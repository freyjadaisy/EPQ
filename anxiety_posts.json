    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, \"Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.\"\n\nBut then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, \"It's okay. Let's take a walk.\"\n\nWe went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.\n\nI always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand.\n",

    "all_comment_text": "That's amazing! Thank you for sharing this!\n\nYou're more than welcome, I'm glad you found it helpful\n\nGreat boss, it scary to be outed as afflicted by anything at work.\n\nThat's the kind of boss we all need.  Glad it ended on a positive note!\n\nI‚Äôm really happy you have that support from your boss! Mine is similarly empathetic and it makes a huge difference!\n\nThank you so much for sharing this. Your story really hit home because it shows the kind of compassion and understanding I wish more people had in the workplace. It‚Äôs inspiring to hear that your boss not only handled the situation gracefully but also took the time to make sure you felt supported. That‚Äôs not something everyone gets to experience, and it makes a huge difference.\n\nFor me, managing anxiety has been a journey, and it's not something I‚Äôve been able to openly share in a work environment. I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for years and often feel the pressure to keep it hidden, especially around others who might not understand what I‚Äôm going through. There have been times I wanted to express what I was dealing with but held back, afraid that it might be seen as weakness or even hurt my work relationships. Not everyone realizes how much courage it takes to even show up to work when you're battling anxiety beneath the surface.\n\nReading stories like yours gives me hope that one day more workplaces will create environments where employees can be open about their mental health without feeling judged. Your boss's kindness proves that there are people out there who genuinely understand and want to help, which is something I‚Äôve longed for myself. I think we all deserve to work in places where our mental well-being is supported, not sidelined.\n\nThank you again for sharing this experience and reminding me‚Äîand all of us‚Äîthat empathy does exist in the workplace. It‚Äôs a reminder to keep advocating for ourselves and to believe that one day, workplaces everywhere will start to see the value in creating a safe space for everyone. I‚Äôm genuinely happy you had this experience, and I hope it helps inspire more of us to speak up or seek out environments that embrace mental health.\n\nTell your boss that a stranger on internet thinks she's cool and deserves all the happiness in the world.\n\nIt's difficult to manage anxiety as is, and work makes the pressure go up. A good boss does exactly what yours did and I'm glad you felt better after their actions. \n\n\nTake care of yourself, go on a walk, do your favorite stuff and remember that you're in control of yourself, not your anxiety! ( Saying this as I struggle heavily myself )\n\nYour boss is a human.\n\nHaving a good boss that understands the human side of business is so nice. I miss my first boss so much cause he genuinely cared for everyone he worked with even though the company didn't. Cherish those people.\n\nA lot of people suffer from some anxieties and can sympathize. I have trouble with situations most others can handle, but can do some things that many struggle with.\n\nThis has just very recently started to happen to me and I‚Äôm in my late 40‚Äôs.  I have a theory about it I want to share and see if others can relate or if it even could help others.  I was always anxious, self conscious, worried etc.  But how my limbic system reacted to it was to fight.  Slam caffeine and nicotine, attack, conquer, go home and drink to calm down.  Rinse and repeat.  Lately, I‚Äôve become physically weaker, it‚Äôs a combination of age and if I am honest ‚Äúcomfort seeking‚Äù mentality.  I think my Limbic system who knows me better than I do understands that deep down if I stood my ground and tried to fight whatever threat is facing me that I would crumble and probably die.  Therefore the ‚Äúflight‚Äù half of the reaction is starting to happen.  \n\nMy plan:  Get stronger. Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  And try to dig down and find the root cause of my insecurity and just deal with it somehow.  I need to convince my Lizard Brain I can still fight and somehow make it less twitchy in the process.\n\nThis is the response I strive to give to my team. I‚Äôm glad you have good support.\n\nI was in the ER once with a really bad panic attack and messaged my supervisor to let her know i wasn‚Äôt coming in and what was happening. She said the same thing happened to her when she was around my age. It happens to way more people then you think, and by speaking up about it it helps others feel less alone.\n\nThat‚Äôs a great leader &amp; a good boss!\n\nGosh, this give me hope. What a great gesture. You‚Äôre lucky to have such an empathetic boss.\n\nThis is beautiful. It‚Äôs wonderful to hear how gentle and understanding she was. She understands that you‚Äôre a human, and that you are allowed to feel.\n\nI am so glad you had this positive experience OP! Your boss sounds amazing üëèüèª I wish all of them were that way.\n\nI used to hide my anxiety and it made it so much worse. After I told my coworkers how I was feeling, they were so supportive and kind. Many of them had mental health struggles too, and it was so refreshing to be open and honest about it.\n\nI started at new position two weeks ago. Same building, different team and managers. I was open from the start that I have ADHD, but I work on it, I'm on meds and I use my ADHD as a superpower, not weakness. That's not an excuse but more as an explanation, so noone is surprised if I need more time learning sth new. I was understanded and supported over that. I have two managers and they both said - yeah, I probably have that too but haven't got a proper diagnosis yet. And when I fucked up it was a talk about where I made mistake and how to better myself and to always ask for help if I'm stuck.\n\nVery understanding boss god bless\n\nWhat helped me a lot when I knew that I was going to a very stressful situation, like a presentation, was to take 20 mg of Propranolol.  It just controls how the body reacts to anxiety like fast heartbeat, sweating, etc.  I don't take it everyday, just in these situations.\n\nWow thats such a blessing to have a superior like that. I had a panic attack and my job was ready to fire me because I was too much of a \"risk\". And I work from home.\n\nI got demoted for it.\n\nLifting pipe with a big bridge crane and had a panic attack and someone took over then i became a parts cleaner.\n\nNote I was doing this job well for many months before this experience...\n\nI think the reason you were demoted is because it‚Äôs actually hazardous you‚Äôre operating a big machinery it can be deadly for you or others involved. It sucks that you were demoted but they did it for safety reasons.\n\nI don't have physical panic attacks,it's all internal or mental they didn't know,I was just kinda frozen for alittle bit,and after that I went back to work. Maybe 15mins later.\n\nThen they most likely interpreted it as you couldn‚Äôt handle to job after all despite having a solid history. If it‚Äôs possible try to reapply for that position? Maybe even with another company if possible? Don‚Äôt let it bother you so much that industry is very brutal supervisors want things done quickly so you staying still for 15 minutes to them was a waste of time.\n\nThere is only one controller per bridge crane so I had my little internal freak out one guy that had a in with the higher ups took the controller and used it for about 10 or 15mins to get it done after that I went back as usual until the next day then I became a parts cleaner. (Horrible job btw)\n\nThis was a few years ago and I'm off to bigger and better things.\n\nIt really wasn't a big deal,I was never unsafe with the crane I did a fine job just froze alittle with my axinety attack, in fact by this point I have been working there for around 4/5 mouths.\n\nThe job title was called ( coordinator) moved parts to the fitters then to the welders looked at blueprints to determine the parts needed next and load parts for alike jobs on a semi trailer.\n\nKudos to your boss! üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª\n\nLove that!! It‚Äôs great when you have a workplace that will support and discipline you ! My boss lets me lay on his floor when I‚Äôm having an attack and then he‚Äôll put a video on his computer for us to watch and he‚Äôll just talk to me about random shit to take my mind off it!\n\nThank you so much for sharing your experience.  I had the blessing of an empathic and kind boss twice before and they are amazing to have.  I'm glad you have this person as your boss!\n\nGreat. I would like to work in a company like that. She deserves appreciation for her understanding of mental health needs.\n\nYour boss is a perfect example of how people in leadership positions supposed to be. Kind boss = kind team\n\nThis is so awesome and so validating .\n\nI love this!\n\nThat‚Äôs so sweet. Wow. Theres still people out there in the world\n\nThat's so much better than most of the stories you read and hear. It ALMOST gives a bit of faith in humanity.\n\nIt's a health issue, and having a boss like that is awesome.  She was understanding and empathetic.  I like her.\n\nFor me it depends on the boss. \nBecause my old boss had 0 compassion or empathy honestly. \nI remember when they let me go I was having a bad panic attack obviously and they are like \"do ya want water or something\" \n\n:|\n\nYour boss is incredible. Definitely let her know how much it meant to you!\n\nThanks for sharing this.\n\nHope you are doing better.\n\nOh, man oh man oh man ooooo man. If I had a nickel for every time I had a panic attack at work, I‚Äôd be a rich man. Had to be brought to the hospital TWICE because of this. \n\nActually woke up this morning feeling a little uneasy. It‚Äôs more of an uphill battle that I have to fight off every day. I‚Äôve even had to lock myself in the men‚Äôs room with my meditation music on in the background.\n\nThat is a great story! \n\nI kept waiting for the OP to say \"She told me to take the rest of the day off, gave me a Valium, and....\" That would have made her boss of the year! Just kidding. \n\nThanks for sharing this story!\n\nY know, not discouraging or giving off negative vibes but\n\nThese kinds of people, don't appear much in the world nowadays.\n\n\nCheers to people out there with anxiety, you will find a way out. Stop saying things like i won't heal or shit's gonna keep happening for the rest of my life\n\nYeah I don‚Äôt think that works if you‚Äôre a man. They just basically tell me that if it happens again, I‚Äôm getting written up\n\nThis made me smile. I wish I had a boss like that and I hope I‚Äôll find someone as nice and empathetic as her for my new workplace üôèüèªü§ó\n\nYour boss is AMAZING! One thing I learned in social situations - I would tell people that I have social anxiety and I'm trying to work through it. I would ask for their patience. As it turned out, most people were very understanding and wanted to help. The people that didn't, in my opinion, were not worth talking to.\n\nGoing through a rough day, and it bought a smile on my face ‚ù§Ô∏èkind people do exist\n\nOmg your boss is a hero ! Great boss!\n\nGreat boss and do take care of yourself though.\n\nAwe my manager did this with me yesterday, I broke down and she took me aside and opened up to me as well and it made me feel safe and listened to and I was able to do my whole 8 hour shift after\n\nThat sounds really tough, but I‚Äôm so glad your boss handled it so well.\n\nYour Boss is a kind understanding soul. I wish all bosses were like this. I had an amazing boss once. I loved working for her\n\nI was having one at work once and it was so bad I was super dizzy and had to have my husband come pick me up. My boss came outside and stood with me and we talked about how hard it is since both our moms had died recently, he stayed until my husband got there\n\nI worked for a place called movie tavern. I was a cook. I had a major anxiety attack one day. They just left me to hyperventilate balled up in the corner of the kitchen by the walk in, for 4 hrs.\n\nThank you\n\nI LOVE your boss for that\n\nI get I'm catching anxiety attacks everyday cannot get a handle on it been trying hard to stay out my head but it's hard not even getting a good solid sleep. Only sleeping about 3 hours a night and that's with medication. I just jump in and out of sleep. Don't know what to do. Need answers.\n\nMate you won the lottery of bosses\n\nSome company stole your post and modified it to promote their services.¬†\n\nThe Ahead App.¬†\n\nI would have been diff√©rent if you were a man‚Ä¶.we don‚Äôt have that kind of understanding When we suffer"

    "all_comment_text": "I decided early on in life that I didn‚Äôt want children. One of the many reasons is that I would probably have health anxiety on top of everything else, and also later on have anxiety about my children‚Äôs safety. \n\nAnd this is if I survive the pregnancy, childbirth and survive PTSD from childbirth.\n\nexactly.Nothing about the process seems fun to me.\n\nI understand it is a very personal decision to make, I do think though that not everything worth having or experiencing has to be enjoyable. I realize pregnancy as a whole is a traumatic experience for the body, but hundreds of thousands of years of procreation and evolution have built bodies plenty capable of bouncing back from such events. We are stronger than we like to believe.\n\nHaving babies can literally kill you, if somebody doesn‚Äôt want to risk it you shouldn‚Äôt judge or pressure them because of it.\n\nI‚Äôm not pressuring anyone. Anything you do throughout you day could literally kill you. The person I replied to said nothing about the process seems ‚Äúfun‚Äù, I‚Äôm simply offering that not everything has to be ‚Äúfun‚Äù for it to be worth it. Like I said it‚Äôs a personal choice everyone gets to and should be allowed to make. I wasn‚Äôt telling anyone to go make a baby. But this is a sub-reddit about anxiety, and generally about people wanting help with it. If you don‚Äôt want a baby that‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt let your anxiety be the determining factor.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not going to have ‚Äúfun‚Äù raising a child then why would you do it? Why resign yourself to a life of responsibility and possibly destroy your health in the process?  Saying that ‚Äúwe are stronger than we like to believe‚Äù and ‚Äúour bodies evolved to do this‚Äù sounds a lot like pressuring to me. Society keeps telling us to have babies by saying shit like that when really it would most likely be a poor outcome for that child. What child wants to grow up with an anxious overbearing parent that doesn‚Äôt even have fun raising them?\n\nOur bodies *did* evolve to do this exact thing. By definition, all life did. That's not pressuring, it's a statement of scientific fact. If they had used that to justify why you should have kids, that would be pressuring, but they didn't say that. They just acknowledged reality.\n\nI get what you‚Äôre trying to say. \n\nI‚Äôve wanted kids severely for as long as I can remember. I also suffer with debilitating anxiety and depression from time to time. I worry about what it will be like to deal with those issues while pregnant, raising children, etc. That said, to me and my wants and goals, it is worth it. \n\nEveryone is different though. If you don‚Äôt want kids, don‚Äôt have them. That‚Äôs perfectly okay too.\n\nI ended up developing Tokophobia after 3 miscarriages. I have all these fears now that were non existent when I started TTC.\n\nTIL I learned that I have Tokophobia\n\nOn the flipside, I have two kids and crippling anxiety - especially health anxiety - and it is very hard. But in between the hard it‚Äôs beautiful. I am immensely grateful I had children. I just don‚Äôt want them to pick up on my anxieties and develop them because of me, that‚Äôs what I struggle with the most.\n\nThis explains what it's like perfectly. My wife has to keep me in check otherwise I become a helicopter parent. Every time these kids move I think of every possible way they could hurt themselves doing whatever they are doing. However, there isn't much compared to the feeling when your kid randomly says \"I love you, Dad\" or wants to sit next to you and just chill. Makes it all worth it\n\nIn a way, having a baby kind of reduced the anxiety I have about stupid shit. As cliche as it is: it helps put things in perspective\n\nPreach\n\nStories like yours is what has me on the fence. I know I would do everything in my power to make sure my kids don‚Äôt learn my anxious thought patterns. I know a lot of it stems from childhood traumas of mine and would do everything to not repeat those things.\n\nI feel that as someone with anxiety I am the very best person to pick up on, listen to, and help my little one out if they develop any anxiety themselves. I was terrified of having a baby and I do still get panicky about it sometimes but I desperately didn't want to allow my anxiety to dictate the course of my entire life. The thought of being at the end of my life and knowing that I gave up the chance to be a mum over anxiety about things that either never happened, or did but I was able to deal with them, is what swayed me. My little boy pushes me out of my comfort zone daily and that is exhausting but it's forcing me to be brave and showing me what I'm capable of. If the only reason you don't want kids is anxiety, get yourself a therapist that specialises in perinatal mental health and talk it through with them, come up with a battle plan. I can promise you that the little person you get to keep is well worth the effort x\n\nUnfortunately, anxiety is something that‚Äôs better to be up front and honest about then try to hide. I think as a parent, it‚Äôs not just showing the anxieties, but also getting help (therapy and/or meds) and being honest about that with them so that when they struggle with anxiety or whatever else, they follow your pattern of getting help and communicating/not being ashamed.\n\nI totally agree except when it comes to telling them  anxiety you're having about their health. My 5 yr old just had to get his tonsils out and I was super anxious about it for a month but I made sure to never say that in front of him. We talked about what surgery was and how it would hurt a bit afterwards for a few days but he'll get lots of ice pops and medicine and he did amazing! He was all smiles in the hospital leading up to it. He had a rough couple of days when he refused to take pain meds while healing but overall it was so worth it. Had he seen how I was really feeling, he would've freaked out.\n\nI get that, but later in life when he‚Äôs in a situation you can be open about it - hey, remember when you got your tonsils out? I was a wreck! As a parent that‚Äôs how we are right? It‚Äôs normal to feel for our kids safety. It‚Äôs our job. It‚Äôs all about the communication and how we do it.\n\nOh totally! I just didn't want him to be nervous leading up to it like I was. I love your earlier point about being open about therapy and anxiety. I talk to my kids a lot about how a little anxiety is good, like remembering to check before you cross the street keeps you safe. But when it takes over your life, it's time to talk to someone. I have a therapist I talk to once a month, even when things are good because I love her point of view and then if things get too stressful for me, I can just add appointments instead of stressing about finding a good therapist while I'm already stressing.\n\nIt‚Äôs so hard Thoe\n\nI picked up my dad's health anxiety - not my mom's OCD though (yet).\n\nSomething interesting I recently learned is that healthy anxiety is a form of OCD. An expert can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but it does make sense. You get obsessive thoughts around your health, and compulsive behaviors to reassure you that you‚Äôre safe. \nI was diagnosed with GAD but I think that‚Äôs a blanket term, and I might actually have OCD. But then I also get agoraphobia, but it‚Äôs related to needing to use a bathroom without one around or me passing out.\n\nI‚Äôm only just now realising how much health anxiety my dad has so clearly that didn‚Äôt help me haha\n\nIf you don‚Äôt mind me asking, how did you have your kids with your anxiety? I have crippling anxiety and health anxiety (I‚Äôm a woman and pregnancy/child birth scares me). I want a kid! But I‚Äôm so scared‚Ä¶\n\nI always wanted kids. For me, I would have done just about anything to have them. I know that‚Äôs unhelpful but it‚Äôs the truth. I put my fears aside and just went for it. Sending you love.\n\nI want kids but too afraid my anxiety is gonna get in the way. Really sucks.\n\nIm sorry you‚Äôre going through that.  Anxiety is a real asshole\n\nIf it helps I had anxiety before I had kids, still do now that I have kids and I've found there are benefits. The demands of parenting are good for shifting focus from your anxiety onto caring for others. Also the good parts of being a parent really help boost your mood. Sure there is a lot of struggle that comes with being a parent but I don't think my anxiety is any worse now that I have kids but my life is certainly much better. Can't speak for everyone, just wanted to share my personal experience.\n\nI think I want them but not even when my mental health is good do I think I could handle the stress of a child, plus the fear they'll inherit all these disorders. I don't want to give that opportunity to them.\n\nI have two children and terrible anxiety, and honestly, it‚Äôs not that bad. If anything they force me to get out of myself and push myself to do things even when I feel shit. Of course some days I wish I could stay in bed all day and cry instead of getting up to take care of them, but at the end of the day they probably do more to HELP my anxiety than the contrary.\n\nAlso as someone with bad anxiety and two kids I came to agree with everything said here\n\nJust read an article about children being a constant worry until you die. So if it is a very real concern for you then trust in your decision.\n\nyes, come here to say this.  if you don't have crippling anxiety but want to get it, have a bunch of kids!\n\nYep my mom worries about me and my brothers all the time. One brother is deceased and one of the 2 remaining is just ruining his life. It‚Äôs hard. And now you said this I have a new perspective abt being a parent. No matter how good we raise the kids ,there will always be that one or more who will drive you insane. My mom deserves better because she went through a lot and now we are making her go through a lot. It‚Äôs not fair.\n\nOn the flip side, having a kid has given me a new perspective and has made my anxiety a lot more manageable. Instead of always internally worrying about myself, I‚Äôm focused on my kid. I‚Äôm not advocating having a kid to cure your anxiety but, glass half full!\n\nYa you are not alone. I've been wanting to have children so my wife and I have been married back in 2016. Never suffered with health issues and/or anxiety until about 2020. And it's kind of been a downward spiral from there. Wife is 39 and I'm 32. And after getting over financial hardship finally but now I have crippling anxiety and depression. She's ok with having a child but I could barely take care of myself let alone be a father. Even though I want to be one so bad, it would be selfish. But you are def not alone.\n\nUgh this is such a hard decision. Especially considering parenting is the ultimate unknown. Full of what ifs. \n\n\nThere are parents who have children and it changes their life for the better. They're no longer hyperfocused on themselves. And there are parents who have children and feel differently. \nAll this to say, you know yourself best.\n\n\nOne thing that helped me was talking to a therapist to try to tease out what was what. You might already have one but it helped to clarify things.\n\nThank you I appreciate that. Ya a few people told me that maybe having a child will change you handle things. But I know myself. I love children. And I want to be able to have our own. But I know I will just shut down.\n\nI would try.  She's 39, realistically if she doesn't have a child soon she may never.  Does she really want one? It's not selfish to have a child.\n\nThere are many selfish reasons that people have children. People say that having kids is ‚Äúworth it‚Äù to them, but is it worth it to the kid? Many of us have traumatic childhoods, I don‚Äôt think going through that was ‚Äúworth it‚Äù\n\nWell that's the problem. Not only is she 39 but unfortunately has PCOS as well. So it's only going to get worse from here üòë\n\nDo not underestimate the determination and love fatherhood can give you.\nThe things you are saying are partly valid but also based on the person you are now. You can be a toy different man 4 years from now. (As you are now than 4 years ago.) And it could be for the better if you do the work. When you have children with a partner you love and trust and if you have a safe relationship (not counting feelings of anxiety not based on facts) than I'd think you two could become great parents!\nI do think you need some therapy. Fear/anxiety can lay a curtain over your feelings and thoughts.\nBut do it quickly because of your wifes age. (Life is unfair for giving us such a short amount of time and much pressure in this time in out lives.)\n\nI'm taking the time to write this because something in the way you wrote it made me feel you could be great parents. All based on next to no information, I know.\nWhatever you decide to do, make sure you are both on board. Think about freezing eggs is possible/necessary. Have some therapy either way and talk about this subject. And whatever you do then, if you not just letting the clock run out and decide, but both of you are consciously making that choice, that's okay eitherway.\n\nI wish you good luck!\n\nIs it possible to have a child with it not being selfish? I just realized that most people that want to be a parent say \"I want\" when they talk about having a kid.  It's not \"they want\" because they haven't been born yet. I don't want to go down the rabbit hole if there is a such a thing as unselfish altruism. It's a philosophical delimma for sure. I think it's probably best to just not think about it but it does pop into my mind every now and and again. \n\nShoot now I'm in the rabbit hole. I do want to ask you one thing. Do you think it's possible to date or marry someone where you care more about your spouse or fiancee more than yourself?\n\nWell the reason why im saying it would be selfish is because it seems as if my responsibility won't be focused on caring for the child. Because I'm too messed up\n\nI don‚Äôt worry as much about my own anxious feelings in relation to having children, but rather that it would hinder me in providing a stable, happy and relatively care free childhood for them. Or that they may even become anxiety ridden themselves, through learned behaviours or whatever. I‚Äôd rather not have a child than risk them struggling with this their entire life like I have.\n\nAnxiety and no money\n\nJust had a kid and have suffered from anxiety most of my life. My anxiety skyrocketed after having this kid and I kind of regret having him. I love him but this was probably not a good idea for my health\n\nThank you for your honesty. We need perspectives like this too. But do know that postpartum anxiety is common, since your hormones need to get back to baseline. Hope that baseline happens soon for you!\n\nI‚Äôm the dad üò≠\n\nlol aww I‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt like that for you, but I must say, it‚Äôs actually its even refreshing to hear a dads perspective and that they can also relate. I feel like most dads don‚Äôt get it , since women typically deal with the most effects of child rearing and obviously pregnancy/birth.\n\nKids just multiply your anxiety anyways. I tell my kids to not have kids because I already have so much anxiety about their future and day to day life. The anxiety for our children‚Äôs future is only going to get worse. I do NOT recommend it knowing what I know now.\n\n^^\n\nMy wife and I each have out own anxiety conditions and we have decided to not have kids to keep life as manageable as we can. It's unfortunate but for the best for us.\n\nI was on the fence most of my life, neither my wife nor I had strong feelings about it and after some stuff came up that really messed me up I realized that if I can BARELY handle my own / my wife‚Äôs and my pets health stuff, then I could absolutely not handle a child having health issues or similar.  I was honestly glad to come to that realization because at least now I don‚Äôt feel guilty for not having kids too..\n\nThis is exactly how I realized I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle my kids! I love kids and seeing them grow throughout the years is beautiful. However, I get OCD flares often to the point where I can‚Äôt function. I have a cat and when he‚Äôs ill it is soooo stressful for me. I cannot imagine having to care for a child because it would be so hard. \nI get called selfish sometimes, but I stopped taking it personal since it comes from people who already have children.\n\nYeah, I get bothered by the hate sometimes but people who judge choices others make are not people I really care to value the opinions of.\n\nI have a kid and anxiety (specifically health anxiety) and in a way having him around has actually given me a lot of perspective and grounded me. When I‚Äôm feeling anxious, heading over to him and building a tower together or reading a book is super grounding. He‚Äôs just so happy all the time haha. \n\nPregnancy was great also cause they give you regular blood and blood pressure and urine tests to say everything‚Äôs alright\n\nI‚Äôve heard this every so often as well. I really hope it would be the case for me, but I‚Äôm stuck in a fear cycle where I can‚Äôt pull the trigger on it\n\nTotally understandable. \n\nIf it helps put things in perspective, even people who don‚Äôt suffer from anxiety find it hard to bite the bullet and finally have a kid. They wait and wait for the day they feel fully ready but you never really are haha but you do it anyway\n\ni have terrible health anxiety and a history of psychosis, so getting pregnant and being postpartum scares tf out of me. i‚Äôve felt like this since i was a kid but just assumed id grow out of it when im older. i‚Äôm only 19 now and people around me are starting to have kids, but im not any less scared. if anything im more scared bcuz i hear so many terrifying stories of women who do suffer from ppd. so im not too sure if i want kids, and im not too sure my bf is okay w that! so thats what im dealing w lol\n\nI have a baby and the health anxiety about him and myself is next level but it's so worth it because it's a love like no other. I used to worry all the time especially health anxiety pre-baby too.\n\nI wondered how the hell I was going to be dad with crumpling anxiety, surprisingly since the day my daughter was born my anxiety disappeared.\n\nFor what it's worth, having kids actually improved my anxiety in a lot of ways. I had extremely traumatic births and struggled with PPA/PPD. It taught me a major lesson - you have zero control over anything. Dealing with the PTSD of what has happened will never end but I've learned to better live in the moment and not let my anxieties control my everyday life, because I only have so much time with my kids being this little. \n\nI can't control if my kids get sick, or if they have a tantrum in public, or if they choke, or if my parents die, or if my partner or I lose our jobs. Life will literally just go on. I continue to take my medications and go to therapy and try to be my best self. I'll always be anxious but I can't imagine missing out on all of this because of it.\n\nUp until I was about 35, I always figured if I had kids, then I had them, if not, then oh well.  It wasn't until after 35 that I was so grateful that I never had kids.  My anxiety was always on the con side of if I should have kids or not, because my own anxiety was passed down from my mother and I never want anyone else to experience what I went through when I was at my worst.  I'm often amazed that I survived and don't know if I will if it ever gets that bad again.  I think having a kid or multiple kids would definitely have exacerbated my anxiety and I don't think I would have been able to be the mother I think all children deserve.  I still have a family, though.  I'm married and we have 3 dogs and I have nieces and a nephew.  I have my parents, brothers, cousins, aunts and uncles and friends who are more like family.  I'm 42 now, so I'd like to think my baby-making days are behind me and i have yet to regret being childfree.\n\nI thought it might affect me, but it really doesn‚Äôt.  I previously thought that I didnt want to pass this onto my child, but I learned my anxiety likely stems from trauma.  I worry about my daughters safety and her future, but that stems from the desire to want the best for her. I wouldn‚Äôt say my anxiety has worsened with a child (though republicans are trying to take women‚Äôs bodily autonomy away, so I‚Äôm anxious about that for her) but I‚Äôm more cautious and think about the future more to best protect her.  I don‚Äôt have any new or worsened physical symptoms since having her, and it‚Äôs been a truly great and wonderful experience.  Obviously you should try to sort through your problems if you can before having a child, but I‚Äôm sure many of us know that this is a lifelong affliction and it‚Äôs not going away.  You might find that being an anxious person helps you think of ways to protect them more, since we are always worrying about what ifs.  Do what‚Äôs best for you, but don‚Äôt let your anxiety hold you back!\n\nNo offense but are u sure u want to make a kid that maybe has the same fears/anxiety??? You certainly dont wish your condition on a tiny person you gonna love. So I dont get it.\n\nI am also fked in the head and thats why I would never ever produce a kid cuz it might inherit the same anxiety problems. And I dont wish this condition onto my worst enemy and specially not my child.\n\nNow if you really want one, just adopt and make one kids life better, instead of forcing a new life into this world without asking.\n\nI was wondering the same thing. My opinion might be biased since I‚Äôm childfree, but it seems like some people are still selfish enough to bring kids into a messed up world.\n\nreal, idk why anyone in here is saying they want kids because they're also saying they want their kids to inherit their problems. there is plenty of kids that already exist in the world with no parents.\n\nYeah, honestly it‚Äôs just confusing trying to understand their logic\n\nI never wanted kids, now it feels like I have a genuine excuse to be honest because realistically im too anxious.\n\nYes, me too. I think I would be 24/7 worrying about my children if I had them. And that's not a healthy pattern for them neither\n\ni appreciate how you care about the potential future baby. birthing an unwanted child with parents who are not ready to take care of even themselves is a bad idea that will only bring the child suffering\n\nThe child would be very much wanted. I am known as the ‚Äúmother hen‚Äù in my family and everyone tells me I would be an amazing mother. But I just can‚Äôt bring myself to have kids if I can‚Äôt even get a grip on my anxiety. I can‚Äôt even imagine how much worse it would get if I had my ‚Äúwhole heart outside of my body‚Äù like how people describe your love and worry for kids. And pregnancy/birth has so much risks as well.\n\nIt's on the list. \n\nI did a lot of psychology and relationship advice reading, and the amount of resentment and stress just destroys so many marriages. It's a major complaint in many divorces. \n\nI know that I would resent having children. And it would be very bad for my mental health. My gf feels the same way. We would rather have a happy relationship than children.\n\nYeah between my anxiety, depression, and ADHD, I don‚Äôt think I could raise a child. \n\n\nMental illness runs strongly in my family and I wouldn‚Äôt want to bring a child into this world just for them to suffer like I have. They‚Äôd most likely inherit my ADHD\n\nHere I am\n\nYes\n\nyou‚Äôre not alone! anxiety sucks :(\n\nMeee! And I'm not even sad about it, I look at my life and think \"the only thing I'm happy about is that I don't have children\"\n\nFor me when I had my daughter some anxiety sort of went away like there is something bigger , like it‚Äôs no longuer you the most important\n\ni wasn‚Äôt aware that i had anxiety until i had children, so too little too late for me i suppose. it was also exacerbated by some trauma. but my anxiety isn‚Äôt terrible. it‚Äôs a low rumble on a good day and i can feel semi-okay. on a bad day? fuck. i feel so bad that i gave them a mom like myself.\n\nOne thing I‚Äôve heard is that you should know you‚Äôre a good mom for even worrying like that. We are all human and not perfect all the time. The fact that you want to be the best for them says a lot about yourself as a mother. Thank you for sharing your perspective!\n\nIt used to but I can‚Äôt have biological kids of my own anymore. It‚Äôs funny how life makes decisions for you sometimes in a way. Still, sorry to hear it‚Äôs been so awful for you. I hope your anxiety gets better soon üíñ\n\nThank you so much. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that you wanted them but can‚Äôt.\n\nDeciding to NOT have kids, when you are aware that having them would be such a burden for your mental health and how it would harm their own growth, is a wise decision. More people should be this much self-aware. No need to feel shame bc of it, and those who try to convince you that you're \"missing out\" most likely are worried about future where there won't be enough of cheap workers paying as many taxes as today. The rich ones are scared of becoming less wealthy bc of low childbirth.\n\nLexapro\n\nI don't want to pass on these genes. I can't risk another human having to experience the hell I've lived through and continue to. Just gonna let natural selection have its way and let the non anxious beings procreate.\n\nProbably not a bad idea‚Ä¶ raising one child with anxiety is hard\n\nYep. Love kids, work with them so get my maternal instincts out with my job but I'm in no way mentally or physically well enough to have my own full time. I worry about the kids I work with after i finish work so my own would be unbearable and I'd probably feel like a terrible parent.\n\nI have three kids. I had anxiety before, but now I like to say I have anxiety on steroids as I also have CPTSD. \n\nI love my kids. But, knowing what the world is today, and specifically the U.S., if I had to make the decision to have kids, I likely wouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure what country you are in, but this country is MUCH different today than when I started having kids 14 years ago. üò¢\n\nI‚Äôm in the U.S. and agree that things are so much different than when I was a teen and younger. Seems like so much more to be anxious about.\n\nYea :,) I really want to be a mom but I‚Äôm terrified of having kids, the whole process or even having an absent partner making me a single mom in a relationship, not being able to protect them from the world‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm just scared I‚Äôll be a pad parent and I wont be able to give them what they want and need and that makes me so insanely anxious about the whole thing\n\nHi! I have anxiety about that too. The way politics are trying to control women, climate change, economy, and my abusive parents and stepparents are the reasons why I have anxiety regarding having kids. It‚Äôs something my bf and I both discussed. And the sad part is we want kids.\n\nI used to feel that way sometimes but getting it treated and then having children made me stronger\n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to put my children through what I  go through mentally and I kind of hold a small amount of resentment to my own parents for having me tbh\n\nThe entire thing sounds stressful. \nDoctor visits, pain, nausea, labor, the after effects. I sometimes find it hard to believe that my body is technically built to handle it to some degree. \nBut damn like do I have to?! I want a kid but I don‚Äôt want to do all that! makes me start stressing.\n\nAs an anxious overthinker I eventually became an anti natalist. A very short summary of anti natalism: those that do not exist do not suffer, and they wont make me suffer either.\n\nI never thought I would be strong enough to be a father because of my anxiety.\n\nI overcome and transformed my relationship with stress and 18 months ago became a first time father - of TWINS. \n\nThe skills and practices I learnt for my stress and anxiety have made me a present and calm father.\n\nI hate to say it, but YES. I already have two beautiful children, and I thought I was done but for the last 2 years I have really been wanting another. I thought I had my anxiety under control, and then a couple of months ago I began semi-trying with my husband. When my next cycle was approaching I got so worried about the what-if‚Äôs: I‚Äôll be 33 when the baby is born, what if there is something wrong with her/him? What if I develop GD and constantly have to check my blood sugar? What if I can‚Äôt manage a new baby and homeschool my other two?¬†\nI started to have panic attacks. I got a pregnancy test and it was negative, and my panic cleared up. I am still very sad about it but I don‚Äôt think having another baby is in the stars for me.¬†\n\n[removed]\n\nYup! No having kids from my crippling anxiety either. I worry too much about the sex being bad to even have it.\n\nI have anxiety but not that kind so I‚Äôm undecided but leaning more towards wanting kids.\n\nThat‚Äôs just one of the reasons for me. There are lots of others I won‚Äôt get into here, but yeah anxiety about basically all of it is a factor too. \n\nI also have emetophobia (could be argued that‚Äôs a type of anxiety I suppose, so still fits into your question), so the idea of having something that tends to puke a lot (and will also want to likely be crawling all over me during those times because they want comforted) literally gives me a panic attack just thinking about it so‚Ä¶.big nope from me on that front too.\n\nI have zero desire or maternal instincts to even have children, but yes, anxiety is definitely a playing factor in why I do not want children. I would never want to pass my mental illness onto someone else on top of having to worry about another human being 24/7 and make sure they grew up properly, plus I have to worry about who could hurt them.\n\nI'm not having children because I like my quiet time and having money. I don't have a maternal bone in my body so I don't feel I'm missing out on anything, bring on the cats!\n\nYup! I don‚Äôt want postpartum, I would want to be present for my kids, and I don‚Äôt wanna pass this shit on. \n\nI grew up with a mother that had untreated anxiety and depression. It affected her parenting skills and her ability to be present.\n\nI have anxiety about my (nonexistent) kids having anxiety\n\nIt‚Äôs so hard, don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs constant hell  üò≠\n\nYes it's one of the reasons. I don't think I'd be a good mom with my anxiety and chronic fatigue. I would hate to leave everything to my.husband and then just feel bad about it\n\nI was like this my whole life. Wanted kids but was too afraid so I just convinced myself I didn't want them. My partner always knew he wanted kids. I was really nervous when I got pregnant unexpectedly, but 2 kids later, it has been more than worth any of the additional anxiety.\n\nIt‚Äôs a good start to acknowledge your own anxieties that cause you trouble in life before having a family. A lot of people don‚Äôt and think having a family will just sort out all their problems. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. \n\nAlways easier said than done, but try using this time to overcome it. It‚Äôs a journey, and you learn so much about yourself. Hell, I think everyone in this sub is on their own journey and they‚Äôre all difficult in their own ways - but we can and will do it!\n\nI wish you well, and if a family is what you truly desire I am sure you have it within yourself to take the difficult steps to overcoming anxiety. Your future self and your family will be forever grateful x\n\nYes, but it‚Äôs mainly social anxiety. I hate to admit it, but I have never been on a date in my life. While part of it was due to focusing on school and building a career, I was always scared no one would love me. I also have a twin sibling who is actively dating and it makes me feel not worthy. I always joke with my friends and family, ‚ÄúThat requires a guy wanting to put up with me for 18+ years, and I just don‚Äôt see that happening.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm like you. Really bad health anxiety. I just had my first baby and while I worry about her, my anxiety has not taken over and I‚Äôm actually so much more chill with her and her health than I am with my own.\n\nYes I really can‚Äôt imagine how I could be a good mom. It‚Äôs such a struggle already (barely) maintaining my job, myself and taking care of our dogs. Maybe if I didn‚Äôt have to work I would have less stress and could care for children\n\nI‚Äôd worry too much about them, like all the time. I don‚Äôt wanna become an unbearable parent because of my extremely bad anxiety, I‚Äôm already anxious about my dog, so it‚Äôd definitely be worse with a kid üò≠\n\nAnd, the fear of pregnancy. I‚Äôm a trans man, but, I still have yk, parts attached so, I‚Äôd most likely be the one giving birth.. the way my mom described giving birth to me and my siblings? aw nah :(\n\nIt's not my only reason, but it's one of many. I also have health anxiety, and going through my own pregnancy just seems like hell. I know I would be stressed all the time. I know I am never going to have bio children if I can help it, but adoption is still on the table pending my financial and mental security---less of a burden to my body and I still get to have a family.\n\nThis is me 110%. Had my first panic attack in 7th grade and gone downhill since (I‚Äôm 52) \n\nI have so many mental and physical illnesses it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to (1) doom a child to potentially inherit my problems and/or (2) not being able to take proper care of the child because I can‚Äôt take proper care of myself. \n\nI had the best most selfless Mom ever, and I could never do what she did.\nI even feel like I fail as a cat mom even though I have the most loved and spoiled cats ever, because inevitably they get sick and die, and I blame myself, even tho cats have much shorter lifespans than humans.\n\nThe good part is we (husband and I) have had a lot more freedom and disposable income to travel and whatnot. \n\nAnd frankly my estranged sibling had two kids, and she and her husband turned them into evil humans who believe in QAnon and hate everyone who is different (including their own grandfather, my father, who practically raised them, but who is non practicing Jewish). She and her hub and kids are estranged from us all and that has destroyed my father, so having kids isn‚Äôt always a great reward either. It can be a great heartbreak.\nSending everyone here love and peace.\n\nI feel exactly the same. 50 here.\n\nI'm one of those that didn't really know i was experiencing anxiety my entire life until I had kids. Now it's just so much worse because I love my kids so darn much and I can't stop the intrusive thoughts. Getting help now to manage it though. My kids are the most precious things in my life and they love me, it's awesome, so I probably wouldn't change my mind even if I go back in time.\n\nI ended up having kids. I think it affects everyone with anxiety differently. I think I would still have pretty bad anxiety even if I didn't have kids because I always have. \n\nI do worry about my kids a lot though but I think that'd still be the case even if I didn't suffer from anxiety. I have a 21 year old bipolar and carefree son, a 9 year old autistic son and a 3 year old son with a minor health issue. I have health problems and childhood trauma as well. It's a lot. I don't regret my kids at all though and wouldn't have it any other way, despite their issues and my worrying about them. Their love is like no other and we share so many happy times together. I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now and it's really helped a lot. I also see a psychiatrist and get medications for my anxiety. That has helped a ton.\n\nYeah, me pretty much. Also bc I can‚Äôt afford it.\n\nI've never wanted kids anyway. Having my anxiety struggles have only exacerbated that. Anxiety itself has also caused an increase in my temper and lack of patience. It wouldn't lend to me even being a good parent. \n\nEven if I ever did change my mind, I'd sooner adopt. The idea of going through childbirth naturally makes me wanna fucking vomit. It's an anxiety, hypochondriac nightmare. \n\nI'm also a black woman and I'm statistically the most likely to die in childbirth in the U.S. I'm good.\n\nI've always had awful anxiety. I had a kid and worry about everything but I'm having a great time anyway. Having someone else to worry about kind of feels good and gets me out of my head. I do go to therapy every other week to talk about my anxiety and had ppa. I'm more confident in my body for what it survived and the awesome creature it made, and myself for always trying to be a good parent. I've never been so proud of myself. Also having a pediatrician you trust and can call/message is huge. \n\nIn deciding to have a kid I did a lot of meditative thinking visualizing what I wanted the rest of my life to be like and made pro/con lists lol.\n\nIn my 20s, I was too selfish but in my 30s, I just think I'm too damaged and I've never been financially or emotionally stable enough to give a child the things they deserve. I had a vasectomy a few years ago so that ship has sailed. Anyway, my niece turned 1 and had a big party on Sunday and it made me very sad thinking about all the things I missed out on. I was watching these chaotic children and loving every minute of it. There was a girl trying to bite balloons! It was adorable. I'm 38 now and even if I reversed the vasectomy (haha), suddenly got super healthy, and made way more money, I feel like I'm too old to start.\n\nPartially. As long as I can remember, I never wanted kids. Just had no appeal to me. And as I got older, I had more and more reasons to not want them; one of them being my lifelong battle with anxiety and other mental health issues. I honestly do not think I could handle having a child and worrying about them for the rest of my life. I don‚Äôt regret my decision one bit.\n\nI feel like if I got pregnant the whole time I'd be worrying about my body being in so much pain and irreparably damaged (not saying that's for every pregnancy and birth but a lot of people do experience that)\n\nI have always wanted a lot of children. I have a 5 year old and I am also about to be 38. My patience is not what it use to be....add in anxiety and depression....well it's not a good mix. I am thinking of getting my tubes tied but I don't want to do something so permanent and regret it later..... You aren't alone\n\nWhen I was pregnant, I had to be on anti anxiety meds and then switched to Zoloft for my 3rd trimester because they said it was safest for the babies. Without the meds, my body is in such panic, it was a risk if I wasn‚Äôt on them. \n\nI‚Äôve had health anxiety most of my life on top of PTSD and OCD. Effexor has helped so much of my anxiety; it really all depends what works best for you. \n\nWhen my girls were in the newborn phase, I was always worried and panicking (they are my only and firsts so new parent anxiety was definitely kicking in) but as time goes on, a lot of parent anxiety has subsided with confidence in being a parent. Do I still worry? Yes. But with my medication, experience, routine, and confidence. It‚Äôs helped a lot.\n\nHaving children or not having children is a personal choice; and either way you will have a fulfilled life. It all depends on what you want üíó\n\nHaving a kid and crippling anxiety has been an absolutely awful combo. If you know yourself well enough to not do it then that‚Äôs great. I don‚Äôt recommend it.\n\nYes. I honestly don't think I could handle having a kid. I'm anxious in general, and we have a dog with a lot of issues over the past couple years. I worry about our dog constantly. I won't let anyone else watch him because I'm scared they'll do his meds wrong or he'll get out if the yard. I would be 10x worse with a kid. I'd be a helicopter mom for sure and we'd probably both suffer because of it so I'm good.\n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of getting married or having children without my anxiety ruining everything. Every time my family says ‚Äúyou‚Äôll understand one day when you have your own kids‚Äù I tell them that‚Äôs not going to happen \n\nI want to avoid spreading my depression/anxiety to a significant other or children, even if I miss out on all the good that comes from making a family\n\nI'm going to be 50 in a few days, and I've never had kids precisely because I had a crippling phobia of pregnancy and childbirth.  If you could grow kids in tanks like Sea Monkeys, I probably would've had half a dozen by now. I'm pretty happy being child-free, though, and have few regrets about this.\n\nüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Me 1000%. I am terrified of having to go off meds while pregnant and having a mental breakdown. I‚Äôm afraid of how anxious I will be having to be responsible for a human life. I‚Äôm afraid that my child would get my panic disorder and depression. The list goes on and on. I hate it. I don‚Äôt want to miss out on being a parent because of fear and anxiety, but I also don‚Äôt know how to get passed it.\n\nI have decided not to have children for many reasons, but anxiety is also one of these reasons. \n\nI already struggle with my anxiety (health anxiety in particular). I can‚Äôt imagine dealing with someone else‚Äôs anxiety. And in my opinion, bringing someone into this world who might have the same kind of anxiety I have just seems very cruel and selfish.\n\nI love kids, but I couldn't have some of my own that's for sure... :/\n\nAnxiety is only one of the many reasons why I‚Äôm 100% childfree. \n\nI may pass down my anxiety and panic disorders to my kids. Also, I worry so much and I know that with a kid I would worry like crazy and I would be stressed all the time. \n\nBut it‚Äôs not a primary reason for being childfree - I don‚Äôt want to be pregnant or give birth, I don‚Äôt want to give up my hobbies or free time. I have goals like travelling and I enjoy my quiet weekends. \n\nEven if I didn‚Äôt have anxiety or panic disorders, I still wouldn‚Äôt want kids\n\nI‚Äôm the opposite, I have kids now I have crippling anxiety\n\nBut I understand and hope you do better than me to work through it\n\nI had my kids before I knew I had crippling anxiety. I didn't find out what I was feeling wasn't normal until years after they were grown and gone. You *can* do it. My kids turned out great.\n\nThere has been a few studies that showed people with children live longer! Of course there are risks associated with child birth that need to be considered. My health anxiety actually got a bit better after kids due to the fact I have him to worry about and I'm not stuck in my head as much. But it's such a personal decision whatever you decide is right for you is the right answer.\n\nOmggg! Exactly exactly the feeling I have. I think suffering from health anxiety and the anxiety of losing a loved one really scares me to death. And the whole reason why I fear having kids though somewhere I want them.\n\nI wanted kids, almost died, and then abruptly changed my mind.\n\nMy child saved my anxiety honestly. Is it crippling still absolutely but does it push me to do things that make me uncomfortable and push me to get myself out of it because I will not let him suffer absolutely yes.\n\nyep :/ i‚Äôd love to have kids but i think my mental illness would make me a horrible mother\n\nTwo years ago I got a cat and I am so in love with her. Sometimes when I‚Äôm at work or on holiday I‚Äôll get this notion that something terrible has happened to her and I‚Äôll think of all the things it could be. This has convinced me I would probably be one of those awful helicopter parents and I wouldn‚Äôt want to do that to a child. If I‚Äôm like that with a cat imagine what I‚Äôd be like with a human I made???\n\nI know that I would become that 'helicopter' parent and probably end up constantly taking my baby to the ER. My health anxiety also just prevents me from wanting to become pregnant and going through childbirth. I also don't want to raise a kid in home with financially instability. I was very anxious as a kid because my dad losing jobs and my parents arguing about money. I don't want my kid to go through what I did.\n\nI have severe health/death anxiety which has only gotten worse having kids (plus not being in counselling or on medication). My worries now include them and my partner. Mostly around \"what if something happens to me and I leave them behind\" but also, \"what if something happens to them\". My son (12) also has health anxiety now, so that's hard too.\n\nTo add, my children are amazing and hilarious and I'm super thankful for them. But if I could do it all again, I wouldn't have had kids, or at the very least, I would have picked someone better to have kids with.\n\nNo. How about ‚ÄúHave kids AND crippling anxiety!?‚Äù\n\nNo, its because I don't have a pot to piss in and a girl that id want to marry around me and part of that is my fault because I have to fulfill my potential. I hope you get over your anxiety.\n\nThis is literally me. I‚Äôd be fine when they‚Äôre young and with me but once they‚Äôre wanting to be independent and not in my protection I think I‚Äôd lose my mind and health.\n\nLife isn‚Äôt really good‚Ä¶I choose not to extend it to the unborn.\n\nOne of the 5,000 reasons\n\nI would obsess over my children so much I wouldn't be able to get anything done. I would have to be a stay at home husband or else it wouldn't work.\n\nAs long as I can afford surrogates I might have kids üòÇcuz my health anxiety would convince me that getting pregnant is not safe. \nAnother big problem : The baby screaming. I might end up in jail cuz yeeting it out of the window would cross my mind.\nEdit : how is a baby even supposed to come out of my underweight body ? Plus am super super super tight down there so I do think abt it a lot. Am not ruining my body for some baby  I haven‚Äôt even met yet lol.\n\nIt's totally ok to not want kids! My experience was that taking medicine for my severe anxiety helped  and reduced my health anxiety enough that parenting is possible.  I can't explain how much I love my kids and how glad I am that I get to experience being their mom. Anxiety is weird, I'm levelheaded and reasonable when it comes to their health, but still worry too much about my own.\n\nWhat meds do you take, and how was your anxiety during pregnancy?\n\nParenting is a big responsability. It doesn‚Äôt matter of you have anxiety or any other sort of handicap, if you can't power through it, then you shouldn't. Theres always your partner that might complement where you could lack and viceversa. If anyone is not willing to give their 110% to being a parent then don't be, and there's nothing wrong woth it.\n\nProblem with me is I know I would give 110% , just worried what it would do to my mental health. I think about how much I put into work and family , where I‚Äôm a perfectionist and burn myself out. I still power through it but with lots of anxiety and panic\n\nI got married three years ago. A year after the wedding, I started to have panic attacks and super anxiety. Since then, Ive tried several antidepressants with minimal effect. I don‚Äôt want to have kids, because  I couldn‚Äôt cope wit that amount of stress. Nonetheless, my husband really wants them and I feel trapped, because he‚Äôs almost 50. So, I‚Äôm waiting when he‚Äôs going to announce that he wants a divorce.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry to hear that. I hope he comes around\n\nYes. I had a harsh upbringing with abusive parents. I'm always terrified I'm going to fuck kids up like my parents did me. It actually resulted in an irrational fear of children and a general dislike of babies. Most women swoon over a baby, I have 0 interest and find them creepy. I can only guess, but I assume it's from my abuse, like a weird trauma response gone haywire. It's only fueled further by the fact no infant placed in my arms has had a good time, they always shriek or cry like I'm some monster the minute they are passed to me. I automatically give them back, and now I just say no thanks.\n\nSo much of what you do and say impacts children for life. I'm not about the do what my parents did to me, not even on accident.\n\nOmfg if you want anxiety then have kids!  I was fine before children and now I worry about every fucking thing\n\nSorry to hear that ‚òπÔ∏è\n\nI chose not to have children because I knew that it might push me over the edge.  I have a hard enough time coping with life as it is.  My Mother is aging and it‚Äôs so overwhelming because she needs my help with so many things.  I can‚Äôt imagine adding children to the mix.  Also, my husband was fine without having children.  We discussed it beforehand, and he felt that we could make a great life together despite not having children.\n\nI have kids and have health anxiety and panic attacks, kids keep you level and it‚Äôs the best feeling anyone can ever have, it‚Äôs just pure love like you‚Äôve never felt before,\n\nYup I‚Äôd love to have kids but probably won‚Äôt happen for me :(\n\nYes but I‚Äôm putting in the mental work right now to get to a good place so I can have the family I‚Äôve always wanted without fear or worry :)\n\nI'm not having kids for many reasons but one of the big ones is mental health. My entire family has high anxiety to some degree or another whether it's diagnosed or not. At this point it has to be genetic, at least the tendency does. I don't want to pass that on. I also doing want to pass on my disability. If I ever did decide to have kids I would adopt, there are tons of kids already in existence that need homes and I feel I would be better with an older kid anyway. Might even adopt a kid WITH my disability since I'm sure that makes it harder to get adopted especially if the kid is already older. I think i could do some good with like teenagers that need to be boosted into adulthood and set up for success.\n\nI didn‚Äôt have anxiety (to my awareness) until I was 31. I had my daughter at 32. But I had been in therapy for a few years at that point and working on the anxiety actively.\n\nI am still in therapy. My anxiety decreased during pregnancy magically, I don‚Äôt know why as I was terrified of pregnancy prior. Must have been hormonal. But postpartum I have dealt with anxiety and depression, though not particularly worse anxiety than before‚Äîjust a new focus for the anxiety, obviously. \n\nIf you really want it, seek therapy and treatment. Do for yourself what you would do for your own child should they have anxiety.\n\nYep. I am not mentally strong enough for kids\n\nHaving kids really helped with my anxiety actually. Just game me a new perspective and ‚Äútoo busy to worry‚Äù.\n\nYou don't *have* to worry about other people, you know? Obviously especially young kids need a little help, but people can also develop independence quickly if allowed to do so\n\nYes. My anxiety would consume me even with my meds over my children if I were to have them. Also I would not want to bring children into a world like this.\n\nAvoid having children if you have anxiety..it will only get worse !!!\n\nMay I ask if you‚Äôre speaking from experience ?\n\nAs someone with really bad anxiety who has a kid. Don‚Äôt have kids if you have anxiety. This shit sucks. I‚Äôm constantly scared I‚Äôm going to lose her. My fears were there before her, but since she was born, it‚Äôs just gotten so much worse.\n\nNo, I‚Äôm not having kids because I have all the sex appeal of a moldy potato. I wouldn‚Äôt even date me.\n\nYes! I feel the same way.\n\nGuilty\n\nAlthough anxiety itself wasn't the main factor in me deciding to be childfree, it was definitely an important one.  I've always felt worried that if I accidentally had a kid I wouldn't be able to care for them, and so therefore also always felt super anxious about accidentally getting someone pregnant.\n\nThat being said, the anxiety about having a kid was solved pretty easily for me by getting a vasectomy, however, that may not be for everyone if they still might want a kid in the future.\n\nYep. I can barely handle anything being remotely wrong with my dog without going into a spiral. I‚Äôve chosen to not have kids for my own wellbeing and for the wellbeing of those kids. I would be unbearable. That‚Äôs no way for a kid to have to live.\n\nAnother thing is children puke and I have emetephobia\n\nid wanna be rich to have kids bc financial instability is a huge fear of mine and itll just fuck my anxiety and depression up indefinitely\n\nI definitely can relate to this and yet now I have 3 young kids.\n\nSo I am a hypochondriac due to a traumatic surgery when I was 3, I have had a lot of trauma like loss of very close family members within a short period of time and other traumas so I‚Äôm a very anxious person.\n\nNever wanted kids but felt the same as you wondered if I‚Äôd miss out or maybe regret it.\nI had always said if I were to be pregnant it would have to be by accident because I‚Äôd absolutely never go out of my way to get pregnant due to my anxieties.\n\nMy husband and I accidentally got pregnant, I miscarried which was traumatic but the loss of that possibility of having a child did something to me and actually made me really sad. We ended up pregnant again and I actually made it through the pregnant plus birth without having a mental breakdown.\nThe reason why I think is hormones, once I experienced all the hormones that occur due to pregnancy it almost made me instinctually care more about the baby then myself which was so weird since I‚Äôm so hyper sensitive/worried about myself.\nAnd during birth same thing it was like instinct I didn‚Äôt even think or worry about myself.\nThen having an actually baby I was so tired, busy and infatuated with my child that I rarely had time to notice myself.\n\nNow that I have 3 kids the only times I ever experience anxiety is when I‚Äôm not with them and have time to actually be alone in my thoughts / have time for my mind to wonder. That‚Äôs when I notice I‚Äôll start worrying about things like health related anxieties regarding my own health and so on.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure if anyone else has experienced this but I say to my husband my kids saved me from anxiety. I still have it and always will but not even close to what it was before having kids.\nNow I‚Äôm a mom, my kids depend on ME to calm them, make them feel safe and there‚Äôs something very empowering about that.\n\nI just thought I‚Äôd share as encouragement!\n\nI didn‚Äôt do it because of anxiety. Even if i made it past the baby years, then ¬†I would be scared to death every time they left to go to school. Will there be a school shooting? bullying? what if they get cancer? ¬†It‚Äôs cruel and selfish to bring an innocent child into the world and be an anxious parent to them - IMO.¬†\nIt is so much to manage. I grieved it and now i own my decision and don‚Äôt sit around reeling sorry for myself. ¬†Plus I am Aunt of the Year every year to two little people i cherish (and worry about!)¬†\n\nPlease know that you need to change your viewpoint on whether or not you have kids(s). You're seeing this from a perspective of \"what I want\", \"what's best for me\" and \"missing out on starting a family\". Please be aware these are all selfish viewpoints. \n\nYou should frame your view on what your unborn child would want. Does your kid want to be born? How will you help your child if they have a physical or mental disability? If your child is healthy, can you raise them well and later on help them go to college? Are you financially well off and can provide a place of safety and solace for your child throughout their life while you're alive and beyond? \n\nYour child may enjoy their life as a whole but will suffer in the process. Your child will get hurt playing sports, will get bullied (or be the bully), will get sick from time to time, may get in a car accident, may be abusive to you or others, may get depressed, will feel stress over schoolwork, may lose their job, may never get married or raise a family of their own, will get frail and old one day (if they're fortunate to live that long), may have an existential crisis on the meaning of life, and eventually die as we all will someday. \n\nLife is suffering, it's a fact of life. However only your child can determine if their suffering was worth it\n\nI just have anxiety of everything. It‚Äôs affecting my work, my intimate life, my friendships and everything. Any ideas what to do? What might be the cause?\n\nActually yes but I feel a happy sense of relief surrounding it. Kids need someone engagedamg many hours of the day. Most people don‚Äôt do right by their kids in this way and many ways. Most parents are ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell me how to raise my kids‚Äù and never open up a parenting book. I see more yell at their kids instead of redirecting. And a lot of parents zoned into their phones. I‚Äôm not judging them from a critical pov, but rather saying what kids needs. I would rather help my friends and family with their kids than create another family of kids that also needs the ever lacking community support.\n\nDo t forget about how postpartum can affect depression too. Some women won‚Äôt have libido return for two years. I knew a married couple who this happened to the woman, her dumb husband didn‚Äôt understand this, and both of them are very Christian. Especially the woman. He pressured her to do an open marriage because he was insecure that he was no longer attractive to her because of her post partum lack of libido and they opened their marriage while having a less than 1 year old newborn. A lot of men pressure their partner into sex before their body (with a gaping wound) can handle it, which can easily lead to death if an infection occurs. Pretty disgusting if you ask me and completely turns me off to pregnancy and child birth.¬†\n\nNothing can truly prepare you for having kids‚Äînothing. There are three major events in life that will change you: the death of a loved one, getting married, and having children. Of these, having children is the number one reason for living. You will never experience greater happiness! I've been through the worst, and my children gave me purpose and helped me understand the meaning of life. Have kids! And of course, stay away from drugs‚Äîthey will damage both your brain and heart.\nTo put things into perspective, one of my kids stop breathing in two occasions and somehow I brought him back twice by performing CPR at 5days old and 1 month old.\n\nI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a beautiful woman and soul. Don‚Äôt let anything hold you back from starting a family. I wish that I had kids when I was younger I always felt that it was my destiny . Hope everything happens good for you sending love from Florida¬†"

Guys?\n\nRight! :)\n\nI‚Äôm not even single and I sleep with one every night üòÖ\n\nSame üòÇ thankfully my partner thinks it‚Äôs cute!\n\nSame here. Bear helps me relax and eases my anxiety. (Yes, the teddy bear‚Äôs name is Bear. Don‚Äôt judge me.) When I am really stressed or anxious, my SO brings me Bear to help calm me down while I try to do my breathing exercises.\n\nEdit: I‚Äôm in my 40s.\n\nLmao I'm 28 and me and my husband both got our own bird squishmallowd to cuddle at night\n\nI'll be 26 in 2 weeks, and I sleep with a dinosaur. I used to hug an old flat pillow, but this guy is cuter and softer and more comfy. No regrets. He also doesn't have claws or staple remover teeth, unlike my cats. Win win!\n\nFLAT PILLOWS FOR THE WIN. Need my snuggle pillow or I won‚Äôt catch a WINK\n\nI'm 38 and I have 8 (14 inch) squishmallows on my bed, I use them as pillows because I have chronic neck and back pain and they're the only thing that keeps me from waking up with a migraine. When one gets too squished to bounce back in the washer, it gets moved to the side and replaced rather than being thrown out.\n\nI have an extra pillow that is like a decorative one and I cuddle it pretending it it my hubby. Apparently you can manifest like that.\n\nI‚Äôm 36 and I collect Squishmallows (and Pusheen stuff)! They are the best!\n\nI‚Äôm 22 and have about 3 of the small ones‚Ä¶ they are they perfect size to fit inside my elbow and press against my chest/neck when I‚Äôm in bed and it‚Äôs the comfiest I have ever felt!\n\nI‚Äôm 25 I used to cuddle my toys even with guys lol. But I got a dog and his cuddle better than any guy\n\nNothing wrong with that!\n\nHugging a pillow is not materially different and nobody would even bat an eye if you mentioned you sleep like that.\n\nThat‚Äôs actually kind of why I (25) still sleep with a stuff animal. It‚Äôs not really an anxiety or comfort thing to me, but I sleep on my stomach and hold the stuffed animal on whatever side my head is turned to, so it props up my shoulder just the tiniest amount and takes any strain off of my neck (always hear that stomach sleeping is bad for your neck, and I def feel some of the strain when I don‚Äôt do this but I‚Äôve never had a problem when I DO do this). \n\nI use a pillow to do it when I don‚Äôt have a stuffed animal (like traveling), but the pillow is always just a little larger than I‚Äôd prefer. Honestly I even took my stuffed animal with me when I went on spring break with a bunch of friends my senior year of college‚Äîlike shared a bed with other friends and everything so they all would‚Äôve seen it. I have no shame about it, why should I?\n\nI mentioned in the post that I‚Äôm nearly 40, and mine is a stuffed duck from when I was born lol A LOT of it has to do with the fact that my family is now gone, and I‚Äôm alone. I miss them so much, that I CLING to my stuffed duck because that‚Äôs the only thing that reminds me of them, and makes me feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. The looks I get are unbelievable lol and truthfully, I‚Äôd do a double take too. But it helps ME. Therefore, my duck will continue the journey to recovery with me üòÇü§ç\n\nYou are not alone! You have us.\n\nIndeed. üí™üèª\n\nThank you. Honestly, that means a lot. Sending you a big hug. ü§ç\n\n&gt;always hear that stomach sleeping is bad for your neck, and I def feel some of the strain when I don‚Äôt do this but I‚Äôve never had a problem when I DO do this). \n\nI can't sleep on my stomach most the time as I don't get enough oxygen but that maybe the position &amp; your teddy bear probably helps with this. \n\nI personally always sleep on my side\n\nI do the same thing!\n\nI do the exact same thing ü•π\n\nIm 40.\nMy pillow is 2 ears and a tail away from being a cuddly toy to sleep with.\n\nSleep is so important, people only know about this if you tell them and if it helps you sleep, who cares?\nIf my cat was the type to cuddle in, i wouldnt need the pillow - but shes a lap cat, likes her own space.\n\nFor real, I stick a pillow between my legs, one under my head, and one that I hug. Teddy bear is just a different pillow shape\n\nthat‚Äôs what i do!! mostly just cause i haven‚Äôt found a stuff animal ‚Äúshape‚Äù that works for my sleep üòÇüòÇ honestly i gotta find my old pillow pet and throw that in the wash!\n\n40 y/o here and sleep with a bear.\n\nI turn 40 soon!  o/\n\n(&amp; I swap out which friend I'm sleeping with most nights)\n\n40's are great! I definitely felt a lot more free of expectations and don't compare myself to anyone/anything any more. \n\nAlso I'm 49 and still sleep with my many times mended teddy bear I've had since I was a very young kid :)\n\nHow . . . how‚Äôd you have a real bear as a pet? üò≥\n\nSo? I‚Äôm a 30 year old dude currently in bed with my 27 year old wife. A teddy bear is also in here somewhere\n\nlol somewhere sounds so ominous\n\nYup, we both have our stuffed animals from childhood next to us... and a few new ones. Can't sleep without protection!\n\nü•∫ this is adorable\n\nLove it!!!\n\nAt 22, I sleep with my weighted dinosaur, I love her with all my heart. Whenever my boyfriend and I are on FaceTime in bed he‚Äôll say ‚Äúawe, you‚Äôre cuddling with your dinosaur ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚Äù makes me chuckle.\n\nHell, my weighted dinosaur comes with me to therapy and work too! If people ask about it I have them put her on their lap so they can see how relaxing it feels :)\n\nI have some weighted microwave ‚Äúbears‚Äù (it‚Äôs a sloth and sheep), I might see about putting him in my car for comfort üò≠\n\nThe way you said I love her with all my heart is so cute ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nI‚Äôve gotten better sleep since having her so I‚Äôm completely happy ü´∂üèªüò≠\n\nI bet that‚Äôs fantastic. I use a weighted blanket, and now I‚Äôm wishing I had a Dino friend too hehe.\n\nI tried weighted blankets, that thing makes me feeling like someone is holding me down üò≠ so I had to switch to the Dino, I can put it on my chest and get the same effect. Target is where I got mine!\n\nOmg I didn‚Äôt know weighted animals was a thing! Now I have to buy one to sleep with.\n\nI sleep with a squishmallow named Georgia O'Teef because she is a shark and has nice teef\nEdit: I too am 27 for the following month at least\n\nI need to follow her Instagram, please.\n\nI second this motion, she needs an Instagram account like yesterday\n\nThis would be what she would post on insta for sure:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/sfLXmBi\n\n(Photo of her at the beach. Well, the parking lot of the beach because I didn't take my phone further than this lol)\n\nOH MY GOD HER LITTLE TEEF\n\nI KNOW. I just look at her and it makes me feel better\n\nI have 2 stuffed Octopuses üêô I sleep with and my couch is lined with stuffed animals.  For some reason I feel safer I guess. I'm 53.\n\nI have a newish (10 years old) Teddy Bear and a Blanket I've had since I was 13. \n\nI'm 51.\n\nJumping on the train of saying it‚Äôs so totally fine üíõ 30 here, I do it too.\n\nI sleep with a weighted plushie. And I just bought a second one last night. They‚Äôre the big ones too lol. They help! No shame.\n\nDo the weighted ones help you more?\n\nI find it does, yeah\n\nMay I recommend , the Warmies plushes. You microwave them to get them warm and they smell like lavender. The warmth is really comforting during anxiety\n\nI‚Äôm 40 and I‚Äôve had one since my dog died in 2020.\n\nso sorry for your loss üíî\n\nThanks. I miss him everyday.\n\n42 with a purple frosted donut squishmallow üç©\n\nI‚Äôm 26 and I have a snowman plushie I‚Äôve had since i was a baby and I sleep with him ever night. His name is snow bearü•∞\n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nI'm almost 60 and I have stuffed animals.\n\nIt's a comfort\n\n29, been sleeping with my Ducky for over 19 years\n\nIm 27 and sleep with a bunch of pillows and some stuffed animals‚Ä¶AND with the bathroom light on (night lights don‚Äôt do a thing for me)\n\nI keep \"nightlights\" in the hall, bathroom and 1 in my room. Mostly because I'm blind at night and have nearly tripped to death over piles of clothes on the floor, but also because it helps my anxiety to have a little bit of light. \n\nDo what works for you, OP\n\nI‚Äôm clumsy af and can be way too tired to actually put things away so the light DEFINITELY helps with that as well. \n\nMy brother is the total opposite. He needs it to be pitch black and SILENT for him to be able to sleep. \n\nI‚Äôve literally woken up in a cold sweat because someone turned the light and my fan off. \n\nI‚Äôm a MESS when the power goes out.\n\nI‚Äôm 43 and I sleep with a Baphomet plushie.\n\nMe too\n\nI have a stuffed animal I sleep with as well. He is a beaver squishmallow :3\n\nI'm in my mid 30s and while I have my very favorite stuffed animal safely tucked away so my cat doesn't get to it, I have plenty on my bed still including a shark and a bunny that I frequently sleep with.\n\nMy husband is in his 40s and he still uses a pillow to snuggle with when I‚Äôm not in bed.  If sleeping with a teddy helps you sleep then keep doing it\n\nHey, I still have my stuffed dog from when I was born!\n\nme too!! well (well im turning 27 in two months) i sleep with a big white bear my friend gave me and a small lion that an old guidance counselor gave me\n\nMe too\n\nI did until I got a dog and he tore up the teddy bear. Now I cuddle with him üòÇ\n\nI'm 32 and have a stuffed bunny I still sleep with. Or my cats &lt;3 Nothing wrong with that\n\nI have been sleeping with the same stuffed bear for 30 years.\n\n32 and teddy has been with me all the way!\n\n40 year old sleeps with a bear I got when I was 7. Boyfriend‚Äôs aware, no issue üòä\n\nHalf a century here and I have a big brown bear named Buster.  Got him in 1993 before my wife and I were married.  (We were, however, dating at the time.)\n\nI do too! I have several and I‚Äôm 28!\n\nIt‚Äôs fine. ü•∞\n\nAbout to turn 40. I have a stuffed raccoon named Boo.\n\nMy lovely boyfriend got me a big pink bear for valentines day and now I cuddle with it more than i cuddle with my boyfriend and I am 32 lol\n\nIf it helps you get a good night‚Äôs sleep, makes you feel better/more secure, etc., keep doing it!\n\nCutie\n\nI won't judge you.\n\nI‚Äôm 23 sleep with a bear! If I ever have a truly shit day I‚Äôll go full toddler mode and take my teddy to the couch with me for the day\n\nI‚Äôm 41 and sleep with a stuffed animal from time to time\n\nI got 7 and I'm 29. 5/7 are Whinie the pooh characters.\n\nI‚Äôm 41, and I‚Äôm snuggled up to my teddy bear right now. üôÇ\n\nAt least you have something to hold onto\n\nSame\n\n29 and I don‚Äôt always but I can on difficult nights. That said, making my bed every day involves putting the two of them where they belong among my pillows!\n\n20 and have one, he was given to me when i was born :)\n\nsame here!! exact same age as you, but my \"cuddle buddy\" is Appa from Avatar the Last Airbender! my partner deals with it lol. he knows Appa is my cuddle buddy, not him... plus, Appa doesn't get sweaty... my partner &amp; i do when we cuddle ahahah. üòÇ\n\ni cannot sleep without holding him, &amp; i don't even care... if your teddy bear keeps your anxiety \"calmer\", keep doin' you!!!\n\nI do too at 30! And probably will forever. No shame in that at all!\n\nWeighted blankets and a lot of plushies:)\n\nI will always sleep with a stuffed animal, my regular Pusheen is my favorite plush to sleep with. I like a lot of other plushes too!\n\ni have a polar bear teddy named shasta he goes all over the world with me, every road trip, plane ride, cruise etc he comes and he also sleeps with me every night! got him when i was 11 im 23 :P\n\nI sleep with multiple plushies it makes me happier and safe. I'm also 27 so there's no shame. \nr/plushies is full of adults who carry plushies daily or have favorites and even personalities to their plushes.\n\nI'm 32 and sleep with a squishmallow every night lol. I don't see myself stopping in the near future even though I'm a mom now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÖ\n\nI sleep with a nemo plushie that I‚Äôve had for 8 years now. I also keep plushies around my room for when I need to touch, hug, cuddle, or even just for random thoughts I like to share aloud. I am 23 years old. I have had a bed full of plushies since a baby up until 2 years ago when I needed to make space for my bf. Now they hang around my room looking all cute ü•∞\n\nEver since I started sleeping with my build a bear I‚Äôve felt better. It has the perfect huggable mess to it\n\nMy wife is 27 and still sleeps with a Pooh Bear. Whatever floats your boat and makes you feel comfortable / safe.\n\nI sleep with a pillow pet ive had since i was 10. Not as a pillow but as a cuddle buddy. Im also married\n\nI‚Äôm 19 and sleep with my teddy bear that I‚Äôve had since I was 2 years old. I‚Äôll never sleep without him, he‚Äôs my best friend üòå\n\n43 and 38 and the stuffed dog sleeps tucked in between the pillows\n\nI sleep with my baby blanket every single night (and it comes with me to ANY other place I‚Äôm sleeping) and I‚Äôm almost 23\n\nI sleep with a squishmallow and I'm over 30. I'll die in my sleep an oooooold lady snuggling my stuffie. When I would spend nights with my now ex, I'd bring my pillow-pet. Hell, hes the one who bought me the pillow-pet. Haha.\n\nAt age 25 I had a major insomnia and anxiety attack. Didn‚Äôt sleep for 5 days. I thought I was losing it. I went on a sabbatical to the coast and my wife sent me with a Care Bear of all things, because she was worried about me.\n\nI‚Äôm 49 now and to this day when my wife goes on a trip on her own she slips the same Care Bear into her spot in the bed. It‚Äôs okay to be tender and vulnerable and do what you need to to calm down.\n\nI‚Äôm 27 and I can‚Äôt sleep if I don‚Äôt have a stuffy with me ‚ô•Ô∏è no judgement here\n\nI 32f sleep with plush toys (stitch, tramp, and simba) scattered around me,and for some reason the dog understands not to ever chew them ü•∞\n\nI'm 27 and I sleep with a baby blanket since I was a baby myself. My husband also sleeps in the bed with me and it's totally fine.\n\nI'm 42 and sleep with a Beast plushie. It's comforting. I sleep alone because my husband works nights. I need the plushie snuggles.\n\nMy 25 year old self &amp; my build a bear stuffed axolotl checking in\n\nI‚Äôm almost 27 and I have 6 small little plushie bunnies ‚Äî they make my heart melt ü©∑ and I wouldn‚Äôt be with my boyfriend if he didn‚Äôt support me loving them hah!\n\n40 with several Squishmallows specifically to hug when I'm falling asleep or anxious.\n\nI‚Äôm 22 and I sleep with my baby blanket and a few of my plushies! üòÖ\n\nI slept with my baby blanket until I was 32 years old. Nothing wrong if it if it brings you relief.\n\nI sleep with a huge Pikachu and I‚Äôm 31! Nothing wrong with it.\n\nMy teddy (named teddy) has an entire personality and my partner and I speak to him every night. He works the overnight shift making sure monsters don't get us and sleeps during the day üòä nothing wrong with having fun and feeling comforted by a teddy!\n\nI'm 27, my partner is 24 and our bed is full of squishmallows so I wouldn't worry about it at all\n\nI‚Äôm a bit older than you and always have my Pusheen near me, if I‚Äôm not hugging her, she‚Äôs at the top of my pillow ü•π \n  \nNo plans to stop anytime soon either!\n\nI have a blankey\n\nI'm 21 and I cannot sleep without a body pillow. My friends and I bought game character pillows as a joke, but it's unironically the most comfortable pillowcase ever.\n\nI literally kissed the top of my teddy bears head and wrapped him in a blanket before I went to sleep lol. Well not sleep just worrying in my bed at 4 am :))\n\nI‚Äôm 30 and I‚Äôve been married for 8 years. I sleep with a bear every night too. If I have a panic attack my husband brings him to me without me ever asking. No shame! üß∏\n\n21 and sleep with a stuffed dog i‚Äôve had since birth\n\nI‚Äôm 31 and snuggling with the strawberry cow I won from an arcade. No shame\n\nAge is just a number. I‚Äôm 42 &amp; have a killer whale &amp; a shark that I sleep with. It‚Äôs like sleeping with a small pillow. I think more people need stuffed animals in their lives.\n\nI'm 26 and my bed is full of plushies, too! Every night I pick a different one to hug to sleep.\n\nI‚Äôm about to turn 29 and I‚Äôve been sleeping with a stuffed animal since I was 5. I need to hold something close to my chest to fall asleep as I get into a fetal position. It‚Äôs so apart of my life that I don‚Äôt even think much about it.\n\nI sleep with 4 big stuffed sharks at 20\n\n( And i plan to keep doing so for the unforeseeable future :p )\n\n38 and still do.  We all need comfort of some kind.  ü©∑üß∏\n\nI sleep with a stuffed bunny and I‚Äôll be 34 in a month.\n\nI‚Äôm 33, will be 34 next week. I still sleep with stuffies. They have changed over the years but for the past few it has been my weighted cheetah, giant pink squishmellow and smaller squishmellow. Sometimes the squishmellow are pillows, arm rests for reading, cuddle when sleeping, whatever. My weighted cheetah is when I‚Äôm extra anxious before bed, I just slap her on my chest and do deep breaths. Then I‚Äôm usually out. I‚Äôm also single and have my queen bed to myself besides my cats, so I like having ‚Äúsomething‚Äù to put my arm around at night.\n\nI sleep with a 1998 godzilla with a plastic head and arms. Got him right before my brother was born as a gift to make me not feel like the new baby was taking love away from me. Picked it out myself.\n\n48. It‚Äôs a stuffy opossum but hey.\n\nSame but stuffed dolphin lol\n\n27 and i have about 20 squishmallows on my bed\n\nI sleep with my newborn blanket handknit by the nurses who helped deliver me at the hospital.\n\n39 years old and have a plethora of stuffed animals/squishmallows. Not all are on the bed, but when it's lonely at night, it's nice to have something. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI'm 23 and I often hug a stuffed dog or a pillow. It's comforting to hold something close to you while you fall asleep\n\nI have a squishmallow koala and Snorlax. I use a squishy pig as a pillow which is softer than my actual pillow. I no longer sleep with my stuffed cat I got in 1999 because I don't want my dog chewing on it. But I love my stuffed animals and I'm 32. Don't be upset or feel ashamed for enjoying a teddy! It makes you happy!\n\nMy boyfriend and I are temporarily long distance. He bought me a teddy bear and I hug it all the time when I'm in bed. Actually I'm currently hugging it as I'm typing this!\n\nI‚Äôm 34 with three children and a husband. Snoozie bear still sleeps with me every night\n\nStuffed animals help a ton and if anyone gives someone shit for it I'll fight them. I'm 20 and im never gonna stop sleeping and playing with my little guys they make me very happy. I always depended on them as a kid, and when my step mom got rid of them while I was in school it made life rough. I started getting my own stuffed animals at 17 and got to experience what I lost as a kid. Made existing a little easier. If it makes you happy then that's what matters.\n\nNothing wrong with that. They actually make anxiety pillows for all ages. I had one at age 28 and named it Squiggles.\n\nI am 27 myself and I too sleep with a sort of squishmellow, it's a little piggy called Vincent and it's such a comfort. Life is already tricky as is, don't complicate it even more by judging yourself for something that makes you feel good :)\n\nI have had my bear bear since the day I was born and still sleep with her and hold her when I‚Äôm really anxious! She‚Äôs great so absolutely nothing wrong with that! I‚Äôm 21 ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n27 guy and I have a plushie net hung up in the corner of my ceiling holding my collection\n\nKinda cute ngl\n\nThat‚Äôs okay. Nothing wrong with that at all.\n\nI dont sleep. üòñ\n\nthis is a green flag!\n\n31, do not sleep with a teddy bear but I think I will start up again :')\n\n36, and stuffed animals for me. Special ones. Lol\n\nNot the strangest thing you could cuddle with XD\n\nHonestly your not alone\n\nI want a weighted blanket. My anxiety so physical, I enjoy when my young child lays on my chest. I need a weighted blanket haha\n\nMe too, I‚Äôm 36\n\nBig deal. I slept with a monster at 27. You‚Äôre better off.\n\nNo worries - Still gotta sleep with mine at 38! üòé\n\nNice to know I'm not the only one\n\nLook into the bearaby weighted pillows! You might enjoy them.\n\nAnd you slay with that. I snuggle my blanket cuz its comfy and makes me feel safe.\n\n21. Same here, even though I share a bed with my partner.\n\nNothing wrong with that I imagine them coming to life during the night fighting off your fears like doom slayer ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\ni have a blankey lmao and it was allegedly so fluffy when i first got it at 1 but all i remember is the way it is now cause ive had it so long and im 22\n\nI hold a pillow in my arms. I'm 33.\n\nThat‚Äôs all good they are comforting that is they‚Äôre point‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI‚Äôm going to be 59 this summer. I still hug my pillows. Being a side sleeper it works.\n\nNothings wrong with this\n\nNothing wrong with that coming from a 19 y/o dude. Do whatever makes you deal with your anxiety better. And who gives a shit what other people think nowadays just do whatever helps best with your anxiety ü§ç\n\nUsed to be my ex wife, now I just sleep with a body pillow. I prefer body pillow so much more, same squishy, no anxiety\n\nI still get scared to sleep in the dark\n\nI sleep with a night light at 24. I‚Äôm uncomfortable in complete darkness. And I like being able to see where I‚Äôm going when I have to use the bathroom\n\nI sleep with one and I‚Äôm 34. It‚Äôs great for side sleeping!\n\nI'm almost 31 and same! And I'm married!\n\nI have electric candles, and two (very bright) nightlights. Sometimes if I wake up in the middle of the night I turn my Philips Hue lights on to their dimmest setting and sleep that way. I‚Äôm 43.\n\nMy wife gave me a stuffed lion at 37, I sleep better now.\n\nThis is so cute ü•∫ü•∫ keep on sleeping with the teddy üëç\n\nI'm almost 38 :)\n\nNothing wrong at all about this.\n\namen\n\nNever grow up.\n\nI'm 44 and I suck my thumb at bed time.\n\nI got a weighted therapy blanked. feels like beeing lovingly hugged to sleep.\nwhatever helps man.\n\nI‚Äôm 23 and my bed is filled with stuffed animals. nothing wrong with having stuff that makes you happy and keeps you safe!!!\n\nIm 26 and i sleep with 2 stuffed toys: Cindy and Louie ü•∞ü•∞\n\nNothing wrong with that. \n\nI myself keep avocado shaped stuffed pillow. Who cares what I take to bed with me? And even if they did, it‚Äôs their problem! \nYou do you! :)\n\nMe too, my sleep companion is a polar bear plushie and I‚Äôm 43. Do what is the best for you.\n\nI still sleep with the same frog stuffed animal my grandma got me when I was little and I‚Äôm 22\n\nI have a ton of bought-as-an-adult stuffies at 36. My bed partner is a Squishmallow."

No music, books, hobbies, tv when I get really bad\n\nOh no. This has pretty much become my baseline\n\nI was about to say üòÖüòÖüòÖ I been doing this for years\n\nNo music books hobbies for me either the only thing I do is TV show shows that I‚Äôve seen over and over.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI SEEM TO HAVE ZERO APPETITIE ALL THE TIME NOW MYSELF, I CAN EAT BUT I DONT WANT TO, AND THE ANXIETY IS JUST OFF THE CHARTS. I NOTICE I DONT READ AS MUCH WHEN ITS BAD.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI‚Äôm glad you pointed this out because I recently have noticed the same thing about myself. If I go more than a week or so without listening to any music, I know something is wrong.\n\nTotally agree. I grew up listening to rock music with my dad, but I loved every genre of music. But since my anxiety/ptsd, it doesn‚Äôt matter what song I play, I just cry.\n\nI am the same way with playing my own music as well. If I‚Äôm playing guitar on a consistent basis (a few times a day for about 30 mins) things are good. When I haven‚Äôt picked it up in 3 days, 2 weeks, one month even, that‚Äôs when you know it‚Äôs not good up in the brian\n\nYes I definitely notice this for me too. And if I do listen to music it‚Äôs classical.\n\nYes! And then I catch the songs I am connecting too and go \"oh no\"\n\nSame here. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion it is because of too much stimuli at that moment. I have GAD and ADHD so im sensitive for all kind of nervous system stimulus, even though I also need and enjoy it very much üòÆ‚Äçüí®\n\nEver since my mom died I rarely listen to music anymore. And I used to have it playing every day while I cooked and cleaned. It's only when I'm in a good mood and half drunk I'll put it on.\n\nSame since my mom died suddenly in 2019. Used to be extremely into and knowledgeable about music. Can‚Äôt listen to it since losing her. I know it indicates something much deeper.\n\nI am sitting in the pain with you, fellow griever. Sending a virtual hug.\n\nSending one back your way. The pain truly never fully goes away unfortunately.\n\nI‚Äôve never thought about it like this, but I think this absolutely applies to me too. I feel like I need Spotify to send me a notification if I haven‚Äôt listened in 3 days!\n\nOmg I recognise this as well. So true, if I am not vibing to music then something is def wrong w me\n\nEither that or only listening to the same few songs, excessively. To the point where just looking at other song titles, even of songs I normally like, is too much.\n\n[removed]\n\nFor me, it‚Äôs under sleeping. Everything else, same here!\n\nThis. So much this. \n\nI catch myself staring stone faced at people talking to me, and then when i realize they're saying something funny, i smile or grin immediately making it seem fake. I try so hard to be present, but my mind is always somewhere else\n\nYep I‚Äôll oversleep because for once I‚Äôm actually happy but it‚Äôs in my dreams üíÄ\n\nMe at my best\n\nMy baseline\n\nNot desiring to eat, no interest in surroundings, feeling tired all the time, avoiding friends and family.\n\n[removed]\n\nMonths, for me\n\nFACTS, if i am putting off doing my dishes and they pile up, lol\n\nYeah I usually force myself to wash them only when they start speaking\n\nFor me it‚Äôs the polar opposite. Lol\n\nHard to get ahold of through text/calls, no interest in reaching out or texting/calling back for prolonged periods of time\n\nYes!!! Me!!!\n\nMe too! I have like 4 messages from friends sitting there in my notifs from days ago and I just can't muster the energy to message them back... but I can scroll reddit for 2 hrs straight easily lol.\n\nYeahhh, your post made me realize that I‚Äôm doing the same thing. I have to force myself to engage with my friends who I love. wtf is wrong with us‚Ä¶.\n\nThis thread gave me a mental kick in the arse to message them all back last night. I have no f'ing idea why we are like this lol.\n\nThe past few weeks I was not interested in reaching out or reverting any texts/calls, even my best friend‚Äôs. It‚Äôd piss me every time I‚Äôd get a call/text no matter who it was from.\n\nThis is me when my anxiety is good.\n\n[removed]\n\nHey! This is me. You can add in lack of money too.\n\nLingering in bed...like most of the day.\n\nOr like me, last week 4 days straight in bed. My body aches everywhere.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMy hips too. It‚Äôs ridiculous, I need to snap out of this rut I‚Äôm in.\n\nDoing this rn\n\nPersonal hygiene, for example brushing my teeth becomes unimportant or really hard mentally to do, now I know about it I catch it and the thoughts and force myself to do it!\n\n100%\n\nBeing filled with hatred and mood swings\n\nFor me: getting angry easily, feeling lost, numb, not socializing, no desire to do any tasks or errands, always feeling tired but can't sleep.\n\nSnapping at people randomly not having motivation to read\n\nI cancel plans a lot... and then I spiral about canceling so often and thinking my friends hate me for it.\n\nI just bailed on my cousins wedding‚Ä¶ I had a massive panic attack about it, yelled at my mom for pressuring me to go (it‚Äôs a 10 hour drive with events all weekend and no breaks from anyone‚Ä¶ a literal nightmare for me) and it‚Äôs all over now but I felt guilty about it all weekend. Not to mention that i can‚Äôt afford to take time off work, but I got the time off so even though I was home I wasn‚Äôt scheduled and no one wants to give up their shifts this time of year lol\n\nCan‚Äôt sleep but feeling wired with anxious energy and ruminating fearful thoughts with worry that something bad is about to happen or im in trouble. Snappy. Not doing chores and staying in bed. Feeling scared. Isolating myself and not talking\n\nHello twin.\n\nHow clean or dirty my house is. It correlates very closely to my mental health\n\nSame here! And I find it goes both ways‚Ä¶ if I‚Äôm feeling crappy, my house will be messier. But also, a messy chaotic house triggers my anxiety and makes me feel crappy.\n\nVicious fucking cycle isn‚Äôt it?  My depression causes problems and my problems reinforce my depression.\n\nI feel this one!\n\nYep, this is me. Also there's two big piles of clothes, random paperwork and mail in the middle of my living room floor right now...I guess that's a pretty good indicator of how things have been going lately.\n\nThis is more depression related, but I know it‚Äôs getting bad when I obsessively have to budget and conserve my energy over the tiniest most mundane tasks. When I have to keep putting off a small task that would take like 10 minutes at most because the idea of even having to move my body any more is completely unbearable. E.g, ‚ÄúI just took a shower which exhausted all my focus ability and energy, and now I won‚Äôt be able to feed myself. Guess I‚Äôll just go lay down with wet hair and starve because that‚Äôs easier and requires less movement‚Äù.\n\nThis gets extra difficult when you have a partner who you love dearly but basically can‚Äôt show up for on your bad days, because keeping yourself alive is already eating up ALL your precious focus and energy. You then have no more to spend on them beyond maybe short conversations. ü´†\n\nFor anxiety, it‚Äôs getting bad when my brain feeds me some wild-ass OCD image about how doing something mundane like washing the dishes or walking down my hallway in socks could potentially kill or injure me. Fun!!!!!\n\nWow that resonates with me so much\n\nMy escape from everything whenever it gets heavy is going out. I know it's getting bad when going out no longer works\n\nthe appetite one is big. Feeling nauseous after every bite\n\nJust constant nausea for me, if I eat, nauseous, if I don‚Äôt, nauseous. Have to force myself to eat anything\n\nI have the opposite problem. I just binge eat junk food\n\nfor me depression makes me binge and anxiety makes me lose my appetite because food isnt even on my mind\n\nI do keep having an appetite, yet I can't eat due to feeling nauseaus after two or three bites. Makes it extra frustrating for me bc I put in the effort of cooking and then throw it away ü•≤\n\nYeah this. People tell me they overeat when they‚Äôre stressed and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat the fuck is a nervous eater, how do you consume *anything* when stressed let alone overeat???‚Äù\n\nI work with kids and I pride myself on patience with them. \n\nI know I'm off on days where I'm just a little snipper than usual.\n\nApathy. Not caring about anything at all be it chores, people, hobbies, etc.\n\nI know I‚Äôm bad off when I stop taking care of myself. Stop leaving the house. Zoning out.\n\nCrying/being on the verge of crying\n\nYeah emotional regulation out the window. Sucks bc o don‚Äôt always notice it immediately\n\nThis thread is calling me the fuck out\n\nI can‚Äôt bring myself to clean my house so it turns into a pig sty\n\nFor me, my appearance. I generally don‚Äôt wear much makeup for skin health. However, when I am struggling, you can really see it in my face and hair. I tend to be disheveled as fuck in hard times, just trying to keep on.\n\nFor me it's dreaming so intensely that I either wake up or remember the dream in the morning. It only happens to me before or during a very bad mental phase and it's always nightmares full of fear and loss.\n\nAlso, due to that (and generally): Sleeping but getting increasingly tired nonetheless. It's like no amount of sleep in this world could actually have my brain rest properly.\n\n‚Äúi‚Äôm fine‚Äù\n\nNothing sounds good. Everything pisses you off\n\nI get super fatigued and tense and start getting super dizzy. Feeling over the edge or ready to run as if someone is chasing me. I sometimes don't perceive it at first until it has built up, and I'm edgy and dizzy.\n\nI pick at my face when I'm anxious. Plucking beard hairs. If my beard is patchy and full of holes, I'm having a bad time.\n\nwhen i literally can‚Äôt force myself out of bed even if i wanted to\n\nLethargy, procrastination, TV &amp; YouTube, not eating at all, house is a mess, can't leave the house, depression.\n\n1. Having anxiety and depression for so long to the point you start to believe that this is normal and everyone else feels the same way only recently (have I found out that feeling like this isn‚Äôt normalüò±üò±)\n\n2. doom scrolling through social media at 5 am because you cant fall asleep even though you are fucking exhausted.\n\n3. Hating and dreading every past, current, and future moment. \nIdek anymore I‚Äôm just rambling anything to pass the time I guess ü•π Loneliness is a killer\n\nOverthinking, not sleeping or eating.\n\nFor me, not showering. \nI don‚Äôt know what it is, all I can think about is that I love to do it so much that I don‚Äôt want to ruin it with my mood.\nOnce my gf realizes my towel is on the same place for 2 straight days, she knows something is wrong.\n\nThe more time I lose the more I know I‚Äôm not doing okay.\n\nFeeling zero joy when doing activities that typically make you happy. It's like you're living life on autopilot.\n\nScalp picking\n\nAvoiding hanging out and not reaching out to beloved ones and friends for months at once.\n\nImpulsive urges to break things/hurt myself all the time\n\nNo appetite, no interest in even thinking about my favorite activities, doom scrolling all day, not getting out of bed, poor sleep, wanting to pull away from friends\n\nWhen I have trouble leaving my house and when its physically difficult to eat anything.\n\nNausea, impulsivity, and crying over little things\n\nPosting too much on social media. Spending too much time on social media. The internet in general, particularly the last 5-10 years.\n\nNot being able to concentrate, crying having to do anything (go to work, grocery shopping, doing laundry, showering etc), self harming, no interest in anything anymore (not talking to friends, going places, ignoring every responsibility), worrying about anything bad happening to my family.\n\nSpiraling into bad habits. I'll spend hours on YouTube &amp; Reddit to fill myself with fast media &amp; procrastinate on my tasks.\n\nFor me, everything seems like too much work. Even things I love to do sound exhausting.\n\nThis might be a weird one, but constant deja-vus. Often accompanied by a feeling of stomach-dropping. I get them even multiple times a day when I'm in a really bad place.\n\nBinge eating\n\nAll these symptoms you guys mention here is like my everyday life for years üò≠üò≠üò≠ maybe minus \"not listening to music\"\n\nSelf doubt and worry.\n\nI don‚Äôt answer to peoples text because ‚ÄùI‚Äôm too exhausted‚Äù \n\nthen sometimes I end up not answering them for weeks\n\nMy heart starts beating incredibly fast\n\nNot eating, losing weight, being wired but tired, racing thoughts, stressing about everything. Not responding to texts\n\nSelf destructive behaviors. Getting angry at loved ones.\n\nWhen i notice i havent taken any pictures recently i know its been bad\n\nLiterally having the thought ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel good.‚Äù\n\nOversleeping or not sleeping enough. Basically tired no matter what\n\nNeeding to know more and researching random useless stuff that creates more anxiety. For example, ‚ÄúI wonder if I can get fired for not emailing back‚Äù turns into a deep internet rabbit hole of workplace laws and reading Reddit posts.\n\nfor me the first signs my mental health is going in the pooper is that I barely sleep, or sleep all day, everything starts to get too overwhelming (noises, activities, eating) constant headaches and nausea, and absolutely no appetite ever.\n\nI start having difficulties leaving the house and it becomes a vicious cycle where I end up feeling completely stuck inside a prison created by my own mind because of shame and anxiety (the consequence of years of emotional abuse). It‚Äôs horrible and breaking out of this cycle is extremely hard the longer it lasts the thought of leaving the house gives me massive anxiety\n\nHaving no motivation to do anything\n\nIf we‚Äôre talking small signs, then it‚Äôs definitely stepping out of your routine esp. if you‚Äôre pretty strict with it. For me, it‚Äôs things like not really working out anymore, not doing chores or at least leaving them for days, not doing small stuff that usually makes me happy like putting on makeup etc or painting my nails. It‚Äôs like a ‚Äògreyscale‚Äô version of yourself. You‚Äôre still there but not really.\n\nI can't concentrate on anything.\n\nStaring into the abyss of aloneness (not loneliness) especially on the comedown of a relapse (I‚Äôm in recovery)\n\nEating less than usual. This is a new one that I hope goes away.\n\nwithdrawing\n\nFor me, personally, I'll stop caring about how I look, go without washing my hair/body, stay in bed, not get my book done, and if I have to get out of bed, you may catch me staring at the pain killers on the counter\n\nwhen i stop eating due to health anxiety\n\nScreaming\n\nfucked up sleep schedule. went through a cycle of staying up till 4-7 am, sleeping til the after noon, possibly napping around 5. rinse and repeat\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù\n\nHaving bangs\n\nSudden and Steep decline in personal hygiene\n\nUnder sleeping and feeling of intense exhaustion. No appetite. Zoning out and being distant. Having a horrible time with socialization and social anxiety. Very on edge and hyper aware of everything and everyone.\n\nBeing easily irritated and snappy at everything someone says, especially if they aren‚Äôt typically like that.\n\nI don‚Äòt like to cook or bake anymore, because it doesn‚Äòt give me any pleasure and just feels like a chore.\n\nhaving a messy room\n\nWhen i am in my own little \"fight or flight\" world. Start ignoring life around me.\n\nWhen I have been sleeping for 10+ hours every day and still feel tired. 10/10 signs that I am not doing okay and feeling v heavy about something\n\nMessy room üò≠\n\nlack of motivation and exhaustion\n\nBinging\n\nI feel you on the food thing. If it‚Äôs been over 24 hours and I haven‚Äôt eaten, something is wrong af.\n\nTedious psychotic behavior...\n\nBipolar mania.\n\nWhen every room is a mess, if I have a pile of food wrappers and empty cups on my bedside table, fuzzy teeth from not brushing for a fpl days, greasy hair, not bathing. Those are all when it gets really bad. So thankfully like twice a year or so unless I'm going through something very bad.\n\nWhen I don‚Äôt sing along to my favorite songs while I‚Äôm driving üòÇ\n\nWhen I pass a day not singing. If you can't hear me hum or sing I'm not doing good, chief.\n\n Normal stuff like doors opening, etc. make me jump.\nConstant nausea.\nLittle things make me so irritated. Like don't even breathe near me.\n\nIm quiet and always hugging something\n\nI have no appetite until I'm home with my husband. Then we eat what we can. It's all good.\n\nSleeping all day and night\n\nDriving around a neighborhood aimlessly after getting off of work instead of just going home\n\nMy eyes start feeling wet and my throat gets tight. Usually it takes a lot for me to actually cry, but if I‚Äôm almost there it‚Äôs also bad.\n\nHaha, yeah. For me, it‚Äôs excruciating pain- but I can‚Äôt determine if it‚Äôs real (physical) or psychosomatic. \n\nAlso SI or urges to self harm that occur more than once a day.\n\nThese are entirely internal experiences, but were you looking for external too/instead?\n\nBrain fog for sure, also the less anchored I am the thinner my brows get and my poor nails get picked to death\n\n\"I think I'll rewatch Bojack :)\"\n\nIntense paranoia and brain fog\n\nMe.\n\nAvoiding the typical daily conversations with friends and family.\n\nI tend to use gaming as an outlet to my problems. It's an escape and only good distraction thus far. I love watching c-dramas, drawing, or painting, but there's literally no motivation or energy to do so. \n\nI digress, I know it's bad when all I want to do is just game and not physically talk to anyone or leave my room/house.\n\nWhen I walk around like a hobo with unwashed hair lol¬†\n\nCan't get out of bed. If u get up I have to run back to bed as it's my safe place\n\nI know I'm bad when I can't even go grocery shopping cause I'm too anxious.\n\nDamn, reading all the comments I‚Äôm apparently not feeling good mentally.\n\nWhen it\\`s as it worst, I can\\`t do anything, not eat, talk, sleep, do school, leave my house, take care of myself. I can\\`t even cry about it or explain what the hell is going on to anyone. I become almost 100% non functional and I can\\`t do anything about it. It\\`s hell!\n\nZero appetite, suddenly snappy, isolating\n\nNot being able to cry anymore. It's been at least 6 months.  Need to.\n\nMy number of unread texts skyrockets because I'm too burnt out to read them\n\nwhen I start doing the \"I'll shower tomorrow\" that just goes on and on and on\n\nObsessive thoughts all related to one subject or event. Not being able to stop over analyzing everything about \"it\", whatever it may be at that time. Going down somewhat of a rabbit hole of being consumed by this one thing and my NEED to FIX it. Not being able to fix it or not knowing the answer to something that I'm obsessing over, it starts to be the cause of more anxiety (more than my usual amount of anxiousness) and it will not stop, does not go away or feel better and then panic starts to come in waves and after the panic settles momentarily I feel almost a tiny bit of relief. But only to be hit with another wave of panic a little while after. But yea, what starts it are usually OCD thoughts about something thats bothering me or something I'm scared of or fear is going to happen. Then it's all downhill from there and eventually it passes, if I am able to talk about it to someone it helps, if im lucky. There have been times when it didn't pass after awhile and I needed professional help because it manifested in something like I was terrified to leave my home or I just couldn't snap out of it and it was manifested in over sleeping so I didn't have to be awake a deal with my mind (which I am prone to liking to sleep anyway but during these cycles it's way much worse, like I will use sleep medicine right when I wake up to try and go right back to sleep). It also manifests in isolating myself even more than I already do (I'm an introvert). Or not willing to be awake during day time, being afraid to see the sun. Feeling like I'm going to die, feeling like I can't breathe. Lol yes I have quite a few issues but they have gotten better over the years with help and medicines. But I have my moments where I fall and it usually starts with obsessive thoughts about something unpleasant that's bothering or scaring me for some reason. And this always happens during a time that I'm under a lot of stress, I've found that out. The mind can be a very scary thing.\n\nMy memory becomes impaired, I burn my food, drop things, and have no desire to do anything.\n\nWhen I need at least a 1 hour cooldown from having 1 conversation, or being invited to hang out with people makes me feel sick. When I lay in bed until 2 am with my headphones on just listening to sad music. When I start taking anxiety and depression online tests haha. When I start journalling again.\n\nSame as you OP. Plus body odour cause I can't be bothered to shower, racing thoughts, crying spells, lethargy, dissociation.\n\nWhen I am staring at the ceiling and waiting for this feeling to go away. But it won't go away.\n\nNapping all the time. No attention span. Lack of interest in anything that used to be very interesting. (Hobbies, books, etc)\n\nWatching the same tv shows over and over again mindlessly, just to drown out  the fear mongering voices in your head.\n\nYes, same here. I have this strange feeling in my stomach, not exactly nausea, but it makes me not want to eat.\n\n dirty house coupled with 12+ hrs of sleep\n\nWhen I loose interest in everything and lay in bed most the day\n\nIÔ∏è feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up the physical anxiety pain gets so bad. Bowels act up. Can‚Äôt even listen to music or focus. Miss work or school. Or I‚Äôm feeling numb and hopeless. Have to take a benzo.\n\nFor me‚Ä¶ not paying bills. I have the money in my account, it‚Äôs there and ready. I just don‚Äôt have the motivation to click three buttons and make the payment.  Then I get mad at myself a few days later when I pick myself up and have to pay a late fee.\n\nSleeping a lot. Not showering every day. Being snappy with family/loved ones. Being absent minded. Being more klutzy than normal. Not cooking, and eating dry cereal. Overspending.\n\nI start feeling like showering is a huge chore and I stop watering my plants.\n\nWant to know how I'm doing? Look at the plants lol\n\nParalysis. Not being able to work or do self care\n\nMy house becomes an absolute mess. To the point it‚Äôs gross.\n\nThoughts feeling heavier and everything souding muffled are the biggest tell tale signs for me.\n\nIt‚Äôs when you don‚Äôt take care of urself\n\nWhen I start to ignore my pets (don‚Äôt play with them or pet them as often)\n\nMy sleep patterns change. I either feel like I could sleep all day or I can‚Äôt sleep at all.\n\nSkipping a shower for too many days in a row\n\nLeaving my house messy dishes undone, not showering for like 3 days, not brushing my teeth in 1 day‚Ä¶ Just laying in bed binge watching YouTube. I told my boyfriend if you see the house a mess just know I‚Äôm depressed.\n\nFeeling tired and exhausted all the time despite sleeping enough. Poor hygiene. Feeling empty.. That's where I am.\n\nUnable to sleep, anxious, always panicky\n\nWell I just slept through my therapy appointment so I guess for me, oversleeping.\n\nI tend to get really quiet and don't engage with people in any meaningful way. I also can't make eye contact when I'm super depressed or anxious.\n\nWhen I close the door and prefer not getting out of my room\n\nFeeling like wires are under my skin, exhausted but can‚Äôt sleep, increase in intrusive thoughts, zero motivation to do anything, feeling completely empty, not eating\n\nI stopped taking care of myself. No showers, cooking, or doing anything I should be. I just sit there like a potato and gaze into the abyss, lol\n\nI start to lose my ability to think before responding.  Like, basically responding more emotionally charged than logical.\n\nSleeping as much as possible all day then being awake all night"

    "body": "A few days ago I made a post about not leaving the house in months. I spoke about how I was going to challenge myself to go somewhere. Guess what‚Ä¶. i went to my local shopping centre today and I went to a few different shops to get different things!\n\nThis is huge for me because I haven‚Äôt been to this shopping centre since August 2023, the last time I was here I felt so dizzy that I thought I was going to pass out. This is the furthest I have travelled in ages! I stayed with my mom on the phone to help me distract myself and to ensure that I didn‚Äôt feel alone. I also left the house at around 9.30 am as the shopping centre is normally very calm at this time. I spent about 20 mins in there. \n\nI just wanted to share my victory with you guys ü•π\n\nEdit: I am so overwhelmed by all of the positivity üò≠ and it truly warms my heart that my post has encouraged others to try to challenge themselves with more exposure! Towards the end of last year I couldn‚Äôt even leave my BED. If I can do it, I‚Äôm almost certain that you can to! I will keep you guys updated when I make my next outing! Thanks everyone üôÇ",

You should buy yourself a toy to celebrate \n\nNo, I‚Äôm not being facetious. Toys are fun. I personally recommend a Transformer. They look cool and you can fiddle around with them and change them back and forth from one mode to the other\n\nI remember my first trip out after 6 months in the house. It was like a bad acid trip with all the movement and activity out in public. \n\nThe next trip out was no big deal.\n\nCongratulations on seeing the way out and taking it. What is your next goal?\n\nThank you! I hope to return to the shopping centre a few more times and try to stay even longer. Once I  am comfortable, I want to travel an even further distance! I also hope to try and get on public transport. That used to be one of my biggest weaknesses!\n\nRemember, anxiety is a liar. Won't it feel good stepping off of that public transport at your destination after successfully riding on it?\n\nI do not know you but I am proud of you!!!\n\n Congratulations! Every bit goes a long way! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nLegend! Proud of you ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nIm so proud of youuu!! &lt;3 /gen\n\nCongratulations!!!

Now today, try to get out and do something. It won‚Äôt take long to train your brain that everything is alright. Anxiety is a self-compounding snowball that rarely breaks itself.

You earned it for sure ü§ó\n\nI‚Äôm in the same boat how did you do it. I keep thinking something is gonna happen to me when I leave\n\nHonestly, I just went for it. Even though I was terrified beforehand and I almost chickened out, I forced myself out the door. I gave myself a reality check, for almost a year I had this intense fear that something bad would happen to me and NOTHING has happened. \n\nIf something bad was going to happen it would have happened by now. As anxiety sufferers we catastrophize even when there might not be any logical reason to do so. \n\nI recommend gradual exposure, as I mentioned in a previous post, With the guidance of an online therapist, I would walk around my front garden and around my neighbourhood for some time to get used to being out in general. I wasn‚Äôt very consistent with this though and the last time I did this was in April of this year. Perhaps if you do it more consistently it can help tremendously when it‚Äôs time to challenge yourself to go even further.\n\nTowards the end of 2023 I was in a position where I could barely even leave my bed without hyperventilating, I couldn‚Äôt shower, brush my teeth or even go downstairs to make my own meals. If I can do you you definitely can You‚Äôve got this! Best of luck üôÇ\n\nI‚Äôm in the same boat. Are you seeing a therapist? Mine keeps offering meds that I‚Äôm too afraid to take. Ugh. One day at a time.\n\nI was also offered meds in November of last year that I never took because I was terrified of the side effects. I just focused on fixing my sleep cycle and fixing my diet a little. I can‚Äôt tell if this is helping but I do have a bit more hope now! :)\n\nCongrats!\n\nThat's awesome! Way to go!\n\nCongratulations that's HUGE\n\nNext stop, freedom!\n\nI used to be like this. I got so desperate from not living life though that I just said whatever happens to me will just have to happen and I‚Äôve done everything in one year that I was afraid to do in 6 from letting the anxiety control me. Congratulations, man.\n\ni‚Äôm so happy for you! you did that\n\nWell done!!!!!!!!\n\nWooo!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nGreat job!!\n\nVery proud of you! Congrats :)\n\nSO FREAKING PROUD OF YOU!!!!! YOU ARE SO BRAVE, SO STRONG, AND SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN  ANXIETY! \n\nSending hugs your way and encouragement to get back out there again. üíêü´Ç\n\nI'm agoraphobic as well, that's awesome üíØüíØ\n\nCongratulations üëèüèΩ keep it up\n\nSo happy for you ü•πüòç\n\nAmazing! Congratulations, rooting for you !!ü´∂üèº\n\nExposure therapy is helping me tremendously. Congrats to you and wish you the best in your recovery journey!!!\n\nSo proud of you!!! I also haven't left my house aside from doctors visits since the end of February. I get very hot, shaky, and dizzy. Your post has me wanting to try and see if I could go. Maybe not 20 minutes but it gives me hope that maybe I can do it too. Keep going, you got this üôèüèª\n\nCongratulations! I hope you feel so proud of yourself! üéâ\n\nProud of you üôåüôå\n\nüëèüèΩü•≥\n\nI‚Äôm so proud of you. You must feel elated. Congratulations on the good work and I hope your confidence keeps on helping you crush your future goals\n\nI am so so happy for you!!! Tiny challenges build up to create big mountains of progress!\n\nGo you!\n\nSmall wins make massive differences.\n\nKudos !!! You did it ! üôèüéâüéâüëè\n\nü•≥ü•≥ü•≥\n\nYES way to tackle that like a boss!!!! Thank you for sharing your huge win!! Keep going!\n\nüòä that is so excellent!¬†\n\nYou can do it üí™\n\nCongratulations :D\n\nThat is amazing!! I know how hard it can be. Currently in the bed. But just like for you better days to come!!¬†\n\nI love your mother"

    "title": "You aren‚Äôt dying. ",
    "body": "There are so so so many of us that suffer from anxiety, health anxiety too. This savage beast will literally tear you apart and make you question things about your well being. Because of either panic attacks, 24/7 symptoms, or both, you‚Äôll think you‚Äôre legitimately dying all the time. Not only does this create more symptoms, but you‚Äôll unfortunately never break out of the anxious-symptoms-anxious cycle because of this. If you‚Äôre trying to tough it out or face your anxiety without medication and haven‚Äôt tried it before, my suggestion is that you speak with your doctor and try them out. These medications can be world-changing for some when dosed properly and taken long enough. One of the best ways I‚Äôve found that relieves my health anxiety is positive thinking. Even if you don‚Äôt feel like it, start listing things in your head or out loud what you‚Äôre grateful for. Even if it feels fake, weird, and unauthentic, keep saying things you‚Äôre grateful for, and more than likely your symptoms/worries will fade and eventually the fake gratitude will start to feel real. Unfortunately though, the anxiety can still slip through at times. \n   Start journaling your symptoms, list the date and time. List them over and over, no matter how many times they occur, so that when they happen again months or years from now, you can look at the list and realize you aren‚Äôt dying. The symptoms have never caused you harm. They may be terrifying, but you‚Äôve dealt with them for literal months and years, and they never once have harmed you, nor have those horrifying health fears come to fruition. I won‚Äôt reassure you too much, one day we‚Äôre all going to die, so I can‚Äôt, nor can you, say with absolute certainty that *we aren‚Äôt really dying*. We all technically are. But right now, you are healthy and alive. Even if you aren‚Äôt healthy, you have so many surrounding resources to get you healthy/better. Think about how much worse things could be. Sure, that crippling mental image of you being in a hospital bed that you so extremely hate scares you, but right now you most likely AREN‚ÄôT in that hospital bed, sick and dying. Try to live your life and realize you‚Äôre breathing, alive, and these symptoms have never hurt you. ",

    "all_comment_text": "Needed to hear this. Thanks you brother / sister. \nI deal with this on a daily basis, for about 3 years. Some days are better some I‚Äôve been in the ER. \nYou are right though. \n\nThanks.\n\nHey I hope you‚Äôre doing okay! Keep going :)\n\nI wanted to reemphasize how golden and important this message is! health anxiety can make us all feel so alone, like we‚Äôre made of glass and any wrong move can end up being our demise. Thanks so much for posting this, I think this is a message we all need to read and then read again\n\nYes!\n\nI feel like I constantly have a light head and something is constantly wrong, but I am fine. Anxiety is a beast. Thank you for this post ü§ç\n\nThat‚Äôs actually the worst symptom I deal with. I‚Äôve had it for almost 3 years straight now, sort of an ‚Äúon a boat‚Äù or floaty head feeling. Had every medical test done to me, all normal. I think part of the issue is hyper focusing on literally just existing, we‚Äôre so in-tune with every micro movement and sensation that we interpret some of those normal feelings as lightheadedness or dizziness\n\nyes! i‚Äôm a space cadetüòÇ\n\nOh my gosh this has been me for the last month! I‚Äôve had all the tests done and everything comes back normal, but the feeling doesn‚Äôt go away. I always feel so scared I‚Äôm going to pass out while driving, taking a walk, going to the gym etc. it makes me so scared to do the things that usually help me feel better (like exercising). It‚Äôs so awful\n\nMy current feeling at the moment and it instantly triggers me. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not alone in this\n\nyou are not alone. ü§çü§ç\n\nüíöüíöüíö\n\nAmen, but I sure hope you‚Äôre eating and resting well.\n\nUghh this. It‚Äôs so bad. Everyday 24/7 my head feels that way. Like out of it/intense brain fog I can never escape. When I focus on it I get lightheaded. I‚Äôve had an mri, there is nothing in my brain but good luck trying to convince me that üò´\n\nYou‚Äôve got this ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nSo what happens with me is that i think ¬†about a disease and i feel i have it. I literally even start getting physical symptoms of the disease and fear going to the doctor because im scared it‚Äôs going to be some bad news. I really don‚Äôt know how to deal with this and be content about my health.\n\nDealing with this right now for a few weeks again after having it in the past. I had been trying to diet a bit but then got this fear that I‚Äôm eating ‚Äútoo little‚Äù and started to misconstrue this ‚Äúlightheaded‚Äù feeling as indication that I‚Äôm starving myself and try to force myself to eat more. Gained two pounds in a week, and now I‚Äôm scared to eat üôÉ\n\nI got over this fear but I started feeling the lightheaded symptoms AGAIN and convinced myself it‚Äôs because of low blood pressure. Literally forgot that my brain was trying to convince me this was because of not eating just a few days ago üôÑ\n\nHow do y‚Äôall relax enough to sleep with this feeling üò≠\n\nI JUST got over my health anxiety and now I have clicking in my neck and immediately I was like omg I‚Äôm dying. Did the worst thing and googled it, but google did say it‚Äôs normally harmless. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle. Even when you think you‚Äôre over it, you‚Äôre not.\n\nI feel my heart beat too much , I keep checking my pulse bc of palpitations but I have terrible health anxiety and idk what to do to help tbh I think I‚Äôm having a heart attack for like the past 3 weeks straight and I‚Äôm not getting a slight pain in my sternum area, am I ok ?\n\nYou‚Äôre ok! I had chest pains and felt my heart for 3 months. It was all anxiety.\n\nMe too. Also, for about 3 months.\n\nOh my god\nI‚Äôm facing the exact same symptoms please help\n\nThe chest pains? Or the neck cracking? Lol\n\nChest pain kind of‚Ä¶ thinking I‚Äôm having heart issues. But before this also i thought i had a disease Abe m and was getting the exact symptoms. Also too scared to go to the doctor\n\nI had chest pains for 3 months. Severe chest pains. My heart rate was constantly elevated and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. It was all anxiety. For peace of mind, I would go to the doctor\n\nOhhh\n\nI have health anxiety as well, but I've been manually cracking my neck for even longer than I've been over-anxious! Not a good habit but nothing bad has come of it. I'm in my 40s now...\n\nI also list things I'm grateful for when my anxiety starts looming. I find it helps \"ground\" me back to reality and also reminds me I have people/things I look forward to seeing every day.\n\nanyone have ear fullness üòîüòî\n\nYup dealing with this now. It makes my anxiety worse just thinking more about it. Can never tell if there is something wrong with me or it‚Äôs my anxiety.\n\nI had a whole day where I randomly thought everything was quieter, I was checking my ears by yelling and talking to see if it wasn‚Äôt as loud. All anxiety\n\nI totally thought I was alone in that feeling! I literally once convinced myself I was having a stroke because I got this sudden feeling of my ears being plugged and everything going silent around me.\n\nEdit: why is me expressing what I‚Äôm going through being downvoted? Isn‚Äôt this supposed to be a place where we can share?\n\nI am feeling this aswel. I feel like I'm going deaf in my right ear. Because I am thinking about this. I am thinking the worst. I have to keep talking loud and then block my left ear to see can I still hear out of my right ear. Health anxiety is tough. Everyday I am just worrying about my health. Thinking I am going insane. I find it so hard to tell myself I am ok. I feel I can't¬† think rationally.\n\nI do... For more than a year now :(\n\nYeah I do when 2 things occur: seasonal allergies or if I drink too much water.   Now I only drink when Im thirsty and I dont have the full ears and I feel great\n\nYessss and doctors say everything looks clear\n\nI get this from clenching my teeth @ night and when anxious üò¢\n\nuvhhh idk what mines from lol\n\nHealth anxiety is even worse when you have lifelong serious health conditions üò≠\n\nI needed this\n\nHealth anxiety is terrible. When I‚Äôm feeling like my heart is pumping fast, and I just can‚Äôt get comfortable, I get thrown in a panic attack. It‚Äôs horrendous feeling\n\nPssh but I‚Äôll die eventually. One day a symptom will kill me or worse. Nobody survives life.\n\nYeah that‚Äôs what I was saying near the end lmao\n\nAlways good to read a reminder of the facts even if we already know it anyway because its easy to forget them in the moment.   And medication can make it so much better when it works and I have been blessed to have it work well for several years at a time but it seems that I need to change it up every decade or so.  And as I am kind of old by now and fighting my way back thru round four of this  crap (started in my early 30s so I was indeed blessed not to know what real panic, true depression, nor GAD was before then) there is the reality that I am not as healthy as when it first started, its just life and aging that does that.  Not to mention losing family and friends along the way, a couple of them with rare but particularly cruel conditions, that is also a part of getting older that I really, really hate.  I admit I sometimes get angry and bitter about having to deal with my own anxious depression or whatever it should be called, and wonder how life might have been without it but in spite of it I have been quite successful in life by the usual markers.  In the latest episode, as before, I have had good periods along with the setbacks, and I know logically that remission is what happens eventually for me given enough time and medicine adjusting.  Been two years since this last episode came up and twice I thought I was cured but it came back, but that just means that I am on my way to a full remission eventually.  I do know that when it remits one of the things that happens is I no longer give it much thought, its like the health anxiety and self focused thinking just vanishes.   I also hope I will see a true permanent cure developed one day for anxiety/panic/depression, and even if I don't many of the younger folks on here will see it happen for sure.  And that will be a wonderful day indeed.\n\nYes, the bitterness, feeling helpless, it's the worst! Feeling like I'm stuck carrying a 70lb weight around and it's all anxiety\n\nThis was great to read as someone who‚Äôs been dealing with a horrible health anxiety flare for the last few months as well as someone who finally bit the bullet and started medication a few days ago for the very first time. Thank you.\n\nThanks so much for posting this. My father passed away some months ago of a heart attack which gave me a terrible health anxiety. Tend to feel discomfort/pain in my left back, chest, shoulder and neck. When I relax is when I feel it manifests the most and recently had my first panic attack which I feel made my anxiety worse and harder to control. Being left alone makes me terrified and I feel anything is happening but I've noticed that when I take the time to relax it all goes away. \n\nCan anyone relate to this? Would be lovely to hear from your experience.\n\nYes, I‚Äôve had all of these symptoms. I was CRIPPLED when my anxiety disorder first started, I just wanted to be around people in fear that I would randomly drop dead. After finally getting my reassurance from the doctors (which you should only do once, two at the ABSOLUTE most, don‚Äôt make going to the doctors a habit) it started to go away. My sternum randomly gets stuck a couple times a week, the cartilage or something gets lodged in a weird way, and it causes some sudden chest pain and tightness. I push on my sternum and it goes away instantly but my anxiety is always like, *but what if today is the daaaaaay?*. Feeding into your anxiety will get you nowhere. Anxiety will stay with you until you develop your own unique methods to deal with it, manage it, and cure it. \n   Psychosomatic symptoms are not super spoken about, but they‚Äôre symptoms mimicking illnesses that literally manifest from your mind, that‚Äôs how insanely powerful your brain is. If you think about heart problems enough, you might subconsciously start developing symptoms mimicking ‚Äúheart issues‚Äù, chest pain, the illusion of tightness, pseudo shortness of breath. For about a month I had this terrifying shortness of breath. It was caused by consciously breathing and checking if I was breathing enough. This made my breathing go from automatic to manual, causing shortness of breath that I saw doctors for. The answer: You‚Äôre aware of your breathing and are trying to do what your body is programmed to do. It sucked.\n\nThanks so much for sharing, could you maybe share a bti of how you dealt with it? Its kinda new for me so I feel a bit lost and afraid.\n\nIt sucked, but I had to get into a mindset of ‚Äúif today is when I‚Äôm gonna die, so be it. Bring it on anxiety.‚Äù Some of the hardest times I had was facing my anxiety. For example, I felt like I was gonna fall over if I was standing still. It sucked, but to cure it, I‚Äôd take a few minutes each day to stand still and allow myself to feel that unsteadiness, that great fear of falling over. The symptoms intensified as I was facing them, but day by day it got a bit better. Journaling as I said in my post is HUGE. Write your symptoms down on your phone or on paper, write down the date too. That is critical, so when you have those symptoms again in a few days or months, you‚Äôll realize they haven‚Äôt harmed you. Those are a couple of my methods that helped me.\n\nI appreciate that you take the time to explain how you deal with your anxiety. Honestly, for me it has been a bit annoying, especially today. I started feeling a lot of pain in my chest and in my back. But I put myself in situations that would make my heart rate raise like walking a bit faster or making a bit of jumps or something that would basically make me understand that my heart is not the problem, but my mind is pretty much. I guess for what comes now is it to follow your advice and find what is that I need to do to rewire my thoughts and lose the fear to the sensations that my body is feeling because of the anxiety. Things again for taking the time to explain how you deal with it and for sharing your experience with this. Is great that you shared this with all the community because really I don't think we are the only ones dealing with this, as we can see for the countless comments, but this was a very helpful contribution, thank you.\n\nYes so I‚Äôm facing this exact same issue. Reading about symptoms pnline and somehow i start facing them and im too scared to go to the doctor. But ik health anxiety is a big part of it symptoms may or may not be real¬†\n\nYes.10 years ago now I lost my best friend. Dealing with the person I loved the most in the world taken from me in a horrible way started my anxiety. From years of meditation and some therapy I am doing much better.\nBut yeah- I was thought my tounge was swelling and I was going to choke on it. My heart was beating too fast so was constantly checking my pulse. My hands and face would go numb. Went to the ER no less than 10 times over the years saying I was dying and having a heart attack. Was put on 51/50 watch for showing up 4 times to the ER the same week.¬† ( they thought I was suicidal???? I was there cause I thought I was dying and didn't want to but whatever. )\nI am truly sorry for your loss. People say it gets better but I don't know if that's true. I would feel like my heart was just black bubbling tar after her murder. Now I feel the tar has become solid and this is the way I'll live forever.¬†¬†\nYou are okay. You don't feel okay but I promise you are. Be kind to yourself during this time. Find outlets and some right recepice of meditation. It has slowly helped me.¬†\nThank you for letting me share.¬†\n\nOh god, I am truly sorry you have been through something as hard as this and sorry for your loss. I feel so much strength in your words. Reading all you've been through and being able to be here saying it gets better is just so refreshing. A friend yesterday told me \"feel proud of the strength you have, not many would be able to endure your pain as well as you did\". I want to share it with you today, hope it makes you feel as good as it did for me. Thanks for giving me hope, recently I've been feeling my anxiety has reduced and its easier to manage, so luckily I feel things are getting better. Thanks for sharing and I wish you all the best.\n\n&lt;3\n\nI don't necessarily disagree with this but it doesn't work for everyone. We're all too different for a single approach to be the complete answer.\n\nPositive thinking didn't work for me. It felt like a conjob in my head.\n\nI'm kind of relapsing at the moment so not in the best place.\n\nWhat worked for me was mindfulness and following the philosophy of eckhart tolle. I've also just read \"how not to give a f**k\" by Mark Manson which I'm feeling is for me.\n\nKudos to those who benefit from greatfullness. Everyone else, keep searching and find YOUR answer, it is out there.\n\nI went through hands down the hardest point in my life bc of health anxiety and the thing that helped me the most with calming my thoughts was telling myself that i'd rather die from an actual symptom than experience the stress i went through just thinking about everything that could possibly be wrong with me. To the point that i had to remind myself that at that point, nothing else could be worse than my own mind lmao. Probably horrible advice to others, but it really shook me out of being in this mental cage 24/7.\n\nWhats worse is that the stress from health anxiety created a bunch more unfamiliar symptoms which made me think that i was dying even more. 2 years later, most if not all of those health anxiety symptoms are gone.\n\nDid medication help you ?\n\ni only took medication for my herniated disc, the whole reason i got health anxiety in the first place lol. after some months where i thought the meds made my symptoms worse, my orthopedic doctor seemed happy with my progress so i took it as a sign that i might have been just catastrophizing\n\nEarlier today, I got up out of my chair, and as I was walking, I felt very off balance. Not light headed, but very dizzy, like I was going to topple over at any moment. I was frightened, but I was able to tell myself that this had happened before, and it was just anxiety. I feel a lot better now.\n\nI don't know if that helps anyone, but I hope it does. üíó\n\nHealth anxiety is a dreadful thing to deal with\n\nI‚Äôve been having some pretty bad panic attacks recently and at its worst I feel like I‚Äôm actually having a heart attack. It‚Äôs scary shit and the fear that I might be dying and should call and ambulance just makes it even worse.\n\nCheers, friend. üíó\n\nThank you. I‚Äôm on day 10 of Prozac and day 8 I felt wonderful, today I feel like shit. I wonder if you can help me answer this question, if you felt this way with SSRI‚Äôs?\n\nDepending on the person and the SSRI one can get total relief for some years in some cases like mine.  I remember lexapro was good for a long time, pristiq was the last one before it pooped out (not totally, it was doing something, but not enough so back to the clonazepam while moving onto trintellix, which time will tell if it is the answer by itself or not, if not something else will be).   I have a non blood relative with anxiety/panic (but not depression afaik) who has been fine for many years on Effexor.   I tried Prozac when it first came out but it was too much for me, it felt like 10 cups of coffee to me but looking back I wonder if I had taken enough clonazepam to get it on board maybe I would have adjusted and then been able to slowly wean off the clonazepam as I have done with other SSRIs in the past.  Looking thru my journals (which I second the recommendation of OP to do) I see that I have had lots of back and forth before remission came and it always seems to take more time to go away than it should.  I also see I have survived in spite of some really scary shit because I wrote about it so I know it happened.  Palpitations, ER visits, even passing out then ER (a rare but not dangerous vasovagal overresponse to anxiety), arm tingling, and countless more symptoms yet here I still stand.  My dad got it in his early 20s and used alcohol (not recommended) to deal with it, he never thought he'd live to 40 but he lived to 83 and it seemed to lighten up a bit over the years for him.  So in your case if you have already had some good days on prozac then more good days will come.   There will be setbacks but they will diminish over time.  A good therapist and pdoc can help of course, therapy helps us to reframe our thinking and remain hopeful especially when it feels hopeless and a good pdoc will work with you to find what works best for you.  No matter the setback better days lie ahead, that is a certainty.\n\ni‚Äôm on prozac, just restarted it 12 days ago. it‚Äôs been a struggle just like this for me, like a roller coaster. it works for me once i get past the first few weeks, but until then i‚Äôm riding it out\n\nOh yeah, definitely. My anxiety can take good strands of days and instantly turn them into bad ones literally in seconds. Anxiety is extremely complicated and can do that, also SSRIs will definitely do that too. Had it happen!\n\nBeen going through it after getting covid a few weeks ago. Thank you\n\nThank you. I'm currently dealing with a nauseous sensation in my head and it often feels like I got kicked on the back of my head and like my head is empty. I also have a sharp pain in my right shoulder blade. It's scary and I'm just shaking.. ü´†\n\nThis is happening to me üò≠ I have a lot tension headache and i‚Äôm going to the doctor tomorrow. I keep telling myself it‚Äôs in my head because one day i have those symptoms and one day i don‚Äôt\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you too. Hopefully your Doctor visit turns out good. Today, I woke up with no headache and haven't had one all day. The only thing is, I think I'm dealing with DPDR so my brain feels \"spacey\" and unable to properly think. Still have some light pressure too. I'm waiting for my workers comp adjuster to approve my CT scan.\n\nThank you ! And i hope everything goes well with you too.\n\nHow did it go?\n\nWell honestly I canceled my appointment since those symptoms disappeared overnight after i convinced myself it was in my head. It shows how crazy powerful your mind can be.\n\nAnd see, that's exactly what happened with me. Mine went away 2 days later after my initial post but now throughout the day, I get some bouts of nausea and squeezing in the back of my head. I'm still waiting on my workers comp adjuster to approve my CT scan because I'm not going to lie, this has me looking down the brain tumor rabbit hole. üò¢\n\nIt also doesn't help that my girlfriend also had a tumor on her pituitary gland she never even knew was there until she went to the Doctor for a CT scan when she got into a fender bender. No symptoms except little headaches here and there.\n\nI hope everything goes well with your CT scan but also remember it may be your imagination making you believe that. Since anxiety causes nausea and it‚Äôs allergies season so you may be sneezing. My mother always says that when you expect it to be bad it‚Äôs always just something simple. i hope everything comes back normal. I‚Äôll keep you in my prayers and your girlfriendüôè.\n\nthis is what i tell myself all the time. not even in the way that youre describing, as far as health anxiety. but just that, whatever im anxious about (sometimes not even anything specific lol) isnt going to kill me.\n\nGetting into my 40s solved this. The best years have passed.  I made it! All down hill from here.\n\nI went off meds for depression (celexa) and developed terrible anxiety with health anxiety that I had never experienced before. I became obsessed with minor health issies. I really did feel like I was dying, and needed to see a bunch of specialists. I had panic attacks, cried almost daily.  I felt like I had transformed into a different person.  It affected every aspect of my life, work, and relationships. I didn't want to be told it was \"just anxiety\", but yes, it mostly was anxiety. Worst 6 months of my life.\n\nAnd most of my issues went away by going back on meds. \n\nSometimes, you just need meds.\n\nThis message is so needed for health anxiety sufferers. This is so true and it's helped me tremendously!!\n\nWow thank you so much, I needed this. I suffer from soft migraine and anxiety, it's a rude combo but your message give me hope\n\nHealth anxiety for me , constantly worrying and actually getting symptoms of what I fear just for them to be gone for a while and suddenly come back.\n\nGoogle is the worst enemy to yourself.\n\nRelate\n\nMay we get better friend.\n\nI've had helath anxiety for the past 2 years I've had over 8 serious health scares in that time and this one rn is my scariest one.... My brain keeps lingering on the fact that I may have HIV only because I recently found out a Family friend had HIV.... Then my brain start d thinking about wether or not I was ever at risk of exposure.... Then I suddenly remembered we had both played with my cat at some point.... And at that time I didn't know her diagnoses.... It was a secret.... My mind started wandering thinking what if it scratched her and immediately scratched me and maybe it transfered something.... It doesn't help that there are gaps in my memory either... It happened to several months go.... I am aware of my severe Hypochondria but my brain gives into it each time\n\nAll in all I really needed to see this... So I could ground myself again and remember that my brain is just trying to protect me from perceived threats\n\nTotally saving this for later. lately i have been struggling with health anxiety a lot, went to the doctor, wouldn‚Äôt you know im completely healthy, but i can still feel sg telling me in the back of my mind that what if something slipped through the cracks and i have sg that cannot be detected via all those tests that were made. it‚Äôs getting incredibly tiring but im trying my best to take a moment everyday and say thanks for what i have. i found that this does help me tremendously!\n\nThis is what I needed at this moment, time, and place. I am legit right now thinking I‚Äôm dying and nobody is taking my symptoms real. The pains, the random spasm, the feeling off. But you‚Äôre so right! I‚Äôm very appreciative of your reassurance. Definitely saving this post for days like today. Praying for us all\n\nI‚Äôve been feeling off for over three years with this bullcrap, but thankfully it never once harmed or killed me. I mean we all will taste clay one day but I‚Äôm grateful for how I feel now, even if not 100%.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è absolutely\n\nAmen. \nNeeded this.\n\nThank you. I needed this.\n\nThank you\n\nüò≠\n\nBIG struggler of health anxiety here. Constantly trying to find ways to work through it and unfortunately haven‚Äôt been the best at positive thinking these past few years. I appreciate these reminders more than you know, as they remind me to be thankful that I am alive and I have a future here. Thanks for the post!\n\nYup I was always trying to tough it out and finally decided to try medication‚Ä¶just started this week so hopefully works out\n\nthank you so much, i really needed to hear this ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nTy for this\n\nThank you for this post. I was actually doing just fine for a few months..working out, eating healthy and getting great sleep and lost weight . But then my gpa passed unexpectedly in May and it triggered me‚Ä¶and at the same time I was dealing with health related worries so I also wasn‚Äôt able to grieve properly‚Ä¶my health anxiety and panic is now back with a vengeance. I slipped into depression and gave up‚Ä¶but as of recently something clicked‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm going to try and get back into my routine again towards a healthy life physically and mentally. I know my gpa wouldn‚Äôt want me to give up‚Ä¶I have good days and bad ones but I know that its ok and it‚Äôll take time. I‚Äôm ready to get my life back on track.\n\nThis is comforting. Thank you\n\nI‚Äôm oldish and have long forgotten the age of anxiety about dying. Now it‚Äôs about losing a loved one, my job, my teeth and hair falling out, etc. because dying would ultimately be a peaceful end to these worries anyhow. I don‚Äôt WANT to die. I just no longer CARE. To be clear. I realize I also don‚Äôt have kids though. Which changes things.\n\nI need to hear this right now, thank you so much. I just feel like I‚Äôm either on the brink of breaking out into tears or just nothing and its so frustrating. stuck in a spiral right now too and my health feels like its dwindling again even if its my anxiety. Thank you, seriously.\n\nThank you for this. To everyone else reading this, you are not alone!!\n\nI needed to see this tonight. Anxiety is such a menace and can feel so scary sometimes. I love how you pointed out journaling because that has helped me recognize some of those same symptoms or fears at later dates of panic!\n\nI have bouts of medical anxiety on and off, but I hope one day it will become much more minor. It sounds some of you have found solutions to lessen the medical anxiety and that‚Äôs uplifting/amazing to see! üíú\n\nI appreciate your post.\n\nI wish sometimes lol\n\nI've been dealing with this throat issue and every test came back negative. This helped me calm down so much, thank you!\n\nIt's so true that anxiety, especially health anxiety, can be incredibly overwhelming. It's like a vicious cycle where the more you worry, the more symptoms you seem to notice, which then makes you worry even more. It's important to remember that these feelings, while very real, don't mean you're actually dying.\n\nTalking to a doctor about medication can be a game-changer for many people. Medication, when used correctly, can help break the cycle and give you the space to manage your anxiety better.\n\nPositive thinking and gratitude can also make a big difference. Even if it feels strange at first, consistently reminding yourself of the good things in your life can help shift your focus away from the anxiety.\n\nJournaling your symptoms is another great tip. By keeping a record, you can look back and see that these symptoms haven't caused you any real harm, which can be reassuring during tough moments.\n\nRemember, it's okay to seek help and use the resources available to you. You're not alone in this, and there are ways to manage and overcome these feelings. Stay strong and keep reminding yourself that right now, you're alive and breathing.\n\nLife saver üò©üôèüèº thank you for this words who ever you are may God always protect you.\n\nTechnically, we *are* all dying\n\nYeah I said that lol\n\nMan hates paragraphs.\n\nI actually put paragraphs in there but when I posted it, they all went away lmao\n\nI understand.  What you wrote is helpful to people. I noticed that I need to work on using my coping mechanisms on a daily basis and make them into more of a routine.  Exercising helps quite the anxiety and talking or journaling helps as well.  \n\nI notice that my anxiety is always worse in the morning. I think it‚Äôs because in the morning my mind is flooded with thoughts on things that need to be completed today. I noticed if I break it into smaller tasks it doesn‚Äôt seem so daunting. The thing I have the most anxiety about is stuff I keep procrastinating.\n\nAnxiety being worse first thing on a morning is what a lot (most? all?) of anxiety sufferers endure, it's all thanks to cortisol which floods in on a morning.  Mine is horrific first thing most days, but understanding why that is and how cortisol works has helped me deal with it\n\nThank you so much for this messageüíö\n\nThat‚Äôs the problem.\n\nBeen feeling so many things at once these past couple of days. Hot (thinking it‚Äôs a fever ALL the time!) check my temp and everything is normal. Nauseated, the past couple of times I‚Äôve rushed to the bathroom thinking today‚Äôs the day but it‚Äôs always just a burp or nothing at all.  Stomach pain, always ends up being passing Gas. Shakes, Shivers, feeling cold/hot, blocked sinuses and it‚Äôs just annoying at this point‚Ä¶.\n\ni needed this ü•∫\n\nThank you. From the bottom of my heart.\n\nThank you for this ü•π A great post to pop up on my timeline that I have heavily been struggling with internally as of late. Anxiety is cruel\n\nI recently found out that I have herpes and I‚Äôm terrified it‚Äôs going to trigger fibromyalgia because of this one sensitive patch of skin on leg. (Sounds so ridiculous to actually write it out.) Health anxiety is a monster. Our bodies aren‚Äôt perfect and Health Anxiety almost punishes us for not feeling 100% all of the time. I‚Äôm been struggling a lot lately. I‚Äôm terrified of being in pain everyday. I know deep down that‚Äôs probably not going to happen. But anxiety lies to us.\n\nBut sometimes I do faint or end up in the hospital from my panic attacks. So how do I know that the symptoms are not going to kill me?\n\nIt‚Äôs a vicious cycle indeed. Undiagnosed GAD caused me to be in the hospital twice within a week because my heart rate was in the upper 130s while at rest.\n\n\nNot feeling well-&gt;stresses-&gt;feels worse due to stressing-&gt;panics and agonizes over feeling worse-&gt; chest hurts and feels palpitations-&gt; thinks I‚Äôm having heart attack-&gt; gets more worked up-&gt;passes out‚Ä¶\n\nYou're amazing.\n\nWell put mate. I‚Äôve suffered from health anxiety for 35 years and journaling my symptoms has helped me so many times. My therapist told me not to as it is exacerbating the anxiety. Telling myself positive aspects of life doesn‚Äôt help me though as it doesn‚Äôt change the the catastrophic thoughts\n\nOne time, while explaining myself to my father, he said ‚Äú just quit worrying‚Äù which I laughed and said - holy shit you just cured the whole world! I know many of us have heard this before and thought, if only it was that easy!! \nAs an inside joke with my wife, I said I‚Äôm going to just say this out loud anytime I‚Äôm having health anxiety, or general anxiety, and holy shit did I Miyagi myself! Anytime I feel like ‚Äúthis is it, I‚Äôm dying‚Äù I say to myself, ‚Äúoh well no big deal, just don‚Äôt worry about it, if you die you die‚Äù and it has been more helpful than any other mindfulness practice or medicine I‚Äôve tried over the years. I know it‚Äôs not a cure, but funny enough his insensitivity has helped tremendously ü§£\n\nThanks for this! I‚Äôve shared it with my own anxiety community AnxietySquad.\n\nThank you for sharing :) I hope this helps everyone who reads this ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nHealth anxiety is a real bummer. Recently going through a heightened period of it. I have been journaling my \"symptoms\" on a day and time basis and that really helps. Makes me chuckle when I read back what I write and notice that I was completely fine.\n\nI am, however, interested in meds. I have a prescription but my health anxiety doesn't want me to take them because I don't wan to OD and die. Which is silly because I doctor prescribed the dose haha\n\nIt‚Äôs extremely extremely hard to OD on anxiety meds lol. You‚Äôll be fine! üòÑ\n\nOh exactly. Anxiety brain trying to tell me otherwise lol\n\nI definitely needed to hear this. Every few months I think there‚Äôs something new that‚Äôs catastrophically wrong with me. I go to the doctors and nothing. From heart issues, to liver disease, kidney disease, enlarged prostate. Thought I had all of them, but nothing ever comes of it. The latest spat of anxiety was thinking I had a blood clot because I recently had surgery and also had discomfort in my calf after. Turns out it was just soreness from PT exercises. I hate this cycle of thinking. It‚Äôs the worst. But I‚Äôm starting to finally try and overcome it.\n\nReading these comments makes me feel like I'm far from alone. Health anxiety is exhausting and annoying. ER visits because I think I'm dying and they always tell me I'm fine. It's just my anxiety. We sometimes don't chuck it up to anxiety and try to find other possible solutions, which, yes, could be the case sometimes, but usually, it's not anything other than anxiety. The beauty of it allüôÉ\n\nThank you!\n\nAs someone who has awful health anxiety, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nIt‚Äôs like a new symptom for me everyday. \n\nIt‚Äôs started with me having these ‚Äúissues‚Äù with my heart. \n\nNow it‚Äôs with my head and feeling numb. It‚Äôs almost as if I can‚Äôt feel nothing when I touch. I wanna go to the ER but I‚Äôm just afraid they‚Äôre gonna say it‚Äôs anxiety again.\n\nTHANK YOU. I would upvote this 500 times if I could.\n\nI hate feeling this way\n\ndude i needed this üò≠i‚Äôve been clenching my jaw at night and i have had a nonstop headache and jaw pain but my mind is making me believe it‚Äôs a brain tumor and i‚Äôve been so fucking worried\n\nThis post being one long paragraph instead of separate shorter paragraphs gave me anxiety\n\nLol jk. Good advice\n\nIt's not just anxiety when you think you're dying it's the most desperate you'll ever feel and it's also unimaginably hard to go through\n\nYeah, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not in the hell I used to be in. It was unrelenting agony and torture for like 3 months. The impending doom, feeling like everything is about to collapse, I don‚Äôt wish that on anyone, and I‚Äôm so sorry for the people who are going through it.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nThank you. So much for this\n\nI needed to hear this so badly, my death anxiety always creeps up on me at night. Thank you.\n\nSame. Sometimes I‚Äôll wake up in the middle of the night panicking about it. I have to force it out of my head and pretend everything is fine so I can relax and go back to sleep\n\nSending you love. It‚Äôll get easier, I promise. Take deep breaths and keep reassuring yourself that you are not going to die, you are present and you are okay.\n\nHealth anxiety can make you feel so alone because it‚Äôs not talked about as much as general anxiety so this post and all the comments are so encouraging to read through.¬†\n\nDoes anybody else suffer with HA but absolutely petrified to actually go to the doctor/hospital to get checked out? Almost like the thought of knowing your worst fears are confirmed is somehow worse than the daily hell of ‚Äúwondering‚Äù and guessing?\n\nI‚Äôve been going on 15 years with on and off severe health anxiety. Have been to the ER more times than I can count. Also been on SSRIs the entire time but I feel like they‚Äôre barely helping. Still holding onto the hope that one day things will be better. It feels amazing to know that I‚Äôm not alone, because that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs felt the majority of the time. I wish I had looked for a community of similar people sooner\n\nThank you I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and I‚Äôm slowly starting to cope with it. I‚Äôve had severe chest pain ongoing for months now and I was almost certain it was heart failure or a heart attack coming on. After two emergency room visits blood tests and EKG came back negative. I am still worried and have to wait another 2 weeks for an echocardiogram this whole experience has been very frustrating and difficult it‚Äôs really taken a toll on me :(\n\nYou‚Äôre not alone. I have had chest pain, like stop what you‚Äôre doing chest pain, for weeks and weeks that gets worse with walking and shortness of breath. I swore I was a ticking heart attack bomb waiting to happen. EKG, clear. Echo, clear. I did a right and left heart cath to check for blockages, clear. I am at a total loss. I have major vitamin deficiencies going on and that‚Äôs all I can think to blame it on. It‚Äôs making me crazy.\n\nIndeed, though it‚Äôs definitely best to get a thorough check first to make sure it‚Äôs not something real. But if a rather thorough health check, like ultrasound on heart, scans, 24-72hr ecg, blood tests and so on come back normal, the chances of it being anything fatal is minimal. Even if something were to happen, it‚Äôd either be something we can‚Äôt detect anyway before it happens or gets worse and would most likely not be deadly, you‚Äôd still likely be saved with modern health care.\n\nAlso, one thing that‚Äôs good to know is that if it the symptoms you experience doesn‚Äôt get noticeably worse with time, they‚Äôre either not real OR the disease progresses so slowly that you‚Äôd definitely be able to get help before it turns lethal.\n\nIt‚Äôs very difficult and I‚Äôm dealing with health anxiety myself, mainly heart disease fears, diabetes fear and fear over my dizziness and dry mouth that somehow seems to have become worse. In my case it seems to be a partly positive thing as it has helped me turn my life around, to get healthier, exercise more, lose weight, eat healthier food while also dealing with some actual issues that I just hadn‚Äôt bothered with before like my injured shoulder.\n\nWhile some parts of my symptoms are certainly real, I‚Äôve verified enough to be false that I know that it‚Äôs not lethal but just annoying stuff like sleep apnea, GERD, maybe some gastritis and some side effects from some meds.\n\nNow I just need to try to teach my body/mind to not fear the scary symptoms like palpitations, chest tightness, shortness of breath and random pain.\n\nAnd also something that helped me a lot... Don't say I wish I was the person I was before ....you still are that person and I know it because there are those small times that you feel a feeling for seconds and then those feelings diminish..because they are covered the anxiety mud...you are still that person..and when the spirit leaves the body,the Day we are old and we die the anxiety will stay to our physical and tired body and the clean spirit will leave our body with Pure natural amazing feelings...the spirit never dies we are still this person it's still in our bodies the spirit it's limitless and nothing can distort it or destroy it..keep that in mind...the person you were once it's still there...after the heaviness of life covered it and that soul holds all this Weight it's you that holds the weight you are very stronger people keep going...in the end when we die we will understand the hard beauty and the meaning of this life..\n\nThank you for this. I've struggling thru horrible weed withdrawal anxiety and chest pain for the last 5 days or so. Just constantly scared I'm gonna have a heart attack or something. But I'm a healthy 21 year old male, that has also had a ct scan of my heart, along with ecg, bloodwork, and other tests. All came out fine. But I still get anxious and it causes the chest pains. It's such a viscous cycle.\n\nHave saved this post for those days\n\nI read the title and my brain was like \"okay, but what if I am?\". How do I know that I'm not dying this time? How do I know that I have to run to the ER or not? It's terrifying to feel this way. (Sorry I think I'm having a panic attack right now so I'm terrified I'm gonna die right now)\n\nBeing that you have an anxiety disorder, and you‚Äôre having repetitive attacks, I can say with almost certainty that it‚Äôs just that, anxiety. Yes, some people that were dying felt immense impending doom moments before they passed, but you‚Äôre suffering these feelings over and over and over with zero health issues. Unfortunately i can‚Äôt tell you if the next one will *really* be a panic attack or you dying. I know what I‚Äôm saying sounds unbelievably terrifying, but you and I, all of us need to accept the fact that one day we are *going to die*. One day those symptoms *just might* be us dying. Right now though, I‚Äôm positive you aren‚Äôt dying and you‚Äôre suffering what we‚Äôre all going through, a good old panic attack and anxiety disorder. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to reassure you too much, as this kind of is like OCD in the sense that if you reassure people a lot it can actually hinder healing. Acceptance is one of the keys to beating an anxiety disorder. You could be that REAAAAALLLY small percent of people who think they‚Äôre having a panic attack but are actually suffering a medical emergency, who honestly knows? The universe doesn‚Äôt care about how we meet our ends, but fortunately you fit into the large majority of people *who aren‚Äôt dying, and are just having bad anxiety*.\n\nThank you, I really needed this ü´∂üèª it was just a panic attack of course üòÖ\n\nGreat post. Been dealing with this for 6 months gone down scary Google rabbit holes about muscle twitches and body weakness. Starting Cymbalta tomorrow hoping for the best. It‚Äôs tore me apart mentally and physically.\n\nthe heart symptoms make life a living hell. the pains and discomfort and chest tightness ugh. it is so draining and i‚Äôm sick of living every day scared\n\nI needed to hear this but reading this while having physical symptoms just made me worry so so much"

    "body": "Hi everyone. Male, 31, lifetime sufferer of panic attacks, agoraphobia, and chronic debilitating nausea. Any stress at all or even sometimes for no reason I start feeling incredibly nauseous. In fact a lot of my anxiety revolves around emetophobia.\n\nAnyway, tonight I took the Clonazepam an hour before. Within an hour I felt....normal. I felt like I could conquer the whole world...not in a manic way but in a \"holy shit I just feel....normal\"\n\nThis got me thinking. How much of my daily chronic and fairly severe nausea is \"just\" my anxiety? I'm on snris for my general anxiety and they work very well. But, this feeling of being healthy is wild to me.\n\nIs there a way to deal with this nausea in other ways than benzos?\n\nI've trried mint, ginger, and even zoffan before to no avail.\n\nAny tips would be amazing.

    "all_comment_text": "Benzos are just small miracles in pill form which make them so addictive.¬†\n\nI guess I can see that. I don't feel a urge to keep taking them, just an urge to feel normal\n\nEvery benzo addict will tell you it all started with just wanting relief from anxiety. It does work extremely well if you can take it as prescribed, however, it‚Äôs amazingly quick building a tolerance.\n\nI‚Äôm glad it helped, and pls be careful\n\nIs it worth taking if it builds a tolerance so quickly? What's the point in taking it anymore once the tolerance builds?\n\n&gt;Is it worth taking if it builds a tolerance so quickly? What's the point in taking it anymore once the tolerance builds?\n\nThe point is more to use it as a \"rescue med\" when, no matter what, you can't calm yourself down/ground yourself. \n\nEven just knowing \"if i cant calm myself down, i have this bottle of meds\" can be enough to keep yourself from panicing MORE about the panic attack.\n\nThis is a great way to look at it.\n\nIt really works\n\nExactly this! Knowing that I stop a panic if I have one helps me not be so afraid to do something that might trigger an attack and makes it so they just don‚Äôt happen instead\n\n100%. I‚Äôve been averaging one about once a month or less. But even just knowing they‚Äôre there is helpful.\n\nI used it for years as an emergency medication, and never had issues with tolerance.\n\nIt helped me for years...then suddenly I couldn't get it prescribed anymore. Still trying to find an equal alternative.\n\nIn the exact same boat‚Ä¶.I‚Äôve had to use a 5 mg edible in lieu of a prescription to Xanax or Klonopin\n\nTake it when it makes a big difference - weddings, big parties. But dont drink alcohol\n\nOnce the tolerance is built, it‚Äôs too late to be able to easily stop. It builds, you find ways of getting more, it builds again‚Ä¶vicious cycle\n\nI‚Äôve been on .25 for panic attacks for 3 years and haven‚Äôt gone up in my usage or script\n\nNot saying it‚Äôs healthy but it‚Äôs unfortunately only way how I can cope and hold down a job\n\nI'm in the same situation, unfortunately. Have tried every therapy and ssri under the sun. Nothing works except alprazolam.\n\nWish I could have that kind of control. I was addicted to painkillers years ago, so I can‚Äôt even take the chance.\n\nYes, it‚Äôs possible to use it responsibly. Not everyone can. I have had periods of addiction and periods of responsible use, I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôm using responsibly now. But it‚Äôs a slippery slope\n\nI mean yeah but that‚Äôs if you use it a lot. Using it as an emergency like once every couple weeks or month (how you‚Äôre supposed to use it) won‚Äôt build tolerance.\n\nCorrect, and that‚Äôs the way the drug was always intended to be used. A lot of us that were prescribed before the black box warning was issued were told it was safe to take daily. Which was a lie.\n\nYeah that‚Äôs messed up. Addiction runs in my family so I‚Äôm always very careful with it and it‚Äôs my last resort.\n\nA psychiatrist prescribed me Clonazapam 4 times a day (0.5 mg pill morning, afternoon, and 2 at night). And now I'm reading it's addictive?? I took the first one a few hours ago.\n\nYes, because it is possible to start and stop. I have had a clonezepam rx for over a decade at this point. Most times, 15 tablets will last 3 to 6 months. Some times heave lasted one month. It is entirely possible to actually take these as needed, and not abuse them.\n\nI took it as prescribed and it still ruined my life\n\nI don't think so. The people I've known to abuse benzos were trying to get messed up, not normal. When you actually have anxiety and take a benzo, there's really not much desire to abuse. I have a physical dependence on them, but I'm not an addict. I have to remind myself to take them, not because I want to, but because I've had a seizure from going cold turkey off of them.\n\nExactly. There‚Äôs millions of people that use them responsibly.\n\nYup ex benzo addict here, doctors put me on them when I was 16 and it took me 11 years to get myself in a good enough place mentally to wean myself off of them. They did work amazing for panic attacks and anxiety but I couldn't function without them so I ended up addicted to them. That was a tough one to kick especially since I still have anxiety problems.\n\nCareful with this. It doesn‚Äôt take much for your brain to link those two to mean the same thing. The only path to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is ‚Äúx‚Äù.\n\nI recently got prescribed them and wow, I get it.  It's great.  I'm just taking days off from it to stay away from any addiction.  But for gatherings or stressful days, it's perfect.\n\nSame been taking for years and still same\n\nJust gonna let you know benzo withdrawal is worse then any other drug withdrawal on planet earth so please be careful like I would would rather withdraw from opiates a million times over before have to to go through benzo withdrawals\n\nThat is the addiction‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre addicted to what you‚Äôre calling ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù It is not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and it takes more and more to feel ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù You have to heal what‚Äôs actually causing your anxiety. \n\nIt‚Äôs like if you had a sprained ankle and took painkillers to walk on it. The painkillers make it feel like everything is fine, but underneath, the injury is still there and might even get worse if not properly treated. Similarly, benzos can make you feel like your anxiety is gone, but if you‚Äôre not also working on the root causes‚Äîthrough therapy, lifestyle changes, or other coping strategies‚Äîthe anxiety will still be there, and be even harder to manage without the medication.\n\nI appreciate your dedication and you have made your point. I will be extremely careful. Thank you\n\nAsk your doctor about Gabaphentin. Legit changed my daughter‚Äôs life with the nausea and dizziness.\n\nAlso the withdrawals can be a lot worse than heroin and opium withdrawal\n\nIt depends on the person and if/how you taper. If you don't taper, you're in for a bad time. Taper too fast and it will be uncomfortable. If you taper slowly and use the Ashton manual as guidance, it should be a pretty smooth experience. I've gone cold turkey, fast tapered and slow tapered all on separate occasions and slow taper is a walk in the park compared to the rest lol.\n\nI have unintentionally gone cold turkey and never had any issues. üò¨Every practitioner cringes when I have to tell them that. Never experienced a single withdrawal symptom either. I acknowledge that I am SUPER lucky in this aspect but my drug tolerances are almost always high. So benzos are rough and I need to reset my tolerance but my anxiety is dependent on a rescue med in addition to my SSRI. If anybody has ideas, please send them on over.\n\nI had the same thing. Took benzos for months and quit and never had withdrawals. I still told my psychiatrist I had an addiction and I did abuse benzos a few times by taking too much so I guess I did have one. I still miss the instant relief they brought though and kind of regret telling them. I hope it's for the best.\n\nI've seen a few people write the same thing and heard of others being on monster doses for a long time and quitting cold turkey without issues while other people get moderate to severe withdrawals after a few weeks on doses that are small in comparison so we are just different\n\nI didn‚Äôt experience withdrawals the last time I went completely cold turkey because I took a long trip abroad and didn‚Äôt take them with me. I realized that my anxiety was mostly because of my environment. Once I got away, the anxiety stopped. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to take anything for months!\n\nThis is just me though. I‚Äôm not big into anything like cigarettes or alcohol so I can do without things unless the anxiety is so bad that it disrupts my life.\n\nThat's why I wrote can be and not is.\n\nYeah I understood you. I just expanded on it a bit\n\nI tapered over about 5 months and it was still a horrific experience.\n\n[removed]\n\nAtivan is seriously the only thing that helps me. I take it for emergencies and it‚Äôs also the only thing that helps my horrible ibs flare ups and the panic attacks that follow. My panic attacks are so bad that I pass out. I‚Äôm almost out of the small amount of pills I was prescribed 2 years ago and I‚Äôm worried. It helps my anxiety induced nausea too. I don‚Äôt feel addicted to them in any way but I‚Äôm worried about not having a safety net. I‚Äôm the type of person who feels like I need to go to the ER and like I‚Äôm dying when I‚Äôm having a panic attack. I hate it.\n\nOh man, I totally feel you on all points. I rarely take them but when I do they literally change my whole sense of reality\n\nAtivan helps me daily, I take 1/4-1/2 of 1mg pill every morning. Need to be at work by 7am\n\nHow long you been on it,any side effects,how many mg you take a day,any brain fog,or other side effects from it,I take 0.25mg or 0.5,mg every other day or 3 days,but don't think it's helping that much\n\nMe too. I take Ativan, my doctor gave me 30  1mg pills a month. I cut them in 1/4‚Äôs and take 1/4 at 3am and another 1/4 at 6am, I have bad morning anxiety. Have you be at work by 7am. Doctor said it‚Äôs ok if I take that daily since it‚Äôs a small amount. He said ‚ÄúI might be the type that needs it daily. It really helps with my morning anxiety\n\n[deleted]\n\nI get these kind of panic attacks with IBS flare ups as well! If I didn‚Äôt have Ativan I would have to go to the hospital. I‚Äôve met other people who have found the same connection as well. You‚Äôre definitely not alone.\n\nSame here! Ativan saves me a hospital trip. Maybe we can be friends and chat about it sometime.\n\nSame. I always grab some when I‚Äôm in Mexico. Not addicted but just knowing and having them available thwarts like half the attacks.\n\nIs it OTC there or something?\n\nedit: pls don‚Äôt downvote me I was just genuinely curious\n\nKinda. Some pharmacies will sell it to you even though you need a prescription. That's the best part about Mexican pharmacies, you can get anything. I got a factory sealed bottle of 90, 2mg alprazolam bars. It did cost me like $400CAD though lol\n\nJust get it prescribed lol. You're living in Canada, I've never paid for Ativan here.\n\nNo doctor in Canada is giving you 90, 2mg tablets of alprazolam unless they're a quack. I'm nearly 30 and been getting them prescribed for almost 2 decades and haven't met one doc yet who's that chill. Even my psych who would prescribe me 40mg of dexedrine per day and ambien would only give like 30 tablets of 0.5mg clonazepam or whichever benzo I wanted, a month. He said it's risky to give handfuls when the college is breathing down your neck. \n\nIf you meant just get them prescribed in general though, then yeah I do lol. It was just convenient getting a large amount of a higher dose at the time.\n\nMind sharing where? If you can remember? I only take .5 for emergencies but the doctor I was seeing who was the only person willing to prescribe it to me is not with my insurance anymore. Tragic.\n\nPlease don't by OTC in Mexico as those aren't 100% safe. I always go see a doctor (super cheap like 60$ for an appointment) and get a s ript for what I need.\n\nHow often do you take them and what do you have a prescription for? Do you take them like once a week, once a month etc? And how long have you been on them? I‚Äôm trying to take them just for emergencies or big events.\n\nIf this has been a lifetime occurrence for you, as it's been for me, it may be due to excess glutamate in the brain. Benzodiazepines enhance the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA receptors of the brain. Glutamate is responsible for \"exciting\" the brain, so to speak, whilst GABA relaxes the brain. Overactive glutamate receptors can lead to digestive problems, pain, anxiety, essential tremors, and even in some cases neurodegenerative disorders. I used to be so opposed to taking a benzo (Klonipin) long-term, but after years of being unmedicated and watching my life fall apart, I'm at peace with it now. SSRI/SNRI don't work, and that follows since they work off serotonin receptors and not GABA.\n\nPropanalol is amazing and also non-narcotic\n\nThis is the best non narcotic drug in the game, followed by gabapentin, followed by hydroxizene, which I take all 3 together.\n\nThat being said, I still take klonopin 3x a day.\n\nI mean, gabapentin can cause addiction and can make you high.\n\nYou‚Äôre not wrong. But that‚Äôs also more of a dosage thing though. I take 600 mg gabapentin 3x a day and do not get high. \n\nSomewhat like saying the propranolol is addictive because your blood pressure will rise without it. \n\nIt‚Äôs give and take. All medicines have pros and cons.\n\nI'm not hating because I used to be on pregabalin which is pretty similar to gabapentin.\n\nThe high effects can usually be felt on the first days of treatment but the anxiolytic effects don't disappear.\n\nYour analogy isn't good at all because propranolol isn't abused, doesn't have any severe withdrawals, is not addictive mentally.\n\nI'm a recovering drug addict, have many drug addicts friends and I've seen how gabapentinoids can potentially destroy lifes. Many people od'd and died by mixing pregabalin/gabapentin with other cns depressant which isn't a case with propranolol.\n\nI'm not trying to demonize gabapentin but I just want to give people  objective information about drugs.\n\nThe last thing I want to do is spread misinformation. Thank you for correcting me.\n\nPropranolol was life changing for me. Stopped almost all the physical symptoms of my anxiety over night!\n\nI really want to try it!\n\nI would absolutely recommend beta blockers - so helpful for the somatic symptoms but non addictive. Was a game changer for me, I tell everyone with anxiety everywhere I go.\n\n*but* you should be careful with beta blockers if you have asthma as one of the most common side effects is a persistent dry cough that can exacerbate asthma symptoms. and non-selective beta blockers such as propranolol and labetol should not be used *at all* you have asthma. they can tighten airways and cause severe bronchospasms while also significantly decreasing the effects of beta agonists like albuterol. so if you do have an asthma attack, the effectiveness of your rescue medication will be severely decreased.\n\nfun fact: antihistamines can actually work well for anxiety too. hydroxyzine is the most commonly used, but even plain old benadryl can reduce acute symptoms of anxiety.\n\nThank you for calling this out! In my experience a lot of my providers were not aware of the relationship between propranolol and asthma. Propranolol doesn‚Äôt cause asthma side effects for me or affect my inhaler when I need it, but I‚Äôm definitely a rare case.\n\nmy doctor wanted to prescribe it for me (knowing I have asthma) and thankfully I have been in pharmacy for a decade so I was like uhhhh no thank you\n\nI would talk to your doctor about it. It really does work (for physical symptoms) and is in no way addictive. You have nothing to lose by trying it if your main symptoms are physical (for me this is mainly heart rate, tightness in chest and stomach etc)\n\nI mean I don‚Äôt think it calms mental anxiety the way benzos do.\n\nWas going to suggest this - it usually has no side effects and can be taken regularly if needed.  Way milder but should address the same physical anxiety symptoms.  It's been a total game-changer for me!\n\nah. this is the only medication that legitimately works on my crazy anxiety as well... it's been years, every single medical professional I have seen, 4 different ones I believe (all telehealth due to location as well as worsening of condition) and due to the stigma..they just don't. instead, I'm on like, my 6th different medication that ultimately does nothing. what's the point of producing Anti-anxiety medication if it doesn't go to the actual patients who suffer FROM JUST THAT SPECIFIC ILLNESS. it's impossible. It's clear this is a problem the majority of us will have to contend with. how many have already failed?\n\nHeard. I‚Äôve tried at minimum 15 different anxiety (non-benzo) meds to help my crippling anxiety. In addition to job changes, therapy, you name it.. No help (except benzos and therapy). \n\nThen what?\n\nthey know exactly what, they simply  don't care. you are to either a. Engage in criminal acts (that give serious prison time and felonies) just to purchase the same exact RX from black market or B. Suffer until you can't take it anymore. I know far too many people that just.. bit the bullet, all because their physician didn't want to refill or perhaps even speak with them about it. shit gets too much at some point, they know this. The American medical situation has become the most disgusting greed filled career field which, as we can see now, only attracts the exact people WHO SHOULDNT be anywhere near patients and those who genuinely SUFFER and yet is the most attractive field of choice simply for the fact that regardless of what specialty practice any M.D. decides to pursue always guarantees at least a base salary of *rich as fuck* (always more than $100,000 grand, starting, but skies the limit) it is genuinely killing more Americans than War or Famine ever could hope to... let alone a first world country, which is apparently what we are...\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes exactly! Very few get the daily dose because they are scared of us getting addicted, but they are okay with us suffering immensely forever?\n\nBenzos are a nightmare - please do not go down this path. Taking them on a daily basis will downregulate your GABA receptors and cause serious brain changes. Eventually, the drug will turn on you and you‚Äôll either have to raise your dosage or taper off them. As someone currently tapering off them, it‚Äôs not worth it. I wish I never touched a benzo in the first place. I wish someone would have warned me, so I‚Äôm warning you. \n\nIt‚Äôs not about addiction, it‚Äôs about physical dependence. I didn‚Äôt abuse them, I actually took less than my prescribed amount the entire time I was taking them. There‚Äôs a good reason many doctors are no longer prescribing them for daily use. r/benzorecovery - just a sample of the horror you can look forward to if you don‚Äôt believe me. Some people get screwed after only a few weeks of daily use. Not a gamble I would take.\n\nbeen taking the gamble for years and been fine. same dose for 2 years. just one person here. but i'm saying it's possible to be ok, in spite of everything else. i don't mean to downplay anyone struggling, but it saved my life.\n\nThoughts on taking them only for emergencies - 1-2x per month?\n\nThat‚Äôs exactly how they were intended to be used. Acute panic attacks, flights, public speaking, medical procedures, etc - all fine. That is the only way doctors should be prescribing these drugs, I was just unfortunate to have a doctor that told me daily use was perfectly fine.\n\nThank you. That‚Äôs really what I‚Äôm hoping I can get them for\n\nA psychiatrist just prescribed me 0.5 mg, 4 tablets a day. I had no idea they were addictive!\n\nI was taking clonazepam for awhile. I didn‚Äôt think it was making much of a difference with my anxiety. My doctor and I agreed that I needed to taper off of it and switched me to something else. Her idea of tapering and my idea were very different and I stopped taking too much too soon. I ended up in the ER afraid of what was happening to me. My face was moving uncontrollably, I was twitching, I felt bugs crawling under my skin. At the ER they demanded I submit urine for a drug test. Thankfully my girlfriend helped me since I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to. I don‚Äôt know how one nurse figured it out, all the others thought I was having a bad trip or something. Anyway, the nurse who figured it out came and gave me a shot of something that was like pouring water slowly over my head. I felt a relief that started at the top of my head and went down to my feet. I could be normal now, control my body and expressions. I felt like me. I had to go back to tapering so it wouldn‚Äôt happen again, and do it so incredibly slowly it drove me nuts.\n\nBenzos were never meant for long term use. It was an off label prescription to go beyond I believe ten days. The drug companies knew the repercussions, but nobody reads the fine print. Avoid these if you can, they aren‚Äôt worth it.\n\nThere are plenty of people that use benzoes responsibly.\n\nNobody should be taking benzos daily. NOBODY. They simply stop working used that way, there‚Äôs no way around that. And once that happens, the problem is no longer anxiety but serious addiction.\n\nYour right! I got lucky and my doctor gave me 6 months, 30 pills in each of 1mg lorazepam (Ativan). I crack it and take it in 1/4‚Äôs every morning\n\nhey. benzos are there for a reason. i used to take them when my depression and anxiety was at its highest, but tapered off as i became more stabilized. if it helps, it fuckin helps, you know? when you‚Äôve been so desperately anxious for so long, allowing your brain that peace is not only healthy but necessary for healing. you‚Äôve got to remember what it‚Äôs like to feel normal.\n\nBruh I feel u man! It‚Äôs wild right? Ur ssri are great! I take an Ativan even at .50 feel like I can handle anything !\n\nYes exactly!!! I wish they had an extended  release form that they would push out more easily\n\nThey have benzos with longer half lives that is sort of akin to extended release. Ask your doctor about it.\n\nClonazepam is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I‚Äôve had addictions to so many benzodiazepines, Xanax, Valium, Ativan, pressed bars you name it - nothing is even close to Clonazepam. It‚Äôs the only one that doesn‚Äôt get you high, but really just eliminates anxiety for the day and lets me work and be social. \n\nEverything in moderation. It‚Äôs very easy to go off the deep end with benzos and go through withdrawals‚Ä¶ been there too many times to count. I seriously wouldn‚Äôt wish withdrawals on my worst enemy.\n\nSo true. I used to be extremely. Dependent on it now I only  take it a couple times a month for emergencies. But it really is a miracle. I always used to think I liked myself better on klonopin . More relaxed and present versus in my head thinking about how I can‚Äôt breathe etc. other meds don‚Äôt really work for me\n\nSo when you eat something that‚Äôs off, or get salmonella or norovirus etc, your stomach reacts the only way it can to get rid of it for you- vomiting (fight mode). Stomach has identified the threat, wants to keep you alive (thanks stomach!) When someone feels anxious they can feel sick because the brain tells the body to look out for threats - freeze mode (fight-flight-feeeze-fawn- one of the 4 threat responses we just never talk about it). Actively retching is more like fight mode! The stomach gets the message from the brain that there are threats about and goes into -I‚Äôm ready to be sick mode- or actively gets you to retch because it‚Äôs scared the imminent threat is going to kill you (thanks again stomach!) \n\nYou have to actively speak to the subconsious to reassure it that the situation you‚Äôre in is not going to kill you- your brain is overdoing the threat response and your body is running right along with it. Repeat that you‚Äôre safe to yourself when you‚Äôre having to do anything scary and when eating every bite. Being scared of being sick is kind of counterintuitive too, because your body is doing exactly what it can only do to keep you alive- that‚Äôs it‚Äôs sole mission. So say ‚Äòthank you body for doing these things but I don‚Äôt need you too- because we‚Äôre safe‚Äô. Helpful to identify your traumas and where they started- your brain is reacting like you‚Äôre about to get eaten by a sabre tooth tiger whilst out gathering food because it‚Äôs reaponses are v limited and rooted in evolution. Tell the brain you‚Äôre not going to die from X Y or Z and the subconsious will start to believe it.\n\nHey thats an interesting post, can you tell me more in easy words about the freeze mode? From what I've understood in your post it's the mode to \"look/scan for the threat\"? My brain often goes into freeze so I'm looking for any solution I can\n\nHave you tried hydroxyzine? They're not addictive because it's just an antihistamine and they work wonders for me. Only problem is they make me hella drowsy. Gotta cut them in half if I don't wanna take a nap ü§£ \n\n\n\nFirst time I had them I was in the ER with really bad heart palpitations (thanks prednisone) and was freaking out. They gave me some and I almost fell asleep in the waiting room haha my husband even commented that he was shocked at how happy and relaxed I was. I'm a frequent ER flyer so he's used to seeing me panic ü§£ü§£ I asked them to send me home with a prescription and got more from my primary later. Total game changer combined with my sertraline.\n\nDuddddde. Yes I got prescribed them as well and yes they work really well. But they also knocked me tf out and I woke up with the craziest dry mouth everrrr\n\nOof this is so rough. I‚Äôm sorry OP, I really empathize with you. Fellow emetophobe and nausea struggler and pretty sure my chronic stress and anxiety my whole life has given me IBS.\n\nThe brain gut connection can be so strong, I really hope it‚Äôs studied more. For me, finding the right medication was what has helped the most. SSRIs/SNRIs helped a bit, but ultimately they aren‚Äôt for me, and I‚Äôm actually on antipsychotics being used off label for anxiety and depression instead and they work way better. When I am unmedicated I basically stop eating, get severely underweight, and feel nauseous and like I‚Äôm going to pass out 24/7. Do you struggle with under or overeating at all? I also tend to walk around with my abdomen muscles super clenched, and when I relax them suddenly I‚Äôll feel a bit better.\n\nI‚Äôm wondering if there is a medication that will work even better for your anxiety which could help, or maybe an additional medication (I am not a doctor, just speculating). CBD might be worth a try? I find it helps my nausea and boosts my appetite (THC in doses that makes me high does the polar opposite and makes me feel super sick). I also find that L-Theanine works like a benzo for me, just not nearly as potent. When I am experiencing anxiety that‚Äôs not quite a panic attack I will pop one and it does help calm down my brain which in turn calms down my stomach. I also started taking magnesium glycinate daily and it helps my body feel more zen.\n\nI hope this helps! Big hugs if you want them.\n\nEdit: I also forgot to mention Propranolol! I love it, it helps a TON with physical anxiety symptoms. There‚Äôs immediate release versions you can take as needed, or extended release ones you can take every day. I was on the extended release for a long time and loved it, but it did make me pretty dizzy and lightheaded. I‚Äôm now on the immediate release as needed and it feels a lot better. Also, if you have asthma, be very careful with beta-blockers. They can cause your symptoms to be worse. I‚Äôm lucky and it doesn‚Äôt affect my lungs, but you really should be careful with it.\n\nI'm sure you take Imodium for the IBS. A 50+ year sufferer due to stress and anxiety I take 1 dose and it usually kicks in within 20 minutes.\n\nIf I have an important event I have to attend even if it's a fun event I get anticipatory anxiety. I'm a basketcase days before it but once I'm there I'm generally fine. I have to make sure I eat bland food for at least 3 or 4 days prior so my stomach has a less of a chance of bothering me. Used to have panic attacks 30-40 yrs ago but haven't had one in many years. Though I still expect them to happen. It's so fucked up.\n\nI relate to you so much! It sucks so bad and it‚Äôs something I still struggle with. Imodium has been my best friend, I always have to have it on hand. When I have a stressful event coming up like travel or an interview I take it preemptively, because without it 10/10 times I will get diarrhea and it makes life so much worse, sorry for the TMI.\n\nYea I use it before an event as well. With IBS there's always TMI. Lol. Even when I tell my wife she says you don't have to describe it. I don't. I just tell her my stomach is acting up. She's so unsympathetic.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry to hear your spouse isn‚Äôt empathetic or even sympathetic. My husband is the same way, he always thinks I‚Äôm too sensitive, too dramatic, not tough enough. We did a big trip to Disney World with his extended family 6 months ago, and the whole week I was running to the bathrooms and super anxious. I hate being away from home and changing my routine (thanks autism lol), even when I‚Äôm having fun and doing something I wanted to do. The diet change and massive increase in exercise made my stomach such a mess.\n\nHe had the nerve to tell me that I made his vacation experience less enjoyable because of it, something that I cannot control. He was also angry with his aunt because she was having stomach issues as well due to a long recovery from food poisoning and spent too much time going to bathrooms. What an asshole.\n\nIt‚Äôs part of why we are currently separated and living apart. Funny how getting away from his toxicity, my stomach has actually been a bit better! Still not 100% though, it‚Äôs so frustrating!\n\nOh wow! Thank you for all this advice! What antipsychotic are you on out of curiosity? I am on one as well but I forgot its name. You feel that the antipsychotic helps your anxiety or panic? And did you feel like it helped your nausea?\n\nBut yes I totally feel that dizzy/pass out vibe all day too. I keep losing weight too :/.\n\nYes, all the hugs ü§ó\n\n[removed]\n\nWow that is so awesome!! I really appreciate you sharing this with me. I'm so glad it's been helpful for you\n\nWhat time of day should I take my magnesium glycinate?\n\nI take it twice a day, one when I wake up and one when I‚Äôm getting ready for bed!\n\nNot the thread op but this comment was helpful and validating with my own struggles, thank you! Reading comments like these help you feel less alone in anxiety experience, it‚Äôs kind of comforting in itself knowing there are folks also going through it and the options that are out there to trial üò≠ hope all is well and thank you for the wisdom!\n\nThis makes me so happy üòä Connecting with others really does help you feel less alone! I‚Äôve been sick and tired of the usual ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in your head just get over it‚Äù reactions I‚Äôve faced in my life, as well as the toxic positivity that we aren‚Äôt supposed to feel sad and frustrated dealing with these symptoms. It really sucks, and acknowledging that is key I think, along with thinking outside the box and trying everything that might help even though it‚Äôs scary! Everybody and every body is so unique which I think is why anxiety is so frustrating. I really hope what I‚Äôve shared helps at least one person. Anxiety is such a formidable beast, it has taken me over a decade of trial and error to get where I‚Äôm at and it‚Äôs still not perfect but I‚Äôm so much better than I was.\n\nI wish you peace and hope you find something that works great for you! If you ever want to chat, I‚Äôm always open for venting or whatever might be helpful üíú\n\nThe severe nausea is the thing that makes dealing with my anxiety the worst. I have a low dose hard to refill Rx for Ativan. I totally hear you that there is something that helps but it is not the ultimate solution. Hang in there!\n\nSorry you are also dealing with this. I hope we can find something helpful soon\n\nI really appreciate that reply! :)\n\nI have 1mg Ativan, cut them in 1/4‚Äôs, have bad morning anxiety and have to be at work by 7am, take 1/4-1/2 every morning\n\nTaking a beta blocker daily has really helped me. My anxiety always showed itself very physically but I think it was because I was so sensitive to feeling even a tiny bit off, so that when I did, I would panic and it would all become sooo much worse. Worth a try?\n\nI have the same exact situation on my end as a female, same age. I take Cymbalta daily &amp; Ativan PRN. I used to be addicted to overtaking benzos and then I realized my anxiety was never going to get better if I used it as a daily routine. So now I don‚Äôt take the allotted amount unless I truly need it and can‚Äôt fight through it. Unfortunately, the only thing you can do is take control of your situation and prepare for those situations that might arise with Pepto, bags, mints, etc. I also go to individual therapy 2x per month &amp; hot yoga 3x per week. It‚Äôs not devastating to know that with some mindfulness and preparation, we can live a fairly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. Wishing you the best.\n\nThank you for sharing your journey &lt;3 I wish you all the very best\n\nAyo same medication combo.\n\nLook at us ü§ûüèΩüëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nAfter my TBI Ativan was the only thing that saved my life.  Took a few months before the doctor prescribed it and it was life changing got me back on track.  I haven‚Äôt taken it in a while but it legit reset my mind.\n\nI take .25mg every morning\n\nYea small doses can be a life saver\n\nClonoz saved my life. I developed acute panic disorder sudden onset from complex PTSD. It didn't instantly relax me like xanax or valium. It just made me feel like the faulty alarm in my brain was fixed. I've been on it 18 months and will likely be on it forever. I take it like an anti depressant and it's slow release. I've had one of the worst experiences of my life in the past year and yet I've dealt with it all far better than I would have I wasn't medicated. I basically fell desperately in love with a friend who hit on me only to find out he was a psycholigically abusive monster. I've never felt like that about anyone. I thought he was the one. And he practically destroyed me. But being on Klonoz I didn't have the extra weight of extreme of anxiety on top of the emotional pain. I've also got serious health issues I'm facing and going to hospital to screened for cancer and pain management. Before I went on Klonoz I was too phobic to even get a blood test, As long as you're responsible with benzos they can be life savers.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI totally feel the same. Been on it for a few years now. I don‚Äôt feel any kind of high, relaxation, sleepy, etc. I just feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù like you said.  I remember telling my wife when I would first try it that I just felt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Sorry I have no tips for the nausea but I wish you the best.\n\nThanks for the confirmation that I'm not alone in this, friend. Wishing you the very best.\n\nI find these comments crazy! I've been on benzos for 20+ years (more than 1 type per day).\nNever built tolerance, they always work wonders. \nIf I need some, I'll just call the clinic and they're prescribed. Maybe there's not a problem here of people abusing benzos? \nI have about 10 boxes of different benzos in my \"pharmacy drawer\". It's normal to me.\nI don't understand the hesitancy towards them... what is wrong in needing them to feel normal/good? My brain needs them, so I take them. Same as with SSRI's, on them for 20+ years. \n\nNever felt like taking more than what I need and they always work. So what if someone needs them to function? \n\nAlso, I've stopped taking them quite abruptly when I made some changes along these years and didn't notice any withdrawal symptoms. \nI really don't understand it - if someone benefits from taking them, why not just take them and keep taking them?? Chronic disease is a thing so why do people mention withdrawal as soon as the subject is benzos? Why the automatic thought of \"I'll need to stop them\"? Most probably people need to take them forever - what's wrong with that?\n\nI really don't get it, it's a different world around here I guess. Anyone cares to explain it to me? I know it's a big issue in some countries, I don't get why.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! I take Ativan small dose daily, I need to be at work by 7am and I have bad morning anxiety\n\nBenzos are not good for you long term daily usage. Just too many negative risks like Alzheimer's, congnitivec function decline, and heart issues. That being said, if it's worth the risk to enjoy the time spent before these issues POSSIBLY arise, more power to you and I think you should do what is right for you\n\nThe issue with benzos is that for most people, they build up a tolerance very quickly therefore you need more to get the same effects overtime. They are very addictive as well. Another thing is that they are dangerous. If you have sudden withdrawal, they work similarly to alcohol on the CNS, and what happens is the withdrawal can be deadly, literally. That is why they are controlled substances here in the US. It sucks because there are people who can use them sparingly as needed, and have zero issues, But unfortunately, that is not as common as the former. I can‚Äôt even get ones from my doctor so I buy them from other people unfortunately because they‚Äôre so restricted.\n\nYou might have a chronic condition that you aren't aware of. I know for myself, I was diagnosed with chronic urticaria (a long term condition that causes hives, flushing, and fatigue). I didn't know for most of my life that I had chronic urticaria. The benzos would really help with my skin flushing, and my logic was that \"I am flushing because I am nervous, and the benzos take away the nervousness and therefore the flushing\". Once I was diagnosed with chronic urticaria, I learned thar benzos help with chronic urticaria symptoms like flushing. So, my point is that you could have a chronic condition that you don't know about, and the benzos could be helping to alleviate symptoms of that condition.\n\nI do indeed have a chronic illness. I have behcets and rheumatoid arthritis and possibly histimine intolerance or mast cell disease (waiting on tests)\n\nThat makes a lot of sense now! Chronic urticaria has a lot of symptoms that are similar to MCAS, and both can cause too much histamine in the body (chronic urticaria causes too much histamine to be released by the skin). I originally thought I had MCAS but my doctor said it was chronic urticaria. Benzos are known to help with histamine issues, so that could be why you feel better when you take one. Your symptoms might not be due to anxiety, but due to your chronic illnesses. Have you tried xolair? I think that treatment for your chronic conditions can help with the issues that you are experiencing.\n\nI've dealt with the awful nausea too, the only thing that seems to work for me is Prozac\n\nMan what a coincidence, the same exact thing happened to me this week. I had Clon prescribed toe a few months ago and really only took it at night as needed. I had panic coming on the other day and took one, and immediately felt‚Ä¶ normal and healthy. It was such an amazing feeling. I just get worried that Dr.‚Äôs will refuse to prescribe it.\n\nThat is my exact same fear!\n\nTrust me, they need to stay a very occasionnal silver bullet.\n\nIf you take them daily, you'll build tolerance, and your anxious mind will learn to trigger you no matter what.\n\nProponolol works really well for physical anxiety. Please do your research but it really works for me. I'd look into natural remedies. Have you been to the doctor to see if youre deficient in anything ? Magnesium is an absolute god send. \n\nI always ask the basic questions such as do you exercise and do you eat well? It's vital that we exercise and it's vital we eat well. Food is fuel. Make sure you drink lots of water. I deal with all kinds of stomach issues from nausea to bloating. I recently heard that working out your legs releases a lot of endorphins. So going for walks uphill, jogging/running, lifting weights, of body exercises like air squats. \n\nIt's the worst and if I don't feel good in my stomach, I have trouble doing anything. Then it'll begin an awful cycle where I'll get mental anxiety from not eating, then physical anxiety from the mental anxiety combined with not eating. \n\nAnother thing that helps me is this green powder blend. I mix it with plant based protein and it's really easy to consume and get down. It gives me good, positive energy. Theres so much more you can try such as Omega 3.\n\nMake sure you write everything down. Take note of the way you feel before you do something, then take note how you feel after you do whatever it is you do.\n\nI‚Äôve never once been able to get any doctor to prescribe me even a low dose prescription of even just a handful of any benzo to use as a last resort. Or to even have just for the relief of knowing I have something available in an emergency even helps and I don‚Äôt and up taking it. Every last one has treated me like a drug addict doctor shopping for merely suggesting . even though no doctor has even prescribed them to me and I can count on 1 hand the times I have taken any in all my 50 yrs of living. \n\nYet, I had a dog that was super anxious of storms and loud noises. The vet prescribed actual Xanax, repeatedly. \nJust knowing they were there was a relief and calmed my anxiety without actually taking any.\n\nYeah that is the case with many doctors. I find that if I ask for these drugs, the doctors immediately shut down and say no but if I just explain my symptoms and panic attacks they will give them to me\n\nMirtazapine helped my anxiety induced nausea a lot, it almost went away completely. It's a strong antiemetic\n\nUnfortunatly I‚Äôm in the same boat and have to do the same as you with my lorazepam‚Ä¶\n\nDon‚Äôt ever take that pill . It will destroy your life . I took it for 6+ yrs and it took a hell out of me to come out of it . It took 2 full years to get through withdrawal symptoms. Doctors won‚Äôt admit your symptoms and they will think you are mad but trust me it induces symptoms which are above and beyond the realm of medicine functions. It‚Äôs a good drug to suppress anxiety neurosis but it‚Äôs not a cure .\n\nI have what you‚Äôre talking about, but replace nausea with being light headed. For years I tried everything, and there are 2 things I can recommend you try. \n\nFirst: don‚Äôt dismiss breathing exercises. They 100% work. I did only this for years. \n\nSecond: Buspar. Ask your doc about it. It‚Äôs the first medicine that actual did something (long term) and it seems the side effects are almost non-existent. I can‚Äôt explain what it does though, it just seems to make everything a ‚Äúlittle better‚Äù. A shitload of my daily stress is just gone.\n\nBy far the best anxiety pill I have taken. It calms me down to a great extent.\n\nI‚Äôm scared of benzo addiction too, but I keep lorazepam (Ativan) or diazepam (Valium) on hand for emergencies. I take mirtazapine (Remeron) daily and it keeps the anxiety and panic at a tolerable level, for the most part, but there are certain situations that the mirtazapine just doesn‚Äôt touch. Driving in big city traffic is a big panic attack inducer for me; socializing with a group of people I don‚Äôt know very well is another. Certain types of doctor appointments, having to give a presentation/speak publicly, attending loud, crowded, overstimulating events like festivals or tourist attractions‚Ä¶ these are situations where I know I will need prescription assistance if I‚Äôm going to make it through. I often go weeks between taking a dose, because these types of situations aren‚Äôt terribly frequent for me. The most consistently I took benzos was a period of time when I was having panic attacks at bedtime or in my sleep. My psychiatrist had me take a low dose on evenings when I could feel the anxiety ramping up. I also took them while I was in a community theater play. I took it a few days a week for a couple of months. I was a little worried that I might develop an addiction in both of those situations, but I quit taking them without any problems, maybe because it was such a small amount. \n\nI will say, though, I‚Äôve never taken more than prescribed in case I like it too much! üòÖ\n\nI felt the same after taking an ativan. Wanted to cry at how normal I felt.\n\nI remember taking my Ativan for the first time and wanting to cry because I was like, ‚Äúdamn, is this what normal people feel like?‚Äù Of course, I only take them when I absolutely need them because I don‚Äôt want to lose my access to such a wonderful thing, so about 10 will last me three months. It‚Äôs crazy how anxiety just becomes a part of us\n\nI just want to say, the baseline for nausea in the majority of people is zero.\n\nMy problem is nothing like yours, but on some days when my sciatic pain is not flaring up, I feel just about euphoric. I guess it's kind of like that. Part of it is waiting for the other shoe to drop but most of it's lovely.\n\nHonestly I would love to try this but scared of getting addicted to it.\n\nslightly unrelated, but for some reason when I started taking magnesium, my anxiety almost completely disappeared. I became almost manic because I got SO excited about not being so anxious anymore. And then for some reason it stopped working, but it was nice for like 2 weeks!\n\n\nI still recommend magnesium for anxiety. It definitely helps (and is more healthy)\n\nClonazepam was one of the few meds that ever helped my anxiety, and it does also help with nausea, regardless of the cause.  I have a condition that causes nausea as the primary symptom and it is known to help for that.  Usually I take Gravol for it, heat on the stomach also helps so hot drinks/soups, hot baths, heating pads etc.\n\n¬†How much of my daily chronic and fairly severe nausea is \"just\" my anxiety ==&gt; 98%\n\nSamesies. I love it /s\n\nI used to have terrible nausea and IBS for years.  \nEventually i outgrowed it, and now my anxiety shows itself mostly with vertigo and feelings of passing out.\n\nBoth sucks very much.\n\nClonazepam makes me sleepy. But man it really makes things better\n\nI take Lorazepam (Ativan) every morning. Doctor gave me 1mg tablets, but I crack them in half and take it every day. I have real bad anxiety in mornings\n\nI take lorazepam (Ativan) every morning, but crack the 1mg pill in 1/4‚Äôs and if I wake with anxiety at4am I take 1/4, and take another 1/4 at 6am if still have bad anxiety. I need to be at work by 7am\n\n[removed]\n\nGlad it works for you so we'll too :)\n\nThe question I was asking myself the other day was ‚Äúhow can I have the clonazepam feeling without the clonazepam?‚Äù I know it‚Äôs probably not doable.\n\nExactly!!! Like just let me feel normal. I don't want anything crazy.\n..just normality\n\nI take a tricyclic antidepressant called amitriptyline for anxiety, IBSD and insomnia. It's also commonly prescribed for other things like migraines, cyclic vomiting syndrome, neuropathy, etc. I used to deal with a lot of emetophobia (fear of vomiting) but since being on ami I don't get that nauseous feeling all the time anymore. Still happens occasionally due to my chronic reflux and post nasal drip but it's definitely decreased. Ami does cause drowsiness so it's usually taken at bedtime but at a low dose I imagine the drowsiness might be similar to that of a benzo.\n\nInteresting. I was on that for my migraines a while ago. Maybe I'll talk to my doc about getting on it again\n\nUnfortunately, you feel normal until you don‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs  even more devastating. Because you are left with 10 times the initial anxiety plus an addiction. And the withdrawal symptoms are so bad. I would advise you to do The Work (by Byron Katie). If you are religious you find feel scared to do it but if you just use it as a tool, you might start feeling less anxious.\n\nI have exhausted a lot of alternative options when it comes to physical anxiety symptoms. EMDR therapy, exercise, group therapy, meditation, changing my eating, cutting out certain foods and caffeine, Lexapro, etc the list goes on. \n\nUnfortunately, it just depends on the persons threshold.\nBenzos have always been the only thing that have helped me feel literally normal when it comes to physical anxiety. I experience loose bowls, nausea, sweating, trembling, shaking, panic, back pain, joint pain. Like my body freezes up when I‚Äôm stressed and anxious. Benzos take all that away üòî\n\nYes I'm exactly the same. The consequences of being animals in a world of technology I suppose\n\nI think Benzos can be useful in extreme moderation. I take .5mg (sometimes I‚Äôll cut it in half and just take .25) every month or so and it can be a lifesaver. But it‚Äôs important not to take them often and to stay at a lower dose. Keep trying to find other alternatives and use them as an emergency. But I find that even knowing I have the benzos is enough to calm my anxiety down.\n\nThere are countless stories about benzo addictions and horror stories. I will be one of a few but I have used klonopin on a daily for probably a decade at this point and have only went up by .25 mg in that time. I still get relief from anxiety when I use it, have stopped cold turkey plenty of times and have never felt the need to go any higher.\n\nIt helps a ton with functioning in social events and dealing with general anxiety. I also use CBD, which I‚Äôm hoping will replace it but I use both when I feel the need.\n\nThis is what happened to me 5 years ago, 6 overdoses, at least 20 excruciating withdrawal periods, a rehab visit, 3 break ups, 4 arrests, years of depression later, I am finally 57 days clean. Don‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs a slippery slope.\n\nI'll be ok, but I appreciate your concern. I've been prescribed this for several years now...I just rarely take it. When I do take it, it's just such a calming feeling..but, even today I feel a bit hungover\n\nI had the same reaction with Ativan. I‚Äôm on Effexor all the time and that‚Äôs helping, I use the Ativan to help my brain see that these situations that made me so frozen and mad are actually normal and I‚Äôve been able to approach them without it. If you journal it helps, before and after the event, then try to wait longer before taking it next time. \n\nThat‚Äôs what my doc has me doing anyway, and I‚Äôve gone from 3x/week (low dose) usage to once a month or less.\n\nI've been on several anxiety medications over my years, but oddly enough when I was diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago, the medications I was prescribed (Adderall and then Vyvanse later), it got rid of my anxiety entirely\n\nHow do you feel when your adhd meds start to wear off? Do you have any rebound anxiety?\n\nX medication has been a game changer for me.\n\nI find weed helps sometimes‚Ä¶but not always. \n\nSometimes I take too big of a hit and cough up a lung and eventually whatever was left in my stomach at the time. \n\nI recently read that smelling isopropyl alcohol helps to.\n\nHere in Spain there is a medication called motilium which is anti nausea. This has worked for me with my anxiety nausea. Only thing is you can't take them more than 4/5 days in a row.\n\nI have the same issue. I‚Äôm only taking Domion atm but man I wish I didn‚Äôt have the nausea and anxiety for like 15 years of my life. It was so debilitating (and still is, it just happens less often nowadays).\n\nUse this as something to aim for. You know taking benzos daily isn‚Äôt a solution but use it as a benchmark for how you want to feel with non addictive meds and therapy.\n\nMy dr told me Benzodiazepines should never be taken more than 2 weeks. That being said I‚Äôve been on Rivitril for 6 years but down from 1 mg 3 times a day to.5 once a day. Hope to be done with the in time. üá®üá¶\n\nHe's mostly right. Unless you are catatonic or deeply paranoid schizophrenic. But that's with daily usage, not for occasional usage\n\nYou sound like me. But I‚Äôm 72, I have just gone from type 2 to type 1 diabetes so now on insulin‚Äîsince I had Covid. I also have ibsd. My digestive issues are helped with Imodium. Recently I have been nauseous while pooing. \n\nI love Xanax. I feel better in digestion and sleep better. But it is addictive so I only take 1-2 times a week.\n\nWow, honestly that's inspiring a bit. I've been struggling with a lot of similar issues but I have ibs mixed and an autoimmune disease that blinded me a few years ago. It's been very hard to keep going.\n\nClonazepam is the only thing that helps me too. If you haven‚Äôt tried it yet, propranolol could be something to test out for physical anxiety symptoms it‚Äôs a lot safer. \n\nI was prescribed it when my mom died and I couldn‚Äôt eat, sleep or stop crying for months. Literally could not function they gave me every other medication that was not a benzo available at the highest dose. I‚Äôve always had panic disorder and once it kicks in, my house could be on fire and I‚Äôd just think ‚Äúmeh whatever‚Äù. Truly the only thing that kept me alive. I‚Äôm still struggling with panic attacks and insomnia over a year later and I hope I don‚Äôt have to depend on this med forever‚Ä¶\n\nDon't be upset when the medication does what it's supposed to do.\n\nWhat dose did you take\n\nAdhd more than anxiety but that's how I'm feeling rn about medication, like what if it just fixes me? I dont want to be dependant on some drug that might stop working for no reason in the future\n\nthey‚Äôve saved my life. and i am not addicted to them. but i don‚Äôt take them more than needed. i keep a personal goal to take less whenever possible - bc my goal is to lessen my anxiety not mask it for life with pills.\n\nthe pills are an incredibly important tool. they saved me from high risk suicide.\n\nI am also a very nauseous person. I have OCD and emetophobia, giving severe panic attacks. I have found that an SSRI and a mood stabilizer are the best at controlling my nausea. Mood stabilizers can help a LOT with anxiety!\n\nI also use Zofran for nausea\nHydroxizine for lesser anxiety\nAtivan for severe anxiety (maybe a few times a year)\n\nOh wow a mood stabilizer? I think I'm on one...or I am prescribed one that I have been scared to take. It's vraylar I think\n\nIt's probably due to Gaba. Same reason many find same relief from drnking alcohol (problem is, it backfires and makes things worse).\n\nCheck the below link out. I think the ultimate goal is to work on the microbiome. L. Rhamnosis is shown in mice studies to have an impact on stress/anxiety but there are others. Lifeway and Giant organic keffir both have this strain. You could try doing an experiment for a weak or so, I'd suggest daily consumption as many meals as possible, just have a small glass. Plus the extra protein could help anxiety too.\n\nI used to be in peak shape when I was doing a lot of keffir, hard to know if that's why but it's been on my radar.\n\nPs. Fibers and vegetables and such can't be discounted. Probiotics have such an impact that they are linked to weight gain. Years and years back it was probably mostly thought simply by regulation insulin or keeping you full, and while these help things, the fiber has a profound effect on our microbiome. There are so many chemical compounds both good and bad these bacteria can produce and they play a crucial in health of both mental and physical.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240605162519.htm#:~:text=When%20someone%20eats%20a%20poor,eat%2C%20and%20how%20we%20feel.\n\nI know that feeling well. And once you realize how great benzos work, it becomes very difficult not to take them for any situation that may cause anxiety. I ended up relying on them anytime I wanted to do anything social and whenever I drove. I took them everyday for work for years (at a very low dose). \n\nNow, I take them very sparingly but I believe they caused permanent damage to my memory. I can  barely remember anything that happened a week ago. I watch movies over and over again and don‚Äôt remember anything that happens in them. I have trouble recalling words and names. \n\nNot trying to scare you! I am not against taking benzos by any means. Just be sure you don‚Äôt get to a point where you find yourself using them as a crutch multiple times a week for long periods of time.\n\nNot an expert on anxiety but maybe ask yourself. Was there a time in your life when you felt normal? What was different? I noticed that social isolation and lack of purpose bring severe anxiety in me. You might have different causes, but they must be there. Hope you feel better soon"

If you don‚Äôt have the resources, mentally or materially, take care of yourself first obviously. But you can also channel your anger and anxiety into action.\n\nHowso\n\nOrganize locally is a good start.\n\nSee thats the problem. You are still in the fight. You think its a fight, a war. And you want to be in that mindset for 4 more years? How long will you keep that up? It doesnt always go your way. Exist outside of this. Thats all im saying.\n\nYour approach is one option. Mine is another. I‚Äôm not advocating for my approach, just offering it as an alternative. We all have to do what we can live with at the end of the day. I respect your approach and wish you the best.\n\nVery good point, but you can also engage in things that'll help a better future, as long as you just do the action without paying mind to everything everyone is saying about it.\n\n1000%\nAlready deactivated everything.  \nChoose peace of mind always. Protect yourself.\n\nExcept Reddit! üòÇ\n\nFiltered political posts\n\nHow do you do that?\n\nCan only do it on the website. They remove the ability to do it on mobile for whatever reason\n\nSaaaame.\n\nI'm restricting my news consumption and social media usage for a while until it blows over. But I won't completely stop.\n\nAbsolutely! There‚Äôs loads of communities on here I follow that are unrelated to politics. I just left a bunch of subs for a while so my homepage is filled up with hobby stuff and other similar things.\n\nI deactivated my instagram account this morning and deleted the app from my phone. Deleted Facebook app from my phone years ago but do login on safari to check stuff here and there.\n\nKeep it restricted forever.\nNews is a horrific propaganda machine that thrives off instilling fear.\n\nI removed all news apps from my phone last night, check. It's not anxiety I experience over the recent events... But just to help keep my personal energy space free of unnecessary bad energy which then helps me from contributing to the bad energy\n\nYes !! Let‚Äôs all take care of ourselves and rest to heal. Sending all the peace and love.\n\nI already have not been using 99% of social\n\nI left Facebook a few years ago and feel like my mental health improved drastically\n\nReddit is the only one I have. It's probably killing me mentally but idk what else to do with myself. All I ever feel like doing is scrolling these days.\n\nReddit is just as bad as any other social media, especially right now, possibly worse. Remember social media is a place for people to get things out quickly. There's going to be a ton of hyperbole right now and probably for a while. Instant news is a good thing, but it's dangerous and centers around engagement now. What drives engagement? Hyperbole, outrage, and fear. Try your best to remember that.\n\nYeah whoever is designing these algorithms need to take responsibility for the mental health of well.. everyone lol. The fact that you can‚Äôt  have the comments disappear on YouTube for example seems intentional &amp; frankly wrong...\n\nI do my best to filter out politics. My reddit feed is all video games, comedy, and cats. But obviously you can only filter so much. Stuff will make it through. But if I deleted reddit I really don't know what I would do with myself. I have so much free time at work I use it to scroll. And then I don't really have any hobbies so after work I scroll more.\n\n Yeah, same on my home feed, but that \"all\" button is right there lol. It's been fine for the most part lately, but now it's just going to be a shitshow. My home feed is luckily all pretty heavily filtered into my interests and the subs do a good job of not allowing politics in them.\n\nFacebook is the absolute worst today. Most of my liberal friends are fine, and they're pissed/worried, but not being extreme about things. My conservative friends though.... it's so weird, they won, but it's like their only goal now is to make things as uncomfortable as possible for the liberals on their feed.\n\nI ran into this too. Was outside putting my kid in the car to go to school and a neighbor was outside and actually called out to me to gloat. I've only ever exchanged hellos with this man and he went out of his way to be rude to me. And they wonder why they're called garbage.\n\nTo be fair, Reddit is by far the most customizable of the major social media platforms. If I wanna tune out politics, I can just unjoin some subs. With other social media platforms, the algorithm will show it to you no matter what.\n\nHave you considered exercise or hobbies?\n\nIve felt like that. I've had to replace sometime that is hurting me with something that will hurt me less. Like social media with a stupid game. I started playing Pokemon go and doing sudokus and listening to cozy happy stories.\n\nPeople ever think to themselves that media in general is what causes the anxiety, division, hate, etc? Quit believing everything the media puts out. Especially social media which is even more Wild West\n\nEven from Canada it's feeling grim to those of us who have empathy or directly affected by empathy. In moments like this it's hard for me to separate genuine feelings of sadness and worry that are justified and ones that are anxiety-condition driven. It's OK to sometimes just feel sad and worried.\n\nBut at the end of the day - you're not alone. Take comfort in that and support each other.\n\nI‚Äôve been off it for almost 18 months now . I don‚Äôt miss it . I gain nothing from it .\n\nI done this about 2-3 years ago and its good for your social anxiety etc but its strange because you live in a world with no social media stress but everyone around you is experiencing the social media stress its weird lol\n\nWell I did not deactivated but I uninstalled insta and facebook. I don't use facebook anyways, never posted anything there. I occasionally post selfies on insta. Rn I am just watching Gilmore girls in my free time and playing stardew valley.\n\nQuitting social media was the best thing that had happened to me\n\nDisconnecting is the best thing you can do.\n\nThe election results have actually helped my anxiety quite a lot. I'm assuming that's what you're referring to. I'm trying not to spend much time on reddit or FB though, still.\n\n&gt;The election results have actually helped my anxiety quite a lot\n\nHere, too. Nearly had one, but my brain was occupied with the \"Burning Desires\" brainrot instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlad to not fear Brownshirts busting my door down.\n\nSpent all morning doing just that! Even thinking of dropping cable and just picking shows on apps so I am not even exposed to so much political stuff and talking heads. Not to say being engaged in politics is not important, but I‚Äôve chosen the same side for decades so why am I even watching? It‚Äôs the people that sit out elections or call it all ‚Äúfake news ‚Äú that really need more information anyway.\n\nI did this many years ago and signed up for Philo, there are absolutely no news stations, local channels, or sports and it‚Äôs been helpful to not be able to see local and national news during stressful times.\n\nI snoozed a ton of people on FB for 30 days for my sanity.\n\n[removed]\n\nI've done it for weeks, and it's liberating.\n\nNo?\n\nI would quit, but I don‚Äôt really have a big friend group so I feel like it‚Äôs my connection to the outside world. I feel isolated without it.\n\nQuit Facebook in 2020.\n   \nMight quit other places.\n   \nDon't use Twitter.\n\nIt's why I'm looking over my subreddits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't need to see people crying over results.\n\nGet off social media, and try to tune yourself to what actual reality around you is life, rather then just a projection that social media puts onto it.\n\n\nIs everything currently around you in your real physical world completely awful? Most likely not even if the current events and the social media reactions make it feel that way.\n\nNah, I actually enjoy fb bc I follow other things like aviation pages and music.  Plus, I get some daily laughs from what other folks posts.\n\nI'm gonna continue to live my life exactly how I'm doing it right now.   I already don't follow politics and this gives me a reason to not follow it even more.\n\nI would love to, but my ADHD draws me in the with the stimulation of arguing with people on the internet, even though I'm sensitive and can't take people coming at me.\n\nNo social media (except Reddit)‚Ä¶no more watching the news‚Ä¶.living life‚Ä¶.\n\nFor the next four years actually\n\nYeah I gave myself until inauguration to slowly wean off, but the inauguration is a hard limit and I will be trying my hardest to be one of those blissfully ignorant and unaware people out there. I have lots of hobbies but spend more time scrolling than I do on them most days, and I want to fix that.\n\nNo I just shut it down now fuck it\n\nreal.\n\nYeah I think it‚Äôs for the best. I deleted Twitter off my phone and I‚Äôm just gonna stick to a few subreddits. I‚Äôll just work and play dragon age.\n\nGoing to do my best. I've restricted my news and Twitter consumption before - sometimes with software on my phone - and every single time it's been the right decision and has improved my life. \n\nIt would be best if there was a more permanent solution, but it is really, really hard to get offline and stay offline for a long period of time.\n\nNothing is going to happen you will be okay\n\nvery tempted to\n\nI've already cried and ready to drink a bottle of wine when I get off work.\n\nI am.  I put all my social media except for Reddit in a folder called ‚Äúapp jail‚Äù on my phone.  Gave my phone number to the few people I talk to frequently on there.  The older I get, the more tired I grow of people\n\nIs Reddit your weakness? lol\n\nReddit does have a lot cat videos so I‚Äôm trying to stick that for now lol\n\nI'm so depressed and anxious right now. What a terrible way to wake up. I'm probably gonna delete Twitter and reddit for a while\n\nNope\n\nI‚Äôm going to greatly reduce my time. Going to more carefully curate the content I consume and going through my follows list and doing a purge.\n\nYes, and the news channels. I‚Äôll stick to PBS News Hour or BBC News.\n\nI'm gonna have to. It wrecks my mental health\n\nI‚Äôm muting or unfriending anyone who doesn‚Äôt bring me value in my life. Cutting out toxic people is liberating. I already left a group chat I was in for over 12 years. Never been more at peace.\n\n[removed]\n\nThis content has been removed.

My brain thinks I had all the fruits of being alive but sadly just an illusion. Rewards don't exist just the illusion.\n\nI'm getting off social media. It will be hard because internet has given me the feelings and anxiety prevents me from making them in real life. So I imagine the withdraw will be very lonely for some time.\n\nI wish you luck! I think it's the right choice.\n\nYep. Limiting social media and going out with my dogs. Cya lol.\n\nHonestly, same. A break from all the noise sounds pretty good right now‚Äîthings are way too intense out here lately!\n\nI really wish I could. I manage my company‚Äôs social media channels though so I can‚Äôt completely avoid it.\n\nYeah. I just can't anymore for a while. \n\nI've been whittling down subs today because I love Reddit but I need to decompress from this disaster. I keep seeing \"Reddit is an echo chamber\" and I'm \"just seeing what I want to see\" and that makes me feel terrible because....isn't peace what we all want??!! FFS. I just can't. \n\nSo I figure, what a better time to focus on myself? \n\nI bought some walking shoes and I'm just gonna go out and walk until I'm so tired I can't think about any of this crap.\n\ni surely am.\n\nMan I got off all socials a year ago and my mental health improved exponentially.\n\nOnce I stopped comparing myself to others I felt like a weight was lifted, and in that space I had room to heal. \n\nIf you need to stay in touch with friends/family, you don't need to delete everything. Just remove the apps and see how you go. \n\nIt really is a fantastic feeling. \n\nAnd, if you still want that \"social media\" fix without seeing everyone you know at a party you weren't invited to (ü•≤) just do what I do and find places right here on reddit that you enjoy. I've found chatting with strangers who share similar stories is much more fulfilling than envying people you personally know. \n\nHope that helps (lol, probably not)\n\nSeek fulfilment, don't chase \"happiness\" ....Much love to you beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI have pretty much left social media except reddit.\nIt has helped me stay sane.\nWe have enough reasons to be anxious about, don't need a few extra for no reason at all.\n\nI need to but I'm mad as hell and need to kick a few people who deserve it still.\n\nI did, everything gone. So much better\n\nyes me! well, not reddit but more the other apps with addicting algos like tiktok. The only problem is that i don't have much energy for anything else.\n\nYes 100000% I need a break\n\nNot really. It‚Äôs kind of therapeutic for me to read the post election autopsies. I am not bummed  out about the outcome as much as I fear the chaos, repression, and absolute regression of the nation‚Äôs domestic and foreign policies in the next 4 years.\n\nGet off social media and document it all on Reddit\n\nI doom scrolled all day Tuesday and felt awful. Even just opening the apps was making me anxious. I finally logged out and just gonna take a breather.\n\nWhat has helped during the depths of Covid and in times like this is to disconnect and hyper focus all around you. Yesterday I went walking around my city and everyone was just the same as ever. now im in Canada but i assume life goes on normally around you.\n\nI have that on my list‚Ä¶‚Ä¶struggling to delete all the apps‚Ä¶\n\nI been thinking about it-my anxiety has gotten really bad¬†\n\nI haven't used social media or watched the news in years, best decision ever\n\nYes, I've deleted facebook and have been going back and forth between uninstalling and then re-installing tiktok when I get super bored. ü§£ those two are the worst, Instagram and reddit doesn't bother me so bad cause it's easier to control what ends up on your radar and what doesn't. I also had 2 other traumatic things happen to me in the 2-3 days after the election and even tho they're completely non-related its made it alot easier for me to get alot more upset and angry about it all. But yes please delete whatever apps you end up the most upset on and stick to it even if you get real bored. ü§£\n\nIm just curious with extremity of everything incoming is there really no way to stop it all/does anyone expect any kind of refute to all this?\n\nDeactivated everything as soon as I woke up.\n\nNope‚Ä¶ why would I miss the endless entertainment\n\nyea i recommend deactivating, especially apps like twitter. prioritize ur mental health :)\n\ni've been off twitter and instagram for the last week or two but now this place is bad so i might be off all of it for a while\n\nNot everything, but I deactivated Twitter.\n\nGuys I wanna ask smth, what wud u wish to be the counter app of social media apps\n\nNature\n\nAbsolutely. I did check Instagram because I building up the fear of checking in my head a LOT. It was fine, but I'll be taking some time off. It's too much.\n\nI did. I took a break from twitter and facebook and I‚Äôll be honest it‚Äôs been nice but wow I was addicted because I‚Äôm like itching to check twitter.\n\nIronically, Twitter is one of the biggest sources of negativity we get.\n\nI‚Äôm still with Reddit because I love the video game threads lol\n\nBest thing I ever did\n\nI‚Äôm getting rid of all negative stuff and people in my social media and filling it with hobby accounts, dog accounts, etc.\n\nI‚Äôm leaving subs as we speak. I feel like I need to be engaged and everything. I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm mentally able to handle it right now. Deleted TikTok completely, have no other social medias except Reddit. For now, I‚Äôm purposely curating my feed to be zero politics for a while\n\nYea... I was looking how to block certain content from Reddit today... should just get off Reddit.  Didn't see anything other than leaving/muting channels. Maybe I will go for all cat channels or something.\n\nYup. Deactivated twitter last night\n\nYep. I have a few subreddits I would like to stay connected to, but besides that just going to focus on my own little world for a while.\n\nDeleted Twitter a few weeks back. Deleted Threads today. Also unsubscribed to News and Politics this morning. Feels good.\n\nBest thing we can do is keep going. Live your life. Support small businesses and your community. Vote in the midterm elections. Be wary of finances in case these tariffs cause increased prices. Stop giving billionaires like Elon Musk your time and money.\n\nYesss. I have a new phone coming tomorrow, and I'm not downloading reddit or Facebook. Those are the two I use. It's just not healthy for my brain to be consuming all this info by scrolling. I don't have the self-control to delete today. Lol\n\nAnd it's not just the election, it's EVERYTHING.  good luck!!\n\nTry not to build your comfort in echo chamber next time\n\nNo. If I was going to get off it the time was before the election when it was real ugly. Now the positive begins.\n\nI wanna be on whatever social media sites you're on lol\n\nYep! Even Reddit. Im going to try and unplug for at least a week starting today\n\nI need a break for my mental health tbh\n\nMe\n\nYes.\n\nI‚Äôm definitely considering it. Just to decompress for a bit.\n\nYep! I‚Äôve pretty much deleted everything besides Reddit and Snapchat because I was up all night sick. Mostly just using Reddit for gaming, and Snapchat to talk to friends. Sending love to everyone ü´∂üèº\n\nWe get polluted and filled with so much toxicity.\n\nIm actually thinking of it, but idk what I'll be doing without social media tbh\n\nYup,\n\nDeactivated this morning... gonna stay off it for a while\n\nYeah I‚Äôm taking this as a sign to scroll less and read more books.¬†\n\nYes, I was up all night and I just cant see the unfolding of it all.\n\nI bought a tarp. Im gonna make a teepee in the forest and live there for a couple of weeks\n\nYou're creating a spiritual retreat lol\n\nYeap. I can't get anywhere or do anything without hearing about it. My umbrella is open wide, and I'm just trying to avoid the shit storm. Unfortunately I seem to always have to say that it wouldn't have mattered what the outcome, I would still have my umbrella open and just trying to get through the next several weeks and possibly months. The unfortunate state of affairs at election time but obviously worse in this past decade. I've got my personal plate full with enough stress and chaos, I don't need to hear about this... and yet my feed is chock full. üòû so yes I'll be hiding from most social media because it's being discussed on nearly every section of it, including here..\n\nI‚Äôm only listening to Spotify and playing games on my phone for a while. üëã\n\nI‚Äôve been off for a while‚Ä¶ so yeah. Time to come back üòπ\n\nwelcome back! Also happy cake day\n\nReddit‚Äôs giving me the spark I lost along the way. I‚Äôm grateful for that at least.\n\nI‚Äôm so happy, Reddit is not indicative of the real world.\n\nYep, but I mostly already am disconnected from socials lately.\n\nYep!\n\nYes. Reddit is all I really use, but today I have been going only to specific subs that are hobby related, no 'Home' or front pages. I'll probably stay away from my parents' house too where news is on all the time and avoid my mother who is not reacting well to the whole thing. I went for an hour long walk this morning and I've got a lot of work to do right now so that helps.\n\nI'm keeping in mind this quote from 2016 from Justin McElroy:\n\n&gt;I'm gonna wake up and keep trying to do good and so are you and nobody gets to vote on that.\n\nI live in a very red area and so I'm just feeling pretty alone right now. Time to circle the wagons and take care of my own.\n\nWould love to if I weren‚Äôt so addicted ‚òπÔ∏è\n\nDeactivated twitter/x today. Might delete reddit next.\n\nDeleting news apps and trying to resist the impulse to go on socials.  Also bringing meditation back in to the mix.  We‚Äôll be swimming against the current for a while‚Ä¶sigh\n\nNot really I‚Äôll just try and skip the things that don‚Äôt interest me (which is the entirety of the politic situation going on right now)\n\nBesides all I have is YouTube, Reddit and Insta, my insta feed is full of funny videos, childhood nostalgia videos or food and all I use it for is to text my bestie or stalk people legally, Reddit has all the shit going on and so far YouTube hasn‚Äôt gotten political that much. I never watch the news or anything and I‚Äôd say i‚Äôm already off my phone a good amount\n\nDeleted it this morning.\n\nYep. Making my world very small right now.\n\nYep! Lol\n\nI feel like this \"a while\" is going to be about 4 years and change.  The news is going to get crazy depressing.  I've never seen a better time to disconnect from modern society than right now.\n\nYes. I will have to\n\nMe!!! Except Reddit of course. And I‚Äôm going to try my best to buy way less of anything.\n\nYes\n\n‚ÄúI reduce what I know feels harmful to me. I don‚Äôt consume reels, stories etc. I have political filters all over Reddit for all politics (nobody can behave themselves on the supply and filtering of the content so the whole thing is gone for me) and generally speaking I‚Äôm avoiding comment sections for posts that aren‚Äôt for comments (I.e vids etc).\n\nI need to learn to appreciate my opinion over others.\n\nDefinitely debating it, I'm trying just avoiding all the negative stuff but with recent events I feel like that won't be very possible so I might have to :( it's a shame no space is really safe from all the negative/scary/overly political things.\n\nReal. Esp Twitter. I‚Äôm just gonna play sims üò≠\n\nI definitely want to just shut off social media for the next four years‚Ä¶. Preferably don‚Äôt even go outside‚Ä¶ ideally not leave my bed.\n\nThats what im doing. Shut everything down for awhile and work on things ive been putting off. If dumb assholes can reach for the stars.....¬†\n\nYep. Unfollowed all political/news people over in Threads. Left all political/news subreddits\n\nI recommend you do the same for your mental well being\n\nYup\n\nDeleted Twitter immediately.\n\nYep.  I deactivated my FB and Insta. This will be next\n\nI deleted my Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter today.  Just need a break from those for a while.\n\nThe worst is yet to come! Deactivate won‚Äôt help\n\nYesterday hit me like a truck, goddamn. I just want to feel like I have a future again, like I'm not just some trash blowing in the wind l, like I'm cared for from actual decent humans.\n\nI feel so disposable, I feel so expendable.\n\nAfter tonight, tiktok and Reddit go for a bit. I deleted my Facebook today. Gotta focus on my mental health and this stuff today and really put a damper on it bad.\n\nI deleted Twitter cause i can live without my history accounts and WW2 photos for a while, but im keeping insta and Discord to keep in contact with my friends around the US.\n\nIm glad my uncle gave me like 60 Star Wars novels, so I've got some good stuff to read for the next 4 years while i shut myself off from most of the world.\n\nYes. It‚Äôs just too much. I don‚Äôt want to listen to the news in the car either."

Basically as he was wrapping up he asked me ‚Äúwhat is the true reason you came in today‚Äù and I replied with to make sure there isn‚Äôt anything wrong. He replied with ‚Äúthere is something wrong‚Äù. I said that I meant something physically wrong and that I wasn‚Äôt dying. He said ‚ÄúYou are dying, there is something physically wrong with you, anxiety isn‚Äôt just a mental disorder, it‚Äôs very physical. You‚Äôre dying because this is no way to live your life.‚Äù A bit harsh but he seemed to be the type that tells you like it is and this did help me and made me realize that he‚Äôs right, this isn‚Äôt any way to live and worrying about dying and illnesses isn‚Äôt living. I hope this can help someone out there!",

    "all_comment_text": "Anxiety &gt; Stress &gt; Inflammation is the number 1 killer because it leads to most of the number one killer diseases.\n\nEDIT:  This process happens over decades.  Not weeks.  I am 50.  I am just now staring to see the ramifications of uncontrolled anxiety on my body, for the last 30 years.  This is a positive, uplifting message.  Make an effort to calm your system from inside and out.  The body is very forgiving.  But when you hit 65 you will either be debilitated or vibrant.  This will likely be the deciding factor.\n\nThis gives me anxiety\n\nRight?!?!\n\nYup. I stopped inhaling while I was reading üò≠\n\nI don‚Äôt know about you all, but you know what would greatly reduce my stress and anxiety? More money.\n\nMoney would genuinely solve so many of my issues.\n\nMy anxiety after reading the post and this comment üìàüìàüìà\n\nUnfortunately I think this is very true, although for most things it would take a very very long time for the anxiety to cause them. Thankfully all my blood work and stuff is all good and the doctor didn‚Äôt seem the least bit concerned about my physical well being (not because he didn‚Äôt care but because he didn‚Äôt see anything wrong)\n\nFor sure. It takes decades. \n\nBut maybe I‚Äôm you in the future right now. I just turned 50. And I‚Äôve done nothing to mitigate my stress levels. And my blood numbers are starting to break. \n\nSo I‚Äôve just gotten on Lexapro and I‚Äôm calling a stop to this immediately. \n\nYou can raw-dog life, but your body is going to suffer and it‚Äôs really all about how you feel from 50 to 90, at the end of the day.\n\n52 and in a ton of pain, and yep. Looking through my life and the issues, it's the stress and anxiety.\n\nAt the very least, try meditation!\n\nIt baffles me that, though the medical establishment preaches this to us, they don't actual check your inflammation markers during your annual wellness exam and insurance doesn't cover any of the things they recommend you do to lower your stress levels (gym membership, yoga classes, massage, etc.).\n\nAgreed.  The medical system is completely ineffective at prevention.  There is zero infrastructure for it.  Absolutely zero.\n\nThat made me have a silent panic attack, thank you üòÄ\n\nWhy post this on an anxiety sub? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThese types of comments are triggering to people with health anxiety.\n\nBecause not all posts here are going to be reassuring and everyone deals with anxiety differently. They put a trigger warning for a reason. \n\nI have OCD and have been a hypochondriac my whole life essentially. I avoid most of the health anxiety posts in here cause reading other people freaking out freaks me out. \n\nNot all posts here are going to be good for everyone that‚Äôs just the internet.\n\nBecause everyone here can get a grip on their anxiety. I finally started taking Lexapro this week myself. \n\nIf we don‚Äôt stress the importance of calming the system, it‚Äôs actually a disservice to all of us. \n\nI made the comment because of the fact that we CAN do something about it.  If it were impossible to fix then it would be a rude thing for me to type. \n\nThere are medications. In any case, it was not intended to upset anyone.\n\nI liked your post and honestly it may make me think again Abt meds ... You put a trigger warning and from there it was up to decide. Anyway thanks for the food for thought. Ps. How have you been feeling since the er?\n\nI‚Äôm not upset. In the past it might of triggered me, but not know. I‚Äôm not on anything. I took Lexapro for a while and it did nothing for my anxiety. Medication isn‚Äôt for everyone. Diet matters. I hardly see anyone bring the importance of diet and anxiety.\n\nSuch bad advice. ‚ÄúIf you want to take a grip: take medication‚Äù. There are numerous other things you should do. Medication is just to silence the symptoms not solve them. But im sure you eat clean, dont drink alchohol, dont smoke, sport everyday and silencing your thoughts with drugs was your ONLY solution‚Ä¶\n\nIn no way, shape, or form is medication ‚Äúbad advice‚Äù.  üôÑ\n\nI spent 40 years trying to get a grip on my anxiety without medication. My BMI is 23.5. My blood work is perfect. \n\nI document every single thing that I eat, including calories, macros, micros, and all nutrients. \n\nI track all waves of sleep and duration.  I exercise 3x a week minimum and I do it right. \n\nBut I have health anxiety. \n\nAnd if I get an abnormal test result, I go off the rails for weeks, until I can get the ‚Äúall clear‚Äù. \n\nDuring this time I destroy my body. Adrenaline and cortisol, coursing through my veins, ripping up soft tissues, draining my adrenals, inflaming my brain, affecting all my organs, and damaging my nervous system. \n\nI‚Äôve done literally everything there is to do outside of medication. So when I say medication, I mean that everyone has that as an option. So anxiety is not mandatory. \n\nThere‚Äôs no bad advice that ever comes out of my mouth.\n\n[removed]\n\nI actually found it reassuring, everybody is different and getting used to seeing triggers in the wild is part of healing. I'm sure I have triggers that wouldn't bother you but I wouldn't wonder why because again, everyone is different. The world can't cater to the millions of anxieties we collectively have.\n\nThis is part of why it really bothers me when people think it‚Äôs funny to deliberately scare or stress other people out as a ‚Äúprank.‚Äù You‚Äôre basically wishing a slow and painful death on that person. üòî\n\nI have severe death anxiety and therefore health anxiety. I went through a period where I thought I was dying daily. I always thought ‚Äòwhat if I die right now?‚Äô And eventually I changed my thinking (through cbt and meds that I‚Äôm no longer on) to think ‚Äòwhat if I lived?‚Äô It makes me way more positive and enjoy the everyday moments.\n\nThis is helpful. Thank you.\n\nThis actually really helps. For the past few days I‚Äôve been having a weird phase where I feel like I need to mentally prepare for death. I don‚Äôt know what triggered it. But thinking of this way really helps my thinking.\n\nHappy I could help! It seems rudimentary but it‚Äôs hard to change the way you think when it comes to anxiety.\n\ndeal with the same thing. Before going to bed im terrified about death &amp; this entire year ive been convinced i have multiple terminal illnesses.\n\nI was right there with you. Every night I was scared to go to sleep because I thought I was going to die.\n\nThis sounds like me can i write to you?\n\nDefinitely!\n\nCurrently me üò≠ for a week I have been woken up to a rapid heart rate. I have been to 3 ERs this week alone. Nobody has an answer. I feel so alone and I literally don't know where to turn. I don't know why this is happening, I Jewish it would stop. Especially if no one can help or tell me why.\n\nAnxiety can raise your heart rate, blood pressure, give you headaches, etc. Almost any physical symptom can be written off as anxiety. I know when you‚Äôre in the middle of it, it‚Äôs hard to realize that but it is true. More than likely there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with you.\n\nI went to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack. Everything looked normal so they gave me some Ativan and my heart rate and blood pressure both went down. That told me that the physical symptoms I was feeling were a result of my anxiety. It still took me months of CBT and anxiety meds to get to a place where I could actually believe it, though.\n\nAfter so deep breaths things slowly start to come back to normal. But is it possible to come in waves like this around the some time every early morning?\n\nDefinitely possible! Think about what your triggers may be and try to address it from that front. Also think of what are things you can do that keep your anxiety at bay? I find when I‚Äôm the busiest is when I‚Äôm the least anxious because I don‚Äôt have time to dwell on it.\n\nThank you so much for replying. I literally felt so hopeless.\n\nMental health is a lonely road.\n\nIt's true cause what are you gonna do, spend all your time worrying and waiting for what may or may not come, only to die regardless of it's instant or slow, and what are you gonna look back on? A life of regret? This is in line with what helped me get over my health anxiety to the extent I can carry on with a normal day for the most part: if I was going to have a terminal diagnosis tomorrow, would I look back on the last few years of my life and feel happy about it? That I lived a good one? I did what I wanted? Or was I gonna regret not doing it when I had the chance?\n\noh okay I'll just tell the adrenaline, cortazone and other chemicals that routinely dump into my body because my \"yo' you're dying\" trigger is fucked. to just stop because i'm not living life.\n\n..except I tried that, and it didn't work. D:\n\nI feel you there :(\n\nI totally get what he's saying, i do, but \\*to me\\* it would help, it would just make me less able to seek help.\n\nwhenever I have my symptoms I just remind myself \"I've done this before\" and ride through itt, or try to, at least.\n\nI keep having this bursts of anxiety through out the day for no reason and my therapist refuses to prescribe medication, because apparently I have to \"try and manage\" the anxiety before resorting to medication. which I get is a good thing sure, but why am I seeing you if I could've tried and managed it by myself?\n\nAsk them to help you build coping skills to help you manage the symptoms of your anxiety if they won‚Äôt prescribe meds. If they can‚Äôt do that‚Ä¶ find a new therapist. \n\nThose coping skills will take time to learn and implement‚Ä¶ but at least if you ask, can‚Äôt say you aren‚Äôt trying.\n\nI have asked and asked but they say that you are the only one who can make it go away by trying to not think negatively. I‚Äôve been through 4 therapists already and they only act like they care to listen because I‚Äôm paying them to and do nothing else.\n\nAre these therapist that specialize in anxiety disorders? \nAsk about guided imagery, breathing techniques, tapping? If you had the skills wouldn‚Äôt you use them? These sound like apathetic providers. You are paying them to help you to obtain coping skills to help elevate or diminish your anxiety. Not sure your country of origin, but in the USA on psychiatrists can prescribe meds. If this isn‚Äôt the case for you, find a doctor that will prescribe meds. With out proper coping skills and medication sometimes it‚Äôs not possible to deal on your own. \n\nSorry you aren‚Äôt getting the help you need.\n\nThat‚Äôs awful for me. I have anxiety almost solely about having anxiety and being anxious and how much my anxiety is affecting me and my health.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was on medication since 13/14 years old. I‚Äôm almost 24 now and came off my medication about a year ago. I‚Äôm anxious about being anxious because I have experience with psychosis. So it‚Äôs very understandable for me to be anxious about being anxious. Despite being anxious, my quality of life has drastically improved because I‚Äôm not numb now and can actually process the feelings rather than push them away. ACT therapy has saved my life. That‚Äôs not to say medication doesn‚Äôt have a place, just that it has served its purpose for me because I wasn‚Äôt ready to deal with those feelings at the time but now I am. I find it a bit irresponsible to recommend medication without knowing anything about someone. Medication should always be a last resort. It‚Äôs also not entirely appropriate to give advice where it‚Äôs not asked for simply because I didn‚Äôt ask due to the nuanced nature of my anxiety.\n\nThanks for your experience with the ER doctor. I hope that the ER doctors I have seen would have told me something like that. I have been dealing with anxiety before I knew I had H Pylori because i was feeling sick, and the doctors kept telling me all the test results, and EKGs came back fine. After i told my primary care doctor to do stomach exams, we finally caught it and started treament.  Then, after the treatment, I started feeling better, but I believe my mind is still in that \"your sick\" mode. I have been feeling a lot of anxiety, which has manifested into physical symptoms like headaches, chest pain, and feelings that I have something wrong with me physically. I have been opening up more to my wife and family about what I'm feeling, and I'm trying to exercise more and just keep my mind active so I don't start thinking about being sick. I just recently started the \"I'm not researching anything anymore phase.\" I believe this has been affecting me a lot because anything I feel I would research it which would make me panic and get more anxiety. I'm slowly getting better, but I know it's gonna take time and effort to get past this. It's good to know that other people have been in my shoes and have gotten better!\n\nHey there. Dealing with some gastro stuff myself. What were your main symptoms if you don't mind sharing. Also congrats on figuring it out/ feeling better and sharing how you are doing with family etc.!\n\nHello, I had chest pains, which felt like I was gonna have a heart attack. I also had esophagus pain, which gave me neck pain. The neck pain felt like I was gonna get a cramp in my neck. My stomach would hurt and feel gaseous. I had trouble going to number 2, which has never been an issue with me, which in turn caused bloating. Also, just a general feeling of feeling ill.\n\nFrom the people I‚Äôve seen in my family, those who had the most stress, passed away first.  Those who were the most relaxed lived the longest. Some of them even periodically used Xanax to remain that way.  They never abused it and lived the longest.\n\nGreat now I have anxiety that I will pass away earlier from my anxiety ‚Ä¶ ü•¥\n\nYou have time to change things around!\n\nReminds me of an ER doc I saw that believed I had a health issue going on but also anxiety and helped me treat both. He didn‚Äôt brush it off, but acknowledged they were separate issues that needed help.\n\nBy all means of honesty, had he said that to me, I'd be panicking so hard that I'd literally destroy the hospital.\n\nI hate attitudes like that. Anxiety can be over real symptoms. If your chest hurts for real it‚Äôs no wonder you get scared and riled up. And it might subside by the time you get checked, to then hear ‚Äùwhat is the REAL reason you are here?‚Äù would infuriate me immensely.\n\nNot sure why you are getting downvoted, but you are absolutely right.\n\nWish I could upvote you more.\n\nI can absolutely see how it could upset others, hence the trigger warning, but for some reason it did help me.\n\nRight? Like..I have the very real symptoms of whatever \"thing\" I think I have, usually it's severe chest pain, sometimes its my limbs hurting, three or four times I've literally lost vision (everything went blurry) ..Like thanks doctor I know I can't live a decent life like this but also fuck you.\n\nComing to terms with this was life changing for me! I've had health anxiety since I was 7, and I'm almost 31 now. 2017-2022 were the worst times for me, I was in and out of ERs and abusing alcohol to cope with the constant stress and panic attacks. Realizing that no amount of worrying and googling and panicking were going to prevent the inevitable - my eventual death - helped me to focus on what I could control. I got sober and started medication (effexor), and now I just do what I can to make sure I'm taking care of my body. I see my doctor regularly and try to live as healthily as possible, and when symptoms pop up that would otherwise send me into a spiral, I try to notice it, but not dwell on it. DBT was also very helpful for me. Mindfulness and grounding techniques are what get me through the toughest times.\n\nBest thing a doctor EVER told on my millionth round to visit. I was yet again convinced I had some rare disease they had missed. \n\nHe looked me dead in the eyes and said, \"You're not that special.\" \n\nBlunt, brutal, but honest.\n\nThere's truth there, I understand why it might not help some people but I'm glad it helped you. I mean, I get it. I get so riled up over health anxiety that I forget that I'm actually more in danger from heart disease in the future from stress and suicide. As dark as it sounds. (I'm not suicidal now, I've just had episodes in the past.) If I truly want to take care of my health, I have to take care of my anxiety and mental health. Spiraling over other most likely harmless sensations will not help me. The anxiety will kill me faster than anything.¬†\n\nThat would be great if everyone would take anxiety seriously like the doctor did. Especially before it gets chronic. I really underestimated how anxiety could impact one's life and I'd love for everyone to realise how important it is to know the way anxiety manifests itself. Just like we're all aware of the importance of disinfecting a wound, knowing the signs would be helpful to prevent an anxiety disorder and worse.\n\nSnausagesgalore said that ‚Äústress &lt; anxiety &lt; inflammation‚Äù but it can work the other way, starting with inflammation &lt; anxiety &lt; stress\n\nI understand what you've been through. What helped my anxiety was realizing God is real and he truly cares for his creation. Seek and you will find. There's peace in having faith in Christ.¬†\n\nTHIS DID NOT HELP üî•üî•üî•\n\nMaybe somebody on here has been through what I'm going through now. I have bad anxiety, and I have my whole life. I have been on anxiety meds since I was 16, and I'm now 39. I've tried most anxiety medications, but the only one that really helps is Xanax. Years back, I got banged up in a car accident and ended up in pain management. I got hooked on pain meds that led to stronger stuff. It took me a long time to shake that stuff, but I'm doing better now. For the last 6 months, I've been going to a sub doctor, and she will not write any kind of benzos. I understand their reasoning behind not wanting to write \"addicts\" scrips to benzos, but it has me in a bad place. The medication she has me on helps a little, I think. But I keep having such bad attacks. I'm tired of being so worried about everything and not being able to just breathe, if that makes any sense. My sub doctor is literally across the street from my regular doctor, but I can't go, or I'll get kicked out. I have to choose between anxiety meds that work, (from my regular doctor) or Suboxon that has helped me get off opiates. Is there some kind herbal remedy, or anything that helps when having an attack? I've tried most non-benzos meds there is. I don't want to relapse on the opiates, but this anxiety is wearing me down.. Sorry for the long text, but somebody suggested seeking answers here. Thanks\n\nsecond kratom, though be careful with it. Also valeren root if you don't mind the d\\*ck cheese smell (I cannot handle the smell but it did work for me)\n\nYou can try kratom, although that comes with risk of addiction.\n\nIt definitely does. It got me. I do not recommend.\n\nI like to use kava root to help with my anxiety. It does calm my body down somewhat. I get it in tea form, chewable ‚Äúmints‚Äù or a spray that you spray on your tongue\n\nCome to live in the UK. There's nothing prescribed for anxiety apart from stupid antidepressants. Something I read earlier on this thread about trying not to catastrophise everything..... Made me think ü§î I know I catastrophise but I¬† forget to try and resist this. What if your anxiety or anxious thoughts are wrong? What if what you're thinking and what anxiety is telling you is just rubbish to give you a hard time?What would happen if you stopped that without drugs or meds or herbal meds? I don't believe they work btw but the prescription drugs only increase anxiety in the long term so best work on breathing techniques and keeping calm naturally and telling anxiety to do one. I'm going to try and think about all this myself now too üòâ\n\nI have severe panic and anxiety and manifests very physically. The only drug that helped was Xanax until I started a beta blocker. I take half of the lowest dose. It isn‚Äôt an anxiety med, it‚Äôs a med that slows your heart rate and lowers BP. I have low BP so it made me a little dizzy at first (few weeks) but it has evened me out a bit. It might be worth talking to your doctor about meds that aren‚Äôt typically used for anxiety to help with anxiety. There is no way to get addicted to this metoprolol tartrate because it gives no euphoric side effects etc. Hope this helps.\n\nThis doctor is a good man\n\nThat sounds like a good Doc to me.\n\nMy anxiety was in fact caused by something physical which when treated reduced it tremendously. Unfortunately it took 10+ years to get to that point.\n\nBut it wasn‚Äôt until I came to terms that I had two issues. One, which might have been something undiagnosed and physical, and second the mental health distress. \n\nI had to treat the mental and learn to accept things as they were. Once I did that I was at much more peace, albeit still physically unwell. In my case, physical issues led to panic and anxiety which was making everything that much worse.\n\nWow i would have been so shocked i couldn‚Äôt speak hell it made me feel validates have no doubt it‚Äôs part of why i am where i am medically\n\nIt‚Äôs like slightly comforting??!! In a weird sense at least. He‚Äôs so right though!!\n\nI agree. You cant control everything and we cant worry things to our will. Thank Goodness I can turn the things over I cant control knowing my Higher Power knows better than I and always has my back today\n\nGreat post we can all learn something from this AAA+"

    "all_comment_text": "Great advice. Everything leading up to the election made me feel so physically sick and I think it's because I'm at an age where I am finally understanding WHAT politics are. I'm finally seeing all the chaos everywhere and it's all too overwhelming. Now I can't stop noticing little things about the news everywhere and hyperfocusing on it, despite knowing I am literally just one random person who cannot do anything at all about it other than appreciate the time I have now with my family. I feel guilty for detaching. It makes me feel like I'm 'privileged' which I suppose so to some extent. I just can't listen to it anymore.\n\nI completely agree with you. It's such a tough balance, especially when you start to understand just how chaotic and overwhelming everything can be. Politics and world events can feel like a constant storm, and it‚Äôs easy to get sucked into the cycle of anxiety and guilt. I‚Äôve been there too feeling like I‚Äôm supposed to stay plugged in and be informed all the time, but it just starts to feel unhealthy.\n\nLiterally was checking the news every single day religiously until my child called me out for it.  They never see that type of behavior but it's even getting to the kids through their peers and now they're being impacted and I could tell they were just tired of hearing about it. So that's what made me realize our household definitely needed a news break.  \n\n\n\nI'll leave it to those who have enough energy in their spirit for the rest of us to inform us if something horribly wrong goes on..\n\nAlso as someone with OCD and anxiety, I came to realize that what I was actually doing was I was trying to control things. That behavior was a way for me to exercise some control. Like somehow if I was aware of things more, maybe I would read the news that would say things were going to get better. Maybe I would find the glimmer of hope. Maybe I would find a way to avoid the pain myself. Instead, I just created pain for myself and for people around me.\n\nFellow OCD/Anxiety-er‚Ä¶.. this is beautifully said, and profoundly relatable for me. I‚Äôm gonna try to remember this comment, because I think this idea will be really helpful to refer back to when I find myself stuck in a certain place. Thank you.\n\nYou worded this really well. I have OCD/Anxiety also. So you exactly get it. I never thought of it that way but it definitely felt like a control issue. Like, the more I would watch the news, maybe I thought mentally things would just...magically get better? Instead I would just overread the news and share it with others and directly spread that fear. But I just feel like a ignorant fool if I just pretend like nothing is going on and live blissfully. But I need to for the sake of me and my family.\n\n\n\nI hope you find comfort and peace for yourself somewhere. I really do!! ‚ô•\n\nIn my opinion, hiding and isolating myself from truth, no matter how terrible, doesn‚Äôt mean that truth becomes any less real or any less terrifying. \n\nI personally lean towards the opposite approach. I seek out the news, and lessen anxiety by learning as much as I reasonably can while also making time to do things I love with people I love. \n\nIf the news is still there, and I‚Äôm still here, unafraid and defiant, then I have won this small victory.\n\nSame - I try to look for the less fear mongering articles and try to find more reasonable sources. Like yes it's bad but here's an explanation of what can or isn't. I try to find things that rationalize what's happening in a way that's less \"all hope is lost!\" To a - there's still things that can be done.\n\nI spent way to long in an echo chamber, I forced myself into a false safety blanket. Now I'm trying to look outside, not to agree, but to try to be realistic and prepared.\n\nUsing only news agencies like Reuters as sources is really helpful in that matter.\n\nApps like Ground News have helped quite a bit with this also¬†\n\nI didn't know about that app! I'll check it, thanks.\n\nIn this particular case following the news is actually the thing that would keep you calm because if you follow the news you know that russia makes nuclear threats like every other week. And also that Ukraine over the course of the last 2.5 years has blown off numerous oil refineries military factories and military airfields in russia, literally occupied a chunk of Kursk oblast in russia, destroyed radiolocation systems that were the part of russian anti-aircraft systems ‚Äî and none of that has caused nuclear apocalypse everybody keeps crying about non-stop since day 1 of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nI can tell you that right now Ukrainian segment of the internet is more worried about STALKER 2 release than Putin's \"new\" nuclear doctrine lol.\n\nBeing reasonably informed eases a lot of anxiety, you are right as well as making realistic plans for the worst case scenarios.\n\nThis is exactly what I'm aiming for. Well, I lean towards \"nervously exhausted but in peace with the fact that only one can decide what to do with the time given\" than \"unafraid and defiant\", but the spirit is still the same.\n\nAre you equating ‚Äúthe news‚Äù with ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù?\n\nAnd it's all intentionally this way. All these algorithms. I think they're slowly driving the population crazy to be honest.\n\nYep.  One thing I did that really helped was unsubbing from every default sub and only subbing to the stuff I want to.  Cut down on a lot of anxiety inducing stuff and generally made the site better quality overall.  \n  \nLearning to ignore stuff you have no control over was crucial for me in overcoming my anxiety.  And 99.999% of the stuff posted to news subs is stuff you have no control over.\n\nLiterally just subbed to a bunch of cat subreddits. üòÇ\n\nI think it‚Äôs still important to be aware of what‚Äôs going on in the world, but I‚Äôd suggest if watching the news makes you anxious, try to just pick one or two days a week to read up for no more than half an hour or so, or watch something like CNN 10 so you still get a gist of what‚Äôs going on but you don‚Äôt fall down a rabbit hole.\n\nThis is a good approach. You don‚Äôt need to be checking in on things every day. Just check in say once a week.¬†\n\nCouldn't agree more. My elderly father-in-law is a news addict &amp; I believe it's doing awful things to his mental health. All he really talks about are all the worst stories he saw on the news the night before (car crashes with fatalities &amp; violent crime mainly) but my husband and I dont know what to do about it. We can't take his TV away because it's his only form of entertainment. He's old-school and doesn't believe in depression &amp; anxiety so taking him to the doctor to be prescribed something for anxiety would be a waste of time, he wouldn't take the damn pills anyway!\n\nReading has become hard on my dad‚Äôs eyes so he is very very grateful for YouTube Premium on his smart TV. All kinds of documentaries and history shows and classic movies. Any chance your dad could watch something like that instead of the current news? I‚Äôm thinking of subscribing to something that will still let me pick up my phone for entertainment without ending up doomscrolling‚Äîit‚Äôs kind of a new habit but not an entire lifestyle change, like your dad still watching TV to learn about world and national events but in the past, not the present, and it would be less depressing for him.\n\nHonestly, even if I brought this up with him, I think he'd reject the idea because that would mean admitting the news is affecting him negatively. He does watch the odd doco but if tv news wasn't a thing, I doubt he'd even have a TV. I think it's basically the highlight of his day, he's in front of the TV 15 mins before the 1st programme even starts and will then flick channels to try catch all the following news programmes in case another one tells him something the previous one didn't. He also doesn't have a smart TV because he's old-school and why buy something new when the old one isn't broken, lol. That's good you were able to find something that works for your dad, he's lucky to have you :)\n\nR/optimistsunite is a great page I've been following on here that, as the name suggests, only puts the positive spin out there. It's been helping me manage all the rest of the negativity found in my various media of choice.\n\nAfter having a delightful spiral on election night, I deleted the news app, Twitter, and TikTok from my phone - this has made it immensely more difficult for me to doomscroll because of the way these headlines are pushed on algorithmic sites. Despite everything, I feel substantially calmer now.\n\nMe too!! I made the Final Cut on election night too.\n\nI sanitized my reddit feed and stopped exposing myself to national/political news after the election. Yes, I want to fight the good fight and stand with people in solidarity against certain things going on, but I need to step back for mental, physical, and emotional health. I can already tell the difference in my state of mind.\n\nHear! Hear!\n\nHow though? I feel like I have a responsibility to watch the news, maybe an OCD thing\n\nUsed to feel that way. But it got too bad in covid. And then Ukraine. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care - I do. But when it‚Äôs gotten to the stage you‚Äôre riddled with anxiety - nightmares and stuff. It‚Äôs just not worth it.\n\nUgh it almost feels like I need permission to stop watching though, I‚Äôm so addicted and been doing it for so long\n\nPermission granted.\n\nThanks :)\n\ni think having a healthy relationship and reframing what we consider news is helpful. give yourself structured, specific time to stay informed about things, and then log off and stop looking at it. it's very difficult, and i'm not great at it either, but it is possible. \n\nexploitative tv news stations and social media where people are reacting in real time and often not fully understanding what they just learned isn't a constructive way to be informed, and is exhausting. especially for those of us with anxiety disorders\n\nAmerican news is very theatrical and sensationalist, and it‚Äôs only gotten worse in recent years. The 24 hour news channels are driven by ratings and advertisers, so they try to keep the people glued to the screen and anxious. When you watch the news in other countries, it is BORING aka how news should be!\n\nVery true. But I‚Äôve noticed even respectable‚Äô news outlets are drama driven now.\n\nMy anxiety first started in Middle School and I was terrified to be alone in my room. This resulted in very embarrassing situations of me trying to sleep with my parents when I was like 12 years old. The school therapist finally told my parents I had to stop watching the news.  I lived outside of DC during the crack epidemic, so yeah the news was fucking non-stop frightening. My brain just kept telling me I was unsafe. Even though I was in the suburbs and not near it.  \n\nThe words of that school therapist still ring out to me as a 40-something-year-old. I have friends that send me articles and I've basically told them I don't want to know. I would way rather be ignorant right now because I cannot mentally process what is going on in the world without losing my mind. So much in the news is presented to us in a way to illicit a fear response. And truthfully a lot of it is horrible. So I can only protect myself by turning off the fucking news. And shielding myself from the news.   I'm not telling y'all to be ignorant of what's going on in the world, but you have to be careful with consumption when you have anxiety.\n\nThe only thing that's kept my anxiety from spiking is the knowledge that Putin is a spineless weakling and even he isn't stupid enough to start a global thermonuclear war.\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt the response I was hoping for tbh.\n\nI hear that, but there are no winners in a nuclear war. It‚Äôs not going to happen. What could happen is tactical, but to your point, turn off the news. Nothing we can do or control what‚Äôs happening across the world or the even the US at large. Live your live the best you can within the community where you have purpose and direct impact.\n\n\"I do not know what weapons World War 3 will be fought, but World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones.\" - Albert Enstein\n\nI couldn't agree more! The only way is to avoid it. It's the same concept as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; identify the negative input/thoughts/stimulus, filter out the negative ones, and maybe even replace them with something positive.\n\nIt really is insane how intentionally upsetting everything called \"news\" is now, and it's all catered specifically to you, available 24/7.\n\n\"It's bad for ya\" - George Carlin\n\nDawg even the aliens shit. But then I realized if yoda kills me so what dawg I had enoughhhhh.\nTurn the news off\n\nI assume you‚Äôre not Sith? Therefore being killed by Yoda would appear to be an irrational worry. Consult doctor asap.\n\nthis is literally what i needed to hear. and on putin; i dont think the guys stupid enough for that. probs just proganda.\n\nand news in general is on negatives or what you see,why would people click on a happy event? negative events are more likely to get clicks. people will need to know what happened,what will,etc etc. ive never had so much anxienty over anything infavt until i started seeing news everywhere. panic attacks or some form  of one every night nearly. they want people coming back,so theyll keep on those events.\n\nanyway thanks for this tiny little post &lt;3\n\nA good piece of advice I got once was: if it goes away when you turn off your phone, it‚Äôs not worth worrying about. \n\nPut your phone down in another room and forget about it. I swear it helps.\n\nThis! I use an app called Screenzen to block any news apps and sites. It messes with our hypersensitive brains to consume all this negativity.\n\nTake it from me, a xenillal who participated in a-bomb drills in kindergarten. There is nothing you can do at this point if the USSR.... er.... I mean Russia...decides to nuke us. \n\nLife is for the living. Go live it.\n\n100% agreed. There's literally almost no escape from the news thanks to social media and smartphones. You really have to make a concerted effort to avoid it. Personally, I don't watch the news unless it's for something important, otherwise I only watch the local news. I don't follow hardly any political content creators for the same reason. It's just an infinite feedback loop of stress, the more you look at it, the worse you feel. And then it compounds on itself to the point where it just ruins your mental health.\n\nI disengaged from news a week before the election in the US, and apart from seeing that Trump won, I haven't heard a word of news since. I am noticeably happier.\n\nI will re-engage before our next election, but that's about all I'm interested in.\n\nI also turned off my News app off Apple and configure my works Edge browser to not show any news or any thing in general. The only place that truly show me news is YouTube now which sucks that I can‚Äôt take it off.\n\nYou can! There is something that says don‚Äôt show this when you scroll down to the news section. I have turned them all off.\n\nCouldn't agree more. I've been a victim of it, I know, but recently I've been really trying to distance myself from it. Each day getting better...\n\nDeal!\n\n[removed]\n\nThis content has been automatically removed.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Anxiety) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nthose are my thoughts recently \n\nsocial media won't even let you ban certain topics and it's just bombarding you with whatever shit it decides will rattle you (for me it's animal welfare)... it definitely works on me which is why I avoid facebook and am starting to get really sick of tiktok. I'm doing what I can to do my part in society, I can't afford to waste my mental energy on being sad\\stressed about stuff that's mostly scams and\\or clickbait\n\nStopped a long time ago.  I voted and did my part, now Ive pretty much blocked everything else out.\n\nFocus on your mental and physical health and well being.  Following everything will lead to massive depression and high anxiety, not good.\n\nI stopped watching the news 5 years ago due to anxiety.\n\nYep - watching things you can't control takes your focus away from the things you can. In other words, eliminating the distractions (I agree with the person who said they're mostly clickbait) frees you up to make the world around you a better place - and that's really what we're here for! If we all did that, the world would be a lot more peaceful!\n\nYou're absolutely right. Constant exposure to negative news can significantly impact mental health. It's important to maintain a balance and prioritize our well-being.\n\nTotally agree, it's only been going from bad to worse lately. At least if I'm reading them I can control the intake a bit.\n\nAs someone mentally struggling, I needed this. Thank you.\n\nYes! I doom-scrolled during trumps presidency and COVID and it fucked me up mentally. I voted and did what I could this year. I don‚Äôt want to be completely uninformed (I feel it‚Äôs my duty as an American/human), but I can‚Äôt read anything until he‚Äôs sworn in and even then, I‚Äôm not going deep into it.\n\nStay healthy, everyone ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nHaving to live with parents in my current situation. They are glued to the TV, the news is always on right on time during dinner.. etc. Best I can do is breathe and be distracted by my phone when I have to be in the same room as the news. Staying away from Twitter, and certain subs. It's hard at times but my anxiety really makes me break and worry for my future amongst other things.\n\nSorry for your trouble. But I‚Äôm glad you get the idea that they design it not to be informative but to scare you.\n\nUnfortunately, many of us probably don't have that choice. I inherited my mental illnesses from my mom. She does NOT know how to cope and refuses to seek help or even acknowledge that she's struggling. She used to use religion as a way to feel in control, but these last 10 years, it's been politics and world events. She just sits in front of the news day in and day out, then she calls me in a panic telling me about all this horrendous stuff, most of which isn't even true! I've tried telling her it's not only bad for her mental health, it's bad for mine, but it's her form of staying in control and her obsession right now... My husband will take one look at me and say \"you talked to your mom today didn't you?\" Because it wracks my nervous system so badly it's written right on my face. And yes, before someone says it, I COULD go no contact... But shes my mom and she hurting herself... I don't want to abandon her... \n\nSo how do I cope? I keep my head down on my own time as much as possible and I read a LOT. Politics aren't just in the news anymore, it's every single place you look, the only place safe are fictional books... I just tell myself that none of it is real. Probably not a good cope either but it's all I can do. I have a panic attack just going to the grocery store, I can't afford to think about this crap.\n\nJust a thought on your mom - you could ask for and enforce a boundary that current events will not be spoken about. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a hard no contact.\n\nTrue.\n\n\nTV is the loop of depression.\n\n\nAlways repeating the same news over and over.\n\n\nIf you watch it for too long, you'll go mad.\n\nI have been consuming the news regularly, every day since high school in the early 2000's. Being informed is almost sort of an addiction for me. After the election, I haven't kept up with anything outside of local goings on, just makes me too angry. The bad guys won, I am contributing to the uninformed populace like I'm sure was their intention.\n\nPay attention enough to be informed. Otherwise, yeah it's overwhelming.\n\nHonestly after the election I took a hard step back from keeping up constantly and I do think overall it has helped me feel less crappy.\n\nThis is a great tip. I'd rather be less \"informed\" than to lose my sanity.\n\nCouldn't agree more, nothing but scare mongering and dividing people for hits üòû\n\nI‚Äôve been listening to the book ‚ÄúSame as Ever‚Äù by Morgan Housel, somewhat familiar advice. :)\n\nIf you do focus on the news. Make it local. Do something for your community.\n\nI can't stand the news, it's all the same shit rewritten over and over trying to push a certain buzz phrase or topic or whatever that doesn't usually even matter for more than like a week at the most.\n\nI use an app called¬†Newsreadeck¬†to follow several source at the same time and get the articles ready to read. I follow several know sources like FT, AP, reuters... etc, but there are a lot more. Also, the app has a possibility to mute a channel with a period of time, so, I used to mute several US politics channel I follow while the election, to save my mental health. Was very useful\n\nI'd expand that to: don't look at 99% of the reddit content that pops up. Just not worth it\n\ncurrently having panic attacks because of the war news, it really sucks and i can‚Äôt tell if i should actually be scared or if the news is making it seem like it‚Äôs going to be a bigger catastrophe than it is\n\nhelp your local community. Take care of yourself. Those are the things you CAN do\n\nThank you.\nMy doctor told me to not read anything regarding the election online and not to watch the news.\n\nI am on two meds and my anxiety is off the charts.\n\nDid you follow his advice? I hope you settle down soon.\n\nOn this note, does anyone have any tips? I find myself jumping at every little noise and looking outside constantly because of how wound up this has me. I know I shouldn't read the news. I'm just absolutely terrified.¬†\n\nYes. The tip is not to read the news.\n\nI‚Äôve gone from constantly watching news (several times a day) to not watching anything for the last 2 weeks - it is having a positive effect on my wellbeing. 100% agree that it‚Äôs just fixating on something completely outside my control but  I can‚Äôt seem to tell my brain that - only avoiding it completely works.\n\nBest advice you can ever hear in this day and age. Ever.\n\nYeahhh I‚Äôd rather not be an ostrich with my head in the sand being unaware that‚Äôs partly why we‚Äôre in the mess we‚Äôre in now in the U.S. because people are unaware and uninformed of how things actually work and which people are doing what.\n\nI agree completely. I stopped watch or reading the news a few years ago and my stress and anxiety improved significantly. I figure if I need know something really important I‚Äôll learn about the old fashioned way, through word of mouth. I am aware of all that‚Äôs happening in the world but blissfully unaware of the details. There‚Äôs an old saying ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt watch the news you are uninformed, if you do watch the news you are misinformed‚Äù \nEither way you never know the entire story and background behind events and regardless of the facts, there is nothing you can do to change the situation, it‚Äôs dead depressing weight. Uninformed and focused on positivity is a lot better for mental health\n\nI stopped watching the news in 2016. My mom mentioned Putin today and told her that exact thing.\n\nI stopped watching any news after the election in November 2016.  I can honestly say it has helped my anxiety quite a bit, but I still struggle with other things in daily life.  Of course, there was no way to completely avoid this last election, and I just restarted therapy because of it.  My approach is to ask my husband every week or so if there‚Äôs anything in the world that I just really need to know about.  The last big thing was the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nI stopped watching the news a while back, and it helped a lot. Now, if I could only get people around me to stfu about events in the world, I wouldn't be gagging at work during their conversations.\n\n[removed]\n\nThank you for proving my point.\n\nI didn‚Äôt prove your point, you proved mine. Look at the state of the world. We have Dr. Oz as the head of Medicare and Medicaid due to people wanting to ‚Äújust tune out of the news‚Äù. You are being irresponsible and weak, and are part of the problem.\n\nIf you say so.\n\nIt‚Äôs not if I say so, it is reality. Stop being immature\n\nI‚Äôll try.\n\nI don‚Äôt though?"

    "body": "*Linked an informational video in the comments*\n\nCatastrophizing is when we automatically jump to the absolute worst, most disastrous conclusions about a situation, without being able to fully back it up with facts or trying to see other more helpful and *realistic* perspectives.\n\nIt can be very hard to open ourselves up to the idea that not everything is awful, because awful can feel more comforting then uncertainty.\n\nAn example could be assuming that just because he is back in office means that everything is going to go totally wrong or we'll all lose our democracy or have a civil war, or people comparing Trump to Hitler (which btw is super disrespectful to those who endured the holocaust)... without looking into stuff like the ways the supreme court and the constitution has levels of control over him, how the state governments set boundaries and protections, past things that we did to get through and prevent future issues. Our countries political system is specifically built in a way that can allow someone to have authoritarian *influence*, but makes it virtually impossible for the president to become a *true* dictator (remember, he's only allowed 8 total years in office so after this term, hes out. That is in the constitution).\n\n And you know how hes said stuff about overturning amendments in the constitution? That has only happened once in US history, for prohibition, and requires cooperation from the supreme court, the senate, congress and 2/3 of all US states. \n\nWhat things have we bounced back from or have improved even despite him being around? Well for one, in 2021 we got the first female vice pres in all of American history, which alone, is monumental and *you* are here for that. *Texas* just got its first openly lgbtqia+ member of congress, and the first transgender woman to ever get elected into congress just got elected. These are already incredible steps that were totally overshadowed by Trump being elected. \n\nI'm *not* saying this isn't a bad situation for many of us, and I'm not saying it's wrong to feel upset or worried or that you should just \"look on the bright side\", but I'm saying that the future implications most likely will not amount to being the *absolute worst things possible* that the news, our anxiety or our family/friends would lead us to believe.\n\nI definitely recommend just trying to open yourself up to the idea that *maybe, just possibly*... everything won't go absolutely wrong, and looking into the video linked. And being open to challenging your thinking.",

I just need to remember the thousands of times I thought I was gonna die before and didn't. Stay strong everyone.\n\nDo you take any sleeping pills or medication for anxiety?\n\nNo I don't\n\nNeeded this. All I can think about recently is dropping dead from cardiac arrest\n\nI feel that on the daily. It's scary for sure!\n\nWhat are your symptoms? I struggle with this fear a lot. I am dizzy 24/7, even when lying in bed,  occasional heart palps and air hunger, fatigue and impending doom. Hate this so fucking much.\n\nRight now I‚Äôm struggling with the exact same symptoms you described. I know they‚Äôre all anxiety symptoms because I feel like this every winter, but it still doesn‚Äôt help. The air hunger is bothering me the most and so are the heart palpitations. I specifically take meds for them, but I guess the anxiety is stronger. And the impending doom!!! Omg. I know. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about death, it‚Äôs on my mind 24/7 right now. It‚Äôs horrible. I hope you feel better soon\n\nI am sorry that you are going through this. Anxiety is a misery. Every symptom that I have, I attach to heart, especially dizziness. Whenever I feel dizzy, I think that cardiac arrest is near. And these heart palps and air hunger make me think more about this. I wouldn't be so concerned about my heart, if I hadn't family history of heart disease. My father has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which increase the risk of cardiac arrest.  Last month I have done echo and stress test and cardiologist said that my heart is good. It relieved me for few weeks, but the fear came back. What if he missed something. Thank you for response. Hope we will heal from thisüôè.\n\nI know how you feel. My dad had double bypass surgery last year, which more or less caused my cardiophobia. I even get chest pains. The difficult part of all this is wondering if it‚Äôs actually something serious, or if it‚Äôs just anxiety. At least you have the assurance of a good echo! God bless you\n\nDid you get any better?

I always think \"what if it's the big one\" or \"my heart's been through this so much what if it can't take it this time\". It is hard. I got to the ER on a regular basis and am not healed by any means I just hope it might help others.\n\n\n\n\n\"I saw this while thinking the exact same thoughts. 'My heart can't take it this time,' I had just searched it on Google. My grandmother is 74 years old, and she thought it would always be like this for 40 years. But she's 74! She still goes for check-ups, has everything checked, and is perfectly healthy. I think what we forget here is how much we experience this and how accustomed our hearts are to it. Stay strong, my friend. I've been fighting this for 10 years, and it hasn't hurt me even once. Promise me, from now on, let's do this: either it will defeat us, or we will defeat it. A win-win situation.\"\n\nIt's like a panic that disables you.\n\nYup. When I have health/death anxiety I tell myself that natural death is a process, most often a pretty slow one. The chances of me unexpectedly dropping dead at my age is too low to waste energy stressing about.\n\nThat's a good way to look at it. It takes a long time to accept it.\n\nI just read Don‚Äôt Believe Everything You Think.  The first half was very helpful. The second was a bit muddled for me. \n\nBut the point is, DON‚ÄôT BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU THINK!!  I‚Äôm practicing it every day.

Then I thought, what am I afraid of? I feel like I‚Äôm not living life on my terms and if I die I‚Äôm gonna miss out on what would make me happy.

It helped a lot.\n\n\\* Anxiety and fear can be overwhelming, but they are not a reflection of reality.\n\n\\* It's okay to feel scared, but it's not okay to let fear control your life.\n\n\\* You are not alone, and there is help available.\n\n\\* You are strong and capable of getting through this difficult time.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nBeen struggling bad with headaches, this neck pain, eye tension, feels weird to walk and stand, sinking and floating feelings, back and shoulder tension, jaw popping, I wonder if I got tmj or something\n\nall of the above for me aswell, ive been going through the worst health anxiety since july, once i get over one thing another comes up. im in the aneurysm thoughts right now lol\n\nI‚Äôm in stroke lol\n\nWanted to touch back in, i recently started reading the DARE Response in the past few weeks, its been helping tremendously, might want to give it a try, couldnt hurt.\n\nI‚Äôve had very similar symptoms since June. Been to the dr an absurd number of times and anxiety seems like the only logical explanation but it‚Äôs so hard to accept and believe that you‚Äôre safe. I sadly find it so comforting coming on here and reading about people who are experiencing almost identical things. I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre going through this.\n\nI was going through the exact same thing this summer/fall, but it's clearing up a little now. Thought I had a brain tumor bc of the headaches. Nope, just tension. Now I've been getting chest pain and am worried I have heart problems even though I'm only 21. Going to the doctor today, though, so I'll talk to them about it.\n\n21 is crazy unlikely but I‚Äôm 24 and got stroke worries lol\n\nCouple months ago I thought I had an aneurysm, then throat cancer, then lymphoma, now it's the heart thing so I'm just frustrated at this point when I'm not anxious. And I'm not even having palpitations anymore, just pain, so I'm probably fine\n\nThis is hard to believe when you have been in the 1% however üò≠ on more than one occasion, too.\n\nI'm so sorry! üòû\n\nso true - but I remind myself that being part of the 1% for more than one thing would be so unlikely! and if that doesn‚Äôt work, I remind myself that maybe I can be in the 1% of the best things happening too ü©∑\n\nHow?\n\nAnxiety due to trauma that did happen, despite a statistically low chance, more than once.\n\nLike what happened? If u feel comfortable sharing\n\nStillborn baby at term, second child born with 1 in 50,000 genetic condition leaving her profoundly disabled, dad killed in car accident. Statistics mean nothing to me.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry :( that‚Äôs what always gets me with reading these things, I try to tell myself it‚Äôs so rare but like I‚Äôm sure the people that it happened to thought the same thing\n\nThis came to me at the right time. I just finished crying like 5 mins ago, thank you so much for this post. ‚ÄúDo what you love and live.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt agree more with that. Sending good wishes to anybody reading this ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nCrying is a powerful and healing weapon.\n\nscreenshotted this and saving it to my favorites. thank you\n\nI'm glad I could help!\n\n[removed]\n\nI will turn to god and jesus if he can get rid of my anxiety\n\nThank you SO MUCH for this actually cause one time I kept hearing my heartbeat in my pillow while sleeping at night and my chest started to hurt and I cried cause I thought there was something wrong and I stayed awake THE WHOLE ENTIRE NIGHT but nothing ever happened! And it was just really bad anxiety!\n\nNighttime anxiety is like unleashing hell.\n\nREAL THOUGH\n\nHate it\n\nNeeded this, thank you!\n\nFunny thing is that I have zero fear of dying during a panic attack. I have just impending doom that I‚Äôll never feel anything different in the moment and that this is my life from now on. I couldn‚Äôt imagine what some of you guys go through with health anxiety. That has to be terrible to go through. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way and things will get better. Even if it‚Äôs years which no one wants to hear, it will get better I promise\n\nIt will! All forms of anxiety suck ass.\n\nI just get this stupid knot and gas pain in my stomach lol idk how to explain it, I'm prescribed xanax and it didnt work until I took a bunch of gas x, then the xanax kicked in so both worked\n\nI get the same thing. The bloating feels like chest tightness. My anxiety and stomach issues are a feedback loop\n\nI got it all too, gut + chest feeling a little off makes me anxious, then anxiety makes the gut + chest feel worse long term triggering more panic\n\nsry I didn't respond but taking fiber gummies helped a little bit... still get anxiety\n\nnot as bad but still sucks\n\nThanks for the reminder!\n\nTHANK YOU\n\nThanks for this.  I'm so sorry you know this.  You're completely right.\n\nI'm sorry anybody feels this. We will be okay though ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nBut will I ever live ?üòî\n\n[deleted]\n\nGoing through the same these past two months. Worst yet. Otherwise, on and off for the past several years and still here. Worst PVC are at night in bed.\n\nThank you. I‚Äôm getting checked out tomorrow, but I‚Äôm hoping it is just anxiety but I really did need this because health anxiety is terrible.\n\nScreenshotting‚Ä¶ thank you so much\n\nThe struggle with anxiety in my case has been a rollercoaster of stability and decline.\n\nThanks, I‚Äôm literally here to make a post and needed to read this first.\n\nThank you so much üíñ i definitely needed this today! I‚Äôm going on a new medication for my sleep and I‚Äôm so nervous today, I‚Äôve been avoiding pills for over two months because of how bad my anxiety got. I‚Äôm going to be just fine, thank you for the reassurance and reminder ü´∂üèª\n\nEvery night is a struggle, overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts and fear , fear I might not wake up in the morning and it‚Äôs never happened but funny thing is that‚Äôs not enough to calm my mind and eliminate the fear , it always feels new and true\n\nmaaaaaan, you hit the nail on every single thought that i feel on a daily, thank you for saying that for me\n\nI tell myself this every day but the thought of \"what if this time...\" always gets me. \n\nEvery time feels like the first and no matter how familiar there are times when there's no more stopping it from hitting a 10 and suddenly you're either calling an ambulance or screaming for one. \n\nThis is where I believe medication is essential. I don't understand the advocacy for being med free. Should I tell my dad to stop going to dialysis? What if there are times that nothing can stop the panic? That it *is* fully out of my control?\n\nMy apologies, I'm not having a go at you OP, I'm getting frustrated at my doctors all over again. If breathing worked I wouldn't have self medicated with alcohol to the point where I am 33 and my prognosis is &lt;17 years. \n\nWhen is surviving more important than quality of life? Why is your quality of life left in the hands of people who don't understand or even care.\n\nI'm medicated now. But it's come a smidge too late unfortunately. \n\nI love the advice, and I sincerely hope it helps people. But for those it doesn't please don't medicate yourself like I did. Fight for your life. \n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π\n\nI understand what you mean. My HR gets close to 200 bpm at least once a day because of my panic attacks and it's hard to tell myself my heart won't stop or fail. I'm currently not medicated and drank for about a decade which only made it worse over time. I can't get past the few weeks that meds make my anxiety and panic attacks worse.\n\nHave you tried Propranolol lovely? I couldn't believe how much it helped me.\n\nI'm on 10mg as a PRN. As soon as my heart's as little fast I pop one. Had an ECHO, ECG and Holter all come back normal except for intermittent tachycardia - which is either a symptom of or a cause of panic. Either way, beta-blockers have been a life changer\n\nYes I've been on that, metropolol and now I'm on labatelol. I had 4 holters, an echo and a tilt table test and they saw my HR as high as 184 but told me it's not a heart issue and maybe anxiety. I've had panic attacks since I was 17 and I'm 25 now. My panic attacks if that's what these are feel way worse and last a lot longer.\n\nMine started at 17 too! \n\nBut I remember having one when I was 6. I was running on the playground at school laughing and next thing I felt like I couldn't breathe and I was being rushed to hospital. They thought asthma but nope.\n\nI have a theory it has to do with my stomach and my vagus nerve. I have done so much (re search - can't say the word here) it's insane. I have a small hiatus hernia I treat with a proton-pump inhibitor. But when it pushes up my heart begins to race and I start panicking. \n\nI'm trying to find someone who will take my 'search seriously. Everyone I've talked to has these exact same symptoms - Stomach issues and a racing heart. \n\nDo you find pacing and stretching backwards - diaphragm area to release pressure - helps at all?\n\nI don‚Äôt ever log in to Reddit but I need to tell you that this just made me start bawling. Sobbing. I haven‚Äôt cried in so long and I feel so alone with this trying to pretend like I‚Äôm not scared but it‚Äôs hell. No one in my life would say something this compassionate to me and I needed to hear it. I try to hide my fear from people, but I really, really needed this. I needed you. Thank you whoever you are. Came online cause I was so passionate about working out before a panic that changed my life- I‚Äôm trying to get back to normal, but I‚Äôm so aware of my heartbeat when I workout. Thank you again.\n\nIm in my worst form of anxiety for the past week and it helps me to see how you got everything spot on. All the problems that i think i have you basically listed it all out. Thank you so much to know that I am not alone\n\nThank you. So much. I very specifically needed this at this moment. Love you, stranger.\n\nthank you for this. literally truly from the bottom of my heart thank you\n\nI just say fuck it now. Idc! Let‚Äôs go death bring it!\n\nThank you so much. I‚Äôm scared sometimes my panic attacks will stress my heart out too much\n\nI have them multiple times a day pulse getting close to 200 and my cardiologist and Drs always say it won't kill me. I think we will be okay. Our hearts are resilient.\n\nThankk you!!\n\nThank you for this\n\nthank you\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you!\n\nI'm dealing with this atm, 2 hrs before bed (5 hrs ago now)-I thought I got a little piece of a turkey sub stuck in my throat. Didn't cough anything up, drank water and carbonated drinks and ate a banana with no problem. I can breathe fine both thru my nose abd mouth. But every couple days it's like something different will take me out. Please does anyone have any suggestions\n\nI have a fear of choking (due to choking before) everytime I eat I have an anxiety attack and think I‚Äôm choking. Sucks but I think I‚Äôm getting a little better I‚Äôm so happy I found this sub.\n\nI had similar the other day, where I swallowed some food quickly without chewing it properly for 2 days I thought I couldn't eat and could feel food going down my throat and getting stuck. I decided to try and distract myself whilst eating and not paying so much attention to it and it did help me to be fair. If only I could do this with other sensations I feel üò™  hope this helps. I also sipped water after food to make sure it had gone down.\n\nThank you\n\nGod, I often need to remind myself of that. And keep going. Keeping going is the way.\n\nThank you I definitely needed this.\n\nThanks. Just back from doctor as spiralling. Thanks for the reminder. Breathe, enjoy life and stay calm\n\nThank you.\n\nI've been stuck in a spell of health anxiety for a bit now, and reading this made me cry right now. I just was wandering through YouTube videos on anxiety and things and wondered if there was a reddit for it and this was the first post I see. This was exactly what I needed to read. It gets so hard to get out of the fears stuck inside the mind sometimes, it's nice to see that others feel the same way and know what to say. Thank you.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nStay strong everyone I‚Äôve experienced this 2 times now just do what the doctor tells you to do I understand your pain and the hell you‚Äôre experiencing but I promise you it‚Äôll be okay you‚Äôre not alone at all it might seem that way but you‚Äôre not if you need someone to talk to about this please don‚Äôt hesitate to dm me my DM‚Äôs are always open ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nSo I‚Äôm not one to deal with anxiety like others. I‚Äôve maybe experienced it a few times and nothing crazy. But my girlfriend does experience it quite often and I do my best to help. She has health anxiety I think I really don‚Äôt know but she mostly worries about herself and her body. As if she could have a heart attack or something which I highly doubt cause she‚Äôs been tested and told she is completely okay. I‚Äôm just looking for ways to help her maybe even give her a sense of calmness in the moment. She does wanna get help but won‚Äôt take the step so maybe if I can help some and then let her know someone in this profession could do so much more than I could. Thank you for reading and I appreciate any feedback. I hope you all are going okay :) you guys got this\n\nFor me I want to get help but I am too scared that doctors will find something bad, and/or I end up having to medicate with lots of pills daily, maybe this is part of it for ur gf?\n\nBeing there and supporting her and letting her know she is not a burden on you is the best you can do imo. My partner listens to my concerns and opens my mind to other things  \n\nFor example if I am panicking that I have a serious life-threatening stomach issue, my partner says ‚ÄúHey, we will look out for that and get it checked if you want to, but what you ate earlier didn‚Äôt agree with you in the past so maybe it‚Äôs that‚Äù and in a weird way, just audibly hearing the suggestion of less extreme possibilities calms me, even though my head is telling me the worst case scenario. \n\nMost importantly you are there for her, that‚Äôs amazing.\n\nThank you very much. And she doesn‚Äôt seem to have a problem with the doctors and I also don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever thought about that with the doctors but I‚Äôm not sure. I know multiple times she‚Äôd gone to the doctor on her behalf. So I‚Äôm not sure why she won‚Äôt take the step. And I‚Äôm not gonna push her to or make her of course just wish she‚Äôd get the help she needs\n\nSeeking help and talking about it outside of your relationship can definitely be hard, hope she builds the courage to seek the help she needs/wants. Wishing you both the best! It‚Äôs messed up how bad health anxiety can make you feel physically and mentally\n\nThanks for sharing those words, feeling like you‚Äôre not alone definitely helps.\n\nI hope this helps a lot of people!\n\nI've always called that the 'feeling of impending doom', and I have it just about every day!!!\n\nI just had a scary dream that my mom told me I would die this week\n\nI needed to see this,Thank you. So I live in a high crime area. I am a first time father. Who tries to be the light in a dark place. Everyday I deal with thinking \"what if something happens because I am a genuine person\" \"What if those people that wanted to kill my unborn son and mother of child and me try to do something that will take me from them or vise versa because I stood my ground and protected my family\" I feel like I deal with more anxiety than I should, when I was 14 I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, I am now 25. Between God , the support of my family, and my anxiety meds. I wish I could say it is completely gone. But it is more so just bandaged up/slightly more manageable than it was and I know it most likely never will be fully \"gone\" . I wish it could just go away, I have tried counseling and just about everything under the sun. But it is genuinely a everyday battle. With everything that has happened in my life I still stay positive and try not to let my anxiety show or dictate my life. Sometimes it is hard. Sometimes it is easy. I finally found me a doctor that is willing to help me manage my anxiety, before the meds it was pure hell everyday. It was hell for my fiancee to see me distraught an a anxious, panicky mess with no way to help me. It was hell on me because it was keeping me from being my genuine self.The example I gave of my anxiety is only a small portion of why I have anxiety. If I was to go into all of it on here, I would be typing on here forever.¬†\n\nThank you üò≠üò≠ü•π I found this post just after I got home from the ER for thinking I had a blood clot in my leg‚Ä¶..my oxygen was a little low and blood pressure a little high. The lower oxygen saturation level is still freaking me out not going to lie. I wonder if anxiety can cause lower oxygen saturation??¬†\n\nHow low is it?\n\nWas 93% when I left the hospital. It got a little lower but they said it coulda been cuz I was moving my hand that had the pulse oximeter on. They sent me home¬†\n\nThat's not too bad. If they didn't find anything wrong then you should be okay.\n\nThank you for the reassurance üíñ\n\nI‚Äôm also pregnant and have mild COPD. I just found it odd cuz every other time it was 97-100%.¬†\n\nThis brought tears to my eyes. I thank you for this post.¬†\n\nThank you. Each and every person who has given me a simple comment like ‚Äúoh that sounds terrible‚Äù makes me feel like I‚Äôm not alone and that people understand me. That nobody is judging me. Thank you.\n\nThank you! It's a reminder I'll repeat in my head.¬†\n\nI have a success story myself that I like to share with others. It may not be the best solution for everyone but worked for me. I used to get the irrational fear of death a lot when I was a young kid. I was diagnosed with depression and something to do with dysphoria, maybe dysthymia. Medication seemed to help. I went off meds for years. All the sudden for no reason at all one day my heart started racing, I felt like I was having a heart attack but realized I was far too young for that to be rational. Those negative feelings I used to get all came back. I went to my Dr and they had me try the same meds I used to take. For some strange reason they made me worse. I did a ton of research online and realized these were all symptoms of an anxiety disorder. To this day I still don‚Äôt understand why my doctors never brought this up when I was a kid. Especially when it is very common when having a depressive disorder. I went to see a psychiatrist. He asked me a ton of questions. I answered honestly, and explained that the symptoms to me seemed to be very obvious to do with anxiety. I was against going back on meds but he talked me into it. I‚Äôm glad he did as they made me so much better. He had me set goals to help improve myself. Eventually he discharged me and said to just continue getting meds from my physician. I was always welcomed back if things didn‚Äôt work out. Luckily the physicians I have had have been great.\n\nI needed to see this. My anxiety was under control for months but between going through a break up, issues at work , grad school the symptoms are coming back . Trying to get back under control with walks in nature and taking supplements¬†\n\nThank you ‚ù§Ô∏èI needed to hear this at 1am cause I can‚Äôt sleep due to the fear of dying of a heart attack or some lung disease üòû\n\nthank you üò≠\n\nYou guys, isn‚Äôt it weird that it seems like we‚Äôve all been having this kind of anxiety at the same time? I remember when my anxiety first started, like a couple years ago, I didn‚Äôt see as many posts like this. I Google stuff like this every couple of months when I‚Äôm at my worst and I‚Äôve been seeing more and more relatable new posts like this. I feel like something has been causing more and more people to have health anxiety like this, with a fear of dropping dead.\n\nBut I will eventually, eventually we all do. Fait accompli.\n\nYes. Death is inevitable but maybe you didn't get the point. This is for ppl dying everyday because of health anxiety.\n\nThat‚Äôs fair enough it is VERY real\n\nI‚Äôm so tired üôÅ\n\nYou will die. Just not right now. This statement is so unrealistic. No, of course.. we will all live forever. *Eyeroll*\n\nMy mom had a clogged artery, had surgery and stroke some time later, had brain surgery for a tumor and eventually died with complications in the hospital ultimately due to cardiac arrest at the age of 42. It happens. She was sick for several years.\n\nShe never complained why me but instead carried her cross and would give praise to God and say the rosary often. A truly remarkable woman and mother.\n\nI am 41\n\nIt‚Äôs been messing with my mind past few years.\n\nI choose to find peace through spiritual growth, God and fellowship. Then I must practice, complete surrender and acceptance. \n\nThe MRI and EKG tests says I‚Äôm in good health.\n\nFinally, I need to lay out the caffeine because I realize when I drink too much it makes me feel super uneasy or leads to a panic attack"

    "all_comment_text": "Great British Bake Off &amp; Joe Pera Talks With You\n\n+1 for Great British Bake Off, it‚Äôs the best relaxing reality show\n\nI love great British bake off. They‚Äôre all so supportive to each other.\n\nIt‚Äôs so unlike every other reality show that‚Äôs aggro and in-your-face. Supportive, educational, good-natured humor, whimsical pleasant music, and you get to watch delicious desserts being made. Sometimes I struggle with eating and this show calms me down and makes me hungry! It‚Äôs just so delightful.\n\nSeconding Joe Pera! Such a comfort show.\n\nGreat British Bake Off is a good shout! Just be careful though, I kept craving desserts whenever I watch it üòÇ\n\nBobs burgers is my go to show when I‚Äôm anxious\n\nNothing else is close to brightening my mood as much as the Belchers.\n\ncurrently rewatching bobs burgers‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π\n\nTotally the right answer. The only cartoon sitcom with a family that actually seems to love each other. And the writing is soooo spot on\n\n100% this. The Belchers restore my faith in humanity on the regular.\n\nSeconded\n\nPretty sure my neighbors know the BB ukelele intro by heart at this point.\n\nMe too!\n\nAdventure Time\n\nI watch this when I‚Äôm really deep in my anxiety and nothing else feels right. Such a lovely little show\n\nI like The Midnight Gospel, which is another Pendleton Ward show, as well\n\nnot The Bear üò≠\n\ngod its SUCH an incredible show but ive never been more on edge watching a series than watching this one üò≠ the christmas episode in season 2 especially üíÄ good lord\n\nI had to take vape breaks omgg\n\nthats why its such a good show. you really feel like youre a line cook üòÇ\n\nYeaaaa that ones anxiety inducing but it‚Äôs a favorite of mine. The sad part is I started it recently with my ex and so not only do I not want to be reminded of time we would‚Äôve spent together but the show itself is so chaotic lmao\n\nThe Golden Girls\n\nIt‚Äôs like visiting some old friends.\n\nThank you for being a friend\n\nI'll bring the cheesecake ^__^\n\nFuturama. That‚Äôs my go to show when I feel down and just want something to relax to.\n\nBut not THAT episode. üò≠\n\nWHICH that episode? Jurassic Bark or Luck of the Fryrish? Or Game of Tones?\n\nJurassic Bark.\n\nThe only episode I avoid truly\n\nThe Good Place is an easy watch.  Also liked ‚Äúonly murders in the building‚Äù\n\nI absolutely loved ‚Äúonly murders in this building‚Äù!!! I may try the good place specifically cuz u mentioned that show haha\n\nThe Good Place is AMAZINGGGG - also I have severe anxiety and panic disorder but loved Dexter, it keeps reeling you in for more\n\ni was gonna suggest dexter but i was worried it was gonna be too dark LMAO\n\nYou might want to look for other ‚Äúcozy mystery‚Äù series if you like OMITB. The old Hercule Poirot series, Miss Marple, that kind of thing\n\nI waited so long to watch the The Good Place, don‚Äôt know why. I LOVED it. I also really loved Only Murders.\n\nLoved the show! But the ending made me anxious\n\nHighly recommend the good place! It makes you think but not enough for you to be anxious and it is so well made and there are so many details it's my comfort show\n\ni‚Äôm not saying that this will work for everyone but TGP (pretty much) cured my (very very severe) death anxiety. something about that last episode brought me a lot of peace\n\nThe last episode was truly beautiful i sobbed and laughed\n\ni think it‚Äôs probably my favorite finale of any show i‚Äôve watched\n\nMe too i still feel all of the emotions just thinking about it\n\nThe good place hits you in your feelings at the end, though. So, it depends on whether OP wants to get emotionally involved or not.\n\nBoth are absolutely amazing shows I love them so muchhhh. Absolutely recommended! It has found family vibe, OMIB feels super cozy and the comedy aspect of both is pretty great. I love the philosophy bits from good place and what the show is getting on so much. Both also got that \"we're in deep shit and we're gonna make fun anyway\" vibe, which I appreciate, ESPECIALLY when anxious. \n\nBased on these two I think good old M\\*A\\*S\\*H goes a long way - found family, humor as coping mechanism and cool characters. Never watched the least episode tho. For me, M\\*A\\*S\\*H never ended.\n\nMy all time fav, Schitts creek\n\n+1 for schitt‚Äôs creek, +1 for all time fave\n\nYou fold it in\n\nIf you say fold it in one more time!\n\nIt‚Äôs YOUR recipe!!\n\nThis show gives me anxiety\n\nOh really, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking why? I mentioned it cuz for me personally it‚Äôs the one show that helped my anxiety lol\n\nCan I ask what part of it triggers your anxiety? Just curious as I see it as being extremely wholesome and soothing when I‚Äôm anxious. So interesting it can have the complete opposite effect\n\nI guess I just find the behaviours of the cast stressful.\n\nas someone who adores schitts creek, i have to be in the mood for it. it gives off a strange dystopian vibe for me at times !! üòÖ\n\nThis is an oldie, but \"I love Lucy\" it's a really funny show :) it's in black and white and it's from the 1950's but it's a comfort show for me ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI go between I Love Lucy, the Dick Van Dyke Show, and Mary Tyler Moore.\n\nCommunity is my go-to‚Ä¶\n\nBut‚Ä¶ Joe Pera Talks With You is pretty fucking calming..\n\nyessss Community is my comfort show!!! Alongside Bob‚Äôs Burgers when I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep\n\nMy go to is nature documentaries.\n\nLittle Bear üêª \n\nIt‚Äôs a very old cartoon but it helps me sleep. It only plays classical music. Try it!\n\nOoooh, in the same genre, Nana‚Äôlan is really comforting. Also old Mr. Rogers episodes\n\nDerry girls\n\nI never laughed more at the first episode than I did when watching Derry Girls pilot. It's so funny and I love how all the anxieties the girls have are relatable but at the same time laughable. Makes you feel better about your own.\n\nTed Lasso, The Office, Silicon Valley\n\nSeconding Ted Lasso here. It has helped me so much and I‚Äôm honestly devastated that they only had 3 seasons üò≠\n\nsuperstore, abbott elementary üòä\n\nAbbott Elementary‚Äîthe best! I‚Äôm a retired teacher‚Äîso it his home‚Äîcan‚Äôt wait for new season\n\nOne of the fee shows that have made me scream out loud in laughter on a regular basis.\n\nthe joy of painting (bob ross show)\n\nI recently been using this show as a comfort show.\n\nYES!  Bob Ross is the best.\n\nI rewatch shows I loved as a kid! iCarly, good luck Charlie, like those :) or even just cartoons\n\nThe Office and Schitts Creek. If you can access Canadian, Corner Gas and Kim‚Äôs Convenience.\n\nThe Office is the absolute opposite for me, I cannot watch it without anxiety and second hand embarrassment. Even thinking about some episodes that I‚Äôve never even watched, like that one where the guy offers to pay for colleges or whatever, makes me stressed.\n\nLove Kim's Convenience!\n\nSuperstore :)\n\nI was gonna comment this. Watched it when I started buspar. Finished season 6 maybe 4 days ago and crushed\n\nThere's something about how not seriously everybody are taking the job that's just absolutely hilarious. It's also a bit like... if The Office was set in a superstore? \n\nRe-watched it last time I got heavily re-triggered and thrown into a vicious anxiety cycle for a month.\n\nNew Girl. Its my comfort show\n\nCame here to say this!\n\nThe middle is one of my comfort shows\n\nI was just thinking of rewatching The Middle again!\n\nThe office¬†\n\nI get really bad secondhand embarrassment - every Micheal Scott scene **increases** my anxiety.\n\nYou‚Äôve just helped me realize why I have a hard time enjoying the show\n\nYes and Parks and Rec as well.\na lot of shows from the 90s and 2000s are great shows to watch and feel like you're in your happy place.\nFrasier, Cougar Town, Gilmore Girls, Seinfeld, Boy Meets World, Will &amp; Grace.\n\nI loved the Blue Skies USA era shows: Royal Pains, Suits, Covert Affairs, Monk, Burn Notice, White Collar.... there are some intense scenes but everything has a happy ending and the characters are so likable, they don't have that saccharine vibe that for example Hallmark movies do which to me are unwatchable.\n\nAlso I like Bravo reality shows, but that's a bit of minefield these days. I like the early episodes of Southern Charm and Vanderpump Rules, Below Deck Sailing Yacht just skip season 1\n\nIDK why but I always have this weird fast talking witty mood after watching Gilmore girls that I call a Gilmore hangover.\n\nGood except the intro song drives me insane üòÇ\n\nThe ultimate comfort show ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThis used to be mine but I relate too closely and it makes me anxious about the next workday lol\n\nbroad city\n\nLOVE LOVE LOVE Broad City\n\nshark tank\n\nStar Trek is my comfort show. Any series.  The optimism and idea that the future might not suck after all,  makes me feel better about things.\n\nYes! Star trek is so optimistic and predictable you know everyone is going to be ok (unless like the actor leaves and they need a reason or something) but I love voyager with all my heart.\n\nI like watching shit reality dating shows like Love Island. I also like below deck, 90 day fiance. But the genre isn't for everyone lol. These shows kinda took me out of my \"let's have a glass of wine before bed\" phase, and now I just watch some trash TV and pass out ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è plus there's some fun subreddits on here to gossip about these shows\n\nI‚Äôve been re-watching below deck and just started love island. Ig I just wanted more of an official drama to watch with a plot and everything, but those shows are pretty fun and entertaining too I def love those!\n\nI have been loving watching kdramas when my anxiety is high. Surprisingly, having to read subtitles helps to keep my attention on the show rather than the thoughts spiraling in my head.  \n\nThere‚Äôs a lot on Netflix these days.  For slice of life, I liked Hometown Cha Cha Cha. Action/fantasy - Alchemy of Souls, Rom/com - King the Land.  Historical/fantasy - Mr. Queen.\n\nYes! Another K-Drama fan ^~^\n\nGrace and Frankie!!\n\nThis one actually increased my anxiety. Even though it was a show I‚Äôve watched and didn‚Äôt have an issue with before. The life changes and getting older is what triggered me.\n\nOh God me too. I was horrified that you can be misled in a relationship and it didn‚Äôt help that the guy I was dating at the time kept telling me about how he wondered about his sexuality for ages and I was like Huh‚Ä¶ you all clear on that now ? Haha\n\nFrasier\n\nFrasier got me through a panic attack when I was on vacation last year.\n\nfriends, the oc, ANNE WITH AN E, suits, outerbanks, modern family\n\nOh I loved Anne with an E. It was such a soothing show. I still wish for more seasons.\n\nyes to modern family 100%! hilarious beginning to end every episode.\n\ni'm still mad they cancelled anne with an e.... but i'm such a sucker for period dramas/series i watched it 3-4x\n\nAnne With An E made me so sad and frusrated at times, I had to stop watching üò≠\n\n90% of cooking and competition shows work for me. There isn‚Äôt a big story you have to become invested in and it‚Äôs something you can put on and multitask too.\n\nfriends and sex and the city are my comfort shows!!! i‚Äôve rewatched them both hundreds of times and always will. also LOVE game and house shows. family feud, jeopardy, and house hunters have gotten me through some rough patches \n\ni also have some youtubers that help me calm down but they‚Äôre romance booktubers so probably not for everyone lol. when i had a really bad panic attack one time i turned on bob ross and that really helped\n\nSouth Park is my comfort show, especially the old episodes.\n\nAmerican Dad is my ‚Äúturn off my brain show‚Äù\n\nFor some reason jersey shore üòÖ it‚Äôs so engaging it takes my mind off of my anxiety\n\nI've been loving my rewatch of Psych. It's *technically* a crime solving series but there's almost no blood and it's super lighthearted.\n\nAlways sunny\n\nI'm on my second time watching it all the way through and it always gets me laughing or at least briefly thinking about something else. Patiently awaiting a new season. ü§ûüèª\n\nFriends is my go to whenever my anxiety is bad.\n\nAbsolutely seconding this. It's my plane trip series (I have a bit of fear of flights).\nIt's been my anti anxiety show for decades now.\n\nFull Bloom. There‚Äôs only two seasons, and it‚Äôs a floral arrangement competition show. Suuuuuuper wholesome. All the contestants want each other to win and you learn a lot about flowers in the process!\n\nI have been enjoying Reba on Netflix. Something that doesn‚Äôt make me think.\n\nPsych is my ultimate comfort show. I've seen the series through at least 10 times. I absolutely love it.\n\nYES!  The blueberry!!\n\nAll Creatures Great &amp; Small\n\nSchitt's Creek\n\nGilmore Girls\n\nFrasier\n\nFrasier!\n\nimpractical jokers always cheers me up\n\nModern Family\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nsex and the city is the best breakup remedy\n\nSeriously!! It‚Äôs a nice reminder that dating is hard and it‚Äôs okay.\n\nThe West Wing, Will &amp; Grace\n\nLove the West Wing, it‚Äôs definitely comforting for me\n\nHaven‚Äôt seen it mentioned my go to easy comfort shoe is Gilmore girls. Such a cozy show with some humor and some light life issues. Nothing triggers or serious really but entertaining. It‚Äôs about a single mother and her daughter living together, the daughter goes to a nice private school and her mom is kinda kooky in an endearing way.\n\nMy second go to comfort and my husbands is community. Kinda cheesy light hearted comedy about a group of adults going to community college. Has some big names and is funny is a cheesy humor way. Nothing too serious but there is character growth.\n\nrupauls dragrace is my silly show :)\n\nany of the planet earth/planet earth adjacent stuff is always great.\n\nI‚Äôve been watching Monk, and I‚Äôm not upset about it. Mr. Monk is adorable.\n\nSpongeBob? Lol you can never go wrong\n\nIf you have a science-y bent and like explosions, *Mythbusters*.\n\nFriends has gotten me through so many panic attacks. How I Met Your Mother also helped a lot recently.\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm\n\nOh God no. This show is pure cringe and makes me insanely anxious.\n\nI think it‚Äôs light and funny!\n\nI watch superstore on Hulu, married at first sight on Hulu or Netflix, I loved the rainn wilson show I think it was called pursuit of happiness, and I love watching crappy documentaries on cults I can google the cult so I know the whole story while watching it‚Äôs just interesting to hear from those involved\n\nBrooklyn 99\n\nMy little pony\n\nLots of recs but right now Brooklyn nine nine is my go to\n\nOh my god, I forgot, BROOKLYN NINE NINE\n\n[deleted]\n\nOne of my all time favs! But sometimes it makes my health anxiety a little worse üòÖ\n\nOh no, my friend, not for me. It makes my health anxiety rear its head, especially during the animations where they show diseases progressing through the body/what‚Äôs happening in the veins etc. I LOVE Dr. House as a character though and he always makes me chuckle.\n\nI go back to the sitcoms of my childhood for times like that. For me that would be Growing Pains, Who‚Äôs the Boss, Perfect Strangers, Family Matters, etc.\n\nRegular show!\n\nWorking Moms! It‚Äôs so hilarious\n\nI've been binge watching Criminal Minds. Yes, it's crime, but the storylines are systematic,  I know what to expect. It's what helps me as I'm holding together a job, a break up, family issues.\n\nKing of the Hill, Adventure Time, American Dad, The Simpsons, Futurama, and lately It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia are my go to shows. Pretty sure I've seen them all 100's of times through but they're great background shows.\n\n‚ú®Bluey ‚ú®\n\nlove island, the summer I turned pretty, new girl, sex and the city, how I met your mother, friends\n\nsecond new girl!\n\nLove Island can be quite triggering\n\nMy go-tos are Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Arrested Development.\n\nI know it‚Äôs random, but if I need mindless hilarity, I rewatch Kenny Vs. Spenny or An Idiot Abroad.\n\nThe Great, What We Do In The Shadows\n\nGolden Girls and Bluey always make me smile.\n\nResident Alien!\n\nMy go-to‚Äôs that I can always count on are the office, superstore, modern family (I watch this when I need a good cry, it‚Äôs so wholesome), great British baking show, and any cooking shows like master chef!!\n\nI will also watch most dumb reality shows that aren‚Äôt centered around relationships (a current trigger for me) like old dumb TLC shows (think cake boss, toddlers and tiaras, my strange addiction, little women, etc.)\n\nAll of these have very few triggers (personally) so they are super easy to put on, have a little laugh, have them on in the background, etc.!\n\nIf I‚Äôm somewhere without my laptop or tv, I will watch Facebook videos lol, typically short clips from different tv shows that can be good when I only have my phone or when I need to switch what I‚Äôm watching every few minutes lol\n\nHope this helps!!\n\nDefinitely Modern Family\n\nBobs burgers. It‚Äôs literally the only thing I watched for a couple months when my anxiety was at its worst\n\nI‚Äôm so glad to see many of my comfort shows on this list. For me it‚Äôs: \n\nCartoons: SpongeBob, the powerpuff girls, adventures of Billy and Mandy, Bluey, Daria, The Amazing world of Gumball. \n\nRegular tv: Modern Family, the Office, the Middle, wizards of waverly place\n\nDocumentary: Joys of Painting, How it‚Äôs Made, Life Below Zero, any insect documentary \n\nYouTube: Hextian, Juno Birch, ASMR hair videos, Rain sound videos (mostly for the purpose of sleeping)\n\nI‚Äôve been watching Community on repeat for almost year before bed now. It‚Äôs just so dumb and nothing.\n\nhonestly when i‚Äôm feeling depressed or anxious i watch the kardashians. it‚Äôs mindless tv. i could list a few more too.\n\ngravity falls\nany disney show you liked as a kid‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nDawson‚Äôs Creek helps me fall asleep for some reason\n\nScooby doo\n\nthe people at collegehumor rebranded as dropout tv and they have made so much quality tv, when i feel anxious I turn on either Make Some Noise or Um Actually\n\nVeep! They go through dramatic situations once in a while but it‚Äôs never not comedic as hell\n\nThe Office \nFrasier\nSeinfeld \nGolden Girls\nFamily Matters\n\nBroad City!!\n\nRaising Hope\n\nThe Nanny!\n\nBelow Deck is my go to!\n\nThese are my comfort shows.  They never steer me wrong.  They fill noise in the background yet provide a bit of clarity along the way.  No judgment.  Just love and acceptance.  We‚Äôve all been there.  And they‚Äôre no different.  They‚Äôll provide a good laugh when needed and a kick in the ass too, if that‚Äôs needed. And they‚Äôll always mend your soul. üôåüèªü´°üíï I‚Äôm always happy and grateful after I watch some of these masterpieces. üòçü§™ü•∏ü•≥ü´∂üèªü•∞\n\nFriends\n\nThe office\n\nThe Golden Girls\n\nModern Family\n\nSchitts Creek\n\nSchitt‚Äôs Creek ü§åüèº\n\nIt‚Äôs already been said but The Joy of Painting. Bob‚Äôs voice is just so soothing.\n\nI like monk, pretty little liars, bobs burgers, king of the hill, grace and Frankie is hilarious lol\n\nTravelling Robert on Youtube got me through some of the worst anxiety of my life.  His accent is soothing, the content and pace predictable, and if you ever wanted to feel like traveling without ever leaving home, it's one of the best full experiences you could have. He writes all his own music and it's all very relaxing stuff.  I listen to it from time to time when I want to relax and reminisce on my own travels.\n\n I've watched dozens upon dozens of his videos and even on the one or two incidents of conflict or strife he experiences, he covers it from an angle that doesn't stress the viewer.\n\nThe Repair Shop.  It's set in England and it's a lovely group of people who specialize in different aspects of furniture/object restoration and it's so chill and relaxed.\n\nReal Housewives of Salt Lake City, season 4. You don‚Äôt need to start from season 1 if you don‚Äôt want to. Trust me - it‚Äôs kooky.\n\nSorry you‚Äôre going through that OP. I know it‚Äôs rough. I‚Äôm processing a breakup too. Can‚Äôt believe several comments here suggested dating shows, I don‚Äôt know about you but the last thing I want to see right now is other people‚Äôs romances. \n\nFor light watching maybe comedy? Simpsons seasons 2-9, Community, Office, Parks and Rec, Etc. \n\nFor me I like stuff that is a little more addictive. I find it‚Äôs a better distraction. Please note these shows are not low anxiety per se, but I found them to be a good distraction to help get through the night: Severance, Mrs. Davis, Silo, Sugar\n\nJulia, it's such a feel good series\n\nThe Good Place!\n\nGilmore Girls, Parks and Recreation, Derry Girls\n\n‚ÄúAnne with an E‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis is Us‚Äù\n\nThe office, new girl, atypical, Gilmore girls, superstore\n\nLove Island if you don't mind laughing from cringe, The Office of course, Bob's Burgers, Pucca, maybe some gaming YouTubers as well like Good Griefs, Berleezy, CoryxKenshin, Dashie, yada yada yada.\n\nMy comfort shows are Friends, Chef‚Äôs Table, Parks &amp; Rec, The Office &amp; Sex and the City. I‚Äôve watched them more times than I remember and always hit the right spot. Another one that made me full of fuzzy warm feelings was Heartstopper. These get me through the good days and the really dark ones too. \n\nCooking shows in general that focus on the actual cooking and theres no one yelling or no drama. Flavourful Origins, Street Food, Pressure Cooker, Salt Fat Acid Heat, more documentary style than reality. \n\nA very wholesome reality show was Down for Love, it felt very genuine and full of positivity. But in general, reality tv I find it good as background noise if I‚Äôm in a good place mentally, but it can be triggering sometimes, I know it‚Äôs mostly scripted but it‚Äôs too much unnecessary drama and fights and it makes the anxiety worse cause I honestly can‚Äôt deal with the thought of people actually behaving like that out there in the real world. So superficial, too many games and dishonesty, zero empathy. \n\nAnd if I feel like a movie, I‚Äôll go for a good classic rom com, 10 things I hate about you, any Julia Robert‚Äôs movie, The Devil Wears Prada (or any Anne Hathaway movie for that matter) and lastly, animated Disney movies from my childhood, The Little mermaid, Lion King, Cinderella, Snow White, etc and the live action versions as well. I actually watched Bambi a couple days ago and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking if I have a daughter some day I‚Äôd love to watch them all with her and sing along.\n\nPhineas and Ferb\n\nCommunity\n\nMy go to show is American Dad. Bobs burgers is also great. Adult cartoons in general seem to keep me at ease."

    "body": "To preface, this may not work for everyone. It also sounds kind of odd. But after I got over the weird apprehension, it has been amazing to me so far. \n\nSo, often we encourage our anxious thoughts by trying to ignore them. It creates a cycle where we push it away and it comes back 10x stronger. So what you do is acknowledge the thought and assign qualities to it. \n\nFor example, I was having a health anxiety attack. I asked myself the following questions :\n-What color is this thought? (My answer: red)\n-What shape is this thought? (Spiky circle)\n-What does it remind me of? (A fire alarm)\n-What situation does this remind me of? (A fire truck racing to the scene of a fire)\n\nYou just keep asking random questions. This gives less power to the thought. It also distracts you into thinking the problem isn‚Äôt all the heavy. \n\nI have also done this to become more grounded. I usually get very anxious while trying to relax. So recently I went and got a facial and focused on the same things \n-What does this smell remind me of? (A rainy tree)\n-What situation does it remind me of? (Laying on a beach in warm sand)\n-What does it feel like? (A snowflake falling on my face)\n\nSuddenly I was able to fully ground and focus myself without any anxiety. \n\nI know it may sound weird but wow it‚Äôs helped. ",

    "all_comment_text": "Yesss, this is working very well. My mom told me the same thing and i‚Äôm trying to do it when i feel anxious. Sweet of you to tell this, there is a lot of people who don‚Äôt know this tricks :)))\n\nI guess that‚Äôs similar to what I try to do. ‚ÄúWhat can I hear right now?‚Äù (The wind in the trees outside) ‚ÄúWhat can I feel right now?‚Äù (My body on the bedsheets). Go through all my senses to ground myself essentially.\n\nI like this. I think this would work for me. Thanks for sharing. I get anxiety driving sometimes. I make up dinner party menus to distract myself. Weird, I know lol\n\nI plan birthday parties!!\n\nGlad I‚Äôm not alone!\n\nOh my gosh I thought I was the only one who does that!¬†\n\nThis works for me. Especially far off sounds that I have to concentrate to hear. \n\nI honestly have no answers for what color or shape my anxiety is. And I'd totally be annoyed at myself for asking those questions while I'm spiraling ü§£\n\nThis is one of the very few things that works for me. I learned it from a therapist who told me to touch something that ‚Äúfeels solid‚Äù (like a desk, a chair, etc) when I‚Äôm either ramping up anxiety or dissociating. For whatever reason, things made of wood really help me. They just seem kinda permanent compared to my fluctuating emotions\n\nCongrats, You're letting the origami monster unfold back to flat paper instead of solidifying into 3D form by fighting/escaping it!\n\nThat comparison genuinely made me laugh, thank you so much. \nHumor definitely helps to cope, doesn‚Äôt it?\n\nThis sounds similar to the DARE technique, encouraging you to run towards your anxiety rather than away from it. I love this idea, thanks for sharing!\n\nI‚Äôm reading DARE right now and it‚Äôs talks about not ignoring or distracting or fighting anxiety.\n\nYeah this. Finding ways to not feed / resist the anxiety but instead just allow and accept the feelings, become curious about them, defuse them, and even run toward them sometimes to prove that they don‚Äôt have power. I think a big part of the anxiety is the fear of fear. The fear of the anxious thoughts and feelings. If we can allow the anxious thoughts and feelings to exist without fearing them, it can help disarm them in a significant way I think.\n\nWish I did this YEARS AGO. Wasted a lot of time with anxiety üòü\n\nSo I tried to imagine doing this during a massage (which I tried only once, I was nervous the whole time and it was a miserable experience which I'd like to never repeat), and I'm afraid it would be like \"what does it make me feel?\" (like I'm being repeatedly stabbed. every touch is full of spikes and it's a torture and *I need to leave now now NOW NOWNOW)*.\n\nI'm not sure what it is, but somehow I'm getting the feeling actual thinking about the thing I'm currently nervous about would just make things worse.\n\nThanks! I'll try it next time :)\n\nIf this works for you, the book The Happiness Trap 2nd edition will be tremendously tremendously helpful.¬†\n\n\nThis is one of the methods in ACT, and you can do this in other ways like putting the thought to a silly melody like happy birthday, or imagining the scenario you're dreading as if in a sitcom. Like you said, to give it less power.¬†\n\n\nThe whole book is full of begginer friendly explanations of a lot of tools like this and of course much more helpful ones as well. It all builds up.¬†\n\nThe happiness trap is one of the most helpful books I‚Äôve read\n\nme too, honestly. being able to engineer and try out tools that work for you is great. the simple explanations of difficult psychology concepts is great. and the actual ACT methods are very useful.\n\nThanks for sharing\n\nThanks for sharing this, this is a new way of thinking for me, thank you!\n\nI have high hopes this will help me sleep tonight. I‚Äôve been trying so many things lately- esp when trying to relax.\n\nIf anyone hasn‚Äôt tried it there is an app called ‚ÄúHow We Feel‚Äù that can help kickoff identifying feelings. I love it and keep a daily log\n\nYes, me too! Identifies patterns, helps you correctly identify emotions, and has coping skills. Love it.\n\nLove this! Thanks for sharing! Even just thinking of how I‚Äôd do this started helping right away.\n\nThis is going to sound weird but listened to a podcast about Golf and the mental game. It was the greatest episode I listened to because Gary Waters talked about getting anxious from not having worth and if we have no worth we won‚Äôt be loved. Really opened my eyes to what is bothering me when I‚Äôm anxious for no reason.\n\nI love this, thanks for sharing. I struggle with ‚Äúname 5 things‚Äù but this seems like it would actually engage my mind\n\nAs somebody with Synesthesia, I adore this.  Thank you so much.  I just tried it and it shifted me to thinking about the colors of all my thoughts and I felt a lot better.\n\nInteresting technique! Giving anxious thoughts characteristics can help defuse their power.¬†\n\nMy anxiety is so strong that all these questions will me me even more anxious because its very obvious that you re trying to distract yourself from something that is still ongoing.\n\nWhat kind of questions would I start asking myself if, say, I was in the grocery store and feeling the onset?\n\nFind an item in the grocery store. Say, an orange. Make the orange your comfort item. Think of other things that are that color, that have that smell, situations where you had an orange or something that reminds you of the vibe of sweet citrus. Feel it in your hands, is it cold and bumpy? What other things feel like that? What other things are that size? Do this for all the items you come across. Repeat and repeat. \n\nWhat‚Äôs the thing that gets you about grocery stores? Is it noise, people, overstimulation? What does that feel like and where do you feel it? Is your anxiety warm in your chest? What else makes your chest feel warm? A nice blanket on a cold day? \n\nThe point being, find comfort in what makes you uncomfortable.\n\nThank you ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nthanks for sharing!!\n\nThe best thing I EVER heard was not to compare a good day or mine to ANYONE elses. So if I‚Äôm having an anxious day but can still manage to shower‚Ä¶celebrate that. Etc‚Ä¶\n\nLife changing\n\nIt does sound weird but you know what, I like it. Seems like a great way to help free the mind. Personally I start to exercise or work on one of my many hobbies then I lose focus on feeling anxious.¬†\n\nI gotta try this! Thank you\n\nYes!!! Mindfulness.¬†\n\nAn interesting technique. I'll be sure to give it a try. Thank you."

    "all_comment_text": "Real. I ask myself the same thing everyday, cry about it and try to \"live\" after.\n\nThe saddest part is when you're younger, you think it'll just magically get better, but you slowly realize it's actually getting worse even with fighting back. \n\nThen you think how the fuck are people living happy and seem anxiety free when I don't feel any happiness. My emotions are literally anxiety, fear, worry, depression, paranoia and anger.\n\nThis! My happiness is when theres a temporary absence of dread.\n\nYo. Wow, yes.¬†\n\nExactly how I'm feeling rn. At 10 I thought it would get better when I'll be 15, at 15 I thought it'll get better when I'm 20. I'm gonna be 20 next year and my anxiety is significantly worse.\n\nThat's usually how it goes.\n\ni relate sooo much\n\nYa need to go inpatient or see a psychiatrist or atleast go to a pcp I recommend a psychiatrist inpatient so they can get you a diagnoses.....I know how dreadful life is and how you're stomach feels daily I myself have generalized anxiety disorder and mdd other docs growing up it was social anxiety disorder......get yourself some help right away\n\nYes I agree with this.¬† I've had anxiety and GAD for several decades. I recently got rxd propranolol for my anxiety and rapid heart beat. I didn't want to be on benzos too long, so this was a good alternative.¬† I also checked my magnesium levels and now take a good magnesium supplement every night with dark cherry juice to relax and help sleep.¬† It's a daily battle y'all you HAVE to find a way.¬† Keep trying different therapies and treatments until you find the right one.¬† Best wishes to all.\n\n¬†I used to feel the same but I realized that if nothing is done to fix the problem, the only thing that changes is time, things don't necessarily change just because time does\n\nYup\n\nDamn real\n\nanxiety puts u into fight or flight mode. And exercise‚Ä¶well it gives u the flight your body thinks it needs. Doesnt address ur root cause cos ur mind has associated something with fight or flight, figuring out that and breaking that association takes therapy. But exercise‚Ä¶.works like a charm.\n\nit's not a cure, and sometimes meds are necessary ( and not a failing or weekness any more than getting a cast on a broken leg ), sometimes therapy will do the trick, sometimes both or all of these... but a good bit of cardio certainly does take the edge off... been listening to audio books on the exercise bike several times a week...\n\nalso worth looking into... cbd tincture... no substitute for proper medication, but a lot less hassle, and almost no risk* (am not a doctor, make your own choices about all of the above)\n\nNo its not. But it is a great off switch while looking into it\n\nYup... It just fits in the niche of \"i don't need much, but I do need something\" and \"but I can't afford the doctor\" or \"but the American medical system is such a cluster fuck, i'd almost rather just die\"...¬†\n\n\nLike, I have phenomenal health coverage, but the soonest diagnosis psychologist is booked 9-12 months out...\n\nHonestly, CBD is absolutely a replacement for medications. I have tried nearly every combo of SSRI, SNRI, tcas,buspar, etc. just not benzos. \n\nStudies show CBD doses for anxiety need to be around 300-600mg a day! That's a lot more than typically found in tinctures.(50mg usually)\n\n\"Evidence from human studies strongly supports the potential for CBD as a treatment for anxiety disorders: at oral doses ranging from 300 to 600 mg\" \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604171/\n\n\"These findings suggest that CBD can reduce anxiety severity and has an adequate safety profile in young people with treatment-resistant anxiety disorders.\" \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35921510/\n\n\n\nGive it a try! I've seen a significant improvement in general anxiety, panicking over small things. Only side effects are appetite stimulation, mild nausea. Can be semi expensive at those doses, but I'm soon going to buy some CBD isolate and make my own high potency tincture!\n\nThe whole \"What Does the Research Say So Far?\" section is them basically saying \"it's either ineffective or low enough efficacy it's undetectable in studies to date\"\n\n\n\nI use it all the time... But I suspect a dose like that is not one i could also function with... As is I don't use it during work most of the time because it makes me just a bit fuzzier and I can't do the highly technical stuff that I need to for work\n\n\n\nMaybe if i were completely debilitated instead of merely miserable I could just down the whole bottle for that dosage and sleep the day off, but I don't know that that's exactly safe, and prescription meds have to pass extremely rigorous medical trials with a enormous numbers of people to even be allowed on the market...¬†\n\n\nI'm a cbd advocate for mild cases, but it has no such assurance for safety or efficacy (especially since it's unregulated, so vendors aren't even obligated to include any cbd in their products, let alone honor the labels accurately)\n\nGranted last night I was kind of lazy with the sourcing. But research is promising, I edited my comment with better sources.\n\nyea, def worth a shot, easily accessible, safe as far as we know (but still unregulated, so, only the exact brands and doses tested in specific studies... and only from those batches... can have any certainty) comparatively cheap w/o any insurance... but I'd still heavily caution against treating it as an alternative to dr prescribed medication if that's available to you.\n\nI understand, I'm probably not the typical case of anxiety. Ssris, anything increasing serotonin or norepinephrine for me have crappy side effects. Anhedonia, naseua, avolition, chills, etc. granted ssris do treat my anxiety, but it's more like becoming numb to everything.\n\nSo having alternatives like CBD is a nice thing to be aware of.\n\nyup, no shade, I use it myself ( danodan and Wyld hemp cbd gummies ) but it would be a lot nicer if it were regulated and had any requirement around labeling, dosage, safety... etc\n\nsome DO publish lab results on good faith and you just have to trust them... so that's something\n\nExercise helps but after a while I lose the motivation. I should try making it a routine rather than an occasional activity, thank you.\n\nExercise for getting fitter i too lose motivation. But this isnt for fitness. Remember that. When ur anxiety spirals. Run! üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è \n\nAnxiety goes away. \n\nRemember that.\n\nThat's all well and good until you have a panic attack while exercising and it becomes an anxiety trigger.  really takes the wind out of your sails.\n\nWork harder. \n\nExercise never triggers anxiety.\n\nTell that to my bruised ass body after a bad session of exercising leads to, surprise, another panic attack filled with self harm\n\nwow, so helpful.\n\nI used to have an anxiety disorder and I dropped out of school 3 times and panic quit 4 jobs before I took it seriously and took the time I actually needed to heal. \nI convinced myself everyone felt what I felt, I was just worse at dealing with it. Spoiler alert: everyone does not feel that way. Health is a wild privilege tbh. \n\nUnlearning and relearning healthy emotional responses takes genuine space and time and requires that you give yourself the permission to be a work in progress. It doesn‚Äôt need to be pressure cooked, it needs to simmer. \n\nI‚Äôm now a grad student and solo backpacking Asia, my confidence sometimes has a shadow but nothing holds me back anymore. You can do it, I promise. You deserve to own yourself again. Get help, and get married to your mental health, it‚Äôs the most important commitment you‚Äôll ever make. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWere pharmaceutical meds involved in your growth/healing, if you don't mind sharing? I have tremendous objections to them but have reached a point where I plan to try them again.\n\nCipralex (Lexapro) saved my life. Best thing I could have ever done was getting started on it.\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nSome meds do. I took Prozac and I have not seen an effect on weight gain or weight loss, but meds work differently for everyone. \n\nOP, I myself have seen an improvement from my anxiety. I don‚Äôt really focus on the awkward moments as much and life has gone up a little. I‚Äôm starting to do things I was afraid of before. Medication isn‚Äôt the cure as it won‚Äôt help everyone. You need to do your part and truly try for that change. Good Luck!\n\nFWIW sometimes it's not so much the meds themselves directly causing weight gain, it's more that your appetite could change, leading to weight gain\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;I used to have an anxiety disorder and I dropped out of school 3 times and panic quit 4 jobs before I took it seriously and took the time I actually needed to heal. I convinced myself everyone felt what I felt, I was just worse at dealing with it. Spoiler alert: everyone does not feel that way. Health is a wild privilege tbh. \n\nI'm sorry you had to go through that... I'm repeating college again because of anxiety. For almost a year I didn't step out of my house, because I felt ashamed of dropping out due to \"poor mental health.\" My family and friends would try to console me by saying \"Everyone has anxiety, you're not alone!\" but I guess it's not the same. \n\nBut your story gives me motivation, only I can get myself out of this mess. Thank you so much.\n\nI get panic quitting jobs, I am a master at that. I thought it was everyone else until I realized everyone else kept jobs for years.¬†\n\nMost people are lucky enough to not have the chemical imbalances anxious people have in their brains. It's false equivalence.\n\nBro, get some help. Talk to a therapist, see a doctor, get on some meds. Your life doesn't have to be this way.\n\nIf you‚Äôre middle class/poor in the USA, talking to a therapist is completely out of the question. Rent, food, utilities, phone bills, oh and that doesn‚Äôt leave anything for therapy! Maybe next decade!\n\nIt depends on your insurance and I know I'm very lucky in this respect. Visiting a therapist in person for me would be $80/session, which we can't afford. But virtual visits from the same psychologist are free. It's worth calling your insurance company to ask.\n\nIt's amazing how this is the richest country in the world yet so many of us, even people in the middle class can't afford what is basic services in other less rich countries.\n\nIt‚Äôs really funny isn‚Äôt it? I have a coworker from Nigeria. We both work in the lumber area of Lowe‚Äôs. This dude came to America for a better opportunity, but he is a licensed and experienced therapist/counselor in Nigeria. It doesn‚Äôt mean shit here. He‚Äôs having to go through the same classes and paying crazy amounts of money here in the USA (which btw has awful standards when compared to his home country‚Äôs).\n\nLike this dude has to work at a LOWE‚ÄôS full time for crap pay just to get by while going to school full time.\n\nSometimes he‚Äôll come over to my place after work, and we‚Äôll smoke up. He has been a lifesaver for me. Really puts things into perspective for me. So he gets a smoke up and I get a therapy session. It‚Äôs a win-win! Lmao\n\nI'm losing hope in therapy, I've went to 5+ doctors and their advice is so surface level, like \"Drink more water, eat better, sleep for more hours.\" No way I never thought of that. When I ask them to assess me for possible anxiety disorders or if I require medication, they tell me \"No you're just a normal teenager\" Ah yes, not stepping out of my house for years because I'm paranoid about people looking at me, typical teen activity.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis would be fair advice if I didn't do anything to fix it. After my first visit to a psychologist I did start to eat better, sleep better, exercise more often, focused on self improvement. Other than feeling \"healthier\" my anxiety and depression was still the same, so when I brought up this issue they shrugged and told me \"I don't know what else to do, having a healthy routine should've worked.\" \n\nIn order for me to get better and be taken seriously, I need the support of a good psychologist. I live in a place where going to a mental health professional means you're either deranged or looking for attention, so on top of risking ostracisation I'm also getting shit responses from the one person who's supposed to help me.\n\nAs someone with crippling anxiety I did seek out therapy. I went two times but even with insurance my visits were right at 170 each. My therapist wanted to start out seeing be once a week but that just was not doable long term. \n\nI know therapy is a blessing for those who have access to it but I would love some suggestions on how to deal with anxiety that don‚Äôt necessarily depend on therapy or meds‚Ä¶\n\nFxck the anxiety. Face it, fight it. Try doing all those activitis with angry mood. Be angry a just do it no matter what!\n\nThat's usually the only time I feel productive! But even that anger wears off so quickly, always replaced with sadness or again, anxiety.\n\nI thought you will get yourself exposed to those situations with anger and realize that nothing is really happening and there is no reason be anxious. But might not working.\n\nAh man you need therapy!\n\nBut if you can‚Äôt afford that, break down all you wrote and tackle with one at a time. It‚Äôll make it less heavy. I wanna know why you worry about projects?\n\nThank you, I've started to write down my thoughts and it has helped a bit. I'm stressed about projects because I either focus on perfectionism too much or procrastinate a lot, resulting in rushing it due to deadlines.\n\nThat‚Äôs really good, I have an exercise where I sit with a blank page and write down words that pop in my head, until the page is full. My therapist got me to do that.\nWhen it comes to projects just do better time management and promise yourself every time you get to make one mistake. That helped me get through my first iaido exam! \n\nWith time management I normally diarise my day in hour blocks and figure out what I need to do and what I want to do and get it all in the diary, and if there isn‚Äôt time for everything, cut all the less important things.\nIf you need any more help always feel free to comment or dm me, I have gone through a lot of struggles but I have come up with coping tools for most things :)\n\nTry to centre yourself, whatever that means to you. Disect the feelings. Understand where they come from. Focus on taking their power away. You're not your anxiety.\n\nI was in my late 30‚Äôs when I got treatment for anxiety. I thought being anxious all the time was normal! When I was put on Prozac, I felt better very quickly. I asked my kids if they noticed a difference in me lately. My eldest said, ‚ÄúHate to say it, but you‚Äôre not yelling at us.‚Äù\n\nI decided then that I would probably stay on anxiety meds for the rest of my life. It‚Äôs been 20 years on it and I‚Äôm very grateful it exists!\n\nThat's wonderful! People lie so often by saying your anxiety will disappear when you're in your 30s, I've not even reached my 20s but it has gotten worse. There's this stigma around medication for mental health in general, but I'm willing to be on meds for the rest of my life if it helps.\n\nMine got worst when I hit 40 in March of this year! Get help now! I am finally on meds and in therapy! If I had gotten help sooner maybe mine would have not progressed to this point. I literally was stuck in a panic attack for weeks before seeking help. I‚Äôm much better now not 100% but glad I got help.¬†\n\n100% agree. It's tiring to be this way üò≠üò≠ \nAnd I constantly think about personality development without ever actually being any better.\n\nA. Download DARE ap\nB. See a doctor for anxiety meds\nC.

I think these same thoughts on a daily basis. I‚Äôm so sorry, OP. Nobody deserves to live this way or feel this way.\n\nPlease feel no shame in asking for help. Medication and therapy really do work.

Thought Id die young from destructive life style and my mental problems. But I didn't give up and started fighting again. Six years of working out, therapy an forcing myself to i things i am afraid of doing but know I should. Forcing myself to do social and family stuff and trying to listen to my body, setting boundaries, being hopeful  has finally given me a life I can be happy in. Its very hard. Big up and downs. Still have times of depression, fear, bitterness hurt. But fighting is worth it byou deserve a better life but only you can make it so. Good luck\n\nTry doing the Lions mane.. Get the powdered one. The best thing is to take the top off this so you can adress the real issues. Anxiety is important call center in your mind, telling you something its not ok. Once you understand this, it will make you want to fight it. Hope it works out, much love\n\nBest thing to know is you're not alone, look how many of us are in this group. Your brain unfortunately is malfunctioning slightly, which should probably be corrected. Have you spoken to your GP about this? Clearly, this is unmanageable for you.\n\nBecause you haven‚Äôt found the right medication/psyche team combination yet. It gets better.\n\nDon‚Äôt you dare give up.\n\n‚ÄúWhy the fuck was I ever born‚Äù \nI feel that so much üò≠üò≠üò≠\n\nBro it feels like an endless loop. No matter if I‚Äôm doing everything correctly everyday, or just trying one time dance one day that could somehow drastically change my life, nothing works. I believe the least anxiety I had was when I was hanging out with my friends everyday and we would not behave normally in public spaces, we would have fun and do weird things because it was comfortable with them. Now we live in seperate countries and everyone here seems so serious and lack that \"something\". But I also know that \"something\" is deep rooted in everyone, but I just can‚Äôt get this out of anyone, and I will not try to do so because it comes out naturally.\n\nI can relate so much. Anxiety takes over your whole body, mind and life. It is awful. But there is one thing that we can do by taking back control. I did it a couple of months ago when I was at my worst. I went to see my doctor I explained everything. I told him I got that bad I couldn't leave my house or even go to the shop. I had to take time of work because I couldn't get into the car and drive to work. Even though I was at home were I felt safe I still couldn't breathe, I had heart palpitations, impending doom all the time. And all the other symptoms.\nMy doctor prescribed me sertraline. The anxiety then wouldn't allow me to take it as my head just kept telling me.( Don't take it, you will get side effects, something could happen ) BUT.... I fought that voice in my head(anxiety), took control and started the medication.¬†\nI am so glad that I did. I started doing things that I couldn't do. I returned to work aswel. I took baby steps.\nI started at 25mg and this is what happened this is a low dose. I want to up my dose to 50mg as my doctor recommended that dose. So I know that would help even more.¬†\nI still get anxious moments and thinking there is something wrong with me but I control it. And I know if I up to 50mg this would improve my anxiety.\nPlease go see your doctor. You do not have to live like this. Your doctor is there to help you. There is help out there for people like us.¬†\nGo for it take control.\nPlease let me know how you get on ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAnxiety sucks.¬† ¬† ¬† Find a good therapist and let it all out.¬† ¬† If you find that the therapist sucks.¬† ¬†Find another one who has experienced some of these situations.¬† Or has anxiety themselves.¬† Sometimes all I do is vent for an hour to my therapist who I pay to listen to me.... Because I feel like noone else gets it.¬† ¬†Thankfully mine does get it.¬† ¬† Meds are needed when it is really bad.¬† ¬† I used to drink to cover it up.... Bad move....¬† ¬†But now I'm on meds and some of these meds with your brain and body...¬† Psychiatrists are like drug dealers.¬† ¬† I feel your pain.¬† ¬†But you aren't worthless and I believe once you get control of this.¬† You will be able to help others.¬† ¬†There is no cure for anxiety... But we can manage it...¬† And we all go down the rabbit hole at some point.¬† ¬† This year has been rough on me.¬† ¬†Like there's nothing to look forward to.¬† ¬†Don't feel like doing anything.¬† ¬† That's depression.¬† ¬†My advice is to talk.¬† Talk talk talk.¬† It helps.¬† Some drugs work great for some people.¬† ¬† Some don't.¬† ¬†If I had the choice.¬† I probably would have preferred not going down the benzo path.¬† ¬†But my issue was so bad they were the only thing that worked.¬† ¬†But the side effects suck.¬† ¬†And you were born because you have something to contribute....God has a plan for you...¬†What that something is you will figure it out along the way.¬† ¬†Remember there is always someone out there worse off than we are.¬† ¬† Keep busy.¬† ¬†Exercise.¬† Find someone who relates and talk to them.¬† ¬†Best way to go\n\n20 is at a age tho that doctors think it's just your body developing so u may get antidepressants to help if lucky and no prior addiction issues maybe sent home also with something to take the edge off.......hang in there I know how it feels worrying everyday about the worst outcomes of every possible thing\n\nU seem like one to benefit from inpatient therapy learn coping skills etc diagnose you\n\nMust we really \"hear you\" yell at us?\n\nMb I should've thugged it out ngl\n\nIt's cool to vent and whatnot, but remember that ultimately you're reaching out for help, right? so it's important to be skillful at it.\n\ni would get nauseous and sick when i was going to school, once i dropped out it was such a relief not having to stress about it at all anymore. i may not have a high school diploma but at least one day i‚Äôll get my GED, i have more important things to worry about.\n\nRemove \"can't\" from your lexicon. You can, you just have to work at it. There's lots and lots of resources all over the place. Step 2 is seeking help. Step 1 should be seeing a therapist and taking through your issues. Anxiety and depression are illnesses, but just like a broken foot or a cold, there are things you can do to feel better. I promise.\n\nBreathing meditation. If you can do this until you are able to engage your parasympathetic nervous system at will.\n\nWhen?! Never. It won't. This is the sisafusarian world we exist in. You make it what you will. It doesn't change until you make it your bitch.  I fight this daily. It changes when you make it change\n\nThis is the hard truth many people including me can't accept. There will be no saviour or miracle drug that can fix everything in a snap.. It's all about doing things even when you really really don't want to, and it is excruciating, but also the only way to truly improve. Sure, meds and therapy can help but they can only help so much when you are not committed enough.. \n\nAnd I say all this after I last minute-cancelled some major plans for this summer because of my usual anxiety. Love living this way.\n\nAnxiety is an emotion. Much like anger and happiness and joy are emotions. The best thing we can do is get to a place where we control our emotions better so that anxiety doesn't consume us. Im Learning this slowly. I used to only have anxiety until about 8 months ago I started getting physical symptoms of anxiety. I was able to manage my anxiety without medication until the physical symptoms started showing up out of nowhere. Was thinking that I've been through 42 years of life without any physical anxiety symptoms aside from maybe stomach cramps here and there. Then I started getting itchy and burning sensations and tingling sensations in my face muscle tightness burning sensations on my legs. I've been to every doctor I can think of about this and nobody can find anything physically wrong with me. Then I discovered this YouTube channel by Trey Jones. And I found out that I'm not alone and that other people go through this and it's probably just anxiety. \n\n\n    .....just anxiety. So simple yet so hard to grasp some days. For some of us it's just grabbing hold of that mental fortitude and saying I'm not going to let this take control of me anymore. I've wasted enough time on this emotion. It's like people who can't control anger or let thoughts of revenge go. At some point we just give in and say I've dedicated enough time to this and it's got to stop\n\nGlad you found a way to cope even when your anxiety worsened. \nAnxiety is an emotion. Yeah this makes sense. Although I don't fully get the control part. If I'm feeling anxious I'm not consciously choosing to (obviously), it just gets triggered and it overtakes all other emotions and my rational decisionmaking. \nIn this aspect it's different for me than other emotions because I don't think I've ever felt blind rage or joy that was prolonged and affected every other part of my life (or maybe I did and just forgor? lol??)\nBest that can be done is to learn to ignore it, right? Technically that's control..\n\nIf you have Spotify I recommend searching anxiety rx. He is an unconventional doctor and an unconventional therapist. He explains it way better than I can. But what I gather from his explanations and others who have similarly explained this.... Think of anger and frustration. These are both emotions and if you're going to look at them on their own, you can analyze them and say to yourself I am mad right now. but I don't want to be mad right now you find different ways to cope with the anger and allow it to subside. Sometimes it's harder to do than other times. When you are happy it's almost natural. But if you really thought about it you can remove your happiness.  I don't know why anybody will do this but it can be done. Anxiety is similar. But because anxiety can also evoke other feelings at the same time it's a little bit more difficult to reel in. especially since anxiety has typically been taught to us that it's not a feeling or an emotion.. but with anger, you can pause and look at the anger. You can sit with it and you can still on it or you can acknowledge it, roll with it. And then use the coping skills you've learned to get over anger. Some people have anger problems and they can't do this as well. It's the same with anxiety. For me anyway and I'm learning to say to myself it's okay to feel this way it's okay to have this anxiety. It is not okay to make this a reality. It is not okay for me to be here for too long. But I can acknowledge it and I can even wake up in the middle of the night and say this is why I'm waking up because my unconscious mind is having issues with anxiety. I'm starting to fall back asleep after his realizations breathing focus that I can separate panic from anxiety. It's not easy and it doesn't always work. But I feel like I'm in the beginning of this I'm getting ahead of it and understanding that\n\nOkay I'll give it a listen! Interesting how simply acknowledging it can change much\n\nAcknowledge and accept. Don't get me wrong. I'm not fixed. I'm finding things that help me manage. I'm not always managing üíØ either. I fall in the google hole w my symptoms. My mind tells me there is no way this numbness in my leg is anxiety. It's been there off and on for a month. My mind says tumor. My mind says google it. See your odds. Make it something treatable. Cancer is treatable and let's fucking go! Treat that NOW! The reality is, it could be cancer.... Probably not. I definitely have severe anxiety. The Simple fact is that it's more likely an anxiety symptom than tumors. So I try to sit with it. I don't know what is causing my anxiety. But I know my panic thoughts. I can work on those.aking an appointment to treat a disease that's probably not real is way easier than sitting with my conscious mind telling me to panic. Then transferring that to my unconscious mind. I have something causing me duress. Bills, parents health, relationships, insomnia. Whatever it is. I try to separate it and say to myself, this is a feeling. It's valid. But it's just that. I am not in control of everything my body does. However I am in control of how I react.\n\nMoral fiber; any one of the people that gave you anxiety don't have it. Know that if anyone of them who attacked you in your life when you guard was down would have acted in exactly the same way. It's like always looking out for a dangerous person to denigrate us. Know that the wider reality doesn't condone this; we need to accept people like Turing. He saved 14mn lives with his rebellious genius. Nazi's would have imprisoned him for objecting. Treat our geeks like sheikhs.\n\nit do be like that. focusing on things that I like to do and staying active sometimes helps, as well as setting aside brain numbing stuff like scrolling through social media. but then I start questioning what's the point and it all repeats. I suppose that my brain only really functions when I don't have any time to actually think. \n\nwhen I'm working for example, I'm so busy and focused that I don't even have time to get anxious about anything or feel sad about whatever's going on in my life. it's just me and my job, and that's the only time I'm free from anxiety. it's funny, though, because most people work thinking about what they're going to do when they're not working, while I usually spend my free time wishing I had something to occupy my mind.\n\nsimply being around people stresses me out so bad when I'm not doing anything. I don't feel comfortable at all in crowded places, and can't stand parties. though before I was diagnosed with social anxiety it was considerably worse, because I had no idea why I was like that, and thought it was normal and everyone simply dealt with it. my psychiatrist prescribed me sertraline back then.\n\nthe sertraline helped for a while, but I couldn't bring myself to change my ways and effectively deposit energy into interacting with other people, so I ultimately stopped taking it and gave up on overcoming social anxiety altogether. I simply avoid any situations that might spike it and try to make every interaction as short as possible. \n\nto this day I believe the best choice I've ever made was to become a vet. because even though I still have a lot of contact with people on a daily basis, it's pretty easy to deal with for the most part. it's so much easier to deal with animals though. way more rewarding as well.\n\nwhen it comes to romantic relationships, it's interestingly different from most of what I've said. when someone is actually interested in you, it doesn't really matter whether you're good at socializing or go through all those extra steps to attract people. you just need to be authentic, and be kind despite all the stress. allowing people to get to know and approach me is never easy, but simply explaining my shyness, and saying that despite not showing it most of the time, I enjoy being with them, usually does the trick. that alone got me laid enough times throughout college and got me a girlfriend at my first job. if you're the one taking the first step though, I'd say you probably need all the extra charisma steps.\n\nof course, being close to someone only brings more anxiety and stress, so I had to learn to kinda let go from my rationality (stop thinking about every single detail about my body, every single thing I say or do) as much I can during those moments. it's extremely difficult, but gets a little easier. alcohol helps a lot, and even though I don't like it, it's kind of an emergency measure for when I'm having an unusually hard time turning off the anxiety switch.\n\nI should also add, this is my personal experience and a simple text I decided to write because I related to your post. I do not expect or want anyone to take it seriously, validate it or use it as a role model for anything. just me letting some thoughts out of my mind, is all.\n\nIt won't end before you find the right therapist."

Then again, what is normal?\n\nLmao, nothing and no one is normal :)\n\nI‚Äôm constantly in fight or flight mode and I have no idea why üò©\n\nReaaal\n\nMe too\n\nYup. When I‚Äôm idle, and have nothing to do is usually when it hits the worst.\n\nIt hits me randomly, like the moment I read this rn I got triggered\n\nIf that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs almost certainly childhood trauma/CPTSD. There isn‚Äôt much awareness about it, even amongst therapists, so you may not have encountered the right info about it in the past. \n\n[Patrick Teahan](https://youtube.com/@patrickteahanofficial?si=F-Da0kbVtQQ4iKQX) and [Heidi Priebe](https://youtube.com/@heidipriebe1?si=yPUV5KM-alMecWJs) have great resources on this if you want to explore more!\n\nBut I‚Äôm not traumatised\n\nOne wrong thought\n\nMy goodness. Read my mind...\n\nA thought. But that thought doesn‚Äôt always trigger my anxiety. Only sometimes, and I don‚Äôt know why.\n\nMe right now while shopping in order at work. I can‚Äôt wait to leave.\n\nFor real. One wrong thought can lead to endless hours of mental and physical anxiety for me. One small stupid thought\n\nWell thanks you just triggered my anxiety.\n\nGoing to a restaurant and realizing during walk that it may be full or there is a long line.\n\ni‚Äôve turned around and left because of that\n\nOmg yea this for me or going to places that are super crowded makes me anxious.\n\nAnd the best solution is to leave before you pass out?\n\nFor me is just going to a restaurant and worried the food is going to hit my stomach bad and I‚Äôll need the restroom ü•¥\n\nMY BIRTHDAY üò≠ i cry every year on my birthday, even though it always turns out to be okay\n\nI get anxious on and around my birthday and usually depressed, thinking how each year is closer to the end of me/loved ones and that I'm wasting time because im anxious of everything üò≠\n\nThis! I feel the exact same and it's very lonely. It \"helps\" reading I'm not alone, not sure if it makes sense!\n\nSame here :/\n\nyou, u/fritzwulf, and everyone who liked my comment are making me feel better. i really thought i was weird for that LMFAOOOOO üò≠ i just hate my bday, i don‚Äôt tell anyone when it is bc i hate the attention ugh\n\nYes! I cry on my birthday, and usually my parents' birthdays too.\n\ndude fr i get so sad on my parents‚Äô birthdays. i love them and their birthdays mean they‚Äôre getting old :(\n\nMy birthday is literally tomorrow in 2 hours and I‚Äôm here on Reddit talking about anxiety üòÆ‚Äçüí®ü´†ü•¥üòÇ\n\nhappy early birthday my friend, i sincerely hope this birthday makes you super duper happy!!!! i‚Äôm always a message away if you need someone to talk to!\n\nOof, I feel that. I've had really bad luck on my birthdays so even if I don't believe luck is a real thing I still get so nervous and upset üò≠\n\nSame! On my 12th birthday I got really sick to the point where I had to go to the doctors and ever since then I get anxious and nauseous on my birthday üò≠\n\nExisting. Everything is terrifying.\n\nSame really.\n\nGreetings and meeting people. It's so overwhelming I never can remember anyone's name.\n\nI forget my name in a job interview.  Totally sober.  Or forget basic stuff in a job interview.  This is when I truly want to die.\n\nBreathing. And yet ppl tell me to breathe to calm anxiety\n\nAre you thinking you look like a nerd?  My therapist told me to spend 2 minutes slowly breathing in front of her and I was just painfully self conscious.\n\nNo. Its the feeling\n\nI get the same thing, I hate manually breathing, it feels suffocating\n\nidk if you mean the same thing but sometimes i realise that i can breathe and i start spiralling into thoughts of who i am and what life is and then i get panic attacks\n\nLike if i walk up a flight of stairs. I start to think I can‚Äôt breathe. Then I try to take in a lungful and when I don‚Äôt get that full feeling I go into panic mode\n\nI used to be triggered by the thought of breathing or my heart beating. I‚Äôve gotten better but it would trigger terrible panic attacks.\n\nSame! Like awareness of my heartbeat made me feel like something was wrong. Went to the ER for it a couple times. Ironically I get through the panic attacks with breathing techniques üòÖ the physiological sigh(double inhale, extended exhale) is the only one that works.\n\nSomething similar for me is swallowing. I become so conscious of the need to swallow (not when I'm eating/drinking either) and it makes me anxious.\n\nSame! No matter how many times I counted, I would feel like ny breaths weren't deep enough to be a full breath. Apparently there's a word for it, \"air hunger.\" You feel like you aren't breathing deeply or frequently enough. \n\nThis was one of my biggest anxiety triggers for the longest time. I would have daily panic attacks over it. Therapy and medication helped, but I also found my favorite breathing technique. It's called Pranayama. The important thing is to breathe from your stomach. Your belly should expand when you breathe in, not your chest. The count is in 4, hold 7, out 8. When you're breathing out through your mouth, it's a controlled exhale. Tighten your mouth a little, almost like you're gently blowing on hot food, and make a whooshing sound. It's not a sigh, it's a whoosh. It should sound like you're trying to mimic gentle waves on a beach.\n\nAir hunger is still something I experience somewhat regularly, even though it doesn't trigger panic attacks for me anymore. This breathing technique is surprisingly helpful, and I hope it helps you.\n\nEdit: Getting a pulse oximeter helped, too. I could see the physical proof that my body was getting enough oxygen. I'd feel like I wasn't getting enough, but my oxygen levels would he perfect.\n\nWalking into work\n\nthis! for as long as i can remember ive always had such a spike of anxiety when going to work. my first job i got in high school, i had a quiet panic attack in the car before every shift and barely ever spoke a word. they thought i was a functional mute (which honestly in those situations i pretty much was). even now, i‚Äôve got to calm myself down and triple check my schedule before every shift, despite having my schedule memorized and knowing exactly how it‚Äôll go.\n\nThis. My workplaces stresses me out and I'm on the edge of my seat of thinking what's going to happen next. The boss has been super strict lately.\n\nWork itself when you're  in a hardcore anxiety mode\n\nYou must be a teacher, lol.\n\nI kinda just have general anxiety about most things. It really sucks always being on edge and needing to turn to meds for any relief.\n\nGetting an email/text message/phone call\n\nThe sound of a phone ringing!\n\nTalking to multiple people at a party. 2 hours later replaying each conversation back in my head over and over. Yes the username checks!\n\nThe word  ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù gives me anxiety, currently clenching my jaw. Thanks\n\nIt gets no sympathy. Everyone with anxiety should have a good fake diagnosis of something physical.  Like cancer but not that bad.\n\nSeeing as how badly anxiety effects the body, we're all going to have physical diagnosis of something eventually. I got all kinds of physical problems now lol üíÄ\n\nlol this is especially true in the UK. They send you to CBT if you mention anxiety (if you‚Äôre lucky). With sciatica, you can at least get some medicine to alleviate the symptoms of sciatica. How debilitating anxiety is is given 0 sympathy in the public health system here. Your options are going private or going abroad.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy sucked for me\n\nMy therapist would very often forget what we spoke about and I‚Äôd be reminding him all kinds of things. We‚Äôd be doing work in a fuckin workbook and all the blame for not advancing and getting better was because I didn‚Äôt do a little fuckin journal. \n\nDidn‚Äôt go to you to get homework I wanted to not kill myself\n\nIBS? It‚Äôs a common comorbidity and it elicits more sympathy than ‚ÄúI am scared so my tummy hurts‚Äù\n\nThank you for the reminder to relax my jaw lol\n\nModern minimalist architecture\n\nI get this, actually. Unnerving\n\nstatues near or coming out of water\n\nBeing in a car\n\nYes and especially driving\n\nYeah sometimes I remember the only thing separating all these cars are lines on the ground and we‚Äôre all hurdling at 80 mph separated by imaginary barriers.\n\nThere are enough of us that we have our own Reddit r/drivinganxiety\nI also developed anxiety about driving. It‚Äôs getting better but I‚Äôm still working up to taking on freeways and longer trips.\n\nSame üò£\n\nSame, but as a passenger. I can manage if I'm in control. If anyone else drives I get nervous.\n\nBeing stuck in traffic and feeling trapped\n\nMe too\n\nYes!!\n\nThisüíØ\n\nFood! Oh my lord food is the biggest trigger. Fat food, greasy food, carb filled food the second I have a bite I notice my senses are heightened.\n\nUgh this is so me. And the feeling of being full as well.\n\nAnxiety triggers my anxiety\n\nidk if it‚Äôs weird but messenger/ms teams notification sound üôÉ\n\nOh my god I resonate so much with MS Teams, and Outlook. I‚Äôm in an upper leadership position at my job which unfortunately means a LOT of people depend on me for help and my Teams sometimes pops off nonstop with 5-10 messages in a 30 second span ‚ò†Ô∏è\n\nI tried to turn off the sound at one point but then I started missing messages‚Ä¶ no winning. Sigh\n\nSeeing my own family. To me that‚Äôs weird af since they know all about my anxiety.\n\nClutter all over my house\n\nPeople asking if I'm okay. This is so men or shitty in general to say but I'm fine if I'm not fine I'm trying to not think about it but now that I've been asked I go into overdrive and dissect and over think then I can't stop.\n\nThis triggers me too! I am NOT ok just give me some space! I don‚Äôt want to say I‚Äôm not ok, I just want to deal with it by myself.\n\nIt‚Äôs why I started asking, how can I help, instead of are you ok.\n\nCaffeine\n\nThat's not weird at all.\n\nWhat's weird is sometimes caffiene ELIMINATES my anxiety and other times makes it pure hell. My neuro chemistry inconsistencies piss me off :(\n\nCould it be the source of caffeine? If I drink some types of coffee/ energy drinks then I‚Äôll feel anxious, other types of coffee I‚Äôll feel ok. Bang gives me anxiety but not prime/ redbull or monster\n\nBang has 300mg caffeine, prime has 200mg caffeine, monster has like 120mg caffeine and red bull depending on the size has like 80mg-150mg\n\nFellow ADHD/anxiety blend?\n\nNever know if you're gonna get the calm af caffeine nap or the nervous jitters.\n\nAs a coffee lover it hurts that I've now hopped off coffee for this very reason :(\n\nWeird lighting‚Ä¶ and high ceilings‚Ä¶ and low ceilings‚Ä¶\n\nFor some reason I can't handle the default ceiling light being the only thing on, puts everything in a really messed up lighting with odd shading so I feel that.\n\nThe second the lighting looks a little weird or uncomfy I 100% am convinced I am having a stroke or about to faint or have a seizure\n\nPeople.\n\nThe sound of silverware touching plates. Not the scraping, screeching sound, just the normal sound of someone setting their spoon down in their bowl of cereal, or the fork touching the plate when using it to pick up food. I understand the source of why it makes me anxious but it's still a weird trigger\n\nBeing with certain persons, I lose half my personality and ability to speak.\n\nMine is the sound of spoons on bowls, the hair dryer, the shower going on in the other room (I'm in bed for all of this, and actually wear earplugs so I don't have to hear any of it).\n\nBasically, any typical \"morning\" sounds fill me with dread, from past trauma and chronic anxiety.\n\nOh, and if the phone rings at any time, I have a panic attack as I'm terrified someone I love has died.\n\nOh wow me too!  I have a million questions. Were you born in the evening?  I also hate the sound of traffic when I'm waking up or trying to.  It's the sound of scary doom, just like waves on a sandy beach.\n\nEating in front of others. I hate going to restaurants\n\nOh gosh this is a big one. Eating with others is the worst thing to me!!\n\nI feel so ashamed that chewing food is pretty gross, so I hide my mouth behind a napkin while chewing, or just pretend I have a toothache plus a stomach flu plus I just had a big meal before I got here.  And I truly apologize that my butthole is so close to my mouth.  Sorry for the hassle!\n\nI also hate restaurants\n\nReading or seeing to many things about death or an illness (such as cancer etc)\n\nA dirty kitchen.\n\nRabies‚Ä¶\n\nYup, last thing I need in my life right now is some rabies.\n\nBeing praised. \n\nThis is a recent discovery; I started working recently and I was trying to get the gist of the job, I did something good and my coworkers who were training me reaffirmed my actions and praise me. I started to freeze up and revert back to old habits.\n\nSpeed while in a car\n\nQuiet places, makes my negative thoughts get louder\n\nStatic shocks. I get so anxious when I‚Äôm out that I avoid touching anything metal and I wear gloves to try and soften the pain of the shocks.\n\nMine is the smell or sometimes even when people talk about weed. It started when I stopped smoking 3 years ago and one time I went into my friends truck on my break and he was smoking dabs. I got contact high and I felt like I was gonna die. Ever since I feel that way. Like I‚Äôm high and I get so scared. Super weird\n\nAh shit I just commented \"weed smell\" and i saw yours. high five! Weed even a small puff just gives me intense paranoia now :( it sucks, i used to be able to go through a gram a night.\n\nSounds like we shouldn‚Äôt even of been potheads to begin withüò≠ even my first time I got a BAD panic attack. But I did it anyway smoked pretty much all day. Even through my high school years\n\nlack of sleep. random tv shows ( i can‚Äôt watch star trek anymore?), silence, whatever‚Äôs triggering mine is hard to fully nail down. its‚Ä¶fear of the future, fear for my kid, fear for the planet, a 5 years of complete change and challenge in my life, childhood trauma, death of an abuser parent, and perimenopause. Ok, its a soup of triggers. it all kind of hits at once for a few days and then i‚Äôm over it for a bit‚Ä¶ in the thick of it right now. do not like.\n\nLack of sleep is terrible.\n\nJust a simple change of routine. I‚Äôve never been fond of my routine overly changing but never previously to the point it‚Äôs triggered my anxiety.\n\nBut one Monday last November me and my girlfriend went out for the day. We had tickets for a comedian performing at an arena a town away from us. We had a day out Christmas shopping, went for a nice meal together and then went to see this comedian in the evening.\n\nThe show went on a lot longer than we thought, and as the evening went on, I was finding myself slowly getting more and more anxious for some bizarre reason. We got home about midnight, and I ended up spending the evening in a state of anxiety and panic attacks. I really don‚Äôt know what came over me\n\nIt doesn't get triggered, it's just always on\n\nAnxiety symptoms in my body \nSweating, heart palpitations, stuttering mind blanking dissociation, stomach drops\n\nInstagram or Facebook that's why I don't use them anymore, and weird because any kind of post talking about a war or a social problem triggers me tf out\n\nMy wife‚Äôs inability to sit down. She is one of those people who needs to keep moving even if there is nothing to do. So when I just want to relax and she keeps getting up my anxiety spikes.\n\nbeing too warm, or sweating\n\nMajor holidays and birthdays, including my own. Bad things always happened around those times, and it gives me flashbacks.\n\nAny type of upcoming plan. even if it‚Äôs like ‚Äúat this time I have to get the work to bus‚Äù which I do every morning yet just like that I‚Äôm anxious\n\nHaving even a slight stomach ache. My brain immediately launches into \"omg it's time.to panic soon!!!!\" because my panic attacks cause stomach pain, so my brain has forever associated the two. It sucks.\n\nLoud sound\n\nPeople chewing loud, slurping, loud voices\n\nWeather.\n\nI have a meteorology degree and totally understand! Weather can be super scary, sending you love ü§ç\n\nOver speculating my health.\nLike dehydration or acid reflux.\nI would panic thinking it's more lmao.\n\nLarge department stores\n\nPeople that talk wicked loudly. Loud noises. My hands having a weird texture\n\nheat, a belly ache, a burp, feeling the slightest bit dizzy\n\nthinking, breathing, walking, eating, remembering i have a heart beat, being alive\n\nhahaha *cry-laughs in solidarity*\n\nBeing the center of attention\n\n‚ÄúYOUr fAcE is TuRnINg ReDddd‚Äù yeah I know I can feel it. Now everyone‚Äôs staring and it‚Äôs getting even redder thanks.\n\nDungeons and Dragons üòÇ\n\ni had a really shitty ex in college who used to play with his friends all the time and they were super misogynistic about it (which is weird bc they were generally not like that). None of their girlfriends were allowed to play, even when they started new campaigns. The only girl they‚Äôd let play was the resident ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù girl\n\nsome good came out of it, because another one of the guys‚Äô girlfriend and I got really close hanging out while they played. we lost touch, but fast forward a few years and we‚Äôre now living in the same city far away from those douchebags and closer with each other than ever. \n\nBut still, D&amp;D will instantly trigger anxiety in me.\n\nGroup of men\n\nOther people throwing up in front of me, occasionally when they've thrown up and just tell me about it. \n\nCan't do it\n\nI hate being read to. Like, send me the link or tell me the book or webpage, I‚Äôll read it. Long conversations are easy enough to politely get out of but when someone starts reading me a long article they think I‚Äôll find interesting, it triggers my anxiety and adhd so badly; I don‚Äôt know why. There‚Äôs no nice way to say ‚Äúplease stop talking.‚Äù\n\nBreathing. Am I breathing too much? Not enough? Wasn't I just doing it fine? Isn't it rude to be a mouth breather? Am I wheezing? Do I need to use my inhaler? Is it just me or is it getting real small in here? Am I breathing? Shit...I'm sweating. I can't breathe. Oh...it's a panic attack.\n\nI can‚Äôt play competitive videogames, cause if just one person says anything slightly negative towards me, I‚Äôll have anxiety every time I even open said game.\nA lot of my friends think it‚Äôs rly dumb that I don‚Äôt want to play fps games for this reason.\n\nBridges and tunnels\n\nSometimes just outside light\n\nWhen the clouds cover the sun.\n\nBeing hungry\n\ncertain songs that don‚Äôt have any trauma attached, like fireflies by owl city or tik tok by kesha. the lyrics aren‚Äôt particularly triggering, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ the noise? or something? i don‚Äôt know\n\nOoh boy! As someone with overstimulation issues and possible PTSD, I got a few wierd ones!\n\nBright sunny days where there's no clouds. Bonus points if it's a dry yellow environment and windy. I've tried to cure myself of this but days like that make me downspiral BAD.\n\nRooms where only the ceiling light is being used, making everything have wierd downward shadows.\n\nThe buzz of fluorescent lights.\n\nBig department store environments like Walmart or Target.\n\nKnocking on doors (both the sound and the action)\n\nThe slorpy sound a bathtub drain makes\n\nTV static even if it's on mute \n\nHearing anything that sounds like a whine/groan, even once.\n\nCutting my fingernails. I'll do it but I hate the feeling. My parents used to have to sit on me to do it to me lmao \n\nRepetitive questioning even if calmly, repetitive words in general if directed right at me\n\nSilence after saying something in a social situation. Like damn just kill me now lol it'd be less painful\n\nWorst one is just waking up? For some reason waking up reminds my body that it's alive and I involuntarily go into \"OH FUCK\" survival mode. I got problems üòî\n\nIntrusive thoughts. My brain is my biggest enemy.\n\nGreetings and goodbyes.\n\nHonestly, mine has a lot to do with being judged. I believe it goes back to something that happened or something that I repeatedly experienced when I was very young‚Ä¶\n\nother people being anxious about something\n\nNot feeling anxious ü§£ If I wake up and feel \"normal\" my brain literally goes \"hold on a minute\" and finds ANYTHING.\n\neating in front of people who aren't close family + men laughing/whispering (specifically teens)\n\nFunny enough my bunny chewing on something wooden. I free roam her around my room.\n\nSun exposure\n\nHaving to dress up as I‚Äôm most comfortable in leggings and a sweater, seeing my family and running out of my meds 2 weeks to early.\n\nI just get anxious and sad randomly lol. Whenever I feel a bit happy, I‚Äôm struck by thoughts of how something bad is coming because everything can‚Äôt be all right, and that i don‚Äôt deserve to stay happy or even at ease because there are things I‚Äôve always failed or will always fail at\n\nGoing outside and hearing people talk\n\nFor some reason the lights at any big store like Walmart, Home Depot, or  Lowe‚Äôs.\n\nWearing bra‚Äôs ü•≤\n\nI admit my anxiety has improved significantly, but just feeling unwell will make me anxious. \nIt doesn't feel like health anxiety, just the weird feeling in my body feels a lot like what I feel when anxious, so then I get anxious lol\n\ndentist and doctors apts\n\nPeople\n\nLes mis (the musical) and I have no idea why\n\nMy anxiety lol\n\nSomebody giving me a gift or something I just feel awkward and bad I can‚Äôt even explain it üòÇüò≠\n\nJust reminiscing abt those little embarrassing mess ups in the past. Triggers my anxiety every time.\nNot to mention intrusive thoughts....arguhhhh!!\n\nSometimes I don‚Äôt even know myself, it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt control my body anymore and it feels scary af üò≠ I get that the amygdala overrides the rest of the brain and that its function is to process fear and anxiety, but not sure how a 180 bpm hear rate at bed time does anything for MY SURVIVAL üò≠ feels more like dying to me\n\nRiding passenger in a car.\n\nSomeone asking what my ‚Äúplans for the future‚Äù are. Idk, Janet, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it to 29\n\nSomeone snoring, loudly mouth-breathing.\n\nSound of the vacuum cleaner when I'm not vacuuming.\n\nRepetitive noises, high pitched squeals or screams from kids even if they're just playing, being touched when I don't want to be.\n\nCrowds, noises, social situations, mess, expectations, deadlines, routine, lack of routine and my absolute favourite, nothing at all!\n\nComing off meds at the moment and it's closed in spaces even like blankets that are too heavy make me want to escape. My favourite place is normally sitting in the garage inside the car playing on my phone but recently it's nearly impossible as my anxiety goes inside it's like my body inside itself is trying to escape.\n\nQuiet rooms. Because everyone can hear every noise I make!\n\nWaking up :(\n\nOther than nothing, Afternoon appointments.\n\nAnxiety in line to order food/drink and someone is behind me.\n\nWorrying about worrying. I worry and build everything up in my head until it becomesagreatBIGTHING AND THEN...nothing. It's never as bad as I think it's gonna be.\n\nLoud, unexpected noises. Could be a cupboard slamming shut, a cup falling off a table, etc etc\n\nStaying away from home\n\nPeople knocking on the door, I have no idea why.\n\nDoing something wrong ü´† i double sometimes triple check excessively\n\nIdk how weird it is, but literally calling anyone who's not my mom or my husband. Even friends or other family.\n\nI'm not diabetic, but when my blood sugar gets low - it gives me heart palpitations and then boom. I'm having a panic attack. Sucks as I'm trying to lose weight. Also, heart rate monitors on TV shows or during horror movies or something. That slowly increasing BMP thumping/beeping kills me.\n\nThe vacuum doing vacuum noise\nStomping footsteps\nThe wind\n\nHaving messy hair ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

    "all_comment_text": "‚ÄúHangxiety‚Äù is a real thing. My anxiety it‚Äôs worse for a few days after a bender. It‚Äôs one of the main reasons why I‚Äôm trying to quit drinking.\n\nMy therapist says you are ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù fun when you drink too much. And that you‚Äôll have to pay on that loan when you‚Äôre done. I used to drink a lot on the weekends to help with my anxiety. As I get closer to 40 it‚Äôs become way too much. I‚Äôd say probably since 35. My anxiety is so bad the next day (or even as soon as I stop drinking) after drinking I just don‚Äôt want to do it anymore.\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean after one or two drinks. It means after getting drunk. In my 20s I always felt nervous and would seek reassurance that I didn‚Äôt act like a fool after drinking. But now that anxiety has grown exponentially. It‚Äôs just not worth it to me.\n\nWhich is not to say I don‚Äôt get drunk once or twice a year. But my alcohol intake has done a steep decline in the past five years.\n\nRecently I‚Äôve been super aware of the come down when I drink. Like I just feel awful.\n\nThis! I didn‚Äôt know if I was just making things up in my mind or what but I‚Äôm getting this bad lately. Even as soon as I stop drinking, I start feeling super bad anxiety and shaky. \n\nThe next day is the worst.\n\nCongrats on the reduced intake! I‚Äôve heard that borrowing metaphor and it‚Äôs very true.\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nthat‚Äôs where i‚Äôm at now at 35. i just couldn‚Äôt keep spending sunday with a knot in my throat and the next few days getting back to normal. june is my second sober month this year as well as cutting back to just weekends otherwise, and damn, im like a different person. almost zero anxiety‚Ä¶ and i was born with and diagnosed at a young age with anxiety and ocd.\n\nHi\nYeah I can totally relate to this,the next day is awfull and many days afterwards,the minuate my eyes open I'm in panic mode,as they say what goes up has to come down,I've quit alcohol now because of the anxiety and panic,just was not worth it..\n\nMy hangxiety is soooo bad! I hate it\n\nEspecially when alcohol makes you more friendly and extroverted than you normally are so then the next day you just think about all those stupid things you said and how you interacted with people was so awkward, ughhhhh I hate it\n\nYES wow I feel so seen. No one has ever understood this when I explained it\n\nI feel this exact same way. The next day I hide in embarrassment\n\nOh my, everything you just said is me to a T! I feel so happy and good and just word vomit things, both good and bad, that the next day I‚Äôm like ‚Ä¶ damn ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI‚Äôm an idiot\n\nThis and palpitations. Not worth it. It has been over 2 months since my last drink.\n\nOne of the things that helps me with that is the fact that everyone knows I was drinking, so if I said something weird they will likely just assume I was drunk, and know I wouldn't normally be like that.\n\nIt has to do with how alcohol affects levels of GABA in the brain. It's a real thing!\n\nAs dr drew says, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no free lunches in nature‚Äù! What comes up, must come down especially gaba receptors.\n\nA rx for hydroxyzine can help; it's not addictive and most docs are comfortable writing for it.\n\nHydroxyzine has no effect on the gaba receptors.\n\nI used to go out a fair amount drinking with friends etc.\n\nI stopped because of the feeling I'd have for days after, I drink now maybe once or twice a year on occasions and I feel much better. I find it weird now to think I used to drink so much, the thought of doing it again isn't appealing at all to me anymore.\n\nI also have much more spare money, which is always a bonus.\n\nI guess as people get older, we learn from our mistakes\n\nI always drink a CBD drink after I‚Äôm finished drinking alcohol. Doesn‚Äôt solve the hangxiety l problem completely but man, it makes such a difference.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to drink then.\n\nIt doesn't even have to be \"after a bender\" for me anymore. If I have more than. 1 or 2 beers then my anxiety is really bad the next day. It doesn't help that anxiety meds don't play well with booze\n\nIt‚Äôs worth it. I used to drink ALOT. Quitting has helped my anxiety tremendously. Of course it‚Äôs still there, but not like it was when I was drinking all the time. Not having hangovers is awesome too. Keep going. You‚Äôll get there.\n\nSame here. It's almost a good thing, as the aversion to anxiety hangovers helped stopped depression exacerbation from alcohol. One mental illness helping another, sorta. Drinking is now purely a social event, during brighter days (i.e. summertime) and usually capped at 3-4 for big events like weddings.\n\nWife and I quit almost two years ago. Definitely reduced anxiety, improved sleep, less remorse, etc... Downside: I'm still acclimating to social life without it and instead of using alcohol to regulate moods I'm enduring the moods until they pass, including the anxiety thst still occurs.\n\nSame\n\nHow long does it take you to start feeling better? I had a lot to drink this past Saturday and I‚Äôm still feeling very anxious and my ocd is getting harder to shake\n\nYou should be at the tail end of it. Tomorrow will probably be better.\n\nThanks for the response, I‚Äôve been needing some encouragement lol. I‚Äôll get back with you soon and let you the progress\n\nPlease do. If you have the time, take a brisk walk, even if it‚Äôs a short one. The resulting endorphins will help greatly.\n\nWill do, thank you so much!\n\nNo problem whatsoever. I‚Äôve been there, and it sucks! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever lasted as long as 4 days, usually it‚Äôs around 3 for me, but as I said, it‚Äôs almost over. When I‚Äôve had episodes like yours in the past, it makes me think before I drink the next time; it‚Äôs quite a good deterrent.\n\nIt differs. Sometimes it‚Äôs really bad for a day or two, then tapers off. Sometimes it‚Äôs mild but consistent for 3-4 days.\n\nSame, contemplated quitting so many times.\n\ndrinking calms me down however smoking cigs/vaping increases anxiety and panic attacks and i love smoking more than drinking ü•≤\n\nI tend to vape too when I‚Äôm drinking and i feel like it makes my anxiety worse!\n\nyea its like an instant adrenaline shot and my heart starts to beat so fast\n\nCan I ask if you‚Äôre vaping nicotine or something else?\n\nonly nicotine i dont take anything else\n\nAlcoholic of 15+ years, almost 2 and a half years sober. Wouldn't recommend it.\n\nWouldn't recommend the alcoholism that is... not the sobriety, that part I absolutely WOULD recommend!\n\nI definitely read this the other way around at first so thank you for clarifying üòù\n\nCongrats on your sobriety ! üëèüèº\n\nWhat was the final defining moment before starting the sobriety journey? May I ask\n\nI was going to kill myself and I decided that I should probably give life one last proper go, and do it sober. I was drinking a litre of vodka a day so if I hadn't quit I'd have died anyway eventually.\n\n*ofc no need to be detailed*, but what were the big things that drove you to be fully sober? I would like to hear, because I kinda struggle with sobrierty myself tbh.\n\nI was suicidal, and very close to doing it... and when I was thinking about doing it I kinda just had an epiphany and decided to give life another chance but actually try and do it sober, because I'd spent almost the entirety of the past 15 years drunk. Plus my sister has given birth to 2 kids in the past 3 years, so I've got to stick around to see them grow up! The depression is still there, but the medication actually works now. I was hoping it'd solve my anxiety but that actually got worse.\n\nPlease do yourself a favour and try really hard to stick at sobriety... it's fucking hard, but it's worth it and so are you.\n\nIndeed. Professional drinking for 8 years. Sober 7 years and 8 months. It‚Äôs a dangerous circular pattern of drinking to reduce anxiety only to wake up with amplified anxiety leading to drinking again. I believe people should be able to drink or do drugs as long as they are the ones accepting responsibility for their actions, however, alcohol is literal poison and I wish society treated it with a little more caution.\n\nRight on! Sobriety is so worth it for so many reasons.\n\nAbsolutely! I thought I needed the booze to cope with my misery, turns out it was making everything 10x worse.\n\nSame here. I was having anxiety and panic attacks so frequently that I really thought I was in hell. 7 years later and my anxiety is SO much better. I wish you much continued sobriety, friend.\n\nUnfortunately my anxiety got way, way, way worse when I got sober, but my depression got a lot better and I'm healthier so you win some you lose some hahaha.\n\nUgh, I'm sorry to hear the anxiety got worse.I hope you get some relief at some point.  That's great news about the depression, though!\n\nI second this.  I‚Äôm 93 days free of that stuff.  You can‚Äôt pay me to drink anymore.  ‚ÄúMental‚Äù dependency is one thing.  PHYSICAL dependency is another different ballgame.  I will never, ever go through that shit again.  Worst thing I‚Äôve ever done was use alcohol as medication for anxiety.\n\nHow do you feel now? 3 months in you should start to notice a fair amount of differences!\n\nSo far so good!  The first month or so I had slight cravings that was mixed with the ‚Äúpink cloud.‚Äù  The pink cloud lasted until about day 50, then my anxiety disorder came back.  \n\nI‚Äôve had anxiety (GAD/Depression) since 2011.  I began as a social drinker when watching sports games or hanging with friends.  Then it turned into once a week, then every few days, then every day, then before I knew it I was drinking over 18+ drinks each day starting at breakfast.  The funny thing was I thought I was invincible to it, that I could stop whenever I wanted.  I felt like I wasn‚Äôt addicted, I just liked the feeling of it.  But I was so wrong lol.  When I went 12 hours without drinking I had the worst shakes of my life.  I accepted that I lost control of my drinking.  I was all but guaranteed to have a seizure if I went longer.  So I went to the store, drank one last 15-pack of beer, and then I realized that I needed help. I was driven to the hospital by my partner and I detoxed over 5 days.  I know I‚Äôm still very early in my sobriety, but it‚Äôs refreshing to know that I‚Äôm not inclined to drink anymore, nor that it has a grip on my life.  \n\nAnyways, sorry for rambling, but congrats on your 2 and a half years!\n\nThe shakes are when you REALLY need to start paying attention to what your body is telling you hahaha. Withdrawals are the fucking worst.\n\nCongrats, 1.5 here. There is a fine line between the cultural thing of your average person having a drink with friends at dinner to just chill out and have fun vs drinking to cause anxiety as an undiagnosed or diagnosed condition.\n\nIt's absolutely NOT worth the hassle that comes with it! Big up yourself on a year and a half, you're well past the hardest bit!\n\nYep unfortunately been an alcoholic since I was 18 and I‚Äôm 27 now (I‚Äôve been to rehab + done AA). I started drinking as a way to cope with my anxiety actually and I haven‚Äôt been able to stop since. The bad anxiety the day after is so real and it‚Äôs what kept me drinking because if I just kept drinking I would never feel hungover or anxious (obviously a horrible mindset). Now I just drink because I‚Äôm physically addicted but I don‚Äôt enjoy it and I don‚Äôt think it even helps with anxiety much anymore. I would not recommend drinking to anyone! Especially anyone with mental health issues as it will just make everything worse in the long run. I‚Äôm 27 and fucked my shoulder up because of my drinking and have to get shoulder surgery soon because I can‚Äôt move my left arm. Very sad stuff.\n\nHugs ü´Çü§ó\n\nThank you ü•≤\n\nDrinking  in moderation is myth initially it feels that I can Drinkk occasionally but it is not possible in long go so drink alcohol for some time. Period like hostel life but then quit it completely\n\nI agree for people with alcoholism there is no drinking in moderation. Plenty of people can do it but if you have addictive tendencies or mental health issues just don‚Äôt drink at all it will mess up your life.\n\nIf I drink I just stop right when i get buzzed so you don‚Äôt have a hangover. Everything in moderation!\n\nI still always feel weird the next day\n\nYep. Could literally be having a couple beers at home to unwind and I feel full of regret and anxiety the next day, but I still do it for some reason ¬Ø\\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø\n\n[deleted]\n\ni get you, but at this point I have to be almost blackout drunk so I dont feel my anxiety its so fucked up lmao\n\nModeration doesn't work for many, unfortunately.  You take the first drink, the drink takes next drink....\n\n\"The drink takes the next drink\" that's such a good way to put it\n\nI can't take credit, it's a common phrase in the sober community, but it really spoke to me as well.\n\nThat‚Äôs fair üòÇ\n\nSame!! One or two beers (on a full stomach) every now and then is all I ever want\n\nStopped 3 years ago.\n\nThe reality of alcohol is that it‚Äôs a flammable liquid that literally damages every cell in your body and is classified as the most dangerous drug in the world.  On r/drugs they were talking about the worst comedown, with many people chipping into say nothing makes their mental health worse the week after than alcohol. \n\nI honestly would rather do pretty much any hard drug, I wouldn‚Äôt but I think on every scale alcohol is the worst drug you can put in your body. Just think why do medical professionals always go ‚Äúdo you drink or smoke?‚Äù, because both are the root cause of so much bad\n\nNo to alcohol. The cycle of normalization has to stop. Is there a disease or issue that alcohol doesent worsen?\n\nSo true! Alcohol is literal poison but normalized to society üòû\n\nyes, its uncanny how alcohol enjoys such a celebrated place in society while its responsible for so much internal and external harm.  And its cheap as dirt.  No other drug comes even close to the recklessness of alcohol and societal damage yet every other drug is judged so harshly compared to it.\n\nIt has tranquilizer, euphoric, and disinhibiting effects ...  it takes about 3 diff drugs to do what alcohol can do.\n\nI smh thinking of all the alcohol i've put through my body.  It must be like ...  hundreds of fifths.  1000?  And I have never vomited either.  Its hard to believe I'm even typing this right now.  ;D  Worst anxiety ever, worst effect on sleep health.\n\nI think it shows that our society will always want 'a little something'.\n\nI wonder how the western world would have turned out if alcohol had been treated like all of the other narcotics?  Carrying a PRISON SENTENCE.?  \n\nIt's the craziest juxtapositioning.\n\nLoads of governments are trying to ban flavoured e liquids or vapes because sweet flavours appeal to children. I obviously don't want children vaping, but I vape myself, and they want to make 'tobacco' the only flavour. Now, vaping is not exactly safe, I know. But I would 100% rather smoke than vape those nasty tobacco flavours. As if adults don't like fruit or sweet flavours.\n\nI've gone off track. My point is that they're attacking e liquid, but every other day a new super sweet vodka or pre-mixed cocktail is being advertised on TV, on bus stops, on every bloody website. Its so hypocritical. If sweet flavours are just for kids, then I want to see them ban all flavoured alcohol too before they come for something so much less dangerous. \n\nAlcohol is the absolute worst. Well, after the big 3 of coke/crack, heroin and meth. I destroyed my entire life within a few months of drinking daily when I was 18. Obviously others can drink responsibly but it was shocking how quickly the damage was done. And how sick I got in that period too. I even looked completely different.\n\nI haven't had even a sip in over two years, simply because it made me anxious after like one glass of wine. My heart would race and everything. Never happened before. But I'm so glad because my body definitely feels the benefits of not drinking and I swear I look younger. \n\nMy uber driver was surprised by my age and immediately said 'I bet you don't drink'. Not that looking young is something that you should aim for or that looking older √¨s bad but your outside appearance often reflects your insides. \n\nI hate how normalised alcohol is. My boyfriend is an ex-alcoholic and when we go to fancy restaurants, the staff often seem almost annoyed when we order soft drinks. I guess because it means we spend less and therefore they get lower tips. \n\nI was at one of my besties weddings recently and she and her family were totally supportive of me not drinking but random people I'd never met were trying to get me to drink? Why do they even care? My boyfriend lost friends when he stopped drinking. They said they didn't feel comfortable hanging out with him while drunk because he'd remember everything. Maybe don't drink yourself stupid and end up behaving like a total dick then? Good riddance to them. \n\nPeople want to drag you to their level. If you don't drink and they drink to excess, it makes them uncomfortable because they have to confront their own alcoholism.\n\nNah, I never drink alcohol - not even one beer or drink. My family has a heavy history with alcohol and I have a history with drugs and alcohol so if I drink even one beer or worse, a drink of booze I lose all self-control and it spirals out of hands and ends up with me drinking everyday for the next 2-3 weeks.\n\nSo yeah, I cant even if I wanted to.\n\nYes!! I used to drink maybe once every other week. The heart palpitations and brain fog I would get the next day were just not worth itüò≠. It‚Äôs better if you don‚Äôt actually get drunk, just buzzed. So now I stick mostly to ciders and wines etc instead of hard liquor.\n\nOMFG I feel you on the heart palpitations and brain god. So bad.\n\nI was a binge drinker, not every day, or every weekend, but when I did drink it was to blackout. My anxiety would typically be heightened for several days to a week afterwards. Eventually any euphoria I got from the liquor buzz faded over time, and instead all I got was sick and anxious. I replaced it with weed for 2 years, and while it‚Äôs less destructive than alcohol, I found my anxiety got worse over time and then the paranoia crept in. Overall I‚Äôd say most substances probably aren‚Äôt worth doing if you‚Äôre anxious, cause it made mine worse trying things, tried shrooms too, that made it worse for awhile. And I still get a little paranoid from that episode.\n\nSocially but haven‚Äôt since new years. Makes me feel like shit so I never think it‚Äôs worth it\n\nAlcohol acts as a histamine bomb in the body, which can fuel panic attacks symptoms and anxiety. Won‚Äôt touch it for this and many other reasons as well. :)\n\nNearly 2 year‚Äôs alcohol and drug free and my anxiety is greatly reduced. I find having a clear head 24/7 + exercising and eating well puts me in a headspace that I‚Äôm better able to analyse and overcome my anxiety 99% of the time.\n\nNot any more. I was like you, I drank a few drinks a week but noticed that even if I had a little I would suffer with bad anxiety for at least a day afterwards. So I've not had a drink in over a year (except for a tiny glass of prosecco at special occasions). It's just not worth it for me.\n\nYep, I quit 7 years ago and it has helped tremendously!\n\nI had to quit cos of the hangxiety and it was hard of course. Tried to go out sober but then I realised clubs and busy pubs are just shit and I was using alcohol to dull the noise and sensory overload and social anxiety. I lost touch with friends since all we had in common was drinking but that wasn't a bad thing. Reconnected with other friends who like quieter things and eventually really enjoy not needing or wanting alcohol. Think I'm about 10 years or so sober minus the occasional one or two beers when on holiday where I can just about cope with the anxiety for a day\n\nI was an alcoholic for about 6 years, 6+ drinks a day every day, I am now 2 years sober. To be honest, my anxiety is no better than it was when I was drinking. Id argue that it is worse, as the numbing from alcohol could effectively shut my brain up. But I absolutely 100% recommend quitting drinking. It is a literal toxin to our body and the fact that the consumption of it has been so normalized is absurd. I can now see that as I observe from the outside. \n\nIts tough to say how alcohol relates to anxiety because anxiety is experienced differently and on such a broad spectrum. As I've gone down my healing journey, quitting alcohol, marijuana, nicotine and caffeine, I still find anxiety consistently derailing my train of thought. Through years of therapy, I have been able to identify that a lot of my anxiety is learned behavior through previous traumas. From my own research, I would argue that the mass majority of peoples anxiety is rooted in an unrecognized trauma.\n\nABSOLUTELY NOT. Worst thing I have ever done for my anxiety was drink. I ended up self-medicating, become addicted VERY quickly, and was only able to quit after becoming pregnant with my son and getting diagnosed with ADHD/properly medicated for it. \n\nMy god, if there was one substance I could remove from the world for everyone‚Äôs sake, it would be alcohol.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHow old are you ?\n\nYES! Two beers gives me 3 days of terrible anxiety. I can't touch alcohol anymore. And yes this is a sad development because most of our culture is wrapped around alcohol. I'm still learning how to accomplish socializing without it.\n\nQuitting drinking isn't easy, but I look at the periods of my life where I didn't drink (including now), and I can say without a doubt, that my emotions were/are more level without alcohol in my life. \n\nThe hard part of quitting drinking (IMO) is that your social life might be turned upside down. I'm no longer friends with any of the people I would only meet up to drink with. I thought some of them were my good friends, but it turns out we don't really have much in common now that I don't drink. Going out to shows or festivals was a bit strange at first without the alcohol, but you get used to it.  \n  \nIt took time to establish new connections, but now I do way more fulfilling things with my friends, like go hiking, camping, snowboarding, etc. I also volunteer to help organize community events and meet a lot of ambitious and interesting people that way. \n\nI wish you luck.\n\nI drink most weekends, but I've learned a few things... I don't drink if I have anything planned the next day (at all) and I try and avoid drinking on Saturdays if I have a big work thing on Monday. I used to drink pretty much Thursday - Saturday (every night), but I was young and silly! I no longer do that, but I limit it now.\n\nQuit the booze if you can. I did it a few years ago because I wanted to be able to shut up any doc that tried to address lifestyle/diet instead of address my anxiety. It made a difference. The night of, next day and the next next day were always bad. No fun evening is worth two days of pain. \n\nEven if it took the edge off 5% any one suffering from anxiety would likely take it. \n\nStrategies: mocktails and NA beers are my go to of we must go to a drinking place. The best are corona NA, Budweiser NA and hop water mixed with kombucha mix with a garnish. But try what they have and see what‚Äôs good for you. \n\nOccasionally I‚Äôll have 1/2-1 drink, ei champ at a wedding, sake with sushi, mimosa at shower  about once a quarter on a special occasion. But really try to keep it to half a glass and you get the yummy taste but no repercussions. \n\nAlso, suggesting other fun activities besides just drinking establishments. People want to do new experiences, they just need help thinking creatively.\n\nI haven‚Äôt drank alcohol in over a year because of my anxiety. I have horrible spirals every time I drink, simply because I am petrified of alcohol having some interaction with my medications. I‚Äôve started to really enjoy things like non-alcoholic beers and mocktails when I go out!\n\nOccasional lurker here, I was under the impression alcohol was more a downer.  Why does it seem to spike anxiety?\n\nIt supresses the nervous system, so when it wears off the nervous system becomes over-excited making anxiety much worse.\n\nNo thank you, I‚Äôll stick to plants\n\n[deleted]\n\nI quit drinking 23 days ago, and I feel a lot better even though I hadn't drank heavily for a long time. My anxiety and anger and irritability was always worse the next day even if I didn't drink enough to notice hangover symptoms. I was on the fence about whether to quit entirely or make it a \"special occasions\" thing, and I decided to quit entirely because the line is too fuzzy and I couldn't rationally justify drinking at all. My only regret is not quitting 5 or 10 years ago.  \n\nTrue friends will respect your decision and be willing to enjoy other activities with you. If they give you crap or try to pressure you, let the trash take itself out. You'll have the best chances of staying sober if you can identify what makes you want to drink and learn healthy coping skills. Your therapist and recovery groups can help you with that. I've gotten some great support at r/stopdrinking as well.\n\nNo I have anxiety about getting drunk actually...\n\nit's rebound anxiety, all the suppressed fears come back even worse than they were before. if you are like me and many others, who have an extremely hard time with moderation after just one drink, then the only way to avoid it is to stop drinking.\n\nHappily sober at 23 because hanxiety and it‚Äôs just not worth the health effects\n\nSome anxious people can drink in moderation. I do. I don‚Äôt when I‚Äôm at my worst, because using alcohol as a crutch is how problem drinking starts. And I don‚Äôt at all when I‚Äôm depressed. \n\nAnxiety + hangover = suffering. Just don‚Äôt go there.\n\nI quit for this exact reason. The physical hangxiety symptoms grew too painful to ignore.\n\nI stopped and it helped a TON plus I lost weight. I got my medical cannabis card and that helps me WAY more. The next day after drinking my anxiety is ALWAYS worse.\n\nIt seems like a lot of people have had good experiences with some of the sobriety subs on here. And that could potentially be a good place to start. If you are seeing a therapist, you might also talk to them about helping you come up with a plan for quitting.\n\nYes but socially. When my anxiety has been really bad I have drank more to combat it. Which worked for the short term but I understand this is not a solution. Once my anxiety is better managed I go back to my usual alcohol habits and intake.\n\nno but mother was been alcoholic. she clean for 10 years now\n\nI don‚Äôt drink. It makes me incredibly anxious, I‚Äôm also emetophobic so anything that makes me nauseous is a NO. I‚Äôm on too many meds to fuck with it, too. I now will drink maybe half a drink in a sitting, any more and my GI tract is so unhappy.\n\nI do not recommend alcohol at all for anxiety. Maybe you‚Äôll get an hour or two (if that) of euphoria but that‚Äôs followed by 3 days of straight up panic attacks while your body is trying to recover. Took me almost 20 years to learn to not run to a drink to self medicate\n\nr/stopdrinking is great\n\nIt‚Äôs the entire reason I had to stop drinking alcohol. I would get so anxious for 48 hours afterwards that I could barely breathe. Literally. It became not at ALL worth it.\n\nAlcoholic of 18 years!! Always drank to ‚Äúcure‚Äù my anxiety. Getting drunk made me not think I was dying all the time, if that I had a bunch of medical problems. The issue is getting drunk always made me feel so bad the next day, I would have to drink super early to help get rid of the anxiety. Racing heart, palpitations with every movement, light headed etc. ya, anxiety spiking the day after drinking is something I‚Äôve dealt with on and off my whole life, I haven‚Äôt drank in a year tho and am in therapy now. Hope this works ü§û\n\nQuit 3 months ago. Only had wine with dinner. My anxiety went from an 8 to a 2. Only time it gets out of hand now is if I don‚Äôt get enough sleep.\n\nI don‚Äôt do anything that guarantees I‚Äôll feel worse tomorrow- because I already feel like shit today ü§£\n\nI had to get medical intervention because I used alcohol to push through all my anxiety and it made me fearless. But when I realized I was lying to myself it took a lot to stop. I‚Äôm newly sober but struggling with my anxiety sober.\nThe medication they give me is useless for my anxiety but my alcholism has been cured by a 10 day librium and low benzo regiment administered in a hospital. I feel better and sharper mentally but the anxiety is still a huge issue\n\nGo to r/stopdrinking !!!! I quit a year ago and my anxiety has noticeably improved. Couldn‚Äôt recommend  it enough\n\nI use to! It was to help me with my nerves, but I‚Äôve been sober for 4 years now and I do feel better\n\nCongrats!\n\nOnce I start, I can‚Äôt stop. It helps my anxiety go away temporarily then I get the insane hangxiety in the morning. So naturally hair of the dog. I‚Äôm trapped in a living hell please if you can stop while you‚Äôre ahead\n\nI no longer drink because of the hangover anxiety feeling and Id literally rot in bed for a day and hated that I could be doing something better with my time.\n\nFor sure! I quit because it just wasn't worth it anymore. You can too. It's no biggie! You're thinking about it too much. And be honest; you're hanging out with your friends and just having ONE drink? Any amount of alcohol is bad for you. Especially if you suffer any amount of anxiety/depression. Start drinking NA beers/drinks. They're making some pretty good ones these days.\n\nI definitely get like this when I go days straight drinking. Then, I can barely function the next few days. The feeling makes me want to \"stop\" drinking. Then it passes, and I go right back to it again. It's like a never-ending circle for me. And I feel like I'm dying and can't eat or drink anything.\n\nI drink to medicate my anxiety, it's become a bit bad, I never used to drink alcohol until I was around 19, it's become a very triggering concept for me to be honest ,\n\nI didn‚Äôt really enjoy it before I developed anxiety, but now that I have anxiety I DEFINITELY don‚Äôt enjoy it. I‚Äôm allll about being in control, which is why the symptoms I have are so triggering: dizziness, nausea, ocular migraines, because I am anything BUT in control. So, no. I don‚Äôt drink. If it took away my problems temporarily, I might take it up haha, but it only adds stress to my life.\n\nI don't drink often but very occasionally (maybe once a few months) I'll have 2-3 drinks and it will really help my nerves\n\nOn the contrary, I often feel like my anxiety is far better when I'm slightly buzzed, even when I'm hungover I feel like I don't ruminate that bad. Which is somehow even worse, since it's an easy path to alcoholism.\n\nI limit myself to 1-2 drinks if I drink at all. Hangxiety is VERY real for me and alcohol is starting to make me quite nauseous as I get older.\n\nEdit: I‚Äôm fortunate to be able to control my intake and stop when I decide to. A lot of people, several of my family members included, struggle with alcohol addiction so I know it‚Äôs easier said than done for many.\n\nAbsolutely yes. Anxiety progressively got worse the day after drinking. I would temporarily cure the anxiety with another drink, then another. It was a terrible cycle and finally decided enough was enough.\n\nI quit drinking due to hangxiety. I feel a lot better these days!\n\nWhen my anxiety was at it‚Äôs worst I didn‚Äôt drink for 4 years. Now that it‚Äôs finally under control I drink socially. My job is tough so I need a drink after a long week lol\n\nNah, never enjoyed it. Alcohol tastes horrible to me. ü´•\n\nOmg I WISH alcohol tasted horrible to me\n\nNot at all\n\nAnxiety and nausea is worse the next morning absolutely every time for me. I feel good whilst drunk then I want to go to sleep. I wake up feeling like I'm going to vomit until I die in my own bathroom. It isn't worth it.\n\nNo\n\ni have the same thing. it gets so bad the day after i pretty much never drink, plus genetic alcoholism isn‚Äôt in my favor so best to not start\n\nYes, but only beer. I gave up drinking liquor a few years ago. I will still order a margarita ot bloody mary every now and then. It's helped tremendously with anxiety the next day.\n\nYea I had to stop drinking completely. I realized it was sabotaging all the progress I have made with my anxiety. The few hours of fun are never worth the sheer terror of the next few days. I am a few months sober and feeling great and my anxiety is stable at the moment\n\nRecently stopped because of health reasons and well I just dislike sacrificing tomorrow for today\n\nI would be careful about using alcohol to numb the anxiety, this is a huge reason why people get addicted to it..\n\nI drank alcohol between the ages 14 and 17, left alcohol for other drugs.\n\nNow I'm 27, done a few drugs in my life. And to me it's straight out insanity how alcohol is the accepted drug in this world...\n\nI couldn't go out on the weekend without it for a while. I decided to quit once I realised the money I was spending. The hangovers were getting pretty severe &amp; when I started taking ssris the interaction was turning me into a psycho. You're far better off avoiding drinking, it's nothing more than expensive poison ‚ò†\n\nI only drink on a rare occasion. It‚Äôs not my favorite thing to do. When I do, I know to expect increased anxiety the next day.\n\nGiving up alcohol is one of the best things I‚Äôve ever done. I 100% recommend it\n\nYes, and it helped\n\nI stopped drinking last August after having drank for 12 or so years. I used it as a crutch for way too long, and it made my anxiety SO much worse the next day. So nope! Goodbye alcohol.\n\nI stopped a few years ago, alcohol is a shitty drug imo.\n\nNot anymore\n\nOh hell nah if I‚Äôm anxious it‚Äôs over lmao not about to be tipsy confessing all my woes and panicking lmfao\n\nSober for nearly five months straight. It was not a painful exit to be honest, maybe because I became more pre-occupied with physical activity (gym, cycling) recently, so that helped. Overall, I am very happy with results. Good luck.\n\nThis is the problem with alcohol.  It's actually a really great drug and blunting your anxiety, but the trade-off is, the next day, it's worse, so you go back to alcohol again.  Sooner than you know it, you're an alcoholic.  People who suffer from PTSD have this issue.\n\nThis could be me writing years ago. I used to drink a lot too because i enjoyed it with friends. I had my first panic attack when i was 25 years old. My hangxiety is extreme that whenever i go out, i get very scared that i might pass out or have a heart attack. So i always stayed at home and not go to school/job whenever i get hangover. It really affected my life. Until recently this year, im now 31 years old, I quit alcohol. I can say no now. Finishing a bottle of 500mL is enough. Its not worth it. You can stil enjoy with friends but just drink yours slowly.\n\nNever drank, never will. Alcoholism runs in my family on both sides.\n\nI have quit alcohol! The sub r/stopdrinking has really helped me, it was hard but worth it. I‚Äôm about 37 days in to my journey, hasn't been without it's downs and ive had to reset it twice. But it is so worth it, on my bad days I try and think 'imagine how horrendous you would feel if you were hungover'. You've got this !\n\nIf you‚Äôre comfortable with a glass of Pepsi or water while you‚Äôre friends are drinking and they don‚Äôt pressure you, if they support and accept you, great‚Ä¶if not, for your well being, you will need to choose you over those friends. See what happens. I wish you well!\n\nI used to all day every day.\n\nThen it stopped working and did nothing but make me sick.\n\nI haven't drank in 3 years for similar reasons.\n\nCongrats! ü•≥\n\nThanks boo!üéâ You're making the best decision putting your health first. It feels a little awkward socially at first but then next thing you know it ain't no thang\n\nI was drinking a lot more when dating (since grabbing drinks is such a popular choice, or if they insist you get a drink with them at dinner) and then started seriously dating someone who is cali sober. For the past year, my anxiety seems to have gotten better. Not so much that the alcohol itself was causing anxiety, but waking up the next day &amp; already feeling bad seemed to set the tone. Like, I‚Äôd wake up with a queasy stomach and headache &amp; would think about all the other things that caused those feelings, got anxious about my health, anxious about what I‚Äôd be unable to do that day now, anxious if it would continue the next day,  etc etc into spiral. Now I only drink on occasion &amp; have to do it on a day where I don‚Äôt have anything the next day just in case.\n\nDrank daily for a few months been sober 11 days now\n\nYes I remember searching Reddit for people with similar experiences a few years ago. It‚Äôs definitely a thing and you‚Äôre not alone!  I‚Äôm also on medications so I decided that alcohol wasn‚Äôt worth it. Actually just made 2 years alcohol free. A lot of places will have non alcoholic versions of popular drinks, at home/cookouts/parties I got into flavored seltzers and really enjoy that. Still gives you the feeling of having a can in your hand and you can pound them all day and feel great. There‚Äôs always the default water as well. I miss trying new beers sometimes but overall I‚Äôm glad I stopped.\n\nSober 5 years, best thing I did for my mental health.\n\nCongrats!!\n\nThis was me. The stopdrinking sub on Reddit really helped me see that stopping was not just possible but preferable. I quit 3 months ago the ago and have never felt better.\n\nI‚Äôm a little over a year sober, I drank to the point of jaundice for years and years. Every morning, no matter what, I felt like I was fucking dying. I would drink again to escape it and it became this horrible fucking cycle that progressed so badly. Now that I‚Äôm sober, my anxiety is worse than ever. \n\nDon‚Äôt even. Stop now, it will ruin your brain chemistry.\n\nBeen on 75mg for a few years and drink socially, never had an issue with it\n\nI use to a few years ago as a coping mechanism. But it messed me up so I stopped\n\nNo not really. Maybe I'll have one drink if I go to a fancy restaurant that has yummy mixed drinks, but otherwise no.\n\nThe hangxiety really scares me. I enjoy having a drink but when I have 3 drinks I suffer. I've learned self control and that's been good!\n\nNo, I quit last year.\n\nWent to a strip club and got tanked at 19, woke up in my friends truck missing one shoe and a couple dollars in my clothes the next day and decided that was enough for me. I was hungover for 4 days afterwords and the anxiety for that long is never worth it. I recommend just drinking one or two to be social, feel a little something, and then dropping it. Alcohol is only fun when you don't have control of yourself and even that's not fun anymore.\n\nSocially, but now that I started antidepressants again, I don't want to risk it.\n\nI am sober as well it‚Äôs better also no more drugs helps\n\nThat‚Äôs what ‚Äúhangxiety‚Äù is\n\ni‚Äôm always afraid of what it‚Äôll feel like to be super drunk and blacked out, so i don‚Äôt drink much. also my dad was an alcoholic so i don‚Äôt want to end up like him. i don‚Äôt rly crave it either, i‚Äôll get like a dirty shirley if i‚Äôm out with friends but that‚Äôs it lol.\n\nWhen i drink my anxiety increases immediantly cause i \"give up\" controll a little and its not something i need to overcoome so i dont drink :)\n\nI‚Äôm on and off. When i‚Äôm off alcohol i experience way less anxiety\n\nMaybe a couple times a year, that‚Äôs it. Being drink makes my anxiety worse.\n\nI‚Äôve never liked the taste, and whenever I do drink it my stomach/anxiety get the best of me and I end up throwing up and getting too nauseous\n\nNope I quit due to getting headaches. I drink NA wine which is delicious and no headaches.\n\nWhen my anxiety wasn‚Äôt as bad, yes. These days, no.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nIt's not a good idea to be drinking alcohol when you suffer from anxiety or any kind of mental illness because it will make matters worse especially if you are on anti-depressents.\n\nYes.  It‚Äôs a vicious cycle\n\nI stopped drinking about 4 months ago as it just made my anxiety worse the next day. I don‚Äôt crave it and don‚Äôt miss it. Although I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôll never drink again as I do enjoy a nice cold beer, glass of wine or whiskey now and again.\n\nMy anxiety is waay less the next day, I feel more like a superhero. I still closely monitor how much alcool I consume because I know how dangerous it is.\n\nUsed to get drunk 2-3 times a week - was a very heavy drinker and never had hangovers. Started working out more and my tolerance plummeted. I'd get insane hangovers from 1 beer. Now I can't have even a sip without gagging. Its better this way, my anxiety has decreased massively¬†\n\nAlcohol doesn‚Äôt seem to have much correlation with my anxiety. I‚Äôve gone long stretches without and it doesn‚Äôt seem to get better. I also don‚Äôt really notice it being worse after a night of drinking.\n\nNo ewww\n\nJust drugs for me üòÇ"

I'm meeting with my doctor next month and plan to tell them about my social anxiety. I don't really want to take medicine, but I feel like I'm at that point where if I have to, I will. :( Therapy doesn't sound helpful either, but I'm willing to give it a try, I guess. I just need change in my life, and I can't do it without facing my fears. I need a new job and I'm bad with interviewing. I also don't have a support system and desperately need to make friends.\n\nWell ive been given zoloft for my anxiety and also been going to a psychologist for about two years now. \nYou have to be more open-minded, i refused medication for so long and for no reason, i feel much better with it. Also there are many branches lf therapy youll have to keep trying fo sed ehoch one works for u. Goodluck! :)\n\nCongratulations¬†! how much do you think medicine has helped you? I mean, Im afraid of people so I dont want to go to the therapy. I have never tried zoloft but other antidepressants do not help me. I hope to go medical route only but no success so far\n\nThank you. My mom and brother just convinced me today to make the appointment for earlier because they're right. The longer I wait to start the conversation, the longer it's going to take for me to start feeling better. Waiting for the appointment, PLUS potentially a referral, PLUS the time it would take for medicine to start working... so I now have an appointment scheduled for next week.

    "all_comment_text": "I love Superstore. Just a silly little sitcom about working in a supermarket. Very easy watching.\n\nI‚Äôve not seen Superstore, but for similar vibes I‚Äôll add: \nSchitts Creek\nJury Duty \nParks and Rec\n\nUpvote for Schitt's Creek.  It took a handful of episodes to start growing on me... and then I just fell in love with it.  It's also makes the best gifs of any show I can think of.\n\nIn a similar style, I also like **The Office**.\n\nI don't care for The Office because most of it's humor is cringe humor.  Like, it hinges on uncomfortable situations... which make me uncomfortable.  üòÇ\n\nNew Girl is probably my favorite comedy.\n\nI *do* like Abott Elementary.\n\nFor non-comedies, if I'm looking to relax, I tend to like period shows (like Downton Abbey) or old movies (I couldn't even tell you how many times I've watched Rear Window).\n\nI just finished watching this for the first time. At first I needed a gentle comedy for the background but then I fell in love with the cast and their shenanigans. It's instantly relaxing. That and:\n-The Office\n-30 Rock\n-Parks and Rec\n-Scrubs\n-Community\n-The Good Place\n\nWas also going to say Superstore! Who knew it was popular with the anxious crowd. I‚Äôll add The Great British Baking Show.\n\nYes I watched the superstore it‚Äôs great. I will look into British baking show\n\nIn a similar style, I also like **The Office**.\n\nI was going to comment Superstore too! It's so good.\n\nor the good place!\n\nThe Great British Bake Off. It‚Äôs so feel good!! All of the contestants clearly respect and support each other. I could binge a whole season of it at any point to be completely honest. I watch it even when I‚Äôm not anxious. Plus, the stuff they bake looks absolutely delicious! That‚Äôs just my two cents :)\n\nAgreed!  In the same vein, Glow Up and the Great Pottery Throw Down are also mellow.  British competition shows seem to have a good vibe.\n\nI recommend Watercolour challenge and The Big Painting Challenge if you like bake off. Even more laid back, relaxing and feel good. Not sure the competitors are even trying to win, just enjoying the British scenery most of the time.\n\nOmg thought I was the only one. Their tone of voice also soothes me for some reason. They all speak so softly and polite\n\n1000x this. It‚Äôs my ‚Äúdrift off to sleep‚Äù magic elixir‚Ä¶\n\nI love how they aren't evil like just about everything on this side of the pond.  if they did it here they would add a twist like, 'if your crust burns this kitten will get zapped by a cattle prod'\n\nNot tv and I don't do this on purpose usually but putting on a youtube video about something you have been meaning to learn, tonight it was the fundementals of Chakras, I nodded right off haha\n\nI agree‚Ä¶ I suffer from anxiety and this is the only show I can watch without being distracted by my phone\n\nCame for this. It‚Äôs sooo wholesome and entertaining.\n\nThis is such a calming show\n\nAlso, it's got cake in it. Big bonus\n\nSecond this! Great feel good show!\n\nThis is the show they play all day, every day at my local nail salon/spa.\n\nThat‚Äôs my go to as well! And I love how no one is ever going to yell at each other. It‚Äôs perfect for those very anxious times.\n\nDefinitely this one!!!\n\nBrooklyn 99 is my favorite. Even though it‚Äôs a Cop show it‚Äôs really more of a workplace comedy. The more intense/serious moments are typically emotional or intellectual, not violent or dangerous. I can think of maybe 3 episodes total where death or injury are levied in a non-comical way. Highly recommend\n\nI love Captain Holt and Cheddar.  üòÅ\n\nSeconded, really great show!\n\ni've been recently watching abbott elementary, it's really funny and i can kinda force myself to pay attention since i don't want to miss any jokes\n\nI love Abbott Elementary!\n\nif you like abbott elementary, you‚Äôll love the english teacher on hulu! it‚Äôs so funny\n\nI have seen clips looks so funny. I cant sit still long enough for the full show lol\n\nWhat we do in the shadows is hilarious and it makes me feel better about my life because at least I‚Äôm not them lol also it has a bit of a dark twist if you like that stuff but don‚Äôt want something too intense. I‚Äôm a horror buff so when I‚Äôm feeling anxious this is just the right level.\n\nYep I love that show I think there is movie and a show or two shows I‚Äôm not sure\n\nI used to love ittt\n\nBobs burgers is always a go to for me, or Garfield, and I love tangled adventures with rapunzel üíï\n\nBobs burgers is the BEST. second cartoon for me is futurama\n\nYep! Bob‚Äôs burgers. 15 seasons of 20 minute episodes. It‚Äôs wholesome and heartwarming (except season 1 is a little less wholesome haha) but it‚Äôs been my comfort show for years!!\n\nit took almost NO time to get through it the first time LOL. now futurama has a few more seasons but man its amazing too. My husband and kid make fun of my cartoon loving nature.\n\nWhere can I watch bobs burgers?\n\nHulu!\n\nYes for futurama\n\nThe Great North is also good.\n\nParks and Rec is a super comforting show for me, it's very sweet and wholesome\n\nYes this is the first thing I thought of!! Unlike the office it isn't all cynical, people are actually happy and like each other!¬†\n\nEspecially after season 3 when all romantic relationships are more-or-less settled, it‚Äôs incredibly wholesome yet funny\n\ntrailer park boys, very chill and funny\n\nBut what happens after Ricky gets his grade 10?\n\nTotoro is soothing and beautiful.\n\nStudio Ghibli is so relaxing for sure! Totally agree with you there.\n\nDepends of the movie haha not all Studio Ghibli is relaxing for me. The ending of The tale of Princess Kaguya made me depressed while Princess Mononoke gave me an existential crisis\n\nIt's so beautifully paced. My kids love it and it calms them down.\n\nI was coming to recommend a Ghibli movie too, Whisper of the Heart. It's such a beautiful, feel good movie.\n\nAaah I haven‚Äôt seen Totoro in so long!!\n\nI know it‚Äôs a kids show but Little Bear is my go to. I have PTSD and nothing about Little Bear triggers my hypervigilance. Same with Bob Ross but you know sometimes you want a plot\n\nLittle Bear is SUCH a cute show. I could see this easing my anxiety for sure. It's a very calming show.\n\nBluey! I‚Äôm an adult, but that show is super comforting when I‚Äôm feeling anxious. \nMy other go-tos are schitts creek and new girl.\n\nSchitt$ creek. Absolutely. I wished there were more seasons of it.\n\nCame here to also say Schitts Creek! Just finished watching for about the fourth time, and honestly I could start all over again üòÇ\n\nI‚Äôd also say Steven Universe if you are going for children‚Äôs cartoons.\n\nBluey is so great for anxiety. \n\nMy Little Pony Frienship is Magic was also amazing for my anxiety but I know some people have issue with the show because the fan base was so cringe.\n\nAlso, Disney's new show Kiff has been a nice, light watch that has helped a lot. There are a lot of goofy musical numbers and the plot points aren't too intense or anything. It's also episodic so you don't have to keep up with lore or anything.\n\nTed Lasso\n\nThis‚Ä¶Ted Lasso is one of a kind!!!\n\nGolden girls has held up SO well.\n\nGolden girls is hilarious\n\n+1 for golden girls. It's comforting.\n\nAll Creatures Great and Small is one of the sweetest, most peaceful, relaxing, and enjoyable shows I've ever watched.\n\nIs it on Netflix?\n\nI think you can watch it through PBS.org\n\nWe Bare Bears. I really like how each episode is chill and cute.\n\nFrasier!\n\nYes!!!!\n\nFriends works for me always it‚Äôs my comfort show üíï Family guy for some weird reason but not when I‚Äôm actually having an attack just to keep my thoughts distracted‚Ä¶\n\nSeinfeld, Modern Family, Friends.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSeinfeld is so good\n\nSeinfeld was my go to sleep show for a decade.  Above all else, the thing that sealed it is the fact it's only really got the one soundtrack, the guitars.  No real drastic changes in volume or anything, it's all nice an consistent.\n\nSeinfeld is my nighttime show when I need something to fall asleep to, it's the best.\n\nSchitts Creek ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nNorthern Exposure.\n\nSUCH A GOOD SHOW!\n\nWhose line is it anyway?\n\nModern Family is my comfy show\n\nBob‚Äôs burgers would take my first vote, with the good place a close second\n\nGood place is SO good. and absolutely a good show to watch through anxiety!\n\nI‚Äôve rewatched it so many times, it‚Äôs yet to lose its edge\n\nSame! its in my rotation of the office/B99/Supertsore/TGP/Bob burgers/Futurama\n\nFuturama! I‚Äôve watched it so. many. times. It‚Äôs such a comfort show for me\n\nTo shreds you say?\n\nBobs Burgers, Modern Family, Delicious in Dungeon, Schitt‚Äôs Creek\n\n‚ÄúOh my God, eww, David!‚Äù\n\nFor me, it's always New Girl!\n\nYes!  My go to happy place show.  Makes me laugh every time I watch it.\n\nPlanet Earth or another David Attenborough documentary... His voice calms my soul\n\nI don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the same realm, but I want to pair How it‚Äôs Made in here. Another decently narrated show that has a ton of oddlysatisfying things to see.\n\nI love Gravity Falls it‚Äôs always a great and fun watch\n\nThis is. TOO. FAR. DOWN. *Angrily upvotes*\n\nGreat British Baking Show (the one w non-professional bakers) is what I've been watching lately.  I don't like competitive or loud content and also don't really go for scifi/fantasy for similar reasons.\n\nBut GBBS it seems like everyone wants each other to do well, which tones down the competitive element, and it's nonfiction.\n\nAlso Practical Engineering, and Studson Studio on Youtube.\n\nSpirited Away is my go to\n\nWorkaholics. Comedy gold and the guys in the show are all about not taking work or life seriously and just having fun.\n\nTaskmaster. Silly British game show with 18 seasons of content. All of it is on YouTube.\n\nseconding this, it's a great distraction when I'm feeling overwhelmed. the UK, New Zealand, and Australian versions are all worth watching!\n\nSouth Park is one of my go to comfort shows if I‚Äôm feeling anxious. I remember during the pandemic, I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all. I‚Äôd turn that on as background noise and it would be able to shut my mind off so I could sleep. \n\nAnother one is Sex and the City, but unsure if that‚Äôs your thing or not. It‚Äôs a show I‚Äôve watched since high school. It‚Äôs funny while having good storylines to it. There‚Äôs something comforting about it being in the 90s and early 2000s too.\n\nYes I will start watching south park I think. Also sex and the city I rewatched like 5 times it‚Äôs amazing I‚Äôm a 90s kid so it‚Äôs great for me.\n\nI like Bluey. Yes, I'm an adult, but it's a nice, cute show. Also Gravity Falls does wonders to me lol, I love it.\n\nAdventure Time is my fave!\n\nBridgerton!\n\nThere is something about that show that is so damn aestheticly pleasing.\n\nThe Office\n\nYes I rewatched it recently my fav show\n\nTry nature shows. Specifically Our Universe and Life on our Planet if you have Netflix. They're narrated but Morgan Freeman, and if that voice, coupled with beautiful visuals doesn't chill you out, I don't know what will. I sleep so much better when I watch them before bed. That's any nature show btw not just these mentioned. Something about the beauty of nature that just chills me out ü•∞\n\nMy favorite comfort show is and will always be Gilmore Girls\n\nFrasier, the Great British Baking Show, Schitt's Creek.\n\n**Pushing Daisies** ‚Äî light-hearted, beautiful, and poetic.\n\nAnother one that's too far down! This needs more upvotes!!!\n\nSuperstore, parks and recreation, Brooklyn 99\n\nNature shows. Specifically Our Universe and Life on our Planet if you have Netflix. They're narrated but Morgan Freeman, and if that voice, coupled with beautiful visuals doesn't chill you out, I don't know what will. I sleep so much better when I watch them before bed.\n\nthe mighty boosh\n\nFather Brown does it for me every time.\n\nWings. Just something about shows before there were smart phones and even cell phones en masse, that‚Äôs relaxing and easy to watch.\n\nThis will be the least popular recommendation EVER because it‚Äôs very niche for political wonks, but for me it‚Äôs the West Wing\n\nVsauce\n\nFirst two Harry Potter movies, howls moving castle, almost famous, Gilmore girls\n\nAlmost Famous is the best!\n\nCannot recommend Bobs burgers enough\n\nUm I actually watch videos of blackhead extractions because I somehow find it very relaxing and satisfying (and before anyone downvotes me I KNOW it‚Äôs gross but I also know I‚Äôm not alone üòÜ) If that‚Äôs not your thing maybe try Schitt‚Äôs Creek, it‚Äôs hilarious. I‚Äôm old so I also like reruns of sitcoms I watched in the 90s like Fresh Prince, Sister Sister, Seinfeld, etc\n\nSecond vote for Bob's Burgers. I absolutely adore that show.\n\nAnother show that fits this bill for me is It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, though I say that with some reservations. The show is almost entirely satire and categorically not okay for kids.\n\nBob‚Äôs Burgers is my absolute favorite. It has gotten me through so many anxious nights. It‚Äôs my biggest comfort show for years at this point.\n\nMike and Molly :)\n\nBeen watching alot of Harry Potter lately, seems to work well for me- when I'm not watching I'm immersing myself in the lore lol\n\nThis may be just nostalgia but my panic attack show has always been Boy Meets World. I usually jump between that and Game Grumps\n\nForest Gump\n\nBig bang theory\n\nTelevision shows: Landscape Artist of the Year, Portrait Artist of the Year, The Great British Bake Off (also known as The Great British Baking Show), Lego Masters, Nigella Lawson‚Äôs cooking shows, Best in Minature, The Great Big Tiny Design Challenge, Loonie Tunes, Merrie Melodies, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, All Creatures Great and Small, Planet Earth and other David Attenborough documentaries, The Good Place, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Cheers, Frasier, Derry Girls, Pushing Daisies, Scrubs, The Graham Norton Show, Anne With an E, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Muppets, The Muppet Show, Anne of Green Gables, Malcolm in the Middle, House Hunters International \n\nMovies: Planes, Trains and Automobiles, Best in Breed, Midnight Run, Election, Ferris Bueller‚Äôs Day Off, 101 Dalmatians, La La Land, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Little Women (1994/2019), Barbie, My Neighbour Totoro and other Studio Ghibli movies, Wallace and Gromit movies, Creature Comforts, Chicken Run, Shaun the Sheep movies, Mary Poppins, The Railway Children, The Artist, The Black Stallion, The Straight Story, The Shop Around the Corner, Local Hero, Harvey, Amelie, The Holdovers, My Dog Skip, Ratatouille, Harvey, Up, Paddington and Paddington 2\n\nKing of the Hill is one of my favorites.\n\nEureka / Warehouse-13. Not really sci-fi, but some interesting plots and characters.\n\n**My Liberation Notes,** it's a K-drama that delves into various emotions you often feel but struggle to express sometimes emotions you didn‚Äôt even realize you had. It serves as my safe space, offering comfort and solace in a way that feels deeply personal and reassuring.\n\nComfort TV shows are the best. Some of my favorites are: Parks &amp; Rec, The Office, Bob's Burgers, The Great British Baking Show, Planet Earth, Ghost Adventures (don't watch if paranormal stuff scares you; sometimes having this on is just really calming to me haha), or just put on the weather channel.\n\nThis is why the office and friends still get ratings\n\nGilmore girls is my current comfy show. Is helping me so much with anxiety/depression days\n\nThe Good Place has been mine lately\n\nThe Office for ever and ever.\nGot sacked? The Office\nPMS raging hormones? The Office\nIntrusive thoughts spiraling? The Office\nLovely dog of my life passes? The Office 24h/7\n\nMonk is excellent for this. Nice, funny, engaging, charming, retro fluff. Keeps you guessing more than other shows, cast have good chemistry. Top notch waste of brain cells.\n\nFor me it‚Äôs always been scrubs, how I met your mother or big bang. Seen all loads of time but I can just veg out on it.\n\nI‚Äôll add another vote for Great British Baking Show. \n\nAlso, hallmark movies. They are short and usually really wholesome. They were a calming part of my postpartum anxiety life after my oldest was born. I had a heard time watching ANYTHING but hallmark movies and GBBS were ok\n\nHonestly, Bluey\n\nI really love watching Modern Family when feeling anxious ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAvatar the last Airbender. There are no woes uncle Iroh cant fix\n\nSince some others have mentioned YouTube channels, may I suggest the Bob Ross of MRE reviewers, [Steve1989](https://youtube.com/@steve1989mre?si=4RFkie2RhpvtziKP)?\n\nI have zero interest in MREs, the military, survivalism, camping, etc... but my husband and I can't get enough of him.  He's so chill and amusing.\n\nMy god yes!!! You are the only other person I have ever seen watch him!\n\nI searched him out a few years ago after I kept seeing him get mentioned elsewhere on Reddit.  üòÇ  I was like who is this Steve MRE guy they keep referencing?\n\nNow it's a tradition for my husband and I to watch one of his videos together before we go to sleep.  Well... my husband often falls asleep during it.  LOL.  He's like, \"his voice is just soothing.\"\n\nAdventure time!\n\nHilda!\n\nI personally love Gilmore Girls if I'm anxious\n\nI listen to this guy on YouTube called ‚Äúredditor‚Äù read funny reddit stories. He has a really nice voice and the stories are usually super funny. I like to do something with my hands while listening, like playing with some putty, crochet, or doing a picky pad. Helps a lot.\n\nI know this isn't what you're asking for, but right before you turn on whatever show you've found here that piques your interest, I would suggest practicing your mindfulness/meditation for a few minutes before hand.  Get used to just sitting with the anxiety and watch those feelings float by like leaves in a river.  Take 5-10 deep breaths, close your eyes and sigh, and say something like \"everything is alright,\" and then go ahead and watch Bluey.  You got this!\n\nNot a tv show, but, the YouTube channel Game Grumps has helped me through tough times\n\nIf you‚Äôve never seen Hilda! I would highly recommend this show with great cutesy animation and a fun storyline as well as sweet little life lessons. Much love to you as you navigate your anxiety‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAsmr\n\nBob's burgers\n\nBugs life\n\nForest Gump\n\nNew girl and Monk are my go too\n\nBob's Burgers. I have it in the background all the time. I never tire of having it on.\n\nOver the Garden Wall\n\nBand of brothers is a good one, although my anxiety comes from war media, I relish in it. only because my mind knows the reality of war, and how it should never be romanticized\n\nMy go-to's are Bob Ross, the Joy of Painting (they're all on YouTube), and SpongeBob. Funny kids cartoons like that are great because they take you completely out of reality and the scaru/crappy parts of being an adult\n\nPsych. Such a positive vibes show.\n\nNew Girl\nPsych\nThe Office or similar\nStupid lighthearted cartoons like American Dad, Bob's Burgers.\nSome people go with YouTube rather than TV/movies. I like ASMR but a lot of people don't. Commentary or reaction videos can be sufficiently mind numbing depending on the person.\n\nI also enjoy What We Do in the Shadows, it's not as dark as you would think for being about blood sucking vampires lol.\n\nGilmore Girls\n\nBetter call Saul!\n\nsame issue!! as many said bobs burgers is a top favorite, adventure time is also awesome the end will be emotional but otherwise fine, how i met your mother is lame but good, friends, modern family, nobody wants this is a new one i blew through, brooklyn 99 is amazing, the good place, arrested development, the office &amp; what we do in the shadows. i‚Äôve seen almost all of these more than once and love them for low anxiety inducing easy watches!! \n\nalso love this thread for myself as well thanks for posting (:\n\nParks and Rec EASY. Its not perfect but its such a comfort show!¬†\n\nSo it might sound weird, old school Disney shows. Like wizards of Waverly place or Lab Rats. I honestly grew up watching nothing but this kind of stuff until I was maybe 25.\n\nDownton abbey, veep, the office, modern family are shows I can keep on repeat. It‚Äôs so comforting knowing what‚Äôs going to happen\n\nmodern family, bobs burgers, the office. my safety shows.\n\nTed lasso is super lighthearted and funny\n\nBob‚Äôs burgers is an anxious staple in my home\n\nGilmore Girls - saved me so many times\n\nGilmore Girls is a good one for this!\n\nFor me it‚Äôs bobs burgers!\n\nI love to watch little kid shows when I feel stressed, like episodes of Mickey Mouse clubhouse, Barbie life in the dream house, shows like that! They always help!!!\n\nGreat British Bake Off on Netflix. Sometimes the music can create some excitement, but they‚Äôre baking. They have British accents and no one yells at anyone else. I also enjoy Downton Abbey on Prime. It‚Äôs a drama with beautiful rooms and costumes. Oh, All Creatures Great and Small on Masterpiece through Prime too. Apparently, I enjoy British accents when I‚Äôm anxious. üòÇ\n\nTed Lasso! One of the best shows in decades!\n\nAdventure Time and Regular Show for the most part are pretty comforting but sometimes Adventure Time can get a little dark. One Piece and Avatar The Last Airbender are good too\n\nPsych is my anxiety show. I just love the friendly banter with all the characters so much, they remind me of my family haha. Though it is a crime show so people get hurt\n\nFor me, two of the non-sci-fi ones that I would go to are Psych and All Creatures Great and Small. Monk. Pawn Stars is another one. Nailed It! Sometimes Big Timber or Oak Island. \n\nI also do Murdoch Mysteries, the one that‚Äôs still in production, although there are some episodes that are a little more tense than others, but mostly easy to watch, and I like the characters and the setting.\n\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine saved my life. I‚Äôve watched it all the way through twice since I‚Äôve been pregnant. It‚Äôs my go-to when I‚Äôm eating or trying to fall asleep (two things that have been giving me a lot of anxiety recently).\n\n/puts horror movies recs back in pocket \n\nNot a romcom fan but I loved Nobody Wants This. Helped me during a very anxious time.\n\nRilakkuma (cute bear, but I have bad memories associated with it now so it doesnt work for me anymore)\n\nHeartstopper S1 (i would check a trigger warning website, but I love this show and the first season is more tame while the 2nd gets darker and the 3rd even darker so)\n\nGravity Falls (My friend loves this show, its cute. Haven't watched more than one or two episodes)\n\nMonk.  I watched the whole series during the pandemic and there were so many times I related to his compulsive nervousness.  For me it was cathartic.\n\nI sometimes watch kids shows for this reason\n\nYou know that kids show you loved back when? You know there were a few you didn‚Äôt really hate. Rewatch them.\n\nMy Little Pony: Friendship is Magic üíú\n\nFuturama?\n\nDr. Katz and Home Movies are great for falling asleep to. The dialogue is mostly improvised so it‚Äôs like listening to a podcast.\n\nI usually watch animated shows so bob's burgers, the great north, and futurama\n\nfor me, spongebob, phineas and ferb, old disney channel &amp; nickelodeon shows, most rom coms, the nanny, and the emperor‚Äôs new groove work well for this\n\nKing of the Hill\n\nOne of my comfort shows is Psych. It's funny and lighthearted and has a mystery element to it and extremely loveable characters. For me it's the perfect combination."

I feel like I'm constantly explaining how I feel to medical professionals only for them to say \"that must be really tough.\" Like yeah thanks it is what do I do about it.\n\nYour post made laugh so hard only because I know how you feel and I get told the same thing. üò© Hugs to you my friend!\n\nLast time she held my hand n said ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt have to live like that, living like that is not sustainable‚Äù then prescribed another unwanted antidepressant. Like babe my issue is a connective tissue disorder not just anxiety.\n\nsame and i hate it. like yes i am young. so help me please\n\nDon‚Äôt let them brush you off. Women are often ignored.\n\nIgnored so far as a guy as well\n\nI just read your bio ‚Äî ibs and anxiety, are you me (23F)?? lol\n\nlol its brutal out here üò≠\n\nThis is a bit delayed but I'd encourage people to really pay attention to their teeth. Low level dental infections can have really bad but just under the radar from accessing relief from the pain consequences. \n\nAnother thing to look into is whether you have auto immune problems. I was told I was clinically depressed, GAD etc for 15 years. It turned out I had chronic low level pain from psoriatic arthritis. The negative thinking and nervousness mostly went away as I got better and became more normal/balanced. \n\nDo your own research and make sure you keep your hygiene up. Mental health can make people not respect themselves enough to clean. Inflammation is the biggest contributor to mental health problems in my opinion and in the future this will become more understood. \n\nOne of the best drugs for me is a very small dose of tramadol. 50mg twice a week keeps me from suffering the low level pain and it also acts as a temp anti depressant for me. I've tried SSRI's, SNRI's, Benzos, beta blockers, booze, weed, etc but the small dose tramadol and eating and living clean helps me most. I still smoke cigs like a chimney though so I need to fix that.....Good luck to you.\n\nYes! So true! I feel horrible all the time and I have an autoimmune disease which is Crohn's disease. I have high inflammation... I have traumatic nightmares every night and panick attacks and a lot of depression and anxiety... It always feels like I can't rest, or relax no matter what.... I really wish they can find a cure for inflammation and autoimmune disease including Crohn‚Äôs üòî.... I don't know how I'm going to live the rest of my life like this.....\n\nI really appreciate this, thank you\n\nDon't give up, this has been my experience too but now, at 28, I have LOTS of diagnoses and answers. It's still a struggle, but it's better now I know what I'm dealing with. Don't let them gaslight you and don't give up on yourself - trust your instincts and knowledge of your own condition. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYes yes yes. Even when I‚Äôm okay - I‚Äôm not okay. I‚Äôm high functioning for the most part. I workout every day, work as a nurse, but it‚Äôs a constant feeling of ‚Äúsomething feels off‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need to figure out why I have this discomfort‚Äù\n\nMine is more so headaches, derealization, dizziness, and nausea though. Nausea being the highest.\n\nyou guys can work? I cant even work. I cant go to concerts or sporting events or make plans or go to dinners even. I live in the worst kind of anxiety hell. and the funny thing is its all subconcious triggers. I personally would love to travel and do things but actually cant bc its soooo uncomfortable every single time.\n\nI work because I have to, but every single minute of my 9 hour shift feels like I'm in hell. All I think about is getting home and lying down üò≠üò≠üò≠\n\nI understand that. I don‚Äôt work I‚Äôm retired but if I go anywhere I‚Äôm so weak and tired that I get anxiety. I just want to get home and lie down. Then I feel guilty but I can‚Äôt help it. My head feels like a bowling bowl it‚Äôs so heavy. The tests all show I‚Äôm just fine. I‚ÄôM NOT FINE!\n\nI feel your pain my health anxiety got me looking at the clock constantly and waiting to go home from work and then on days off constantly worrying that something wrong with me runins days off and ER people say it's just anxiety because blood work and urine test and EKG comes back normal¬†\n\nI literally have to force myself to go to work, and it is torture when I am there, especially if we aren't busy. Normally, if we are busy, i am okay, but when we aren't, my anxiety is through the roof. Anxiety sucks\n\nThis is me :( the dizziness is the worse.\n\nShit sucks\n\nFrom one nurse to another‚Ä¶I feel you. Lots of nausea and stomach pain with no known cause (saw a GI doc for a bit). I‚Äôm now on an SSRI and meds for my stomach, which used to help but not so much anymore\n\nI know I don‚Äôt have anything wrong, but I‚Äôm still considering getting an endoscopy just to try and prove it to my brain. It‚Äôs exhausting. I was doing well for a while, had a patient with colon cancer - and boom. Symptoms started to arise again.\n\nYou‚Äôre not alone\n\nIt often feels like it, and that‚Äôs the scariest part. I hope you find relief üíõ\n\nNursing is the most toxic profession on earth I 100% regret becoming a nurse\n\nDizziness is pretty big for me. I think it might also aggravate my tinnitus\n\nI wonder what does it\n\nIt could be anti-depressants, qs q side effect.\n\nI have tinnitus too. I think it's from stress and anxiety. Had it since February. Before that, I had it post-covid.\n\nI‚Äôm new to all of this, but I have developed worsening anxiety along with tinnitus. Interesting\n\nthe comments in this post are a breath of fresh air honestly. I love hearing that we're not alone in these feelings and that others have gone through the worst of it for us to at least provide some kinda help.\n\ni wake up every morning feeling incredibly sick, like wanting to vomit (no matter what I eat the day/night before), i get hot &amp; cold flashes, start sweating like crazy and it's just the *longest* 10 minutes ever to get out of bed\n\nstill just having random hot flashes (i'm early 30 male) at the thought of something triggering my anxiety. I've tried a few things but i'm on cymbalta and it's kinda leveling everything out\n\nAnxiety/panic attacks.\n\nI've had that for over 3 years.  For a while, it was every day and I barely slept.\n\nyes. in fact i feel like shit right now at work üòÇ\n\nCame here to say this. \nCurrently have tight neck muscles from being tense with anxiety. Worse on my right side where my TMJ is (teeth clenching from anxiety)and pulling all the way up to the back of my head. Lots of pressure and annoying smh.\n\nMe too! lolololol\n\nI‚Äôm going back to work in two weeks and dreading it. I‚Äôm counting the days anxiously.\n\nyou can do it!!!!! doing it anxious still counts ‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nThank you! I feel so dizzy though I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll do it. I thought for sure my brain/ears MRI would reveal something but no, zero organic problems.\n\nMe too!! Like shit\n\nSame lmao\n\nHow old are you ?\n\nI feel exactly the same. Totally relate. \n\nI think doctors sometimes not taking seriously people with anxiety. They put every pain in that case even if we know it is something else.\n\nThe only solution I found is to live with pain.\n\nI am 38. My doctor does take me seriously and has sent me for extensive blood tests, brain MRI, I had an EMG, some ultrasounds and now I‚Äôm getting tested for sleep apnea. Everything comes back clear!\n\nSame. 39.\n\nCan confirm. I had horrible neck pain for years and every dr told me it‚Äôs just anxiety. I felt like I was going insane. Finally someone ordered an mri and I have herniated discs, bulging discs, and loss of natural spine curve. But yeah it‚Äôs just ‚ú®anxiety‚ú®\n\nI am going through this right now, I think I need a mri on my spine cause constant pain and numbness tingling and itching arms. But doc says just anxiety üòï\n\nThis. I have anxiety so therefore (according to every doctor I've asked for help) any and EVERY symptom I've ever had is JUST ANXIETY. Honestly my anxiety REALLY wasn't that bad at all until I had excruciating back pain, constant extreme temperature fluctuations &amp; sweats/chills/shivering, nausea, dizziness, eye pain &amp; headaches and it was ALL put down to anxiety.\n\nyep. Dizzy, ear ringing, abdominal pain, exhausted, nauseous, irritable, aches and pains everywhere, reflux, burping...it's terrible\n\nI feel that. It may be a good time to consult with the doctor/psychiatrist about this. They can give you alternatives to what you‚Äôre taking or supplementary medication to help alleviate the symptoms. The main thing though, is when you do get something to help with it, is to find ways to alleviate them naturally like eating healthier or better, going on walks, and finding things to keep you busy.\n\nIt will definitely take time for these physical symptoms to recover, but you‚Äôre not alone. People telling you that it‚Äôs an exaggeration have never truly understood just how imaginative our brain can get when it thinks it‚Äôs trying to protect us.\n\nYeah I do see a therapist. I‚Äôm at the point where I just try to learn to feel like shit physically while still enjoying life. I feel like when I just say \"Fuck it\" and stop problem solving that‚Äôs when my physical symptoms are usually the best. When I‚Äôm browsing all day trying to find a physical cause for my symptoms is when I feel the worst.\n\nAt least you‚Äôve identified it! I definitely agree searching symptoms or even things like medicine side effects for what you‚Äôre about to take can definitely contribute to it. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre learning to cope with your anxiety but hopefully in the future you can learn to live without anxiety with support from your therapist. I‚Äôm working on that too myself.\n\nYep. Dizziness is my main thing although I do have low blood pressure, mostly due to not drinking enough water/eating enough. Nausea most of the time, feeling out of breath, general weird body feelings. Not fun\n\ninit i feel like i‚Äôve ran a marathon all the time\n\nsame and it makes me feel claustrophobic in my own body. idk if that makes sense\n\nIt does.\n\nYeah that makes sense to me.\n\n28 M, I suffer from anxiety and IBS. Such a bad double whammy‚Ä¶this week I was diagnosed with depression, my depression hurts so much and when the anxiety hits. I have to take time to make sure I‚Äôm not going to pass out and that I don‚Äôt show too much panic around others ‚Ä¶.\n\nI‚Äôve had daily abdominal pain from May 2020 to February 2021 and then again from June 2023 to February 2024. I would get some good days here and there but my intestines were hyper fragile. I thought for sure I had Crohn‚Äôs disease but got a clear colonoscopy and my calprotectin wasn‚Äôt at IBD levels. I‚Äôve been better now for 2 months or so. Still frequent discomfort but not as bad. Like‚Ä¶ why? Why the fuck do I have IBS-like episodes that last all day for months and my tests are all clear? My body is a big fucking joke. I started to get better when my constant dizziness kicked in and my mind was focused on that.\n\nI had similar problem Oct 2020 for a year. It could be Covid. It can enter by your mouth instead of nose and lungs.  I had 5 days of diarrhea, complete brain fog, and then just the diarrhea one month bad,  and basically a year. I had to take omeprozole for a year.  But that is not good long-term bc you need an acidic intestine to absorb vitamins and minerals. \n\nHydrate all day long (get a water bottle you like). Take probiotics, including saccaromyses boulardii ( which research shows actually decreases bad bacteria and increases healthy bacteria),  drink kefir, kombucha, Dannon yougurt, something high fiber for breakfast like shredded wheat (I like Berry Kashi brand).\n\nYou gotta hydrate for your ears to not have vertigo, and for your liver and kidneys to flush out toxins,  and for your bile to flow and not turn to sludge in your gall bladder. Also, a low dose of melatonin 3 MG only each night benefits the intestine. It is anti- inflammatory. Research shows it helps Crohns. It is actually made by your gut (along with the pineal gland.)  \n\nI found all this wellness info by Google.\n\nI feel like the anxiety and thinking in your mind you‚Äôre gonna be sick. There‚Äôs a link of some kind there ngl, it‚Äôs so hard to not be worried about your health and what‚Äôs gonna happen next.. I hope you feel better OP. I hate when the anxiety hits and the dizzy feeling comes like it‚Äôs so hard to stay calm and not feel like crying or like you‚Äôre gonna pass out\n\nMy biggest wish is for more research to be done into the links between anxiety and stomach issues. I used to get stomach cramps so bad it felt like I‚Äôd been shot. Not for 2/3 years now, fingers crossed. They would last for 1-2 weeks and I couldn‚Äôt eat or drink, even ice chips, without being ill. I was told it was IBS which was probably linked to my anxiety, but omg it was awful.\nI‚Äôm really sorry though, I know it sounds unhelpful but I do hope you can feel better. Constantly monitoring your anxiety is so exhausting.\n\nIt‚Äôs like Reddit reads my mind and the right threads pop up. I‚Äôve been stressed for the past several months. And it‚Äôs led to migraines, tmj, nauseous, acid reflux, and sometimes back pains. I literally had to call off from my job today because I was nauseous and I‚Äôve been struggling all day. You‚Äôre not exaggerating at all. It‚Äôs awful.\n\nReddit does read your thoughts.¬†\n\nEvery fucking day of my life. Everything you just mentioned I have too.\n\nAll day\n\n30f and I've been dealing with the nasty physical symptoms, chest pain dizziness all the things. Started buspirone and slowly increasing dosage hoping it all works out\n\nHow did you feel on buspirone?\n\nHonestly my Dr started me on a baby dose 5mg 2√ós a day.\nMoved me up to 5mg 3√ós a day.  Just today we decided we are going to bump up 5mg in the afternoon for 3 days then 5mg in the morning for 3 days and finally 5mg at night for 3 day to get me to a total of 10mg 3√ós a day.\n\nI like the medicine there aren't any horrible side effects(I experienced really horrible dreams on zoloft) a little bit of dizziness. It has helped my anxiety quite a bit from where I started (I was having chest pains that had me calling my doctors office after hours line every single night and crying to my husband insisting I needed to go to the hospital). I'm able to calm my thoughts a bit more and navigate a bit better  but I'm still not fully there.\n\nYes I‚Äôm only 25 so many test I have constant dizziness and head pressure I always feel I‚Äôm going to pass out\n\nYep, 35 year old male here with constant pressure between and behind the eyes with trouble focusing the vision, resulting in derealization/depersonalization.\n\n\n¬†The crazy thing is I was completely normal until like 2 months ago without medication or anything. I feel like I'm going crazy and I feel so embarrassed to talk to family about it.\n\nI was waiting for someone to post this. I dont have the headaches but i never and i mean NEVER have a second of mental clarity. I feel foggy all the time. Dizzy levels go way up in public/around large groups. I cant really go to many places im unfamiliar with or do much. I even struggle in places im very familiar with sometimes. we live in a very unique hell. I am on meds and all i can say is i have good days and bad days. mostly bad. i exercise a lot to make sure at least my heart is healthy.  2 doctors (out of the 20 I tried) said one of the issues is bipolar depression. ok well doesnt help much bc its been 2 years and i live in a cloudy drugged high state of mind all day everyday. i gave up on doctors i just live and suffer with occasional random relief. let me know when you find the cure.\n\nyeah. dizziness and headaches. and I've been waking up with pounding chest lately.\n\nsame‚Ä¶ I also have a hard time falling asleep because of the constant headache and heart palpitations.. \n\nso tired of this.\n\nI stopped drinking 6 months ago and I drank because of my anxiety and depression now I no longer drink I have to deal with all these feelings that anxiety brings it‚Äôs been crazy im goin to see a therapist on how to cope with all these emotions I have goin on in my head I don‚Äôt want any medication I just want to learn how to cope with it I eat healthy and I exercise but I need to be more consistent in doing this as I write this I‚Äôm saying to myself do more but there are days I‚Äôm feeling down and defeated üòî I took a mental health leave do I can get myself back right I pray everyone can live a happy life again üôèüèΩ\n\nI did the same thing, the first year or so is super rough ngl but sobriety gets soooo much better and my anxiety has been pretty sell resolved for a while now. You got this. Also for what it‚Äôs worth, do the 12-steps, they actually work\n\nI could have written this. I feel so seen and understood, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in this life raft with me. \n\nI have made myself sick, some kind of anxiety induced asthma. I never had asthma until last year. My doctor recognized it and gave me atarax to prevent inflammation when the anxiety creeps up. I have into use a rescue inhaler more and more these days. \n\nI am consistently tense and on edge, even when I am not actively having a panic attack. I have knots in my shoulders that look like swimmer‚Äôs muscles. My chest is so tight and painful all of the time I am sure I will have a heart attack young. The upside is that I‚Äôm always flexing everything so I have a lot of muscle üòÇ \n\nThe dichotomy in how I feel and what I am thinking is the most defeating part. I have positive thoughts, I think life is beautiful, and I have quite a good life. I am still making myself sick with 24/7 anxiety sucking the life out of me. \n\nI have tried I do all the things I‚Äôm supposed to do, like belly breathing and grounding techniques, but it just doesn‚Äôt work for me. :(\n\nI am sorry you were not seen or understood prior to this! And the only thing you are supposed to do is whatever works for you.  If it doesn't work for you, change up the routine or find something else. No big deal. We are all different.  Have you tried nature therapy...fancy term  for go outside and try to relax amongst leaves rustling, birds chirping, etc?\n\nThis is a mood. Blood test, Lyme disease test, sleep therapy, CBT, SSRI, now an SNRI‚Ä¶. And still I get told to just ‚Äútake it easy‚Äù and ‚Äúsleep more‚Äù even though my body feels like it‚Äôs actually degrading. Life‚Äôs a bitch.\n\nYes. I have the exact same symptoms. Wtf is up with the ear pressure? I‚Äôm just popping my ears all day long:\n\nLikely TMJ, bb\n\nI feel you on this. Everyone obviously experiences different symptoms. I'm a 30 year old male. I have similar symptoms that you listed, but the main ones I struggle with are frequent back pain, nausea, and high blood pressure. I also suffer from depression which usually goes hand in hand with anxiety. And on the note of feeling like shit all the time, I also do. There could be absolutely nothing for me to be upset about, and yet I start crying for no reason.\n\nI wish I could be of more consolation, but the only thing I can really say is it takes a lot to find out the best solution for ourselves. I was on multiple different antidepressants (at separate times), and the only two that somewhat worked for me were Remeron and Wellbutrin. I stopped taking Remeron because it made me sleep too much, and I gained a lot of weight from it. So I was still unhappy because it caused those effects. Wellbutrin just kind of stopped after a while even after upping the dose.\n\nI understand that you also said you have seen a therapist. I've only had one who I felt was helpful for me, and then ultimately left soon after I began my sessions. Never found anyone else that I felt was benefiting me.\n\nSo at the end of the day, it is a lot of work trying to find what does work for you. But I promise you will eventually get to that point. I still suffer, and I have my whole life, but I've learned to just kind of ignore people who try to tell me things such as to \"find a hobby\" or \"go work out or something.\" Those are positive things, but it depends on what works for YOU personally.\n\nhave you had covid? long covid can cause stuff like this\n\nI'm 25 and I also feel this. Head/ear pressure, abdominal symptoms, constant fatigue, back pain (though I know this is caused by little to no exercise and sitting)\n\nCould be drug induced micro nutrient depletion.\n\nI just tried writing a post about it but the algorithm deleted it for some reason.\n\nBasically SSRIs can deplete B-vitamins like B1, folate, B12 and B6.\n\nDysautonomia and fatigue can result from this.\n\nElliot Overton is who I learned about this from.\n\nI can't tell if it's my allergies or anxiety cuz they're both awful\n\nSame. I‚Äôve done tests and tests and tests every one comes back fine. In my early 20s I went through all this testing and I went through it all again in early 30s. Everything still good. I now think my nervous system is just fried from growing up in abusive household and that changes your brain development. And then going into adulthood things never really got easier. So yeah I think I‚Äôm fired and everything makes me feel sick now. I don‚Äôt even go out anymore just to work and home and lost all friends cause I won‚Äôt go out and keep lights dim and sounds quiet etc.\n\nYeah i feel ill constantly. I feel dizzy all the time. My ears feel clogged up and have crippling anxiety. Been feeling like this fir 9 months. No meds have helped.¬†\n\nNot all of the time, but a lot.  I went though a phase about 5 or 6 years ago where I was having panic attacks, constant pain everywhere, barely slept, several ER visits.  Every test came back clean, doctor's couldn't find anything wrong.  Not nearly as bad now but I still have headaches, tired, dizzy.  I'm to the point where I think I need professional mental help.\n\n29 and I can relate to this! Gonna see an ENT in 11 days!! Went to PT, got a CT scan and everything is normal. Turns out that it could be psychological bc it is a traumatic event that you could have expereinced.\n\nYES. LITERALLY YES. I always feel like shit and all of my tests come back clear. which is good i guess, but i don‚Äôt understand\n\n33 male \n\nyes, i'd say i typically feel about 20%, i get a 90% day maybe one every other week, and a 100% maybe every 90 days\n\nconstantly feel faint, dizzy, winded, heart pounding, fingers tingling, but every test says i'm perfectly healthy and just anxiety ridden\n\nthe biggest issue is that it affects my sleep quality, then the sleep deprivation makes me feel worse, which lowers my sleep quality\n\nYou get your thyroid checked? I was feeling the same way last year, turns out it was hypothyroidism.\n\nYesss I literally could have written this! &amp;Sometimes I feel a little shaky too!!\n\nI have a tendency to feel \"off\" mentally and it's been getting so much worse over the last year or so. And that \"off\" feeling is enough to send me into full anxiety attacks and equate it to losing my mind fully.\n\nThe ear pressure is so constant that my doc ordered a contrast MRI. Nothing remarkable and they presume it's just a combination of weird neurodivergent sitting habits and anxiety.\n\nI DM'd you, but I couldn't resist posting after all because I am so passionate about this.  Often times, medicine fails people who are dealing with these sorts of issues. We are trained to do a physical exam, run specific labs and imaging based on exam and history, use all the above to guide treatment. If we cannot find anything wrong, then we are stuck. Everything is (or at least should be) evidence-based, so it's hard to do anything outside of what is considered standard of care.  I hope I am making sense here lol.  Basically, you are going through a real process that we do not know how to test for yet. \n\nAND a big area that medicine often overlooks is your diet.  For some reason, doctors are not taught nutrition in school. I advocated for it while I was a med student and was shot down. I had to teach myself even though I paid 6 figures for my education (smh). Would you mind sharing what else you have tried besides the SSRI?\n\nThat does make sense and it‚Äôs very kind and thoughtful of you to reach out to OP and to also leave a comment. That is more than a lot of people will even try to do so I hope you know I see your effort and it is appreciated even if I am just some random internet stranger with anxiety issues! üôÉ\n\nIt must be frustrating to not be able to do anything about things like this, knowing you want to genuinely help people and make their lives easier through their health and well being. I imagine it‚Äôs very disheartening when you‚Äôre only allowed so many ways with the way the system is set up. I get that you‚Äôre kind of at a loss when it comes to finding answers for things when they don‚Äôt follow the diagnostic criteria and the way the system works.\n\nThank you moonjuicediet! I want to be of service to my community, and sometimes I wonder if what I am doing is making a difference. This just brought tears to my eyes honestly!\n\nEvery day and it literally makes me tired all the time.\n\nIt almost felt like I had wrote this. I even questioned myself for a minute, like, did I type this? Yes, I always do.\n\nI'm 33 F and feel like rubbish everyday it affects me going outside i have to force myself to do anything.My back hurts, i cant hear well, my hair doesnt look good.\n\nWith risk of running in to a link deleter, I try posting this:   \n[http://haidut.me/?p=2514](http://haidut.me/?p=2514)\n\n**SSRI drugs, serotonin (5-HT) can cause chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)**\n\nOpposite holds true also. Getting off SSRIs and temporarily using anti-serotonin compounds may cure the fatigue and associated maladies.\n\nSame and sore legs\n\nI no longer feel like you describe, but I did for YEARS. Some random thoughts: meds can cause dizziness/extreme fatigue, etc.; may be something to look into. Drinking enough water daily has relieved me of daily headaches and mid-afternoon fatigue: go figure! Breathing exercises were also major life-changers; that‚Äôs the first thing my therapist thaught me. I had an episode where I had diarrhea for weeks: took a week of PTO, it stopped, got back to work, started again, went on medical leave, stopped again. I‚Äôm someone who works out daily for 1:30 to 2hrs. At that time, I was barely able to do gentle yoga for 15 min. I was like, something is sooo wrong with me. My body was def telling me something, but not what I thought. It holds onto trauma in ways I don‚Äôt understand. Anyway, there is hope. It was 2 years ago and I‚Äôm doing pretty well since.\n\nI had a rough 9 months last year and felt like this nearly every day. The physical symptoms of anxiety lead to health anxiety, which lead to compulsively monitoring my physical symptoms, which just increased my anxiety. It can be a vicious cycle. It became debilitating and I could barely leave my house without as-needed medication. \n\nI had been on an SSRI that worked for years, but it stopped working for me, seemingly overnight. I started working with a psychiatrist and finally started a different SSRI that's working well for me. It took some trial and error, but I'm sensitive to several medications and tend to have rough side effects. I also switched therapists to someone that has more experience with treating trauma (which is a trigger for my anxiety).\n\nAll of that to say, yes. I felt like that for months and I thought I would never feel like myself again. Finding a psychiatrist and switching therapists made a huge difference. Once my body got used to the new medication, I started to feel better and I got my life back. I still have rough days sometimes, but it's not constant. And it no longer prevents me from living my life.\n\nYour first paragraph is exactly me!\n\nThe world is at a strange point in time right now. Try and avoid news and so/me, trust me, it helps ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nWait, you have times where you *don't* feel anxious? Lucky SOB... and you get just a headache, some dizziness and back pain?\n\nYeah I'm thriving in pain 24/7, haven't slept 2 hours straight in 8 years without some high dose of Benzos, high grade medicinal marijuana, or getting black out drunk off Whiskey or Vodka... and/or need to call 911 every other month for heart palpitations, trouble breathing, severe chest pain resulting in stabbing sensations inyour upper left abdomen... oh and the best part of it all.. your \"vitals\" (blood pressure and pulse) resembling levels of a 110yr old (I'm im 30's)  200/100 with a 250 pulse when walking... where I am admitted to the hospital. Luckily I always bring my laptop so I can work from the while being loaded up on Ativan just to survive and prevent the seizure.\n\nAnxiety is such a general term... we tend to exaggerate our problems to family and friends who think \"anxiety\" is just being \"nervous\" as if midterms or finals were in front of us, or as if on a job interview. Not the 24/7 physical pain some of us get to eventually, which only makes things worse. Just be thankful you only have mild anxiety, and nothing that impairs your ability to breathe.\n\nI'm glad they don't get it. Dont you??\n\nFirst thing first is realizing med school is grueling. Extraordinarily few Drs experience anxiety on a clinical level. Nobody cares about anxiety. How could they get through the whole ordeal? The concept of anxiety is a joke to them. I've met tons of people who only got help when exaggerating their experiences (saying you are depressed, seeing/hearing things, want to hurt/kill yourself, show physical signs of self-harm, etc). Not suggesting that!! ...but just stating a FACT at least in the US where Benzodiazapines (NOT SSRIS.. thank you HBO, Big Pharma, and The Sopranos) fell largely out of favor to treat those in need fore more profitable less effective treatments. Pretty sure its easier to get ECT than a Benzo script in 2024.\n\nF'ing spot on!\n\nHoly hell, I thought I was the only one. \n\nMy therapist recommends medication, but I can‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm currently researching microdosing as an alternative.\n\nI never could get the microdosing right as far as shrooms go. Plus wavey ceilings and walls are boring.\n\nI feel emotionally sick and exhausted. Nothing cheers me up. I feel like stuck in a loop all the time.\n\nFor me, it feels like I have to work so hard not to let the anxiety take over entirely and that takes so much energy out of me everyday. There was a point where I started falling from how dizzy I was, all because I was going through a super stressful time. I started SSRI‚Äôs for it, but now my therapist And I think I may need adhd meds. So I don't know if you explored other options of where the anxiety is coming from and possibly treat it different but it could be a possibility.\n\nIm 33 and ive honestly felt like this since i was 16, i do have a few health issues but it honestly feels like a never ending cycle of doctors every few months finding nothing. I decided at the start of the year i dont give a fuck anymore and im not bothering with investigating, the sense of doom and what if is tiring though.\n\nYeah I‚Äôve pretty much made the same decision at this point. I‚Äôll do what‚Äôs left of the tests my doctor ordered and after I‚Äôm done I‚Äôm entering \"fuck it\" mode.\n\nGood to hear. Takes up way too much \"precious\" time, whatever happens will happen\n\nYup can totally relate, it's weird because sometimes the sickness can change a morph into some other weird thing. Like one day It's nausea, weakness or just feeling blah. Next day it's dizziness and seeing stars or spot, brain fog too. Generally the aches and pains around my entire body are always there. It's so hard to deal with day to day. : (\n\nYeah once I get over one set of symptoms, something else starts.\n\nWe should make Feel Like Shit Club t-shirts.\n\nAre you on psychiatric medication? I‚Äôve heard many anecdotal tales of physical symptoms disappearing with proper medication\n\nYep. Just started mirtzapine with my Lex. The last 2 days have been great though. Hopefully this keeps up.\n\nYes yes yes! I couldn't even make it to work this week thanks to waking up with anxiety followed by just feeling unwell all day after. \n\nI can honestly relate because I've been to some doctors and they all give me the same story and tell me how the labs were perfect and whatnot. Truthfully I think it's a combo of my stress and anxiety. I always thought I handled both of those pretty well until recently. Turns out I was really good at hiding them. \n\nSo no you're definitely not alone.\n\nHit the nail on the head with this one! Every single day! And everyone just acts like it‚Äôs nothing smh. Hope you find some relief soon friend.\n\nSounds like your antidepressant isn‚Äôt working for your anxiety very well. Try switching maybe to a different one that‚Äôs more effective.\n\nI‚Äôm thinking of doing that yeah.\n\nWhat does de realization feel like ?\n\nHave you checked to see if you have inflammation in your gut? I have every symptom you have for the past 3 years since having covid then taking antibiotics. I got a gi test and a neurotransmitter test waiting on my results. My xrays showed me that very inflamed. Started a inflammation diet and boy does eating certain foods change the way you feel it‚Äôs crazy!\n\nYep, constant nausea, stomach issues, wasting away üò≠\n\nI just posted something like this. Currently in bed trying to figure out how to beat this!\n\nYes, headaches and tired all the time from my brain just going unless I‚Äôm asleep. Making myself put my phone away before bed and working on my breathing has helped me a lot. I‚Äôve also been trying to walk/ move a lot during the day so I feel physically tired in addition to the mental tiredness. I know this is small, but I also get small bursts of excitement/ joy whenever I‚Äôm outside and the sun is out. I actually feel a bit relaxed. Also, fruit helps. I have found that adding some fruit to my diet has helped my mental health a lot.\n\nI take pregabalin as needed if I feel the day will be anxious am I feel on edge. Works as good as benzo if not better. I have a prescription for 75 mg twice per day but I try no to take it everyday to avoid dependence. Extremely potent anxiolytic potential.\n\nYup everyday for me. No pills or anything though. Just trying to deal with it. Been a few years\n\nYup everyday. It‚Äôs gotten better but some days it‚Äôs never ending.\n\nHave you had any covid of late? Covid is known for increasing anxiety along with all the symptoms you have. Long covid be the most common term.\n\nNo covid since like two years ago.\n\nRight here with you had lung and heart surgery before they say everything is normal now but some days I barely have enough energy to even breath some days are good the first half then I get hit with derilzation and don‚Äôt feel like myself at all it‚Äôs a tough boat don‚Äôt give up\n\n28m I take drugs to cope with the pain but sometimes they just don‚Äôt work and I feel like shit depressed/bored/anxious. When there‚Äôs nothing else to do force yourself outside and sit on as chair\n\nMy dad is going through the exact same thing. If anyone finds a cure please share ü•∫\n\nSomeone did recommend Lions Mane mushroom powder to me for all of these things\n\nYep, lately if I'm not sleeping I'm worrying about everything.\n\nI did. Eventually I found out that I have mast cell activation syndrome. One of its big symptoms is anxiety, And lots of the things you mentioned.\n\nI‚Äôm the exact same way. 23F with anxiety, bpd, and bipolar 2. I live in basically constant pain and work is hard sometimes because of it. I was just about to get bloodwork done because my psychiatrist wants to rule out physical stuff. But honestly idk if anything is gonna be off. I‚Äôm sorry your experiencing this pain‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThis might sound silly, but are you drinking enough water?\n\nI tend to drink way less than recommended but I am trying to correct that now.\n\nPhysical pain, my back, joints, hands wrists hips all anxiety  apparently. Vertigo alot too, and tremor. I'm doing a quick taper off a few weeks of diazepam ATM so having some WD side effects also\n\nI feel the same way but I‚Äôm currently going through a diagnosis of broncietasis also and health anxiety üôÑ life is always seen differently for each of us, until people get the same sensations as us they will never understand‚Ä¶.\n\nI think a lot of people are autoimmune with no diagnosis or EDS POTS fibromyalgia or have hormonal imbalances. Doctors are too fucking lazy to do the right tests\n\nI always wonder if food allergies can cause your body to feel bad. If you eat things daily that you're slightly allergic to, you can have systemic low grade inflammation. Been wanting and curious if anyone has ever gotten a GI map done, or a test where you can tell what your genetic expressions are.\n\nYes absolutely. All these things. I had a neck thing a few years ago that a chiropractorhas been helping with but it definitely was at it's worst when my neck was out out alignment. I also take sertraline and have had high TSH at times on blood tests. Could be combinations of lots of things I guess. I dunno. It does suck though\n\nYes,\nWake up a lot of days quite rested and as soon I start my day I start to feel worser. Heavy head, high heartrate, brain fog, forgetting things and since a few months als problems with my belly. Bloodtests and cardiac exam all came back clear. Tbh sometimes you hope they find something so there is a clarification for your shitty feelings. Considering to go on SSRI‚Äôs now since my health anxiety also goes nuts.\n\nIts just so good were not alone and its a human thing to go through this. After rain the sun will shine üíô\n\nYes. Always tired, always some new thing making me stress to the point of exhaustion, always waking up thinking someone‚Äôs in the room with me, always petrified every sound from my house is some huge problem.\n\nI am so glad to have found this post . Lately , I have been feeling absolutely awful . Body aches , extremely tense muscles , nausea , ear pressure , headaches , back pain , stomach issues , tiredness , feverish , mouth ulcers , lack of appetite . I feel like I constantly want to fix it but I know that it‚Äôs just anxiety because I have done every test under the sun and they always come back clear . \n\nIt is insane how physical anxiety is . For example , today I felt fucking miserable all day physically and then I was distracted because I was hanging out with my family for a few hours, cooking a meal and the symptoms literally dipped right down and I felt fine for a while but then my mum broke a glass into some of the food and we had to remake it and somehow that minor inconvenience distressed me so much that I thought I was going to throw up and now I got no appetite for the meal I just made and trying to eat it made me feel like gagging . \n\nIt‚Äôs honestly unbearable .\n\nI do. Fatigue all that stuff. Suspect histamines and possibly dehydration. Inactivity is also a problem. If I have an office day, always feel better even with less sleep. I also get way more steps in. Also when I exercise hard I feel better but getting the motivation can be hard sometimed. Noticed that I'm getting usually an hour or less deep sleep no matter how many hours I sleep and wondering if that factors in.\n\nGot dizzy, head pressure, tinnitus awhile back here and there, figured it was Covid effects or after effects. But when I had a tick in me, also getting dizzy and feeling depersonalization and increased anxiety. Infections can be causing a lot of problems we don't realize. Covid also seems to hang around for a long time, it's apparently hanging around in the microbiome and perhaps sinus.\n\nMy thought on all of this is a lot of us having MCAS situation and making us have high histamine levels. Probably caused by weather changes and exaggerated by Covid.\n\nWhat kind of  back pain is it,? I mean if it consists? Do you see ant correlation with weather?\n\nI did and bloods kept coming back fine.\n\nThen they decided to check my Thyroid (thought they would of with the other tests ) \n\nAnd BAM I‚Äôm overactive and been put on meds.\n\n\n\n\nHave they checked you thyroid levels?\n\nI‚Äôll be checking them next week actually\n\nWhat's your diet and lifestyle like? Look in to GAPS diet or keto and go from there. It sounds too easy, but get outside and away from your phone.\n\nyepp\n\nYeah I suffer from fatigue. I feel like crap all the time. You aren't alone. I'm still not sure what causes it. Probably a lot of things.\n\nI feel miserable all the time\n\nHealth anxiety is a bitch\n\nYeah it‚Äôs terrible. Seems like I manifest every symptom I learn about. When one disappears another one begins.\n\nEveryday - have so many symptoms idek whats anxiety and whats not atp.\n\nI had dizziness hit me sometimes. I thought it is a bodily problem. Got checks done for thyroid and took medicines for gastritis.\n\nI was eating dinner one day and started sweating profusely for some reason. It went away the next day and everything seemed alright. I thought it must be gut issues since I also suffer from IBS \n\nIt was all related to anxiety :) You have to go inside yourself to find what is bothering YOU . WE DONT HAVE AN OPTION . All your body pain, tense muscles and shortness of breath .. everything is because of patterns your body has picked up. Sitting in a particular place in my own home triggered the symptoms . \n\nPlease üôè stop using your brain and follow advice from spiritual people . The dumber it sounds the greater it works. ‚ÄúFollow your breath‚Äù is the dumbest thing I have heard in my life . What can it do ? Will it solve my anxiety problems ? It does\nIt may sound simple. It isn‚Äôt . You will see the nonsense that your own mind is creating for you. You will see how it is not your friend \n\nDo yoga and do meditation everyday or twice a day like your life depends on it. Anxiety issues aren‚Äôt supposed to be taken lightly. If you are at a stage where you don‚Äôt need medications üíä you are already at an advantage. Start your practice now\n\nYou probably have reactivated Epstein Barr virus. It causes everything you listed. Used to be me. Look into it!\n\nI come to find that my anxiety was tied to not being hydrated or eating enough through the day. I'm t2d, so I get hangry and anxious bordering on panic attacks when my blood sugar drops. Keep some balanced snacks like nuts, edamame, cheese sticks, turkey deli meat, Greek yogurt and berries, celery sticks and peanut butter stocked up so your mood will improve. Gatorade, powerade or stur zero for hydration.\n\nYes. Every single day is something new. I‚Äôve been agoraphobic from it. :/\n\nYa thats me\n\nYup. Been feeling like shit for most of my life. And everyone says it‚Äôs cause I don‚Äôt work out and don‚Äôt eat well enough. And they‚Äôre probably right that it only contributes to the problem. But I have had times in my life where I was doing all of that, and more, perfectly, and still I was feeling like shit.\n\nYep.\n\nI think the anxiety is causing some chemical imbalances and neurological issues.\n\nYes very much so I'll stop by found when I got rid of toxic environments and people things got so much better.\n\nDo you have migraines or possibly fibromyalgia?\n\nYES! Look into finding out if you have an auto immune disorder. This can commonly be the case when you‚Äôre having many symptoms that don‚Äôt show up to doctors or on scans, etc.\n\nNow that's I've been on antidepressants for awhile I'm finally getting my sleep study. I think me saying my husband's complaints about my snoring getting worse sealed the deal. Whoo! I've been exhausted for like 10 years.\n\nYes\n\nGet some sun. I literally want to move somewhere sunny because of this. I have some depression too but seasonal depression is a monster. I feel much better in the summertime. You might actually be dealing with this too.\n\nYup I can relate to this. On SSRI for 3 yrs I think now. But its fine. I believe it will get better. And even it doesn't , then also its fine. Cause not all people get all they want in life.\n\nYes,  same to all\n\nThis is me 24/7, I never have or will take any type of medication though. I try my best to work out, meditate and stay as positive as possible. I know it sounds like complete bullshit when u read to meditate, but I swear it helps alottt. As far as physical pain, I just push thru it as much as I can. For headaches and dizziness I take vitamin b2 and magnesium, it‚Äôs not an end all be all, but it helps. Anxiety is anxiety, it just is what it is\n\nI know you mentioned medical tests but have you have iron, folate and b12 checked?\n\nThey are in my next blood tests I‚Äôm doing this week.\n\nIt‚Äôll be interesting - my b12 was horribly low and it gave me lots of the ear pressure and dizziness you mention. Hope you feel lots better soon!\n\nany chance you have allergies? i felt the same way too and had no idea i was living with pretty strong allergy to mold and dust. mold for sure can be a killer.\n\nYep.\n\nActually i have fibromialgia and anxiety makes it worst\n\nGuys!!! It‚Äôs the SSRI‚Äôs. Find a good somatic counsellor and process what needs to be lifted from your systems. Get tested for Lyme. Turn off social media. Be intentional about social connections. But seriously get off the meds.\n\nI am 24 and have been going through all of this as well. I noticed sometimes I‚Äôd get lower right abdominal pain but usually I‚Äôd eat or lay down with a heating pad and it would go away. A few days ago, that pain would not go away and it turns out, I have had chronic appendicitis for a year or more and did not know. I even got a cat scan a few days before I got diagnosed and they saw nothing wrong. When I went to the ER, they ordered another cat scan and they were able to see my appendix was inflamed and could‚Äôve burst any moment. I went into surgery, got it removed and all of these symptoms are GONE. Get your appendix checked out!!!\n\n21 F here! So I felt the same way and went to the doctors for somebody work. Turned out my vitamin d2 was on the floor. I took my first dose of d2 50,000 on Thursday and already feel less anxious and less tired! I also have a background of chronic sinusitis so I'm usually dizzy and stuffed up all the time. I would say make sure your vitamin levels are good!\n\nWhat does you daily exercise schedule look like?\n\nI have had anxiety all my life. I also developed chronic migraines with bad brain fog and bouts of dizziness. Pain, feeling tense and tight. \n\nHave IBS. I found out I had h pylori. It aggravated my IBS, gave me gastritis and GERD. Not a fun time. Got my stomach better (eliminated H Pylori and then treatments for SIBO). Gut health impacts our bodies in so many ways as it can regulate things like histamine and inflammation. When it‚Äôs out of whack so are our bodies.\n\nI had MRI, CT Scan, but things kept coming back normal. I see a naturopath and I‚Äôm on lots of supplements. Also was seeing physio and chiro and RMT and realized posture messed me up and lack of activity as I got worse, tightening fascia. So keep moving, yoga, even just walking. Work on correcting posture. \n\nI went to a from the neck up RMT. They only deal with, you guessed it, from the neck up. Damn! I didn‚Äôt realize just how tight my jaw was and neck, shoulders, upper back, back of head muscles were. They recreated my pain in and behind and around my eyes and my dizziness. I was so tense it was causing me so many referred pain in head and balance issues. \n\nhttps://fromtheneckupmassage.com/selfcare/\n\nPosting a link to at home stuff you can do. If it helps anyone I‚Äôd be so happy. If you feel referred pain or balance issues from any of the exercises it‚Äôs likely contributing.\n\nI‚Äôve been on a health journey for so many years. I‚Äôm 39M. I was diagnosed with a chronic connective tissue disease last year. I strongly believe many of the things that happen to us later in life is linked to stress, anxiety, how we take care of or don‚Äôt take care of our bodies. It sounds hippy but here I am, after I got no answers or resolutions from western medicine. I had to find the answers to my own health, I had to research online and find support groups for my specific disease and then find the one specialist in my country to get a referral to and sure enough he confirmed diagnosis but there was no treatment plan.\n\nI had to find out what was causing my migraines when told just take more pills. \n\nI had to find a diet that actually helped my GERD and gastritis when no one helped me with a plan and again just told to take medication.\n\nMigraines severely reduced, stomach a lot better but will always have to maintenance for SIBO. Flare ups greatly reduced. Anxiety manageable after over 20 years of it. I‚Äôm weaning off my anxiety medication and that‚Äôs the last medication I‚Äôm on! \n\nIt‚Äôs not easy. And I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt seek answers with western medicine. I had to and some yes have things that can be fixed. But for people who aren‚Äôt getting answers, try to see what works for you holistically. It‚Äôs not easy, it‚Äôs a long process, I‚Äôm still discovering new things to try. But I‚Äôm doing yoga, things like wim hof breathing and cold showers, I‚Äôm eating essentially paleo diet; no gluten, grains, dairy and also some triggers I found like onion, garlic, some nightshades, no pepper of any kind. No processed food, no sugars (just honey or pure maple syrup). Doing therapy for mental health (so important!). Was doing some guided meditations. \n\nDon‚Äôt give up hope! Keep trying. There‚Äôs lots we can look at doing and it can‚Äôt hurt to do more natural stuff. Even without supplements. But you gotta do the work. Took me again such a long time. Everything gets in the way. But I was crumbling and my anxiety turned to so many other issues I had no choice. \n\nHang in there!\n\nI feel the same way with my lupus."

    "all_comment_text": "I wish! \nSincerely,\nMy anxious fat ass\n\n\n(I joke lol)\n\nHaha same same. I‚Äôm with ya üòÇ\n\nI wish not. Kindly, my skeletal ass trying to put on muscle üòî\n\nWhen anxious, your heart is racing, your brain is on high alert, your muscles are tensed, and nearly every other system is in overdrive. While I don't know how many, it should burn calories.\n\nyeah from my muscle tension alone i feel like it‚Äôs a 12hr workout¬†\n\nIkr?\n\nIdk but it suppresses my appetite so there‚Äôs thatü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nYes, if I have a multi day anxiety attack, I will loose up to 10 pounds.\n\nYeha I‚Äôve literally lost like 6 pounds in the past 3 days\n\nWell, I hope you stop fretting about whatever is bothering you. I know it‚Äôs not that easy.\n\nThank you &lt;3\n\nSame.  I look great off my meds.\n\nUntil I started meds, I thought they just magically would make my metabolism slow down or something, leading to the infamous weight gain.\n\nNope, just made me not feel like I wanted to sprint out of my skin 10x day, which made it easier to eat normally üòÖ put on 10 lbs when I started and it became my new baseline weight.\n\nWish I could relate, the feeling of impending doom makes me eat everything I can get my grubby little paws on\n\nI can understand that. Eating can be a way of telling your body that things are normal, but for me I sometimes lose my appetite.\n\nI once had a panic attack so bad it counted as a workout on my Fitbit\n\nOmg me too! I forgot about that.\n\nI‚Äôve lost about 60 lbs over the past year, mainly due to anxiety.\n\nI lost a lot of weight from not eating when my anxiety started and when it relapsed. I never ate and found it extremely hard to put anything in my mouth. That changed with medication though. Im kinda back to my normal self. Well its been more than a decade with anxiety\n\nNah, you've lost weight from not eating. \n\nStress releases cortisol which feeds you sugar for your escape, which we don't do.\n\nAnxiety looks different for everyone\nI have anxiety and i eat like a Buffalo (i weigh less than 120lbs)\n\nI used to anxiety-eat, now I anxiety-starve lol I‚Äôve lost 20 pounds since May and I think at least 5-10 pounds of that is from not eating because of anxiety.\n\nSame I can eat anything.\n\nIf it did I should be stick thin at this point. Lol.\n\nSame ü§£\n\nGod I wish üòÜ probably burns at best 4-5 calories.\n\nPerhaps... but in some of us the consumption of carb laden comfort foods offset any calories burned, and then some. \n\nThere have been a few rare occasions when anxiety suppressed my appetite for short periods of time. However, there was always rebound weight gain. \n\nFinally, if we have anxiety that is severe and long term, our bodies are pumping out a lot of cortisol. Cortisol is implicated in weight gain especially the abdominal weight that is more unhealthy and harder to get rid of. It may not be apparent what is going on in younger people but at middle age it can really catch up with you.\n\nI'm already severely underweight. If anxiety made me burn more calories, I'd disappear in an instant.¬†\n\n\nIn all seriousness, though, I feel ya! And I think it does burn calories by increasing metabolic rate. I always feel exhausted and out of breath both during and after an anxiety attack. I feel like I've forgotten how to breathe, which just leads to more discomfort. Nothing has really helped me with it so far, so unfortunately, so all I can say is I hope it gets better for you!\n\n\n(Edited to fix formatting.)\n\nI overeat to soothe my nerves, that‚Äòs why I gain weight instead of losing it.\n\nA good meal is very well deserved after an anxiety attack. Bon app√©tit!\n\nA good meal, maybe. But I binge eat crackers and peanuts. üò≠\n\nDon‚Äôt buy them\n\nYup\n\nIf that was the case, I'd be a tooth pick\n\nUnfortunately i turned into a toothpick and my Apple Watch showed me why. It‚Äôs anxiety burning more calories than i consume , everyday\n\nWoa\n\nIf it did, I wouldn‚Äôt struggle with morbid obesity.\n\nSame here. My through the roof cortisol levels hang onto every gram of fat tissue and even though I try really hard I cannot lose an ounce üò´\n\nAwh man when you‚Äôre literally thinking youre dying and shaking . It does ive lost so much weight from it , but it can be dangerous cause when youre under weight from anxiety it can cause issues i been there its better to be a stable weight and not lose weight fast from it\n\nMy psychiatrist basically told me yes. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre an engine revving too high on a low gear\n\nI‚Äôve never thought about this. Asking the right questionsüòÇ\n\nI mean if we can‚Äôt change it at least get something good out of it\n\nGlass half full, always!\n\nI would love if this were the case automatically but as people have said, this would really only work if your anxiety causes you to eat Less food in a meaningful way. \n\nI have a tendency to stress feed, so no amount of extra breaths or a racing heart will lead to weight loss.\n\nAlso, anxiety tends to raise cortisol and worsen sleep, both of which lead to increased weight gain. \n\nIt‚Äôs counterintuitive but a healthy body requires periods of both activity and true rest. \n\nWith anxiety, I feel like I‚Äôm never relaxing. I‚Äôm always worried, and the feedback cycle of guilt and pressure never ends. The exhaustion is both my body and my mind.\n\nMost research into this has failed to show any significant link between mental effort and caloric consumption unfortunately. The fatigue is real but we don‚Äôt seem to burn any more fat when doing so. Which is a bummer for anyone who does a lot of mental effort in the day.\n\nGenerally, the only benefit I feel like my anxiety has given me is increased Empathy. All I have left sometimes is kindness, mostly for others, and occasionally for myself.\n\nAgree with the increased empathy.. I find myself giving small amounts of cash to homeless people on the side of the road with their sad signs... Saw a young lady sitting outside a kolache shop with a bag of clothes.. bought her some kolaches and cried with her... It was very humbling...\n\nwell it‚Äôs made me way too nervous to eat for about a month now, which has made me lose weight. but it‚Äôs not healthy because i feel weaker\n\nHow are you guys getting the appetite suppressant anxiety and not the eat everything in sight to feel better anxiety?\n\nMine does, i can't eat when i am anxious so mostly i don't eat üòû\n\nI hope not. Lol \nI‚Äôm underweight and puke when I get anxiety already. Don‚Äôt need to lose more\n\nYou've peaked my eating disorder's interest üëÄ \n(/j)\n\nI bet it does. But also when I was high anxiety I wasn‚Äôt eating either because I was afraid of getting sick. I was horribly underweight\n\nProbably, but the body is so efficient it‚Äôs probably like 25 extra calories. We were meant to go days without eating while watching for predators in the wild lol.\n\nI can‚Äôt break 130 lbs as a 5 foot 11, 30 year old man.  I definitely attribute it to calories burned by anxiety, but primarily the lack of eating.  I try so hard to get calories in but sometimes I can‚Äôt stomach eating anything at all.  Even garbage that‚Äôs usually enticing\n\nI'm super skinny and when I get really anxious periods I start losing weight which terrifies me, makes the anxiety worse...vicious cycle. I hover right at the bottom of a 'healthy' bmi. It's frustrating at times but not many people have sympathy lol. I started lifting weights and increasing my protein and this has helped a bit.\n\nI hope not.\n\nAs much \"buzzing\" it makes me do. God do I wish.\n\nAccording to my Apple Watch closing my activity rings most days when I‚Äôm literally sitting down‚Ä¶ I would say yes.\n\nüò≠üò≠üò≠\n\nRight? I‚Äôd be 5 pounds\n\nDepends on how it's affecting your body. It can make you overeat, stop eating or pump your body full of cortisol/disrupt your hormones because of the stress.\n\nI'd be so damn skinny. It's a freaking shame.\n\nIdk, but I do know that I‚Äôm unable to eat whenever my anxiety level is moderate to severe. So I tend to lose weight during periods of stress and gain it back once the stressful circumstance is over.\n\nAnxiety does burn calories!\n\nUnfortunately, it also puts your body into energy savings mode and can make you eat even more if you're a stress eater. You'll want to exercise less and you'll be much less energetic. Most luck you can have here is if your anxiety axes your appetite.\n\nI‚Äôve heard that chess players burn a crazy amount \nOf calories a day during tournaments. I feel like sometimes when at peak anxiety my brain must be doing something that equates to this‚Ä¶.\n\nI had the flu and lost like 10 pounds\n\nWhenever I have bad anxiety, I have trouble eating any kind of food\n\nIt can either suppress hunger but I know it can also lead to overeating \n\nI wish I had the latter because I need the weight\n\nIt does suppress my appetite so I assume it does burn calories in the long run.\n\nNot exactly the healthiest calorie burning but it probably does\n\nMine does!!\n\nI lost 15lbs in 3 weeks once. It was definitely due to eating less. So many things made my anxiety worse so I cut them out. I was still eating but only healthy foods. Funny how they make us feel better.\n\nIt doesn't for me lol\n\nLMAOOO THIS ONES FUNNY\n\nHad a doc in my 20's tell me I would never gain weight because of it. He was right.\n\nIt really should.... Then maybe I wouldn't be told to reduce weight all time. Wait, one of my reasons for anxiety is this so it's a goddamn loop ig...\n\nThe meds say otherwise lol\n\nLikely doesn't actively burn calories, but for myself at least I absolutely cannot keep anything down when I'm maxing out on anxiety. I've dropped dangerous amounts of weight during prolonged bad spells.\n\nDuring my worst period of anxiety in 2019-2020, I actually did lose a lot of weight. I‚Äôm currently overweight (6‚Äô2‚Äù, 220 lbs.), but at that time I was at 181 lbs. and people were worried about me.\n\nMy psychiatrist says the 30 lbs I lost (when anxiety took me over) was burned from energy constantly happening physically, nausea from the anxiety killing my appetite. When Lexapro got going for me, I gained most of it back.¬†\n\nStress releases cortisol, which prevents weight loss. \n\nI lost weight on anxiety medication, because my cortisol dropped.\n\nDefinitely does on me. Especially because my Fitbit would say that I'm technically doing cardio cuz my heart is racing and said I was burning a lot of calories lol which is not good for me anyway cuz I'm already really skinny and underweight\n\nThankfully though I finally found a medication that helps with my anxiety so my heart's not racing all the time anymore.\n\nI have anxiety combined with skipping meals too so yes technically\n\nThat‚Äôs a different story\n\nIt would surely be offset by the cortisol.\n\nDepends on how high your heart rate is.\n\nFor me it does unfortunately. When my anxiety was at its peak, I was my thinest, which wasn‚Äôt great bc I didn‚Äôt feel/wasn‚Äôt healthy. Now that I am having a resurgence (of anxiety) due to bc pill usage, I am seeing the weight come off. I am contemplating going off of them even though my period is awful‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm torn.\n\nI think anxiety can also prevent weight loss. It can also cause weight loss. I‚Äôve yo-yoed all my life due to anxiety.\n\nIt sure does speed up metabolism at least in my case\n\nYou would lose weight in a sense if it caused you not to eat.\n\nI‚Äôm riddled with anxiety and obese, so I assume not\n\nhaha, you'd be alirght if you can find the funny in it\n\nIn my experience, considering I lost 15 pounds in a month partially due to stress, yes it does\n\nWell seeing as I dropped 20 pounds from loss of appetite and feeling like I ran a marathon after an anxiety attack all the time, I‚Äôd say yes it does üòÖ\n\nI wish. But then when I lose weight that would add to my already long list of worries - üîÑ never ending cycle!\n\nIt increases cortisol so you can gain cortisol weight\n\ni literally lost 65 pounds because of my anxiety. üôÉ\n\nBetween the heart racing, shaking, vomiting, etc. and the meds that knock me out for the next day, I feel like I should be thinner.\n\nSevere anxiety can burn around 2000 calories day from the constant adrenaline. I suffer from it, makes it very very difficult to gain weight. When I take more of my anxiety medication I'll gain weight and hormones level out but i don't want to build a tolerance so it's goes back and forth :X\n\nFirst time I experienced true anxiety, I lost 10 pounds from not eating for days.  Then it morphed, and then I started trying to cope with shit and now I'm a bit chunky lol\n\nMaybe but it also releases cortisol which causes you to store up body fat.\n\nYeh I fuckin wish. I depress/anxiety eat and get fat AF\n\nIt does if you have the anxiety where your stomach hurts so much that you can‚Äôt eat anything\n\nI eat more sweet when anxious and sleep less which has caused type 2 diabetes and now I am anxious about it as well :-/\n\nSeriously we could do Olympia¬†\n\nI lost 20 lbs because my anxiety made me stop eating real meals for two weeks. I literally just survived off of protein bars and fruit\n\nYes! It increases your cells' energy consumption. But not enough to make a big difference on the macro scale.\n\nIt actually kinda does, just don't expect it to substitute the same calorie burn of a run or something.\n\nI‚Äôd be skeletal if it did.\n\nTotally does.\n\nFrom experience, the days I‚Äôm the most anxious and stressed I‚Äôll look at my smart watch and I‚Äôll have significantly more calories burned than usual.\n\nThis made me laugh out LOUD. Well done friend üò≠\n\nWhen my anxiety used to be really bad, I could hardly eat. But that led to a cascade of feeling lightheaded and more anxious.\n\nHealthy food and healthy eating is your friend.\n\nI would assume that anxiety = stress = excess cortisol released = weight gain\n\nI was clinically underweight for years because of anxiety üòî\n\nMy anxiety makes me constantly bounce my knees and I read that that burns 400 calories. I‚Äôm not actually sure how much I burn like that.\n\nIf it did I‚Äôd be dead probably\n\nIf it does then food is my medicine\n\nIt does. It shows fidgeters burn more calories than non\n\nWell... I'm sorry for what I'm about to say...\n\n\nBurning calories? Not sure.\n\n\nGiving me diarrhea and no appetite so make me lose weight: definitely ü•≤\n\nyes. (meds make you fat tho and i dont take any) my anxiety makes my stomach literally close and i can‚Äôt eat, in one year i lost like 10 kg.. it isn‚Äôt fun tho my weight is never stable bc of that\n\ni think it does but the increase cortisol means you'll likely not see anything positive of it\n\nalso body tries to use the same amount of energy as much as possible day to day so you'll likely take more rest after such an episode\n\nExactly!!! I mean come on mind is always racing at least burn some calories too ughhhh\n\nI have high anxiety and I am 140 pounds at 5 feet 1 inch. 20 pounds overweight.\n\nI think it does. ¬†I‚Äôve been in an anxiety spiral for 4 weeks and I‚Äôve lost 10 pounds. Lol. At lease one positive is coming of this. And I‚Äôm eating the same.¬†"

Here‚Äôs a script for you if it helps:\n\n‚ÄúHello, my name is _________ (first name) ________ (last name), and I was wondering if you have availability for new patients, please?‚Äù\n\n(If the person on the phone says yes, they will probably give you a list of their available dentists and you can chose one, sometimes they only have one available dentist and if you‚Äôre comfortable with their gender and you agree to see them, you can say,) : ‚ÄúGreat! I‚Äôd love to become Dr. _________‚Äôs new patient.‚Äù \n\n(The person on the phone will probably ask you for some information. First &amp; last name, date of birth, and insurance info. Make sure you have your insurance card in hand when you make the phone call so you can give them the info on your card. If you don‚Äôt have insurance, just let them know. Edit: Usually they will let you know if they are in your insurance‚Äôs network or not, when you give them your insurance info. Sometimes, they can give you a quote on how much a procedure costs out of pocket, such as cleanings, x-rays, etc.. You can also go on your insurance providers website, click on the type of insurance plan you have, and it should tell you what the company will cover, and what gets taken out of your deductible.)\n\n(Then, the person on the phone will likely ask you if you have any specific concerns for your dental health. Since it sounds like you just need a cleaning, simply reply,) : ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to schedule a check up and a cleaning, please.‚Äù \n\n(The person on the phone will then probably give you the date of your new dentists first available appointment. Sometimes these appointments are scheduled pretty far into the future. If the date or time they give you doesn‚Äôt work for you, simply ask,) ‚ÄúMay you please tell me what other dates are available?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúCould you put my name on the cancellation list so if there is anyone who cancels their appointment, I can take that slot instead and get in sooner?‚Äù \n\n(When they confirm your appointment details, I usually repeat the date, time, and check in time that they tell me, just to make sure the information is correct. For example, if they say your appointment is on, say, July 8th at 10AM with a checkin time at 9:30 * AM simply repeat back to them) : ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll see you on July 8th, for an appointment at 10:00AM, check in at 9:30. Thank you, and have a nice day!‚Äù Make sure you write it down so you * don‚Äôt forget, I always forget ü§£ \n\nGood luck, and you‚Äôve got this!! I‚Äôm proud of you for taking care of your oral health. ü´∂\n\nYou rock for this answer.\n\nSweet of you to type all of this for OP\n\nThere was a time, back when I was a teenager, before I was really getting treatment for my anxiety, I literally could not even order my own meal at a restaurant. I always wished someone would tell me exactly what to say. With 13 years of treatment up my sleeve, as well as watching Ez Butler‚Äôs series, ‚ÄúDoing things you‚Äôre afraid of to show you that it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù on YouTube/TikTok, I‚Äôve found a lot more confidence in making phone calls and going out by myself. All I needed was an example of what to do. That, and speaking with a polite and cheerful manner gets you a long way.\n\nOhh I love Ez Butler :) Their videos always seem so sweet\n\nOoh I‚Äôm gonna have to check out that series üëÄ\n\nPeople like you are the sole reason I made it through my years of struggling with extreme social anxiety. I literally googled ‚Äúhow to order at subway‚Äù and someone as amazing as you had answered this exact question on Quora, script and all ü•≤‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThere is a subreddit called r/ExplainLikeImScared with lots of kind people who write explanations just like this one &lt;3\n\nHi, thank you so much for this, u don‚Äôt know how much it means to me, I appreciate the time and effort u put into this just to help a stranger on the internet, and everyone else who has left a comment, I appreciate u. üòÅüò≠\n\nThis list that was shared is so great! Also if your dentist specializes in high anxiety or fear patients I would let them know that you have some anxiety. They can help to prepare your appointment to ensure it‚Äôs calm and also assist if needed with other options for treatment. ü´∂üèΩ\n\nAlso let them know that you have anxiety and if you take medication or see someone for it.  They will not think differently of it.  I have anxiety and issues with people near my face and male dentists becz of one bad egg.  I go to a really nice clinic that has dentists that work with it and can offer the laughing gas/Nitrous Oxide.  \n\nThey should do a free consultation and print out of your treatment plan with estimate insurance cost and your cost.  Please only go to ones that file claims for the services for you and who will do the prior authorizations for the clients.   Some will also (at least locally) will do payment plans between visits for your portion if you pay In cash .. my last visit I had 5 months between and every month I paid 80 bucks in cash.  It paid my portion the, gas‚Äôs and my next cleanings‚Äôs gas session‚Ä¶\n\nGood luck!\n\nYou got this, I know it‚Äôs not easy but it will get easier ü´∂\n\nI wish someone had done this for me. Thank you for taking the time to put this together. It‚Äôs wonderful.\n\nW human for this, not everyone has someone looking after them or giving guidance\n\nVery thorough! I‚Äôve been doing calls for a super long time so I‚Äôm pretty used to it now but I keep a little list just in case. It‚Äôs more general and sometimes I don‚Äôt even care to pick a doctor. They just give me whoever and if I don‚Äôt like that doctor I just ask to see a different one when I make my next appointment. \n\n- [ ] Are you accepting new patients?\n- [ ] Do you take my insurance?\n- [ ] Is it in network?\n- [ ] Are they seeing people in-person?\n- [ ] When's the earliest I can see them?\n\nDont forget to add\n'do you have any dentists with experience of anxious patients / those with severe mental health issues?  And can maybe afford a slightly longer appointment?\n\nThis gives me ‚Äú help me order subway‚Äù vibes and I love it\n\nReading through these types of posts and replies definitely makes me feel much better about my anxiety and panic attacks. I never (fortunately) got this far. Guess I‚Äôm a lucky one (between the unlucky ones‚Ä¶)\n\nOkay, but you didn't talk about price and insurance and all that. (Me: just having called the dentist and realized I didn't ask if they took my insurance and if there was an insurance price vs. cash price)\n\nThat‚Äôs a good point! Sorry I missed that!\n\nThis was super nice of you to do. You‚Äôre a good person. I remember being around this age and having so many fears about handling little ‚Äúadult things‚Äù such as calls like this and calling to set up electric. \n\nOP - you got this! What helped me is reminding myself that everyone has only gotta do each new thing once. After you make this first appointment, you‚Äôll never have an issue calling a dr for an appointment again. And usually if you tell folks it‚Äôs your first time doing something on your own, they‚Äôll go out of their way to be nice and patient. Especially health-related, they want new patients to feel comfortable.\n\nThis is so helpful for me as well. I need to make an appointment after over 20 years of not going. Thank you so much.\n\n[removed]\n\nNo u\n\nLove the step by step\n\nI love this and I'll just add that when you go in for your appointment, you can share, \"I have a lot of anxiety with going to the dentist but I'm working on it. If I'm nervous, that's why.\"\n\nDental anxiety is very common and it's why some people need sedation dentistry. It's great to let your dentist know that you might be nervous because then they know how to better care for you. Plus I believe in culturally normalizing anxiety for the benefit of everyone.\n\nThank you, I shall use this as well üòÅ\n\nThis is really kind\n\nYou're an absolute treasure.\n\nYou‚Äôre an incredible human being.\n\nMy dentist has a menu of things to make the visit more comfortable. The ones I remember are: weighted blanket, ear plugs, eye mask, lip balm, and my personal favorite: a chocolate chip cookie when the visit is done. \n\nFinally, always remember: this is an exam. If you are uncomfortable at any point, you can ask them to stop. Maybe you and the hygienist don‚Äôt ‚Äúclick‚Äù. Maybe the office layout and traffic is annoying. You can say ‚Äústop, please‚Äù and end the procedure and either fix the problem or find another office. You have control.\n\nI love these modern dentist that understand dental anxiety! Mine even offers prescriptions before hand so you are relaxed when you come in\n\nI was happy to find mine offered nitrous. I will take RX sedatives before something big if necessary, but I hate feeling drugged for the rest of the day. With nitrous, they did two crowns on me and ten minutes after they were finished I was on my motorcycle heading home with a completely clear head.\n\nI think just knowing it‚Äôs an option helps my anxiety. At my dentist they never leave you in the room alone either if you have a history of dental anxiety. It‚Äôs like having a buddy.\n\nIt's so cool some places are becoming more welcoming of anxious patients. I had a cleaning the other day and had the same assistant who remembered me from when I had invisalign fitted (where I ended up freaking out the whole appointment because I wasn't aware of all the steps they had to take). She explained every step she did, told me the x-ray gown would be slightly heavy before she put it on me, explained where each x-ray mouthpiece would be placed, it was almost too considerate!\n\nAnd honestly I've started bringing stuffed animals with me. A full on adult . Major stress reliever for me since I can squish them tightly. Very sensitive teeth\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis, and then you just answer their questions! They really guide you through the whole process - they‚Äôll ask you one question at a time like your name, DOB, and the numbers on your insurance card.¬†\n\nInstructions unclear, accidentally became a dentist\n\nThat‚Äôs exactly what I do.\n\nI always tell the receptionist that I‚Äôm a nervous patient and would like the hygienist, tech, etc that is most patient.  Then when I show up for the appt I remind the hygienist, dentist, etc that I am a nervous patient.  Let them know what works for you (ie, being told things or not being told things), ask if they have any suggestions to make you more comfortable, and let them know if you will self soothe (I say, don‚Äôt be surprised if I start humming as it calms me).  Be prepared to talk about a safe hobby, most medical professionals will engage in that type talk to help distract you and think of happy things.  Good luck.\n\nYES! Be as open and honest about it as possible. I many times am left bewildered by some patients who LATER I feel are dealing with MH. I think being informed AHEAD of time allows me to alter my entire approach to better meet their needs.\n\nI used to be way more reserved and would have trouble communicating something like that, hoping that this would be the one time I could be chill and not make the doctor think I‚Äôm crazy. Now I just flat out tell them that I‚Äôm afraid of everything and to bear with me‚Ä¶but someone with severe anxiety may feel too ashamed or well, anxious to say it lol\n\nThis is great, except, as someone who deals with MH, I‚Äôd suggest stop saying you‚Äôre ‚Äúafraid of everything‚Äù and maybe say something like ‚ÄúI deal with bad anxiety‚Äù instead? I dunno, just seems like the way we talk to ourselves is really important. \n\nAnd again, WITHOUT FAIL, any time a patient has opened up to me about their struggles with MH, I‚Äôm all about lifting the up! We have to be there for one another!!!\n\nI also sometimes bring headphones as the noises can get to me for certain parts of a cleaning or a procedure and they are MORE than okay if I have them on.\n\nSay, \"Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for a check-up,\" and they'll take it from there.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI am a health care professional and I am very sorry you have this experience. That‚Äôs really no way to treat someone who is already going through a hard time.\n\nYou could look and see if any of your dentist offices have online booking? Mine does and it‚Äôs the best thing ever.\n\nOnline booking is my favorite. If I can‚Äôt do it online I‚Äôll find a new office.\n\nI start with my name \"hi this is Sarah B, I'd like to make an appointment for a cleaning\" or \"hi this is Sarah B, I'm having a tooth ache I'd like to get checked out\"\n\nStart by calling and making the appointment and just be honest with them about your anxiety.\n\nI had a bad tooth after years of not going to the dentist for the same reason. I was honest about my anxiety and fear of the dentist and they took care of me. I know that depends on the dentist but you can always shop around before committing. \n\nGood luck and you got this!\n\nYou just tell them ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to schedule a check up. It‚Äôs been a long while and here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶I have this crazy anxiety about seeing Dentists! I know it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense, but it‚Äôs just there. And, it‚Äôs been keeping me from scheduling for years.‚Äù \n\nI BET you that ANY Dentist in the world will get that and be able to support you in the process! This is a lot more common than you think and any adequately trained health professional will be aware of how mental health impacts people wrt taking good care of themselves. And this is HUGE for you! It may not seem like much to you, but being able to put the Anxiety aside long enough to possibly have a different than expected outcome is a great step THROUGH the Anxiety along the path to recovering from it! I‚Äôve met many people who cannot or won‚Äôt do things like this. HECK, I am kind of the same way in that I let my Anxiety control me than me controlling it. We‚Äôre all works in progress‚Ä¶Remember that, ok? And be SUPER nice to yourself through this process. Treat yourself like you would treat a really good friend in the same situation. You would encourage your friend to do it and would be supportive of that friend if s/he had any challenges, right? \n\nIn full disclosure, I am a health care professional and when people let me know they struggle, my RESPECT for them goes through the roof and I immediately focus on really helping them navigate the process as best as I can. \n\nSo, call. Schedule. Report back, k? \n\nAND: if they seem like they don‚Äôt care in any way, cancel the appointment and call another Dentist.\n\nCall to make a cleaning appointment. Also, ask if they take your insurance if you have any (so have your insurance card with you, as they may ask for information listed on your card). They will have certain questions they ask like your name, insurance, etc, so don't worry, they do it all the time.\n\nCall them to make a new patient appointment but ask them first about what options they have for people with severe dental anxiety. Ask them to describe exactly what they do for those types of patients.\n\nIt might be anxiety-inducing to say but you could also say to your hygenist: \"I know I haven't taken care of my teeth in the best way. I have strong anxiety about it. Please don't go too hard on lecturing me about it. I will do better. It was hard even coming in, so I'd appreciate some understanding.\" \n\nThis is why I haven't made a dentist appointment. I have a fear of dentists from past history and I'm dreading making an appointment because I don't want the lecture I know I'll get. What I typed out is what I'm planning on saying and asking the receptionist or hygienist to make a note.\n\nHey I have severe anxiety and I‚Äôm a dental receptionist! In case you want some literal script to help you out:\n\n1. Hi! I‚Äôd like to know if you are accepting new patients and possibly make an appointment?\n\n2. Yes? Great, can you confirm if you accept my dental insurance? Here is my information- [have your card ready with member number. If you are covered under someone else, you will need their birthdate and possibly social security number for verification purposes.]\n\n3. Yes? Great, do you have any availability- \n[weekends, evenings, just tell them when you want to come and they will tell you what‚Äôs closest.]\n\n4. Perfect! Could you tell me what to expect during this visit? Is there anything I should bring?\n\nI‚Äôm a little new and only worked in one office so far, maybe others are different, but I believe most new patient visits include a basic exam and cleaning. Especially since most insurance covers these almost 100%. Any copay should be less than $50 for ballpark expectations. \n\nThe exam includes X-Rays which are not nearly as radioactive as your cell phone so don‚Äôt worry about that. The cleaning is surface level and while some people are gentler than others, nobody is really trying to hurt you. Our hygienist tells patients to raise their right hand if they‚Äôre in pain, and you can tell them if you‚Äôre sensitive and ask for softer handling. \n\nPlease prioritize your dental health! You‚Äôll want your teeth to be healthy and strong for you to eat, smile, and enjoy your life for a long time! You got this! ü©∑ü¶∑ü©∑\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!! step by step instructions have my heart i really appreciate this\n\nI needed this a couple days ago lol I was like ‚Äòyes no one picked up!‚Äô Then I was like ‚Äòoh that‚Äôs actually not good‚Ä¶‚Äô üòÇüòÇ now I have to do it all over again. I just rehearse what I want to say like my name, date of birth and that I want an appointment soon.\n\nShoutout to my dentist for having no issues giving me Xanax every time ü§§üôè\n\nTry googling for ‚Äúdentists near me‚Äù with anxiety/anxious patient/sedation dentistry tagged\n on; if you live in a larger area you should get some results and I find this helps because they‚Äôre used to seeing people who are nervous as heck. I also always tell them I have bad anxiety and because of it I haven‚Äôt been to the dentist for a while. I‚Äôve never had anyone make me feel bad about it or be rude about how long since I‚Äôd last been in. I ended up needing a root canal which hurt and was expensive and took several trips (I got sedation so I was able to manage just fine), I hope you‚Äôre able to make it in before you end up a silly goose like me üò≥ \n\n\nYou got this! It‚Äôs also totally okay to bring someone with you, or have someone call you make your appointment and let them know how anxious you are, if that‚Äôs an option for you.\n\nI found a dentist I like which reduced my anxiety a lot. You can find a dentist who treats people who have dental anxiety‚Ä¶ They will be especially gentle and may give you a weighted blanket which can help some people‚Ä¶ Oddly I just needed a very non-chatty dentist who was not judgmental at all. I did not want someone overly friendly because I want to get in and out quickly lol. After I found the right dentist, I didn‚Äôt have as much anxiety. Just want to say good for you for thinking of yourself. It‚Äôs useful to care for your teeth.\n\n‚ÄúHi there, my name is OP, and I‚Äôm looking for (what service you‚Äôre asking for. ie teeth cleaning). When would a dentist be available? Okay, so that‚Äôs on (date and time)? Thank you.‚Äù\n\nThis reminds me isn't there a subreddit for help about asking what to do for the first time at a business?\n\nI don't say this as some weirdly passive aggressive point to OP I just forget what it's called.\n\nif you recall lmk cause i need that lmao\n\nIt's r/ExplainLikeImScared in case you haven't found it yet ü´∂\n\nTell them straight up/ dentist are different now. Told mine I was a big baby and they were so great with everything\n\nHi, I‚Äôd like to schedule a cleaning\n\nYou may also be able to go in a few days before to get paperwork filled out OR they may email you the paperwork and you can then go to your PCP and ask for anti anxiety meds !\n\nCall them and say you need to schedule a teeth cleaning . If it‚Äôs your first time there they do X-rays anyway so they‚Äôll see if there‚Äôs any other issues\n\nCall and say:\n\n\"Hi, my name is _____, and I would like to make an appointment for a cleaning. Are you taking new patients?\"\n\nTwo possible responses. If they say no, say thank you, hang up, and move on. \n\nIf they say yes:\n\n\"Great, could I please schedule an appointment?\"\n\nThey'll respond one of two ways: asking for your availability or giving you their first available.\n\nThey may also ask you if you have insurance! So be prepared for that question. If you're worried about your insurance, you can ask them if they take your insurance as well. Most insurance companies list their providers on their website, so that is helpful info to have. \n\nHave your insurance card out so you don't get flustered (I always forget this and I'm ALWAYS flustered trying to get it out) in case they ask about it! \n\nLastly, it's worth telling them that you have anxiety about dentists. They see it all the time, and I promise they'll be very understanding and helpful about it!!!\n\nGood luck!! You've got this!!!\n\nLet them know on the phone you‚Äôre anxious about the appointment and it‚Äôs been a good while since you‚Äôve been. They‚Äôll be very accommodating. Another thing to point out is that they‚Äôll probably look to schedule you for a new patient appointment where the dentist will look at and X-ray all the teeth which is great to figure out a game plan for any treatment that needs to be done, but if you‚Äôre having discomfort in a certain area that has gradually gotten worse in the recent days/weeks you can also mention that and they might bring you in a bit sooner to at least look at the problem area only. Good luck!!!\n\nTip I learned recently for when they clean your teeth. Ask for the numbing gel . It helps so much if you have sensitive gums.\n\n12 to 17? Amateur.\n\nI'm 52 and haven't been since 17.\n\nYou want to make appointment.  That's all. They'll do the rest. \n\nBelieve me I'm terrified of the dentist.  My mouth is full of bad teeth from not being able to go. It sucks!!!!\n\nMany places will do everything (even cleaning) with sedation - maybe look for an office who offers that - if it sounds like that may help? :)\n\nYou can absolutely tell them you have anxiety. They will try to make you comfortable üôÇ\n\nJust tell them that you want to schedule a screening or a cleaning. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nGotcha beat kiddo, my last appointment before my fairly serious cleaning had an 18 year gap.\n\nI developed some black spots of which I assumed were cavities on my teeth and decided then was time for a cleaning.\n\nThey took me no problem, and I also had new dental insurance of which they covered the whole thing.\n\nRequired some fillings to be done, hypersonic cleaning, and about 3 trips to get caught up (within days of each other).\n\nSurprisingly it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, they have pretty good numbing medication and the most stressful part was the hypersonic cleaning not so much the drilling.\n\nWhatever that tool was it felt like someone took a soldering iron to my teeth.\n\nGo get your cleaning scheduled, brush well before bed, and definitely floss and use mouthwash at least daily.\n\nReal mouthwash as well, not the no-burn kind it's not as anti-bacterial. The brown stuff.\n\nNo amount of brushing it yourself will prevent the inevitable trip, our teeth just eventually need that deep cleaning and doing it on a schedule keeps it relatively pain free.\n\nWhat kind of mouthwash is brown?\n\nHonestly, the fear of losing teeth should be FAR greater than going to the dentist. I understand that‚Äôs it‚Äôs hard, but all you really need to say is ask when is the next available appointment and whether they accept your insurance. Some dental offices allow you to schedule an appointment online as well.\n\nI feel your pain on this one. I was the same way. I would literally cry when the dentist would clean my teeth.... That's how scared I was. I had a really bad experience when I was little so that's where most of my anxiety came from. If you're very honest with them when you call they should give you medication to help ease the anxiety.  Don't let them be rude or act like they don't take you seriously though. I got lucky and found a dentist that was very understanding. After a handful of times I didn't even need the medication anymore.\n\nI‚Äôm rooting for you!!\n\nPlease be gentle ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nIf your anxiety is bad enough: A doctor can sometimes prescribe something prior to your dentist appointment. Like a sedative. However, this will require you to have someone drive you home. \n\nBe upfront about your dental anxiety. I suggest asking about getting a cleaning done and go from there.\n\nThere is no shame in being afraid of the dentist. I personally am not a huge fan of dentists or doctors. However, my recent dentist is really nice.\n\ncrying2emoji5 gave a rad answer. Def recommend. I would add that mentioning you have anxiety to the dentist/receptionist can be helpful. Anxiety around dentists is super common and they're usually quite used to accommodating that.\n\nYou could use the ZocDoc app to find a dentist. It helped me a lot to read the reviews to see what other patients said about the care they received. I had major anxiety about going to the dentist and this helped me get an appointment scheduled. I found a great dentist who makes me feel very comfortable and Ive been going to her for the last 3 years consistently since.\n\nLiterally just tell them exactly that. They hear it all the time and will know how to treat you. I'm also deathly afraid of dentists and Drs and when I told the dentists basically what you've said they took good care of me.\n\nThis has been me since 12 also, I'm now 41 and still haven't made that call to the dentist üôÉ\n\nI never knew anything about dental health until I started working for a dentist. It‚Äôs confusing and intimidating, before you even get to the teeth!\n\nIt‚Äôs never too late, just do it. I‚Äôve seen so many patients in their 50-60-70-80s that are finally coming in to get the work done. The sooner the better! You might get sticker shocked and then a few years later, come back again. So tell yourself to just get the info first and back away if needed. There‚Äôs literally no shame. The dentist has seen worse, I garuntee it. Get it started. ü©∑ü¶∑ü©∑\n\nWhat is sticker shocked?\n\nSorry Im in the U.S. and lots of people aren‚Äôt aware how much dental care costs. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs better in other countries, most patients are very surprised when they hear how much treatment will cost. The phrase just means they are shocked by the sticker price.\n\nOh! Okay. I hadn‚Äôt ever heard that phrase before. Lol, very true though.\n\nIf you have anxiety around this it‚Äôs worth telling the dentist and/or explaining to the receptionist what you need in a treatment provider. I have had some bad experiences there and I felt like being told off about avoiding it and the shame of a visit after a long period had a negative effect on how I perceived the experience. \n\nAt the current practice I go to I was really up front with them that I needed a practitioner who could be mindful of my anxiety and would frame the visits and treatments in a positive way of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to fix this‚Äù and be gentle and encouraging rather than shaming me for any delay in visiting. I see the same practitioner every time because of that comfort level. After being really bad at regular visits for my whole life I‚Äôve now being going back like clockwork, have followed their instructions closely and haven‚Äôt needed any work done for two years ü•≤\n\nI‚Äôm still not the best at the dentist so I don‚Äôt have any real good advice other than what u/crying2emoji5 said! They nailed it w the script honestly lol. But I just wanted to pop in and say good luck and you got this!! Sending so much love!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I went through this myself recently at the ripe old age of 24 ü•≤ it‚Äôs a scary hurdle but once you get it, you got it ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI did this last year. Called and started by saying I am deadly afraid of dentists. I had looked for dentists that had a certified education in psychology/anxiety as well, so they were probably quite used to this. They have good notes about it in my journal, so when I visit them, they are very aware and kind and gentle.\n\nYou got this hun ..\n\nWhen they answer.. give them your name n say ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to make an appointment for ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù your teeth cleaned, I have a toothache , I think I have a cavity.. whatever you need to see the dentist for .. they‚Äôll give you some times they have available n you pick the best time for you \n\nAs some who hates making calls .. I feel you .. but sometimes we have to \n\nYou got this üòç\n\nI'm lucky enough that be able to text my dentist office, it's a comfort knowing I can text instead of call, but other doctors I have to call and I take my time and breathe\n\nMy doctors in my town have a texting system which I discovered and was so happy üòÇüò≠ but sadly my dentist is a bit behind and don‚Äôt have a texting or online booking system.üòî\n\nThe online booking for my dentist doesn't work üòî\n\nI ghost my dentist every time I feel something is not necessary and panic. Then I come back for the same thing or something else like nothing happened. \n\nThey're working, they don't care if you avoided going, it's not personal. They might tell you to come more often, but it's still not personal, just work. And if they shame you it's time to look for a professional dentist, no one should have to go to the doctor to be morally judged üòî.\n\nLol ikr idk too, but ive heard parents say their full name XD Like Hi, (?) on the phone...¬† Thats Wat they say here if someone calls them. I always wait first the other than me going first talkin in phone, even tho i should have talked. But the dentist one is so confusing.¬†\n\nTell them you're looking for a new dentist and you'd like to schedule a cleaning. If you have dental insurance, make sure they're in your network. The admin who answers your call will ask you some basic questions (name, contact info, any contact info for your previous dentist if you have it). \n\nYou can let them know it's been a while since you've seen a dentist. I'm sure they'll understand. You can do it!\n\nFind a dentist that will give you nitrous oxide.  You can google ones in your area.\n\n‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôd like to schedule an appointment for a cleaning‚Äù \n\nThen they‚Äôll probably ask you if you‚Äôve been there before and you can say \n\n‚ÄúNo, I actually haven‚Äôt had a cleaning in a few years‚Äù \n\nThey‚Äôll probably ask you about insurance if you have that, so have that information ready as well. \n\nI also have a lot of anxiety about the dentist and phone calls, and one thing that helped me was finding a dentist that allows you to make appointments online. For my first appointment I just went on their website and it allowed me to schedule my first appointment easy peasy.\n\nHi!! Dental hygienist here. Looks like there‚Äôs some amazing responses here about how to call. \n\nI just wanted to let you know that the buildup on your front teeth happens to everyone! There are saliva glands under your tongue that encourage the tartar growth there all day long. Just needs a cleaning and you‚Äôll be good as new. You‚Äôve got this! We‚Äôre not here to judge, just here to educate and help.\n\nAs someone who has put off going to the dentist for years and now has a disaster zone of a mouth, I recommend going as soon as you can.\n\n me too darling it‚Äôs been a bit since i‚Äôve gone and i‚Äôm 21 now. very proud of you for wanting to call now and take care of your teethies üíì\n\nI'm 35 and I always ask for nitrous oxide. Really helps with anxiety\n\nThe only reason I have a dentist is because they had online booking. Not all of them do but you could check and see if you could book online?\n\nI already commented but I just wanted to say I‚Äôm so proud of you for wanting to get this checked out now. I didn‚Äôt go to the dentist until I was 24 due to anxiety. When they did my first cleaning it was not bad at all though. I told them about my anxiety, they had a little questionnaire actually asking about my anxiety so that was really cool. They made my experience as comforting as possible. The actual cleaning was really interesting because I had a ton of buildup under my gums and I could feel it coming off, it felt like rocks. It didn‚Äôt hurt though, just a bit uncomfortable. But the good news is that once you get your teeth cleaned and you don‚Äôt have that build up anymore, it‚Äôs so much easier to floss and keep it from reforming. Once your appointment is over they‚Äôll schedule you for your next cleaning in 6 months and you really won‚Äôt even have to call anymore to set them up unless you need to reschedule. \n\nGood luck with your appointment! &lt;3\n\nI didn‚Äôt go for all of my 20s and for some reason I chose the pandemic to become hyperfixated on the status of my teeth lol I want to tell you it‚Äôs ok! I was so scared to go, but it ended up being mostly ok!! First they‚Äôll likely take some X-rays and then depending on that you‚Äôll probably have another appointment for a deep cleaning, which wouldn‚Äôt have been as bad had I been able to be numbed for it, I found snout I had high blood pressure from this actually and I ended up not being able to be numbed, but even so it was bearable. Now my teeth are in a much better place but I wish so much I‚Äôd went sooner. Good for you for deciding to go now though!!! You‚Äôve got this, just make the appointment and tell them it‚Äôs been some time and you don‚Äôt know what you need to do, they‚Äôll do the rest.\n\nI go every three months ever since I had a huge infection (from my wisdom tooth). \n\nPrior I went once a year, and in 2017 the dentist told me I have a wisdom tooth that should be taken out. He said it wasn‚Äôt a problem but in the ‚Äúnear future‚Äù it would be.\n\nIn 2021, I woke up with huge pain in my mouth. I couldn‚Äôt eat, I thought I had covid. I took Tylonel and the pain went away. A few days later‚Ä¶ when I tell you I could NOT open my mouth to drink a glass of water I was not kidding. It was in SO much pain. I was about to go to the doctors until I remembered it could possibly be my wisdom tooth. It was infected and luckily for me, that day they had a spot open immediately for me to get it pulled out. I did it awake when they froze my mouth. \n\n-$700 later and one wisdom tooth out, I now go every three months because of that traumatic experience. \n\nGoing to the dentist isn‚Äôt bad, I go for regular cleaning (and incase they see anything ‚Äòn).\n\nNo advice from me I'm sorry, just to say I feel your pain! Haven't been in 5 years !!! üò≠\n\nLiterally what you just posted. If they don‚Äôt reassure you that they will facilitate your anxiety then bounce. I also would read any reviews of the dental practice and see if you can find one others recommended that helps with anxiety\n\nOne thing you might consider - ask them if they have nitrous ‚Äúlaughing‚Äù gas. Not all dentists offer it, and that will really help take the edge off. I usually pay an extra $50 in the Midwest for it. Good luck! And it‚Äôs okay to be anxious, dentists deal with anxious patients on a daily basis - but the more proactive you can be with dental care, the less expensive and less pain you‚Äôll have in the long run.\n\nYou have got some good answers here. I just wanted to add that it‚Äôs okay to tell them you have anxiety regarding the dentist! Lots of people do. \n\nMy mother has been a dental assistant for over 40 years..(she does everything from root canals to simple cleanings..whatever the doctor needs. Her work also provides free cleanings once a month for the under privileged). \n\nYour dental staff wants it to be as painless and not-scary as possible! If they are worth their salt, they do care very much about making you as comfortable as possible! Just let them know that going to the dentist makes you anxious. I‚Äôm lucky I grew up with a dental practitioner because otherwise I‚Äôd probably be anxious as well. \n\nI need a cleaning, too! It feels so good when you‚Äôre done!\n\nTell them you have medical anxiety. Many will be happy to know what you‚Äôre experiencing. \n\nThey don‚Äôt want you to hide your pain or your anxiety. Their job is to treat both and they don‚Äôt want you to ‚Äútough it out‚Äù. \n\nThey have seen worse. I promise.\n\nDon't worry, dentists see people who have neglected their teeth for decades. They won't judge you. They will be able to clean and fix everything.  Once I didn't go for 10 years,  and they were fine.\n\nsame here, I just prepared two days for calling the dentist. Deep breath, start with Hey, I want to schedule an appointment, and they will kindly ask you for the rest of the information they need!\n\nYou‚Äôve got lots of great advice here.  I‚Äôm just commenting to tell you A LOT of folks have severe dental anxiety.  I didn‚Äôt see the dentist for close to twenty years, but had to go after developing a tooth ache.  I‚Äôm a lot older than you, and I work in a tough profession, so I felt obscenely embarrassed.\n\n\nAnyway, I went in, and literally just blabbed to the secretary, the hygienist, the dentist, and any else listening that I‚Äôm utterly terrified to be there, and that I‚Äôd really appreciate them being patient with me.  EVERYONE was AMAZING, and a few said even they get nervous!  If you find you can, be completely up front about your anxiety, and they‚Äôll go much slower with you.  It still sucks, and I still have trepidation going,  but I‚Äôm very good about going to my cleanings now.\n\nBEST thing is to be honest the minute you call.  Hi, I am super anxious about dentists but I need an appointment.  If you don't feel comfortable with how they respond or treat you then, keep calling until you find the one that makes you feel like they understand.  and kudos to crying2emoji5 for the script!!!\n\nI completely understand this post. I'm literally in the same predicament and I need make the call today my mouth is HUUURTING\n\nI‚Äôm my experience if I can work up the strength to call that‚Äôs half the battle, then when they pick up I say ‚Äúyes I am calling to schedule an appointment‚Äù then they just start asking me questions to set things up, because I gave them nothing to go on. \nNow that they are asking questions, the burden is lessened for me.\n\n\"Hi Dentist\"\n\n  \nComplete sarcasm there\n\nFrom someone that also has dentist anxiety, YOULL BE OKAY. I finally bit the bullet and called because I was having bad headaches and tooth pain. Waited so long now I have like 5 cavities. Had them take care of the worst area 1st because I was low on funds, no more headaches or pain. Once I have more money I will be going back for the next area. Sometimes it's worth ignoring your anxiety and just doing it.\n\nI too am deathly afraid of the dentist and I'm in my 30s. I havent  been since way before covid. I just called a few days ago since I've been having alot of pain that's causing my migraines. All you gotta do is just tell them the reason your making the appointment, give them ur information like ur name phone number address (mainly if you haven't been to that dentist) and confirm which day you prefer to appointment to be on. They might ask if you have insurance so if you have that information make sure you have that ready as well. Good Luck!!\n\nI avoided the dentist for awhile. Not a crippling fear, but a mid-level and laziness. I woke up with horrible pain in my molars. Next thing I knew, I needed three root-canals. Since then, I'm on top of it. A little pain never hurt anyone.\n\nI make appointments online. Might be an option\n\nHonestly if you are 17, unless you are legally emancipated (at least in the US) they will tell you they need to speak with a guardian‚Ä¶but there are LOTS of options for people in your position to receive good care even in a denti-cal clinic to help you with your anxiety. Showing up is the hard part, and it sounds like you are ready to do it, congratulations and take care of your teeth while you are young, you don‚Äôt want bone loss from avoiding cleanings!\n\nAlso. Check Google reviews. Some dentists are soo nice and gentle now.  Always checking in with you as they go. We found ours through reading reviews and now I go 6 monthly for my cleans (used to be like every 5 years and only with a bad toothache).\n\nI couldn't go to the dentist for 10y (I live in the US and I didn't have insurance or the money for it) I can tell you that in my experience dental hygienist have been the sweetest to my case. I had periodontal decease, not severe but bad enough. They were so sweet and gentle and did not judge, they were super caring.\n\nI have severe anxiety, fear to the dentist (because in the past I was always in pain during these visits), and not the best at keeping up with my teeth cleaning because brushing is too distracting? Or not distracting enough? (Adhd thing I guess)\n\nI swear they were super sweet and caring, they listened to my fear and made sure I felt nothing. Genuinely just go and be open, try your best to explain the situation, most hygienist and dentist truly care for your health and want you to not ve scared.\n\nI'm EXACTLY the same way!  I put it off for yearsss and then finally went! I ended up having quite a few problems so I'm glad I finally did go. I just called and made an apt for a cleaning, but when I finally got there, I let my hygienist and dentist know how anxious I was! They were amazing and still are to this day! It's been a lo g journey but I'm finally in the green zone with my teeth and I couldn't be happier! It takes time and if you can find the right dentist, you'll be great! I've found that a lot of the younger dentists are more understanding, not set in their ways like some older ones. And, in my own opinion,  they are more up to date on newer  techniques and ways to help!  Maybe see if there is someone who can go with you! I wish you the best of luck!\n\nI totally get this. I avoided the dentist from about 20 years old to 25 years old, and the only reason I went was because my then-boyfriend was in dental school. He knew how much anxiety it gave me, and I would start shedding tears uncontrollably. He helped me get over my fears. Then I found a doctor who understands my fear and how I hate noises inside my skull. He's worked with me to get over my fears and even offered me something to calm me down, but since I have to drive myself, I can't take them. He puts me at ease before starting the cleaning. I suggest being open with them when you find them. They have patients like that all the time.\n\nI feel your anxiety - you have some solid advice from someone about what to say, but I wanted to say that a lot of dentists have anxious patients. \n\nIn my experience they‚Äôre super reassuring and kind and go at my pace to help me feel better. As soon as I‚Äôve said I was scared, they instantly knew how to help calm me down. \n\nI also take headphones with me so I can distract myself with music. \n\nYou‚Äôve got this, OP!\n\nI'm also someone with a similar fear, what I like to ask is whether they have nitrous or not (laughing gas), that usually does enough to calm my anxiety\n\nHonestly, don‚Äôt need to worry. Dentistry nowadays has advanced to much, that you won‚Äôt need to be anxious about it at all. The best thing you can do is relax. I had a bad childhood experience and dreaded the idea of going to a dentist, but now go regularly (ageing on and a fair bit or work needs to be done on regular basis), but I enjoy going, as I know that it means better oral health.\nAlso remember: you can tell them at any point, if something hurts or doesn‚Äôt feel good/comfortable. Dentists and doctors in general are great listeners, and will be glad to hear this feedback. \nRelax, trust and go see a dentist üòä\n\nSay that you need a cleaning. \n\nand you can ask them if they do nitrous gas. i alwyas use it when i go bc i have severe anxiety with the dentist.\n\nit makes you super relaxed"

    "all_comment_text": "Idk. I don‚Äôt want children because I would be an awful parent. I‚Äôm way too mentally and emotionally unstable.\n\nHere's an honest person who's not afraid to speak their truth.\n\nI‚Äôm afraid. Always afraid. I couldn‚Äôt have a child. Life hasn‚Äôt been kind or good to me. I can‚Äôt put them through this too.\n\nThis!\n\nExactly how I feel\n\nI feel that in my soul\n\nPreach üôå\n\nMe too\n\nI appreciate this. I feel the same way. I'm 40/f. I've been married for 14 years. No kids. My mom damaged me enough, and I'm still trying to fix her mess. Aka, therapy. \nPlus the condition our country is in... It's not logical for me to bring a life into this world. \nThe world is broken, and so are people. I'd be in constant fear of my child's safety. You can't trust anyone. \nTeachers are corrupt \nDoctors are corrupt \nPolice are corrupt \nThe government is corrupt.\n\nGiven your rebuttals, I don't think you're going to agree with any answer anyone will give you.  Having a kid/kids is a personal choice and if it isn't for you, then don't have any.\n\nüíØ\n\nWhy so negative? I think it's a great question with tons of interesting replies. Not so sure about yours though.\n\nYeah; it‚Äôs a choice. Love this answer after skimming.\n\nHumans are not separate from nature. Humans are part of nature. We have the same instincts, hormones and reproductive organs as the animals. For the majority, it is a natural desire and need to have offspring. This does not mean that it is wrong not to have children. As humans, we - unlike the animals - have a choice. But it always surprises me when people think that having children is a cultural thing. We are part of nature. üôÇ\n\nIt's always interesting to me when someone expresses how we are the same as nature and have all of the same drivers in XYZ ways and biological and evolutionary pressures etc etc... but then at the end adds \"only we're different because we make choices\". Everything is the same, everything, like you said. We have the experience of perceiving that we make choices, but given any circumstances in our life, given everything that lead up to it, we would always make the same \"choice\". Our illusion of thinking we get to choose A or B is no different from any other animal as far as we know. We aren't close to being the same, we are the same.\n\nA fellow anxiety sufferer and philosophy enjoyer, good day.\n\nYou‚Äôre conflating the desire to have sex with the desire to have children. I doubt other species specifically want to have children. They want to have sex, and end up with children. Same with humans. Some people do specifically have the desire to have kids, but I think that‚Äôs different from what happens in nature. Some people get baby crazy, for sure, but for many others it seems to be more of an intellectual decision.\n\nPoint being, animals don‚Äôt have birth control or knowledge of how pregnancy occurs. It‚Äôs only in humans that the distinction between wanting sex and wanting children can meaningfully be made. So, in that sense, we are different from nature.\n\nInstincts that maybe play off of other instincts as well? I think the idea of having a child can validate our need for belonging and being accepted in soceity. \n\nBut it can also perfectly natural to have baby fever or just be plain horny lol\n\nNot true. I have hens. The roosters only want sex, yes. üôÇ The hens don't want sex, they actually try to avoid it. But they want to have chickens. They find nests and try to hatch eggs even if there is no rooster and the eggs are not fertilized. Their urge for offspring - not sex - is strong. The same with other birds. They build nests - prepare for offspring - before they have sex. The same with many insects. And probably other animals too.\n\nEdit: In women, sex and reproduction are closely related. Women's sex drive is highest when they ovulate = can become pregnant.\n\n\"Other birds\"--is false, parrots do not work this way. Their urge for offspring is sometimes non-existent until certain factors align to induce those habits/preparations, and even then, saying they *want* to have offspring is phrasing that is extremely imposing\n\nYou're imposing ideations that aren't there on an entire species for the sake of your argument. You could have just said it's natural, your hens are great mothers and left it at that.\n\nThanks for the reminder!\n\n Something can be both natural and cultural. Furthermore, something can be cultural because it's natural.\n\n Saying the people have children because this is their natural instinct is only a part of the general picture.\n\n First of all, it is not even an instinct in the sense that desires of sex, hunger or being in a safe place are instinct. A person may desire sex spontaneously due to some external stimulus (ex: the pic of a nude woman, having flirtatious conversation with man). A person may desire eating something when they're feeling hungry. However, a person doesn't desire \"having children\" even though the sex desire is a product of evolution for having offspring. It is different from the sex desire. One can satisfy one's own sex desire with a condom but by definition, one cannot do so for the will to have children. We don't have a separate desire \"to have sex without a condom\" or \"to have sex but this time for a baby\".\n\n The willingness to have children has a cultural side. A good illustration of this is that women in 30s begin to fear if they will not marry or have children. The popular explanation is that they fear because their \"biological clock\" is alarmed because they will lost their fertility in the near future. However, this is not even scientifically true. The women becomes most fruitful around their 20s and it stars to decline in mid-30s. Yet, the woman starts worrying about these issues even around the end-20s. Therefore, biology by itself cannot explain this fact. It is our nature to compare ourselves with others and if it is a cultural norm to have babies before 30s, it's normal to start having anxiety.\n\n A friend of mine once told me that he asked a professor of his why he had a baby and the answer was \"I didn't think about it much\". For most people, having a baby is another \"necessary\" step to advance in life, just like going to college, finding a job, and marrying someone.\n\n We are part of nature but nature is not one thing, it is complex. Nature may produce different results for different situations, environments, countries, and people. Anxiety is also a part of nature but this is not incompatible with the fact that some people can be calm in most situations and some people may be extremely anxious for, let's say, their exams or may be even suffering from anxiety disorder.\n\nThank you for your comment. I agree that it is complex and that culture also plays a role.\n\nBut I believe that sex and reproduction are deeply connected, especially in women. Women have the greatest sex drive when they ovulate = can get pregnant. And their sex drive often disappears when they have small children (just like animals that don't mate when they have offspring to take care of) and when they've gone through menopause and can no longer get pregnant.\n\nAnd then one can say: Having children is not an instinct, only sex is an instinct. But that is exactly what the female body does. It links sex and reproduction as a shared instinct.\n\nThe ‚Äúlows‚Äù you‚Äôre describing do happen, I‚Äôm always worried about my kids, however the good emotions that come from them are 100x better than anything else. Seeing them grow, seeing them be independent, clever, kind little humans. Their funny little anecdotes and their universe bending questions makes it so worthwhile‚Ä¶\n\nHaving kids is hard, nerve wracking and expensive, but I‚Äôd do it all a million times over for my kids.\n\nLove this response, my kids are my legacy. They are the only part of me that remains after I die. It is my responsibility to teach them how to make the world a better place than the one we inherited.\n\nHard, nerve-wracking and expensive is everything I'm looking to avoid in life, but I'm glad it's going excellently for you.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm 39 weeks and have struggled with (health) anxiety and other stuff my whole life. My husband and I wanted children to make our family bigger and enjoy the experience of bringing up a new person where we can see life through their eyes but also create a good person for the world. Of course it‚Äôs out of our own desire but we feel that we have a very secure and privileged life where a child will grow up healthy and taken care of and just make life so fun.\n\nIt's always nice to hear people happy and excited to have kids.\n\nIs you don‚Äôt mind me asking, how are you coping with going to doctors appts and doing the necessary tests? I have health anxiety and want children but am terrified of going to several appts and being in the hospital for birth  is so terrifying to me. Any advice?\n\nI‚Äôve been okay, not the best but I‚Äôve made it through! Just waiting to give birth now and the anxiety and intrusive thoughts are definitely high. I had a bad panic attack at my first appt and then every time I went I had high blood pressure which we think is just white coat bc I was always fine at home. But they put me on meds about halfway thru my pregnancy and things got a lot better. Now that they‚Äôre monitoring me closely it‚Äôs actually comforting knowing that they are aware of every little thing. It‚Äôs been a challenge for sure but also has pushed me to overcome a lot of anxiety and panic challenges that I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get through if not pregnant. And I‚Äôm so excited for my baby - scared of birth for sure! But so excited.\n\nI have plenty of friends that have struggled with anxiety (still do) that are wonderful parents to wonderful kids. I myself have struggled with chronic anxiety my entire life- but my kids make my life worth living. So much healing and love can come from becoming a parent and nurturing life (perhaps in a way that yours was not nurtured by your own nuclear family). It gives life meaning to have a warm and loving family to spend your life with. Life can be dark and scary and prickly but it can also be full of love and light and butterfly kisses. The glass really can be half full. Of course it took many years of therapy to get here- but if someone WANTS kids, anxiety shouldn‚Äôt scare you out of it. People who genuinely don‚Äôt want kids? All the power to you as well. We‚Äôre all just doing our best. ü´∂üèº\n\nThis is the best answer. I felt like what you describe when I was young. I didn't understand why anyone would do it at all until I was in my 30s and married and something just changed. Biology or the desire to make another human and meet them or a reduction in anxiety... Having done it once I can say that my daughter gives my life meaning, she's the most amazing thing in the entire world and I love her more than anything.\nBut raising her has also been the most difficult, exhausting, frightening thing I've ever done. I'll add that she was born with a birth defect that made the first year scarier and then she also has food allergies so there are lots of things for me to be anxious about. But she's also an incredibly good and mature kid. So that's easier.\nSo now I'm at the stage where I honestly don't understand why anyone ever does it more than once ü§£\nBut it all depends how you parent and what you want. We're all different!\n\nI love this ü©∑\n\nI mean, just because you don‚Äôt want kids doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs like that for others. I have 3 kids, I couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without them.\n\nIt's great that it makes people happy. I'm just wondering how\n\nIf you have to wonder- parenthood is absolutely not for you. And that‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs good that you recognized this before having a child or getting into a relationship with someone that does want children.\n\nI wondered and never wanted children.\n  \nWell accidents happen and my daughter is 2.5 years old.  She's the most amazing person to me, the absolute joy of seeing her grow and learn.  Her little cheeky laugh smile and jokes.  The way she sprints across the room full speed to hug me when I pick her up from daycare.  The way she flops onto me for cuddles and won't let go.  The way she mimics and tries to copy things I do.\n  \nNot going to lie, sometimes its tough, but the rewards are amazing to me and I was in the past a member of /r/childfree\n\nIs it ‚Äògreat‚Äô to create a life to make oneself happy? I‚Äôm really glad that‚Äôs why I have to put up with the hell of existence‚Ä¶.because my parents wanted ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù. Sure was a lot of happiness when I had to break up their physical fights when I was a teenager.\n\nI can definitely relate to this. My mom thought I was, in her own words, ‚Äúgods miracle gift‚Äù to her, but that was only after she had already fucked me up for life. During the first half of her pregnancy, she refused to believe she was actually pregnant because again, in her own words, she ‚Äúthought god didn‚Äôt want her to be a mother‚Äù. She believed this so strongly that she ignored her pregnancy for the first 5 months and drank heavily throughout this time, and the alcohol exposure I received during the most vulnerable time of gestation was enough to cause me my disability, commonly known as fetal alcohol syndrome. \n\nOnce she started showing and couldn‚Äôt deny her pregnancy any longer to my dad and family, that‚Äôs when she suddenly decided I was this huge miracle to her. She then proceeded to convince herself that I was going to be fine despite the things she exposed me to, and she never brought it up to anyone. The thought of her little miracle having something wrong with them was too much for her, so apparently the solution was to act as if everything I struggled with from birth throughout my childhood and all the symptoms of my disability were all ‚Äúnormal‚Äù things every kid goes through, and I‚Äôd grow out of it all. Well, I‚Äôm 25 now and still have fetal alcohol syndrome, and I always have _and_ always will because there is no cure for this illness as it‚Äôs a developmental disorder. I was only diagnosed 4 years ago when I met my now husband who was able to help me find support and resources for a diagnosis. In fact, I did not know about my mom drinking during her pregnancy until she let something slip in a passing comment while talking to my husband. Had he not been there in that moment to ask the right questions, I would have gone my entire life believing all of my struggles were my own fault for not trying hard enough. There were plenty of adults at my schools who brought up their concerns about me to my parents throughout my time in  K-12, but nothing ever came about it because my parents outright refused to believe there was something deeper going on. I‚Äôve only mentioned my mom so far, but my dad is also to blame here as he was there all nine months of my mom‚Äôs pregnancy and _he knew_ she drank heavily during the first half, but he knew bringing this up at any point would‚Äôve hurt my mom‚Äôs feelings, so he joined her in denial. \n\nMy mom used to go on and on about how much happier she was since having me, but I think that‚Äôs the issue here; she was so focused on how happy she was that ‚Äúgod finally let her be a mother‚Äù that she forgot she had a tiny human she needed to protect, and my existence wasn‚Äôt just to serve her. I am so thankful I am my mom‚Äôs only child, because it would break my heart to see another person grow up alongside me in the same situation. Who knows if my mom would‚Äôve used her religion to convince herself she wasn‚Äôt pregnant again had she conceived more than once, but I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôll never have to find out.\n\nAs traumatic as experiences can be as a child, watching parents who are supposed to \"love\" each other do and act completely opposite, carry on an addiction, while being physically and mentally abusive, it doesn't mean that their cannot be balance and love for the life that you live. \n\nI only say this because that was my childhood, and I, too, never wanted to have children when I was younger, thinking that I was saving a child from trauma. But then I realized that just because *I* had to grow up with that lifestyle, it doesn't mean that my children do. \n\nThrough all of the suffering experienced, I found it in my heart that I wanted to be the best parent I could possibly be and show them unconditional love like I had lacked.\n\nDon't let memories of your childhood shape your future for what could bring you internal gratefulness and joy. But, if kids aren't your cup of tea, anyone can respect that. My son being born made me realize all of what I held onto only drug me to a dark place, yet there was so much light that began at his birth.  \n\nKeep your head up! Reach out if needed. You can live a great life, and if you ever need to talk, I'll gladly be there to talk and listen.\n\nYo I have parents just as shitty (my dad was in prison half my life) and I used to shun the idea of kids for that reason. But tbh, I do want kids and I kind of always have, I was just scared of repeating the cycle of generational trauma. But at the end of the day, each person decides for themselves what kind of person or parent they want to be. Not all parents are as shitty as ours. I've met some fantastic parents out there and that's the kind of parent I aspire to be like. I just need to remember all the things that sucked about my parents and NOT do those things. It's easier said than done, but that's why I'm working on my issues prior to having kids.\n\nthe truth is people get bored with their lives &amp; need something to give them purpose\n\nI don't agree with that. \n\nMy wife and I have a son who's a year and a half old. He was not planned whatsoever. I was scared, I didn't know if I was going to be a good parent or know how to deal with my anxiety AND be a parent. \n\nAll of that subsided when I first got to meet him. My wife would do it again for the love that we have been able to give naturally. Having children is a beautiful thing, rather you feel that you have purpouse prior or not.\n\nThis may not be true for everyone but it is for a lot of people. And it‚Äôs important to be honest when someone is asking a genuine question. That said, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad thing. If their purpose is to focus their livelihood on being great parents I‚Äôm all for it. Just my 2 cents.\n\n[removed]\n\n&gt;knowing their bloodline will carry on\n\nThat is the dumbest reason to have kids i've ever heard\n\nNo, I think it's an extensional thing.\n\nThe fear of death, the fear of being \"gone\" forever.\n\nI feel terrible that my line dies with me.\n\nI don‚Äôt feel too bad. I mean, my uncle has kids with my last name. My extended family also has kids. My line continues, just not exactly with me\n\nLmao why ??? Who gives a shit. What's in your bloodline that's so important\n\nThis didn‚Äôt answer the question at all lol.\n\nI honestly have no clue\n\nI love kids and always wanted to be a mom ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Sounds like it‚Äôs not for you and that‚Äôs fine!\n\nI had a really strong maternal instinct despite struggling with anxiety all my life. I now have 2 amazing daughters and yes, the anxiety is hard but I love them more than anything else in the world.\n\nIf you don't have a maternal instinct then you don't need to worry about having kids. It's entirely personal choice.\n\nI think there‚Äôs an innate instinct in animals to reproduce. We are no different from the rest of the animal kingdom in this.\n\nI love my son so much. I‚Äôd do anything for him. I love being a mom, his mom. That being said, I have to work through so many of my anxieties for him so that he‚Äôs normal lol. \n\nEven with all of the extra anxiety and responsibility, I‚Äôd have a dozen of him if I could.\n\nYou're not going to find the answer(s) you're looking for online. \n\nThe right answer is within YOU.\n\nIf you really believe this world is evil and hell, then most likely, the end is coming...\n\nStop the breeding!\n\nStop the breading üçûü•Øü•ñ\n\nBut ‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶. Sourdough\n\nSourdough can stay. I‚Äôll allow it.\n\nIt just happened and it has been an insanely difficult 18 years. Unfortunately, I have passed my anxiety and tics along to her. My husband (not her bio dad) and I have decided not to have more because it's not just a stressful undertaking, but because it's been so hard for my daughter to cope with what my genetics passed along to her.\n\nI also fear my child would get the wretched anxiety, chronic pain and OCD disorders that my mother, me and my sisters all have.  So I never had a child and now it‚Äôs too late.  My husband wants one and he has great genes so I am I‚Äôm a tough position.\n\nIt was easier thay my hubby has some heritable issues too. We plan on being foster parents in the future. Then we are helping the world and get a chance to be a part of kids lives in a positive way. For now we are enjoying our empty nest.\n\nI think it varies from person to person, much like anxiety triggers. I have a child and he has taught me a lot of things about myself that I wasn't aware of - like, my level of patience is MUCH higher than I thought.\n\nI think the why varies from person to person. Sometimes it‚Äôs not a good reason or no reason. \n\nPersonally I liked the idea of being a parent and good role model. I also liked knowing that I would break so many negative cycles I was forced into as a kid by my family. And I could give my kids the experiences and peace I should‚Äôve had. It‚Äôs a wonderful feeling to create a life and actively make it a good one.\n\nYeah, I wasn't willing to give up freedom and money,  or add shackles,  yup.  No kids.\n\nNot social pressure for me. I never wanted kids while I was married cuz I was younger. My ex did not want them either but at some point I changed my mind. It‚Äôs not why we divorced cuz we really didn‚Äôt talk about it (the divorced was because he cheated on me). Anyway I went out with a guy after the divorce and I was crazy about him. I got pregnant and decided it was my last chance at 37. The guy left, no big deal. I had a good job and my folks would help out. Easy pregnancy despite my extensive food allergies. Birth wasn‚Äôt bad either and I had no pain meds. \n\nI wanted a child because of all the fun things my mom did with us and because I loved my son‚Äôs dad. Loving the guy made all the difference although it wasn‚Äôt reciprocated. Having my son , especially when he was little, was so much fun. To be fair, he was a Gerber baby but he loved everything and we went everywhere. If you focus on housekeeping, you might get stressed with kids but if you focus on learning and exploring and having fun, you‚Äôll love it. \n\nIt IS expensive and more so since I was a single parent but it all turned out ok. Being older and settled in my career, living in a big condo, was key. You never can tell how it will work out but you prepare as much as you can. Growing a human being and watching them learn is simply wonderful. Edit: as far as anxiety, yeah I have it which is why I‚Äôm on here. And my son was born with meningitis but he seems ok. He‚Äôs very very intelligent but has ADHD. It may be a consequence of having meningitis or not. No one can say. Considering what could have happened, I‚Äôll take it.\n\nBecause a lot of people enjoy \"creating a new life\" and to take care of their baby/kid. My sister gave birth to my nephew 3 months ago and she told me that the pain was awful but every second of it was worth it :') And it's true.\n\nI think it‚Äôs just some peoples dream to be a parent. I‚Äôd love to be a parent in another life. But don‚Äôt think I ever could be in this one. I‚Äôve got too many health issues, mental and physical. I also didn‚Äôt get to enjoy much of my childhood and I just want to live out my years with as little stress as I can.\n\nI'm gonna get dragged for this, but these comments are saccharine.  And it's like parents wants a lump of clay to make something in their own image.\n\nSo weird.  I will never understand wanting children.\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nJust because life is awful for you, doesn't mean it is the same for others. Humans have children to pass on their legacy, to nurture, teach, love and form a connection with others by building family and community. All species desire to do this. Bringing life into the world is a very personal and spiritual experience. The pitfalls of life do not deter this because experiencing life is more important. \n\nI never became a mother because it wasn't the right choice for me. I have been struggling with anxiety since I was a child and knew that I didn't have the resources nor the emotional capacity to take care of someone else if I could hardly take care of myself. I didn't decide this because \"life is terrifying\", but because it was the logical thing to do for myself. \n\nIf you don't want children, then don't have them. In the end, the decision is ultimately yours to make.\n\nI feel a similar way.  \n\nMy anxiety and chronic pain have been hell since I was a young child, despite doing everything possible to treat it and every alternative therapy that exists.  So, I never felt anywhere close to ready and now I am going through menopause.  I also take meds for anxiety and pain that are meds you cannot take while being pregnant and I am physically addicted to them. \n\nHowever, my husband desperately wants a baby and I would have one for him if I could.  I definitely understand wanting to carry on the bloodline and leave your legacy to your children.  For example, we have built and accomplished so much and have no one to leave it to.  I am thinking about adoption.\n\nI definitely understand OP‚Äôs confusion because I never wanted a child until it was too late like this.  If I wasn‚Äôt infertile and on tertragenic medications I would have my husband‚Äôs child in a second, despite the torture of chronic pain, all the anxiety disorders and OCD. Like others said, despite the mental issues, they love their children more then anything else in the world.\n\nI feel where you‚Äôre coming from. I want kids pretty bad, but I fear they will fall into depression and not know how to recover from it. Of all the bad things out there, unfortunately not everyone knows how to help themselves and I‚Äôd hate for that to be one of my kids\n\nI‚Äôve had anxiety my whole life and now have 2 kids. Honestly they help my anxiety.  They make me want to be better for them. My oldest does get depressed and overwhelmed but because I‚Äôve been through it, I can guide him to overcome it.\n\nI wanted a baby, I just wanted a little more time before I had one. My pregnancy was unexpected, but we decided to keep the baby because we felt like since it was happening, it was an opportunity that we couldn't pass up.\n\nAnd as a parent, my life isn't hell. It's hard caring for a little person day in and day out. So far, I've just learned that it's about my attitude when I start the day. If I wake up in the morning feeling like being a parent is hell, then patenting ends up being hell. I still  have my bad days, but I do my best to be open about my needs as a parent and addressing my personal needs.\n\nI think now that I am a parent, I'd say my reasoning to have children is growth. I am better at standing up for myself, regulating my emotions, and staying on top of my mental health. My family has grown, and so has our joy. The giggles and the snuggles and the kisses are something I don't think I could live without now.\n\nI imagine they want to take care of and nurture children, simple as that. This is no different than a parent asking why do people not want kids. The answer is people are different and have different desires in life. If you don't want kids, you're never gonna understand why others do because that's not something you relate to and you don't have to. And you have to remember that not everyone finds life as terrifying as those of us with anxiety disorders do. As long as they're good to those children, who really gives a fuck? Live and let live.\n\nThis is my hot ass take, but people are having kids because they're selfish. They want something to love them, they want to love something, they want to be needed. They want to \"be a parent\". I can't imagine bringing a whole person into this terrible world all because I get butterflies when I see a baby. Like yeah, I think babies are cute, I would love to prove to the world and myself that im a better mom than my mom, but I don't think those feelings are worth bringing a child into this dying world right now.\n\nI‚Äôm so thankful I had my son. Yes, there‚Äôs stress and altering schedules to make sure someone is there for him at all times but he‚Äôs brought us so much joy.\n\nI love watching him grow. He‚Äôs six now and doing sports. I love going to his games and cheering him on. I love hiking with him and playing video games with him. He‚Äôs my best friend.\n\nI have had anxiety my whole life but it‚Äôs never held me back from dreaming about being a mother. I have now a one year old and honestly she is my missing piece and a huge distraction to everything that holds me back. Yes I have panic attacks but I look at her and remind myself that I need to be strong and I need to work through it. Whenever I see her looking at the world with such innocence and compassion it‚Äôs just a beautiful sight.\n\nBecause they‚Äôre bored and want to fill the void of meaningless‚Ä¶so they think creating life will fill that void. So we‚Äôre all roped into this. That or ‚Äòmisery loves comapny‚Äô.\n\nGoing by my roommate, who loves his very much, they just want to start a family. Valid enough reason. For some people it may be wanting to pass on their genes or have grandkids some day, I don‚Äôt know - personally I don‚Äôt want any rn because I enjoy the freedom I have to be able to up and travel anywhere, etc.\n\nCan also literally ask your parents if they‚Äôre in your life lol\n\nThe body will try to get you to reproduce for the prevalence of the species many humans succumb to. Some feel it more than others. We can't discard the fact that we're mammals on this planet. \n\nSocial pressure is also another reason. \n\nReligion is another one that generally dissuades abortion.\n\nMost babies are also oopsie babies. Combine that with all the other things I've mentioned, and we'll have a somewhat comprehensive view. \n\nYou've also got the other humans that underestimate the degree of effort and sacrifice to raise a tiny human into a successful, self-sufficient, and emotionally stable one. \n\nThe answer is not black and white but a gamut of gray, depending on the human you're thinking of.\n\nAs a mom, I get where you're coming from. Life can be really tough, but the joy and fulfillment kids bring are truly one of a kind. Their smiles, watching them grow, and seeing their achievements bring so much happiness and pride. Sure, cultural and societal expectations play a part, but in the end, the love and meaning kids add to life far outweigh the fear and stress. Every family has its own reasons, and it's a very personal decision.\n\nHello latorila, are you still active on this account?\n\nThere are good reasons not to have children. \n\nBut some people love kids and the idea of forming a family. My son has stressed me out (a lot, sometimes!) but the value and joy he‚Äôs added makes up for all of it a thousand times over. \n\nHe keeps me going.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI (25f) literally have no idea.\n\nIt's so expensive nowadays I can't even afford myself ü§£ my mom almost died giving birth to me, I have a high probability for twins which would almost most definitely kill me, I've always had a huge fear of childbirth and something growing in me, my mom was emotionally and physically abusive and I'm scared of being like her. My parents still ask me when they're gonna get grandbabies (I'm sterilized and they don't know). My mom even called me selfish for not giving her grandkids. \n\nKids are stressful, expensive, and time consuming. Most of the time people want them to pass down their \"legacy\" or as a retirement plan or just due to boredom. No thank you.\n\nselfish\n\nI think more than anything, people have kids to feel a sense of companionship and to fulfill their need to have a family of their own. I know there is a lot of shit in this world that‚Äôs horrible and miserable, but to most people bringing children into the world, in a way, counteracts the misery around them. Kids really can be a joy and help you view the world through a brighter lens.\n\nI didn‚Äôt have a dad growing up so it‚Äôs always been a nice thought of being a great dad to my kids. Haven‚Äôt had any yet but I‚Äôd feel so blessed to have a chance.\n\nI wish I could understand it. I know I have my own reasons for not wanting children. Most of which stem from a financial place/not having the patience to deal with children. I'm selfish with my time and if I need to work two jobs to support a child when my wife and I are barely getting by on our own, it's not really a great idea.\n\nChild care alone is almost a full-time job in order to afford it, let alone housing, feeding, time etc. I have no desire to kill myself to afford a child to meet some kind of life standard.\n\nLife is terrifying for everyone because you say it is? I‚Äôm always concerned about people who can‚Äôt think outside of their own bubble. Life is great for me. Can‚Äôt wait to have children someday!\n\nI think maybe you, like me, are lacking the hormonal and instinctual drive to reproduce. Without that inherent drive, it makes absolutely no sense logically to have children. Makes life harder in so many ways and does not seem enjoyable or desirable in the least. \n\nI asked the same question my whole life until I realized it‚Äôs not a logical choice, it‚Äôs an urge. You likely will never understand that feeling and neither will I, but knowing that allows me to finally understand why humans make that choice. You‚Äôre trying to find a logical reason where there isn‚Äôt one (in modern society, in the past maybe it would be to have more help on the farm etc)\n\nI think a lot of people who have kids do it out of narcissism. Wanting to have a ‚Äúmini me‚Äù that you can shape to be what you want. Of course, that‚Äôs not how it actually works and children are autonomous people who won‚Äôt necessarily turn out the way you want to make them, but narcissists don‚Äôt care about reality.\n\nThe look on my moms face the day she realized I was growing into being my own person and I wasn‚Äôt going to stay a complete copy of her for the rest of my life, that is a look I will not ever forget. Your comment fits her perfectly.\n\nIf you ever wondered how big your heart is capable of growing, having a kid will show you. \n\nI've had my challenges with my kids, but you could back a truck up loaded with cash, and I wouldn't trade it for my kids, ever. \n\nKids show you who you really are as a person.\n\nI had my boyfriend‚Äôs brother and fianc√©e near arguing with me one night about having children. It was wild! She said I‚Äôm living in fear of it. Lady, I can barely afford to survive on my own and I‚Äôm a lazy fuck. Dont project your baby fever onto me. It makes no sense to me! I wanted children, but after growing up and seeing this society, fuck that!\n\nBecause they are thoughtless and lack personal insight failing to see they will fuxk them up just as bad as they are fuxked up\n\n‚ÄúLife is not about avoiding suffering.‚Äù\n\nNot sure if this has already been mentioned because I didn‚Äôt look at all of the responses but I think it‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what society expects of us.  You fall in love, you get married, you have kids.  In my case, I only have one child, mostly due to my anxiety, which was even worse postpartum but I get a lot of crap for not having more, also because that‚Äôs what society expects. \nI feel like there‚Äôs a lot of social pressure that comes along with the decision to have kids.\n\nSome people have good reasons for having children. Most don‚Äôt.\n\nI always thought I'd be a dad. At the age of 37, my girlfriend at the time fell pregnant and we were both quite unsure about it all, more out of anxiety for me, even though we both loved children. Alas, she miscarried. My GAD considerably worsened eleven years ago and has made it pretty much impossible for me to manage myself at the best of times let alone a family. I know it'll be my biggest regret on my deathbed not being a father. I genuinely love seeing children being happy and how a smile or joy on their face dissipates a bad or highly anxious day for me, making my heart melt. I'm now fairly happily resigned to being an \"uncle\" to a few friends' children and have a godson who I absolutely adore.\n\nLife isn‚Äôt terrifying for me. We don‚Äôt live in the same reality.\n\nBreeding kink\n\nHappy little accidents\n\nIf I had known, I wouldn't have kids\n\nBecause it is so much friggin fun. They‚Äôve actually helped me manage and control my anxiety and life is great with them in it.\n\nBecause that‚Äôs why we are here to reproduce.\n\nBecause I love life, and I wanted to share it with my children. I have a great relationship with my parents, and I wanted that with my own children too. Going through birth was pretty easy (pregnancy was a different matter), and children have given my life so much purpose and joy.\n\ni feel like a lot of ppl have kids cause ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how things should be‚Äù or in other words, social pressure. that‚Äôs just my opinion though\n\nI feel like people without anxiety came here just to tell op that anxiety is not real.\n\nFor their own sake.\n\nI saw this woman on Tik Tok complaining about how all kinds of plastic, etc. baby toys are being recalled for chemicals, safety, etc. ‚ÄúIt makes me so scared that nothing I buy my baby is safe!‚Äù \n\nAll I could think was Girl you didn‚Äôt know that before? I know You‚Äôve been here the last 20 some years that the internet and mass communication has been a thing - you didn‚Äôt realize you were bringing your kid into an unsafe world? FULL of chemicals, diseases, natural disasters, wars, and genocides? \n\nBut as others have stated, ultimately it is a result of humans not having grown beyond our lizard brain and act based on the natural compulsion to reproduce.\n\nUnfortunately for me and my partner, our mental health is of such that not only are we anxious, we are also very easily overloaded when constant responsibility comes into play. It's difficult managing bills/work/home for us so we remain clothed, fed and stable. Not to mention our sensory issues.\n\nI have a two year old niece and feel I will most likely end up being an aunty again and that fulfills me so much, i have so much love for her and a bond i never thought I could feel, however I could never risk projecting my irritability, depression, anxiety and sometimes anger onto a child in my care. I also have severe medical anxiety so again why would I sign up for 9 months of potential medical appointments. \n\nIf I could push through my mental health problems I'd love being a mother, I'd be great at it, I've worked in childcare.  But even then I don't feel as though I have what it takes in the UK economy to bring up a child in a financially stable home, my parents have nothing and nothing to leave me and it would be the same if I had children. I don't want to rely on a government to have a child. \n\nI have however promised myself that later in life if my circumstances change I would love to foster children who deserve love and stability. \n\nLong story short! OP I totally understand that you see more cons than pros thus not being able to fathom why it's a good choice. \n\nPeople from allsorts of backgrounds and homes have children and are amazing loving parents and that's what the world.\n\nBeats the fuck out of me. Especially with the way this country is going, here's some stats; 40% of us believe in Biblical Creationism, 10% Flat Earthers, 20%+ illiteracy, 1/2 and 1/3 men and women will have a form of cancer, we use 90% of all drugs legal/illegal, highest infant/child mortality rate outside of conflict/war zones, highest healthcare cost, 1 million a year and growing go bankrupt for medical debt, and Social Security is going Kaput in 2031/32. 50 million make $15 an hour or less, 80 million $20 an hour or less.\n\nYou want children in this Godforsaken country? What the fuck is wrong with you?!\n\nNature and personal choice. Personally I feel it‚Äôs something innate that just switches on whether it‚Äôs during pregnancy, at birth, or first time viewing/holding your child. \n\nI personally am an overly anxious person, to the point that I can be considered paranoid and used to be scared to leave my home. That natural drive in me to be a mother still very much exists and overrides all my fears. Yes I‚Äôm beyond scared to give birth and all the monsters out there that may go after my kid but my need/drive for a child is higher than the fear. I‚Äôve wanted to be a mom since my early 20‚Äôs when I met my husband. My mom had similar anxiety to me and said the minute she had my eldest sibling anything pertaining to them her anxiety shut off and she just became a natural mom. So yeah I guess it‚Äôs just a chemical compound that some people can‚Äôt fight?\n\nI appreciate you asking the question. I wonder if myself because I‚Äôve made the choice not to but worried about regretting it and know my partner would prefer it. I always wondered what I was missing. People tell me I would be a great mom, but it frightens me, the lack of freedom, having to put someone else first all the time, making mistakes etc.\n\nI tend to think the fact that I don‚Äôt yearn for it means I‚Äôm not meant to. ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI love my husband very much. We are financially well off (although mentally i‚Äôm not) educated and I feel we could do something good in the world together.\n\nIt‚Äôs something I didn‚Äôt feel until almost in my mid thirties now.\n\nBecause sex.\n\nPeople have children for all sorts of reasons. They also don‚Äôt have children for all sorts of reasons. Hope this helps.\n\nI always wanted to have 2 or 3 kids. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and sever depression a year before having my child. I had bad postpartum depression after having her. I have 1 child and I‚Äôm 21. It‚Äôs not easy being a parent at all. I never had experience with a baby or toddler or kid. I always stayed away so I walked into having a child completely blind but I would not change it for the world. She‚Äôs brought a lot of happiness into my life. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have another baby but even though she drives me up the wall, I love her to death and I‚Äôd do anything for her and anything to protect her. She will be 2 in November.\n\nSimple, Survival\n\nIt‚Äôs a personal decision that a lot of people make. From what I gather, it‚Äôs to nurture and teach someone, and to have someone to care for/love.\n\nThat being said, I‚Äôm in my mid 30s at this point and have never had the serious desire for children. My mom would always talk about how having children gives her purpose and makes her life more meaningful, and when my siblings and I came along she just knew that that was the right path for her. \n\nI‚Äôm not interested at all, but I was open to the idea that maybe something would ‚Äúflip on‚Äù and I would just ‚Äúknow.‚Äù Like I would suddenly get that fever and feel my ‚Äúbiological clock ticking‚Äù. But it hasn‚Äôt happened so far; and if it doesn‚Äôt happen in the next 5 years or so, I reckon it probably won‚Äôt happen. And that‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôm pretty okay with my life as it stands currently.\n\nI didn't care about being a dad until the last few years (I'm 26)  where I realise adulthood will start to feel pretty empty/hollow, despite the holidays, pormotions, hobbies, I believe happiness derives, mainly, from purpose, and what more obvious purpose is there than continuing your bloodline, and therefore the human race. I realise that makes it sound like it's quite a selfish choice, but it's more of a realisation I have had as I've gotten older.\n\ni've had an anxiety disorder my entire life. i've also gone through a lot of trauma. and i still think life is beautiful and a gift. i have a lot of patience when it comes to babies and kids. i think they bring out the best in me and help me be present and calm. i have gotten so much joy out of babysitting and teaching. i can't even imagine the joy of having my own kid who i can love fully, try to build the life i want for them, and spend a lifetime loving someone on a deeper level than i can even comprehend right now as someone who doesn't have kids.\n\nGiving birth and raising kids isn't hell. Not everyone feels how you do about life.\n\nMy answer is I felt compelled to. It is an innate drive and there's nothing else that clear for me. Now that I have 2 kids, I'm the happiest I've ever been in my 33 years of life.  I feel so much joy just looking at my kids. My anxiety is way better now after having them.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have children you give the anxiety you feel in yourself. A 0% chance to come back in someone else.\n\nHappiness and fulfillment, your humanity after a certain biological age is no longer meant to be having fun, big reason mental health problems hit often times around the same time you're becoming an adult. I don't have a kid and my wife doesen't want to because she has health issues she doesen't want to give a kid, and I can see how all of my friends who are having kids have found this new happiness and purpose. I'm 32 and have always went against the grain, but lately I really feel a lack of purpose. I don't know with my mental health if I could rely on myself being a father as I have so much down time (bed ridden depression), but in another life I can see the rationalization. Also it must feel nice to watch something you made be happy and go through being a kid, I'm sure that rejuvinates you quite a bit.\n\nI'm talking out of my ass here but those are my thoughts.\n\nYes\n\n‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt understand‚Äù what‚Äôs there to understand? people want kids, so they have kids. anxiety or no anxiety, you‚Äôre just willfully ignorant.\n\nIt‚Äôs a really personal choice. Why did your parents want you? Everyone has their reasons. For me it was obvious, I have always wanted kids, to leave my mark the world and to care about someone more than anything. Children teach you about humanity, that YOU are not the most important person on the planet. They remind you about love and all the good things in the world. Children are not yet ruined by the world. A child is innocent, their joy is pure. You make it sound horrible and if you really see it that way, kids are not for you.\n\nWell, there‚Äôs the thought of seeing your genes be passed on, and having someone around when you‚Äôre older. But I think for a lot of people it was an unspoken expectation.  I look back and realize I don‚Äôt think I ever felt like choosing to not have kids was a choice for me. I feel like society told me I had to. I do realize this is ridiculous, but honest to God, I felt like I‚Äôd be letting people down if I didn‚Äôt, or that all those around me would move on in life and I‚Äôd be left behind not fitting in or alone.  It‚Äôs only recently on Reddit and other social media where I‚Äôm seeing a lot of people choose not to have kids.  I‚Äôm 45 if that gives a timeline.  Maybe people 10-15 years younger than me had a different experience? Maybe it‚Äôs because I grew up in the Midwest? Maybe it‚Äôs my Italian heritage? I‚Äôm not sure but I wish I thought I had a choice in the matter.  I likely would have chosen the same (to have my 2 kids), but looking back realizing that I felt pressured into it makes me sad.  Options are wonderful things.\n\nI had them despite my severe anxiety. And truth be told, it added to my anxiety. I didn't quite bargain for the worry that would accompany parenthood. It's like I took a piece of my heart and put it out into the world. I will worry about them for the rest of my life.\nBut despite the challenges, I wouldn't trade it in for the world. I can't imagine a world in which these little humans didn't exist. The love is beyond anything I could have imagined being possible.\nIt's not my job to encourage or discourage you from having children. It is a deeply personal choice and there is no right or wrong answer.\n\nI've heard people say their life would not be complete without their own children.\n\nTo have a family. I love being with family and wanted one of my own. That being said, after I had two I thought about having a third and knew that mentally and emotionally I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle another kid and decided against it.\n\nI‚Äôm with you OP, life is too terrifying and overwhelming with my slew of MH diagnoses, including anxiety as one of many, I am can‚Äôt even imagine having to care for another tiny human especially with all my own challenges that make life a daily struggle.\n\nIt foxes you to grow, to have a deep purpose, to help fix the things your wish were fixed in you and leave another human in a better position. It helped my anxiety by forcing me to grow in ways I never could have before. Very rewarding.\n\nI have anxiety and also 2 children and yes a lot of my worries surrounding them and their wellbeing. But I truly feel the majority of my joy and even sense of peace is from my children. Seeing them in happy moments or even asleep. It‚Äôs indescribable the peace and joy having children has brought me despite the anxiety around it. I feel without them I don‚Äôt even know what I would be doing. Alone at home? I really don‚Äôt know.\n\nIdk tbh. I‚Äôll never have kids bc I can‚Äôt even take care of myself some days, and I‚Äôm also selfish and like to do what I want when I want. If I had to watch a baby/kid all the time I think I‚Äôd go insane. I‚Äôm not stable enough to be responsible for another life\n\npersonally, if i ever get to a stage in my life where i‚Äôm living comfortably and can financially support a child- i‚Äôd love to have a daughter. i‚Äôm nowhere near the age of wanting to have a kid (and i‚Äôm not giving birth- hell no. adoption all the way) but every time i see a kid, i get this warm maternal feeling inside. i get it for my pets too. i just have this urge to protect and love, i guess. i just wanna spoil someone and give them the childhood my parents gave me\n\nKids are like testicles. If you don't have them, you probably aren't so sure you want them. If you do have them, you instinctively want to protect them.\n\nIt‚Äôs not for everyone, but there‚Äôs no point shaming people who do. That‚Äôs a bit negative. Good thoughts in your head are better than this rumination.\n\nI've had insane anxiety since I was 19. Probably before, but that was my first hospitalization. I have also always wanted a family. I want a big chaotic house with lots of love so that when I grow old I'll be surrounded by something I've created from my soul. I went for it and it's incredible. I actually felt relief from some types of anxiety. Some anxieties are worse. It's the hardest thing I've ever done but also the best. I firmly believe that people shouldn't do it unless they REALLY want to. But if you feel that urge, it's so beyond worth the anxiety.\n\nI totally understand not wanting children. Nobody should have kids if they do not want them.\n\nI personally would love to be a mom. I was sad when I took a test a few weeks ago and it came back negative. Even though it would've been unplanned.\nI think I would love being pregnant. Just the thought that an actual human is growing inside of you, and now your job is to protect that child and nurture them. It feels so natural to me.\nChildbirth would be such a small fraction of pain compared to the priceless memories you'd make while watching your kids grow. The risk of tragedy seems worth it when you picture these things.\n\nJust to know that this kid came from such a special bond between two people. I want that so much. I want to learn to love again, and make my kid/s my reason to continue on. I want to love them the way that they need and then let go of them when they're ready to leave. I want to care for them if they need to come back to me, and be there for them when they make mistakes. I just want to be a mom for the sake of being a mom. I feel like it's my true purpose.\n\nThey open up a whole new world. Teach you things you can‚Äôt even imagine. But also it‚Äôs such a gift to teach them and enjoy life with them; to guide and nurture. To share humor and silliness. To explore the world and have fun. It‚Äôs almost like an honor if they trust you as they age. What a gift! For them to turn to you with their problems and for you to be there for them - through their tough times and help them process and problem solve. It‚Äôs a real relationship and it‚Äôs beautiful to be there for it all.\n\nsome people actually want children so they have children.\n\nIve been anxious my whole life and i stress almost everything, do ALOT of overthinking to the point i feel sick but even with that and at this age (i turn 20), i do want to have kids. And i do realize it‚Äôs a tough job and comes with some hella lot of responsibilities and challenges from day one but that somehow is not of my biggest fears (and lemme tell ya, i have quite some) and dealbreakers. With my whole being I wanna bring a few humans into this world and raise them to be truly good people, empathetic, kind, respectful, responsible so they can make this world a better place. But also do my absolute best to raise them in a safe, healthy, accepting environment (as healthy as possible given all that shit going on in the world) so they won‚Äôt take their traumas with them down the road, atleast the ambience where they grow up, their home, should be all these things \n* i want my own kids, my flesh and blood, as for the rest, kids are not my thing, like it‚Äôs 70/30 im indifferent to them (tho it‚Äôs not like im indifferent if children are hurt, abused, in some awful conditions like poverty or war, on the contrary) Im sure Id love my siblings with my whole heart but too bad i dont have a single one to give my love &amp; some knowledge to\n\nBecause some people want children and for some people it just happens. I am riddled with anxiety 24/7 but I honestly wouldn‚Äôt currently exist if it wasn‚Äôt for my child and I wouldn‚Äôt change it for the world. Best thing by far that has ever happened in my life.\n\nI'm 31 &amp; single. I do have a lot of anxiety, and being a gay man, I feel like I've just discovered myself, &amp; I'm finally living my 20s even though I'm older. With that being said, I wouldn't want to have kids because I'm unsure if I'd be able to give them the best life ever because they wouldn't have a mum, my anxiety, world is a crazy place nowadays, and stigma/bullying the child would deal with having Dads. But it does hurt me a bit because I always wanted to share my hobbies with a son and give him the life I never had. Luckily, though, my siblings have kids, so I try my best to be a great uncle and help out as much as I can.\n\nI used to think the same I still have anxiety but it's like I had a spiritual break through. I remembered I used to be able to control my dreams. My husband and his friend was talking about how they both can. I was like wtf my husband and I been together 5 almost 6 years N he has never told me this. When he knew I suffered so bad. That night I went to sleep and I did it so effortless. No nightmares in over 6 months. Today my state is getting pound with tornadoes and I had no knowledge of it until a little bit ago. I'm so happy right now. Yall there is nothing to fear. We are everlasting souls. We've been here before. We've done this before. We are ok. We are great. Go deep into your child hood think about any experience you thought odd. You flew a lot. You remember entering your body from a dream. Or you remember watching your sleeping body like I did. Our soul leaves our body every day. I had night from 20 years. They became overwhelming when my kids came along. I was terrified to sleep. I couldn't leave the house. Since that day I've been great bc once you experience it .You turn the nightmares into a higher Dimension.. bc you are a higher frequency.  You go deep within. And work on you. Change food habits. Take herbal meds. Exercise. You get good at it quick. I know I am powerful now. I know I can't hope or ask for help to someone outside me. I have to know I have the ability to control my life. My life is how it is bc I created this. I had to take my responsibility for my part on everything. Once I realized that I made those decisions to do those things. I forgave myself and then I was able to heal the wounds of my traumas. One thing the other side hates us doing is Hating ourselves. And having self doubt. Go to the mirror tell your self  \"I love you. I forgive you. You made no mistakes. You made decisions and making decisions is ok to do. I know you can do it. You are beautiful/handsome\" When we tell ourselves self affirmations it becomes reality and then you can heal everything.\n\nI want family. People to be close to. I have so much love to give. Lost both t parents by age 33, lost my father in law the same year. I want to rebuild the family I wish to have. I love my son more than anything.\n\nHaving kids isn't everyone's calling. But the children make me so happy, sad, anxiety,  exhilarated, etc. This is life for me. I take good care to strive towards a life where my children aren't my only source of life but I feel that they greatly increase my quality of life.\n\nNot everyone is as scared as life tbh. But as someone with anxiety and some mental health issues much beyond anxiety, I actually have been thinking a lot more about parenthood. I‚Äôm 22 and personally would love to live many, many years without children if I end up having them. Plus I‚Äôm gay which makes parenthood a lot more complicated and costly.\n\nReally what did it for me was starting to stabilize and realize that I love helping others through the difficulty of life. My partner has some severe mental health issues (he just broke up with me because of them, we‚Äôre in a complicated limbo space until he stabilizes cause idk what he‚Äôll figure out) and I‚Äôve loved supporting him through hardship and learning how to accommodate for him and his brain. Also I‚Äôll be so real, he‚Äôd be a great dad. He‚Äôs on the fence about kids but tbh seeing how good of a dad he‚Äôd be when more stable really illuminated that feeling of openness to it for me.\n\nRealizing that I would love to support a child through learning how to exist and giving them a safer experience of life than I got. I also love the idea of showing a child music, movies, books, talking to them about cool stuff. Kids are so cool, I have little siblings and I adore them.\n\nBut of course on the flip side we have the constant fears I have for people I‚Äôm close to. Intrusive thoughts, anxiety, etc. But as those fears ease up a bit and I see myself heading in a good direction once I‚Äôm on meds, idk! We‚Äôll see!\n\nLet's look at it another way. This is the only way it could be because if other people also didn't want children, humans wouldn't exist and you wouldn't be asking this question.\n\nHaving a child is one of life‚Äôs toughest jobs and rewarding gifts all in one. When I saw the face of my first child, it was proof, in my eyes, that God exists. I wasn‚Äôt going to have kids for many of the same reasons everyone is stating. I waited until I was 40. Man, am I glad I had them. There is no deeper love.\n\nI always said I wanted to have two kids, but after how anxious I was all the time during pregnancy and through most of my sons‚Äô infancy, I decided one and done was the way for me to go. I wouldn‚Äôt trade my son for anything but I know I couldn‚Äôt do this all over again and keep the small amount of sanity I do have left\n\nI have always had anxiety and it definitely got worse after having my first kid. But the highs for me outweigh the lows by a long shot. He is truly the life of the party. And Zoloft helps me a lot. I thankfully haven‚Äôt had any side effects and it‚Äôs treated me well for nearly 4 years now. I have always loved kids and always wanted to be a mom though. I try to be a glass half full kind of person even with, at times crippling anxiety.\n\nAs a person who has dealt with crippling anxiety ad depression for years....I thought similar things. Until I had my daughter. Now I wouldn't change it for the world. She's my everything. She is the better than benzos for days I'm feeling like crap. Her smile and laughter make nothing else matter.\n\nIt is scary. But I will say that so far the 4 years I've had with my son were the best years of my life. \n\nBut it is absolutely terrifying.\n\nI‚Äôm still embarrassed of being pregnant, everybody gonna know I got cream ü•ß. I can‚Äôt let that happen.\n\nIt‚Äôs not logical and I don‚Äôt think anyone is going to think their way into having kids - there will be more cons than pros on the list.\n\nHaving children has given my life more meaning and joy than I‚Äôve ever imagined or can put into words. I haven‚Äôt regretted it for a minute, even now while struggling with postpartum anxiety after my second.\n\nThat said, many people have happy, successful, beautiful lives without kids. Many people regret having kids. Do whatever feels right for you.\n\nThey're cute and can make you laugh.\n\nWe are biologically motivated to reproduce. \n\nBabies are adorable!\n\nYou need help\n\nI mean because children are beautiful and they just bring out something in me. My child that is that I never thought it was possible. I do have anxiety, but I have also learned that, there are worse things to think about the hell women put them through to give birth. I‚Äôve asked someone who had four kids. She said that every time she seen a baby she gets happy she feels the love, she can‚Äôt explain more than that\n\nI can barely get through a day where I am only responsible for myself, let alone a tiny human being.\n\nImagine if no one had kids, the human consciousness will go extinct in some 80 years time, meaning there would be no one left to be terrified or be happy, I would rather be alive and terrified than be dead , in death there's no concept of anything, at least I get to be terrified, dead people don't have that chance. Of course I don't want kids, for someone like me it's the ethical thing to do, but I will be far more anxious than I already am if everyone else choose not have kids too, because I will feel threatened, even though I won't have kids I am satisfied by the thought that some people will and their kids will live on and experience things I experienced and keep humanity going, in the hope, the hope that maybe one day, we will find a cure for mental illnesses.\n\nthose sick minds think their sickness would be gone if they pour it all onto their child.. it's terrible but that's life\n\nHave you ever experienced people's lack of empathy over possible anxiety? Perhaps they think you are just not doing enough to \"get over it\". Maybe dismissing the way your brain is functioning, because they simply haven't experienced it.\n\nThis is that. You are dismissing their thoughts, feelings and desires. Only now you can be the person who can confront your inability to empathize, and realize that just because you can't wrap your head around it, others can. Humanity only exists because generation after generation have babies. That's just how it is.\n\nI don't want children either, but that's me, and I accept that those are my thoughts, and that my thoughts are mine. There's a difference between someone trying to convince you to have children yourself even when you don't want to, and them wanting to have children for their own reasons. \n\nMaybe it's just not for you to understand why people want kids, but it's nobody's responsibility to make you understand why they want kids.\n\nNo way am I having kids\n\nWhy would it all be hell?\n\nI think for many of us it's just a natural desire to have children.\n\nBecause people think they need to reproduce because peer pressure..\n\n- Some people view it as the gift of giving life, something  miraculous and therefore profound.\n\n- It gives a powerful meaning to some people's lives too, that can't be replaced. \n\n- Familial structure / encouragement / obligations.\n\n- Some even find comfort in it, despite the obvious challenges therein.\n\n- Some view it as the pinnacle of one's relationship with another.\n\n- There's a lot of pride and satisfaction in guiding and teaching others.\n\n- For men, an instinctive desire to pass on one's genes.\n\n- For women, an instinctive desire towards being a mother.\n\n\nI've always suffered with anxiety, but I just couldn't ever see a life without children. Even as a teen, I already knew the names I will want üòäüíó Just have to find my soulmate.\n\nI would love a family but finding someone is hard in this day and age and also I‚Äôm not emotionally stable. I believe I would love them but traumatise them at same time if I‚Äôm having a drop in mood. I‚Äôm trying to be content with my niece and nephews. I enjoy watching them grow and see the funny stuff they do. You get a lot of love from kids if you love them back just as much. That‚Äôs why I want children, to have that love and raise someone to be better than me. But il settle with helping raise my niece and nephews.\n\nBecause life is good and children are wonderful and happy to be around.\n\nBecause being a parent is the best thing in the world. I have crippling anxiety, my husband died when our daughter was 6 months old leaving me at 23 years old with an infant and no plan. I figured it out and created a life for us. I‚Äôm a senior database engineer and homeowner now. Last year my daughter was diagnosed with epilepsy. An anxiety ridden parent and a seizure disorder really do not mix well. I‚Äôm on 3mg klononpin AND 3mg Ativan as a result. She‚Äôs been seizure free for months and yesterday we were in the ER after she had about 20 seizures, first one being in the pool at swim practice, which happened to be also where her most severe one was. I get so anxious at her practices I can hardly breathe. But she loves it and as long as her doctors say it‚Äôs okay, she will swim.\n\nI‚Äôm all she has, not just a parent but a solo parent. I make every decision. The weight of that can be crippling. But then I see my wonderful daughter, happy and smiling and loving her life despite the epilepsy. She is my world, my reason for everything. Even knowning what I know now, I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. She‚Äôs the best thing that ever happened to me. The day she was born a love exploded from inside me that I never knew even existed and it grows everyday with her. I would move heaven and earth for her. \n\nImo, that‚Äôs why.\n\nI know a lot of parents that have 3 or more children and treat them like shit, like they are now a burden and its their fault for being born because their parents did not forsee certain consequences,  possible life changes and expenses....\n\nThen there are people like me and my wife who instead having children from a younger age we waited too much to make our life as comfortable as possible in order to provide the best experience for possible children and now we need to pay a ton of.money for IVF... \n\n\nPersonally i want children because my life is fulfilled and in 30-40 years i will die, and i would like to give someone the opportunity to have a better jumpstart at life than i did. \n\nIf i won't have children then why did i struggle so much to have a life as comfortable as possible since in the end nothing i own even matters lol.\n\nPersonally i had a rough upbringing. Early life was in a poor family then from 8 years of age parents had enough money to be considered middle class and i was raised by narcissists until i went away from home... at 23... i didn't get to have a normal life, and normal life experiences at each stage of my life.\n\nI was living under totalitarianism and then i just ran away from home and got launched into adulthood rough. I had some money to use wisely to get the mortgage going and make a safety net but that was it.\n\nI never managed to go out with a girl, or party or visit places with friends, go to clubs or go through the normal things people at my age used to go through. I could only dream about it.\n\nNow i kind of regret all that in a way because I have no purpose in life other than making.more.money.\n\nHobbies: board games, video games, airsoft no longer make me happy. Holidays are meh to me and don't feel relaxing. I feel like i live in a bubble and i can't escape regardless what i am doing.\n\nBut by having children i will offer them the possibility to enjoy their life the way its meant to be and not.miss out like i did...\n\nIt's the desire to nurture and gave someone a future.\n\nBut nowadays I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give them a good future.\n\nAs much as I doubt my own about capabilities as a possible parent, I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for me to question anyone else‚Äôs choices to deliberately have children to take care of.\n\nIt‚Äôs a personal choice, and I just leave it at that.\n\nHaving a baby has actually helped my anxiety in the long run and will continue to. It‚Äôs making me a more responsible, clean and organized person because I HAVE to be for my baby. Nothing else would motivate me like she does. I cook now because I have to feed her. I‚Äôm learn how to regulate my emotions so I can handle the toddler years. I‚Äôm inspired to go back to therapy. The hard times help you grow and learn! That‚Äôs what life is about\n\nWell for one, many of us have the primal urge to reproduce. Being a parent has been a very cool journey for me. I have learned a lot about who i am, and have been encouraged to take action to become the person i WANT to be. have been forced to deal with the trauma and insecurities i have to be a better parent and person to my son. Personally, it has made me find better ways to cope with my anxiety and mental health problems in a constructive way, i am now a brave person who isnt afraid to take up space and take control of my life because i now have an extrinsic force driving me. i feel like i have been able to develop an optimistic outlook on life because i am responsible for making sure someone else is safe, happy, and loved.\n\nOff topic a bit but I was talking to my grandma and uncle last night and said \"sigh I don't want kids, they're too much work\" then my uncle turned and said \"they're not that much work, it's lovely to have kids right [grandma]?\" And then my grandma shake her head signing a no and said \"sometimes I got to agree with her, chuldren are quite alot of work to have. \" I just started laughing so loud\n\nLike I‚Äôve seen some people say, it‚Äôs based on what each person wants. I personally want kids (in the future) I‚Äôm 21 and gay so I want to wait to be fully prepared. I helped raise my sisters and watching them become the strong women I knew they could be brings me so much comfort. If I were to be honest most people don‚Äôt have children on purpose but we are genetically programmed to want to reproduce sooo‚Ä¶ Idk\n\nIt's the whole thing of what society expects us to do with our lives. Grow up, get an education, get married, have kids, grandkids, etc .  I'm like you- I couldn't imagine bringing a kid into this hellhole world and be responsible for them.\n\n\nI guess it is selfish to some extent, but my daughter‚Äôs birth is the best day of my life. She is in all likelihood autistic, but she has come so far. I am so proud of her. \n\nThere is a concept of ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù parenting. You have to deliberately do the opposite of that for kids to have an increased likelihood of mental illness. That does not exclude the fact, that you could be ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù, but it does erase genetics or things that happen outside of the home, like bullying. There are plenty of things to beat yourself up about as a parent if you look for it.\n\nI don‚Äôt have any but I want them so bad and always have. I want to leave a part of me behind when I go that can positively impact the world based on the person they are who I raised them to be. I also love babies and kids and imagine how fun it would be getting to do kid friendly things with them. Idk there‚Äôs so much I could say!\n\nFor myself, I decided not to have children. Because I was brought up in an abusive family, my stepdad enjoyed the violence. I did not wish it upon my children if I was to have any. I felt that I would be an awful parent. I feel that I could be both abusive and violent. I see it from the jobs that I have done in the past. So I would not want children.\n\nLive is what you make it. It can be beautiful. Aging can be beautiful. Someday you will grow old and depending on the type of person you are you will wish someone who loves you unconditionally would have been there by your side just as you were for them. I hope this helps bring light to your situation and helps you see that it can be only temporary. EVERYTHING is temporary. It‚Äôs a matter of acceptance.\n\nI never gave birth, but I‚Äôm a dad. \n\nIt is very stressful, hard, and exhausting. But at the same time is very rewarding and just amazing. Taking care of mini version of you, watching them experience life, and new feelings is an amazing feeling you can‚Äôt describe. \n\nIt made me want to be better. I started taking better care of myself and my family. Stopped drinking, working out, eating better, doing more, has given be the push to be the best version of myself for him and my wife.\n\nIt's an interesting question, and my thoughts on this have changed over the years. I used to think it was a selfish thing to have kids - and that people were doing it out of ego.\n\nAs I grew older, I realized that having kids with the right person may actually be one of the purest expressions of love. If you two are coming at it from a healed place and want to continue in your journey. This can be said about adoption or having a biological kid, as long as you and your partner are in a healed place.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with having kids or not having kids. The people that want to do for the right reasons do it out of love, not obligation.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone does it for the right reasons. We can only hope the kids and the families turn out okay in those cases\n\n[removed]\n\nBecause not everyone is a doomer woe is me life sucks person. Some people love their lives and are doing well enough financially and want to be able to share that with their children."

    "title": "This is how I solved 90% of my Anxiety",
    "body": "I wanted to share something that helped me tremendously when it comes to dealing with my anxiety, and something that increased my life satisfaction overall. If nothing, stick around for the funny story at the end.\n\n**Who am I?**   \n31 year old male who has had anxiety until the age of 30 - so, most of my life. I didn't know I had it until I started going to therapy.   \nI was always the person who everyone told to \"relax\" - but I never know what that meant. I was relaxed *in my perception of myself*. Everyone told me I was always so \"tense\" - in my thinking and ways of life.  \nI remember constantly going through tough (read: bad) situations in my mind; for example, in my thoughts, I was perhaps fighting someone or someone was attacking me from the shadows when I was walking in a shady alley (this never happened in real life, but my mind has made it up). I had a lot of thoughts where I argued with people - never to reach a happy ending or an agreement, it always ended with a conflict.\n\nSo, unrelated to all of this, I started going to psychotherapy. After a year of going perhaps once or twice a week, I started recognizing more and more what anxiety was. It was sometimes mixed with, what I like to call, depression - but my psychotherapist refuses to accept that, because it's not chronic. And I agree, it was not chronic, but more like daily occurences of emptied out reserves of happy molecules, and lack of ambition. (I also kind of solved this afterwards as well, so I might write a post in the future about that). So I was feeling bad during the day. And of course, had lots of negative thoughts - arguing with people, imagining bad outcomes in my day-to-day job, being rejected by people, and so on.\n\n**What helped?**  \nSo, at the beginning of the year (2024), I had a lot of anxiety. Both related to work and to my health (incidentaly I had increased my salt intake during one week and my blood pressure suffered, so being the anxious person that I am, I kept imagining it going so bad that I'd die). And I started having some kind of flashes of anxiety - I never had those before, so the situation seemed to have gotten way worse than what it was previously. The flashes were manifested in increased heart rate and tensing up - probably my blood pressure suffered as well - and also an array of negative thoughts. \n\nSo I was laying one night in my bed and was going through the flashes. I couldn't help them whatever I did. I told myself to \"just stop fucking thinking negatively\" and, of course, it didn't help. Then I started to realize something - it never helps anyone to tell them to *stop doing something*, but instead, reframe it &amp; motivate someone to *start doing something*. That was the game changer. I told myself -  \n\\- Okay, you're arguing with someone in your mind right now. How about you hug them in, instead?   \nSo I did. And then:  \n\\- How about they also apologize to you and tell you you've been right all along? (this goes in the direction of the conflict I've been having with people, who in my mind were telling me I'm wrong about some things)  \nAnd I did. And they apologized. \n\nAnd I started crying. I've felt like the turntable has happened (had to say it like that, I'm *The Office* fan).   \nI was being engulfed with positive emotions, like my body started to heal finally from all the trauma.\n\nSadly (or luckily, because I was about to learn how to strengthen my positive thinking), another flash of anxiety &amp; negative thoughts came up as I was having these nice thoughts, after such a long time.  \n\\- No, FUCK you! (I've said to myself)  \nI managed to turn them around into something positive again. And more crying ensued. \n\nFrom this point on, I learned to start thinking positively in my life. And I found myself SMILING! Constantly!  \n*How does that look like?* Well, I imagine goofy stuff which brings me lots of joy. For example, if I was at a pool and I walked by three girls (who by the way ignored me) I thought afterwards how they approached me and told me how nice I look. Or if I ended a call / job meeting which I didn't like how it went, I imagined in my head that it went exactly how I wanted it to go, and that everyone praised me for my contributions.\n\nIt didn't matter that this didn't happen (or maybe won't ever happen), and I wasn't delusional. I knew that I was imagining it, and that I cannot always be right, or that I cannot be the prettiest guy in the room and that everyone will like me.   \nBut in my mind, I was. And, boy, did that change my perspective on life. It manifested some *crazy good shit* into reality just became of my positive framing.\n\n**What I learned from it**  \nI learned that I had some unhealed trauma in my life - and you might have guessed it, about being right, about being liked, and so on. So in my mind I started making up situations where I was the prettiest, I was always right  and that I was having a lovely time with everyone - there were no arguments, fights, or things of that sort.\n\nNow I have set up events in my calendar to remind me to think \"happy thoughts\" 2x per week, and for 10 minutes only. I come refreshed out of it. \n\nWhenever I am feeling bad, if I remember to reframe those feelings, or just think of something good happening to me. \n\n**Do you want to try it? How will you know if it works for you?**  \nPlease note, if you try this for yourself and it doesn't work - try to see if, when you shift around your perspective from bad to good, does your mind say: \"No, this can't be right. I cannot be this liked / loved / right / pretty\"? If so, CONVINCE IT that it is fucking possible! Your mind will try to stop you at first, because it's been that way for years / decades, it probably  won't allow you to shift your perspective that fast. It might, but you also might need to \"battle it out\".  \nYou will know it works for you if:  \n\\- tension starts dropping  \n\\- you start feeling good throughout your body  \n\\- you start crying (if unresolved trauma)  \n**- you start SMILING** \n\nI hope this helps at least one person, the way it helped me. Have a nice day, reader!\n\n**Funny story**  \nI was having lunch with my parents and I finally had the courage to bring up the topic of anxiety, now that I've learned to recognize it &amp; deal with it. So I asked my dad, who is a very intelligent person, with a PhD, if he has anxiety perhaps, because he is kind of a negative person. This is what he said:   \n\\- Hey dad, do you think you have anxiety?  \n\\- Anxiety, what's that? Some modern problem of your generation?  \n\\- No, it's when you think of negative thoughts all the time. Like thinking about bad scenarios which might happen.  \n\\- No I don't have it. But yes I do think a lot about negative scenarios because I'm trying to prevent them. For example, I think of all the things that might go bad, so when they actually happen, I am prepared for them. Have you read Sun Tzu and \"The Art of War\"? He said that preparation is most of the battle.\n\n*\\*queue me thinking how to tell him that this is exactly what anxiety is\\**  \n  \n\\- Well, dad, does that mean you're preparing for war in your head constantly, what kind of life is that?\n\n*\\*now he stopped to think, which he hasn't done in a long time, since he usually just spews out answers\\**\n\n\\- Well, heh, maybe. \n\nBy now I think he was embarrassed that anyone actually outwitted him in a sense, because he enjoys winning conversations. But also I think - no, I hope - that he reflected a bit on his life so far.",

    "all_comment_text": "One of the most important practices I've adopted so far is 1. learning to accept you anxiety as your body trying to help and let it be AND 2. acknowledging and celebrating the good moments or the moments you have little anxiety to remind yourself it's not always bad\n\nWhat does accepting your anxiety look like? While I know now that I‚Äôve had it all my life to an extent, it‚Äôs through therapy that I‚Äôve begun to recognize it. Like within the last 10 months. Maybe even shorter. I know what it looks like and I know what triggers it. I know I need to accept it but I don‚Äôt know what that means? Maybe I already have but I just don‚Äôt know. \n\nI‚Äôm not even sure I can ever shake the anxiety. There are specific scenarios that trigger it but I‚Äôm not giving up on those triggers. It doesn‚Äôt last long and I get over it quickly. But I wish I just didn‚Äôt feel like this in those scenarios. Like OP I think I have negative scenarios in my head and I can turn them around. But I don‚Äôt like the feeling.\n\nTake a look at the DARE response. It's roughly acknowledging what you feel happening in your body, going \"ok that's anxiety, cool, but you aren't going to worry me. So do as you will, anxiety, but f off\"\n\nIt's a way to accept anxiety. You'll want the real four steps or however many there are because my explanation is a very poor version and just the first part of what you do\n\nAlso, to your point about \"I'm not even sure I can ever shake the anxiety\"--my goal now isn't to get rid of my anxiety bc I think that's impossible, my goal is to get to a place that when I feel my anxiety it doesn't take over and further ruin my day. To be able to see it, label it, and float with it (Dr. Claire Weekes). Our brains have learned to be anxious in these situations and retraining your brain to teach itself that certain situations is very tough but possible with practice. :)\n\nYes! This is why exposure therapy is so effective. As you learn to accept the anxiety, it gives you a feeling of more autonomy and you in turn get less anxiety. \n\nA friend recently asked me of an example of mindfulness and I always point to when I‚Äôve thought I was so anxious I had to take a benzo. It wasn‚Äôt until I started challenging that thought that I started tapering off of my benzos. \n\nOr when you feel hopeless and your brain is telling you to go bedrot but you accept your depression and do ANYTHING but lay down, almost always you will end up in a better state than if you gave into lying down and boiling in anxious thoughts. \n\nWhen I couldn‚Äôt accept that the anxiety, that was not negotiable to me. I would just say I‚Äôm too weak and find myself bedridden for weeks to months.\n\nCan I ask how you tapered off your benzo?\n\nI was buying them illegally for a decade and taking about 20-30mg of clonazepam but in legal research drugs. I always wanted to quit but during covid when I got really bad, I went out of control and even had to be revived once. That led to me quitting alcohol for two years and then weed, and then I jumped from my huge daily dosage to 2mg clonazapam prescribed. I went through hell because of how big of a drop it was, I was put on seizure meds and blood pressure meds. \n\nI‚Äôm tapering at .25 every 2 weeks to a month. My doctor lets me control the speed. I started August 1st, and currently I‚Äôm down to 1.25 with minimal withdrawals. I started exercising daily and getting in 10k steps+ daily, as well as started a small dose of Prozac. My anxiety has diminished quite a bit. It‚Äôs still there but I feel numb to it, which is a welcoming thing during tapering.\n\nWow! That is so impressive and inspiring! Good for you taking control of your life. I am tapering clonazepam as well and learning how to accept anxiety and move on. Thanks for replying :)\n\nNo problem! I will always be available to talk to if you have any questions or want someone to talk to during tapering. It's not always that bad btw, the people who get it bad post online, the people who quit and dont experience bad things move on. I think that goes with googling anything health related. \n\nThanks for your kind words.\n\nThat is super powerful!\n\nI‚Äôve spent all weekend mentally arguing with a coworker(s) over a miscommunication that I‚Äôll have to deal with tomorrow. Ugh. I hate catastrophizing, but it feels beyond my control.\n\nMy anxiety has me convinced that this will be the worst experience and there will be no recovery from the aftermath. It will result in an unpleasant work environment forever and even worse I‚Äôll be ‚Äúin trouble‚Äù with my supervisor for the poor communication and for not choosing my words more carefully (I didn‚Äôt say anything inappropriate. It‚Äôs just the confusion caused by my words). \n\nI feel like I‚Äôve been marinating in cortisol and adrenaline while my brain is running hundred of thousands of laps this weekend. I‚Äôm truly *scared* of this situation. My brain can‚Äôt fathom that it might not cause the end of the world and ruin the lives of everyone involved. Silly brain. I know it‚Äôs not true, but it doesn‚Äôt change anything. I‚Äôm going to apply your strategy in the hopes that I can at least stop the almost 72 straight hours of mental arguing. ü§û\n\n&gt; hate catastrophizing, but it feels beyond my control\n\nWhat works for me is repeating what I want to believe over and over. So for this, I works start saying\n\n&gt; I don't catastrophize\n\nOver and over again in my head. Maybe even a hundred times a day. Then the next day, and the next day, and whenever I start to do that behavior. Eventually you'll \"install\" that belief in your head and you'll go to catastrophize and think \"I didn't catastrophize\" and being free from there old belief, you'll do something different. \n\nWorks really well for me. I have a lot of these things I repeat daily, and when I find something new or a behavior I want to change I repeat it a lot.\n\nIt sounds like rumination to me. \n\nMy anxiety is very different. I wish I could just think positive thoughts and be free of it. It doesn‚Äôt work that way for me.\n\nI think it's kind of related, but you're right - sometimes my anxiety is just a feeling, like a really bad one, without any ongoing thoughts. Would you say it's something like that for you?\n\nYes. I feel it in my chest and stomach. I unfortunately can‚Äôt stop it with thoughts.\n\nYeah okay. This happens to me too. I think it's when I'm spent emotionally that I feel that way. What helps is good nights sleep, vitamins (D, B, omega 3s, magnesium) and also activities that raise dopamine (being optimistic, hopeful about the future...) but that's another topic :)\n\nThis truly depends on the type of anxiety you have and what traumas/triggers you have. If one has clinical anxiety that is life debilitating to the point you cant leave the house or else you‚Äôd faint (like me), positive thinking and rewiring your brain is not easy and you need meds to help with the chemical imbalance. Not undermining your experience, but what you said does not work for me personally. I learned coping mechanisms and acknowledging it, letting it be. Went to therapy too, but bottom line if i didnt take zoloft, i wouldnt feel better. I have an overly reactive brain that never stops thinking, spiraling down scenarios, fear of the future, regrets and trauma from the past, loneliness. Obviously zoloft is just to help, doesnt ‚Äòcure‚Äô anxiety, but surely helps with the serotonin in the brain so one can work on it and change the thought process.\n\nWhile I agree with you, I would just like to say that I am in no way offering a way for everyone to get rid of every type of anxiety that exists out there. \n\nHowever! If you imagine anxiety as kind of *layered issues*, one on top of the other, where you cannot get to the bottom (root) issues until you've dealt with top (surface) issues, I would say that this technique might just get rid of a layer or two! For that alone, I would still try to practice it. Then, you can focus on resolving everything beneath it, and overcoming your anxiety completely (it's a process).\n\nI do think even you can benefit from this. Try it, let me know how it went? :) But give it a day or two, be consistent!\n\nHey, the author here. I noticed some typing errors but I won't edit the post, hopefully everything is clear with those mistakes as well.\n\nI just wanted to add something: while I might have focused on thoughts such as \"feeling pretty\" or \"feeling right\", that doesn't mean this is what will certainly help you out, too. Everyone is different, and you probably have different issues in your life, and this is what you should focus on while you're thinking positively - think of the best possible outcomes **for you** in the situations **that you are in.** \n\nAnd one more really important thing that I wanted to add, but forgot to add in the original post:\n\nwhen you think of something bad, your body GOES THROUGH IT like it's actually happening. If you are fighting in your mind, it is no different if you are fighting in real life.  \nBut luckily, that goes both ways. If you are imagining a perfect scenario, your body will LIVE THROUGH IT, and release all the molecules that make you happy and satisfied, like it actually happened.\n\nThis is just something that I learned on my own.\n\nThanks for the post! \n\nWhat happens when I replace negative thoughts with positive ones though is that I start to \"ruminate positively\" and I'll build scenarios where I'm the best in the world or I solve everythingggg and then when that inevitably doesn't happen, I come crashing down haha\n\nHas that ever happened to you?\n\nOh, no! You went too deep into positive thinking! Hahah, yeah no haven't been there! I do not need to be the best and I do not need to be liked by everyone. I just really love when I imagine such things, it feels like self love. In the end, it doesn't matter if it doesn't go my way.\n\nSo to clarify you reframe not just things your anxious about in future but past things too? I think my brain would have probs about past things I‚Äôd think I‚Äôm lying to myself but how long has this been helping you for?\n\nI just read a book called ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt believe everything you think‚Äù.  Try to read it if you can.\n\nI remember hearing about this book actually. Thank you.\n\nI missed to answer a really important part of your answer about your brain feeling like it is lying to itself --- YES! :D this is true and the most important thing. But hey, when you imagine future scenarios in your life with the wost outcomes, please realize that, at that point, you are also lying to yourself. Just instead of lying yourself, then, about the bad things, lie to yourself about the good things and best possible outcomes, too?\n\nThat‚Äôs true re lying to yourself I guess on some level you think you are preparing though but v interesting I‚Äôm willing to try!\n\nI haven't delved in my past too much to be honest. I only have (had) visions of very bad outcomes in the future - but those are probably because of my past traumas. The events in my mind were always in the future.\n\nThis has been helping me throughout this whole year (since January 2024) and because of that I have felt confident about sharing it with the world. :)\n\nOk so that‚Äôs a long time cool! No I mean like you gave an example where girls ignored you by the pool but then you imagined they all said you were pretty or something so I mean you reframe past things also, I think that would be hard for me. Future reframing I can get on board with though\n\nYes, I then closed my eyes and imagined them approaching me now. I haven't altered the past.\n\nWhatever you do with the past, the work is to accept it and move on. There is value in unpacking trauma, or trying to learn what you could have done better. \n\nHowever thinking about it too much is where things become a problem. Just accept, shrug, recognize the feeling is there, and then live your life.\n\nDo I still have anxiety? Yeah, sometimes! Not for long (and not as bad as it was), though, and I always catch it quickly. \n\nSometimes I do feel drained because of *life* and can't focus on thinking &amp; being happy. But I stopped imagining the worst case scenarios. The next day, if I had enough sleep, I'm feeling refreshed and great again. If I didn't have enough sleep, the \"sloppy\" feelings continue, but will be resolved once I get some sleep, finally.\n\nI don't completely agree. But I fucking loved your journey. Glad you're improved.\n\nB vitamins can help btw.  Obviously take medical advice.\n\nThey do help, along with vitamin D3 (2000 units daily when its sunny outside, and 4000units daily when its winter). I actually found that when I stop supplementing D3, that in a day or two, anxiety starts \"attacking\" again. Usually, then I start supplementing again and feel cheerful perhaps even that same night, or the next day.\n\nIt's amazing how shifting your mindset in such a small way could lead to such a huge impact. The idea of re-framing negative thoughts into positive ones sounds so simple, yet I can see how powerful it must be. Thanks for being open about your journey! üòä\n\nI get a lot of anxiety dreams with conflict surrounding my family. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to try this while I‚Äôm dreaming, but it‚Äôs worth a shot\n\nI love it man. I am your age and struggling hard with anxiety the same way. I will try it out. Thanks for the blessing.\n\nThis is such a helpful read. Thank you! My anxiety has evolved over the years and now resides in me as terrible claustrophobia. I cannot ride in elevators, like it‚Äôs a hard no for me. Can only fly if I‚Äôm heavily medicated, and I really avoid it just because of the anxiety in the weeks before a trip. But I realize now that my claustrophobia is just my brain assuming the worst possible scenario. So recently I was in Vegas and challenged myself to ride the tram. I made my brain imagine only a perfect ride, no malfunctions involving me getting stuck. I thought well these casinos and businesses make a ton of money from tourists, they must keep the tram in perfect working order. And so I rode it. Twice! And I felt so calm and confident and it all went perfectly. I just hope I can eventually do this with elevators because it‚Äôs really a pain in the ass to not use them.\n\nYess I think you nailed it! That's exactly how you should think. Best possible scenarios.\n\nLuckily for me, I never reached claustrophobia state - but I did fear the elevators. I did use them, just feared them, also.\n\nBut then I thought - hey how many times per year have I seen in the news that someone died in an elevator? Exactly, 0 times per year. I can't even remember when it happened last time. Probably loooong time ago. And elevators are being used so many times per day!\n\nSame thing with flights. I ask myself how many passenger planes crash every year? And then I search for how many flights there are in a year - **16.3 million** in 2023. So they're really safe, too.  \n(although last month I was flying and there was turbulence - I said \"well this is it - I'm done\" :D - and yeah nothing bad happened in the end, alive and well!)\n\nOp, I am so glad you were able to do this for yourself. It‚Äôs incredible. I hope one day to fully accept my anxiety. I have specific scenarios that trigger my anxiety and I‚Äôm nit giving those up. The anxiety goes away after a couple hours but I hate the feeling.\n\nInteresting. This sounds like a self-guided ART session (not drawing or painting - ART is a therapy modality. Your therapist has to be trained in it. It involves eye movement combined with the type of reframing the OP describes.) That can be a draining but beneficial process. I'm going to try it and hopefully remember to report back.\n\nAccelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) is something I never heard of, but indeed it sounds very similar! Thanks for sharing, buddy :)\n\nThis post is everything.. if I wasn‚Äôt cheap I‚Äôd buy you an award. ü•á\n\nThis reminds me of something I read in \"the happiness trap\" by Russ Harris. I think he is a pioneer in acceptance and commitment therapy. Basically when you have a recurring thought which makes you anxious, you add something absurd to it. It's hard to be scared when you reframe it that way. It helped me with intrusive thoughts I would have while driving. Specifically during long straight sections of road I would imagine driving head on into the cars heading my way. This would terrify me and I would white knuckle the steering wheel. I started imagining doing a huge jump as a result of colliding and landing it perfectly. Made me smile... Now I don't have that thought much anymore.\n\nHahah this is great! I also tried this in several cases this year. Since I was so afraid of conflict, and I was 5-10 minutes late to a doctor's appointment that I had, I imagined the doctor yelling at me and providing me bad service overall. I started feeling tense and I just knew my blood pressure shot up &amp; that I was entering the fight/flight mode -- and this was on my way to the doctor's office, so nothing really happened yet, I was just imagining it.\n\nThen I imagined the doctor being really small and tiny and he had this high pitched tone and was yelling at me from the ground. This made me laugh &amp; released the tension.\n\nOf course, that stems from conflict avoidance &amp; issues with authorities - some past trauma that I had from childhood.\n\nThis is so dope, an in depth breakthrough event shared in detail. I wish i could in real time appreciate and navigate anxiety or atleast adhere to this new mindset and actually apply it when needed. Thank you for sharing, I feel like ive had serveral breakthrough moments but not a single one that shows replicable  lasting effects. Maybe my fault for putting all eggs in a basket so to speak waiting for a 1 fix it all moment . This one time i was in middle of a cute little freak out, you know the type, little tears, little bit of anger, capped with a thick bit of self deprecation , shame and fear. All good stuff, i thought it was a great time to have a smoke to try and take the edge off. But that quickly resulted in the second worst anxiety attack id ever have . My chest felt like there was a vise slowly clamping down on lungs and circulation but in the middle of almost passing out i hallucinated in giant neon letters, ‚ÄúYOU ARE OUTSIDE ‚Äú my mind was fixated on the vibrancy of the words i could not focus on in anything else. I slowly was able to breathe while observing the buzzing vibrations of the letters, its like i found a frequency my heart rate and lings could follow. Anyways as i got out of the panic state, i then found the anxious place that was originally causing me stress, i kept breathing and even found myself outside of that place. peace. Its like i stepped into an elevator through these floors upward and out of myself. From the outside i can observe myself and see that 99% of my anxiety is just thoughts of worrying . I can get to this mindset if i really sit down and breathe through my thoughts and view things from a 3rd person view then i know everything is irie. However days where i dont have the luxury to sit and breathe or situations where i get caught off guard by stress,My emotions boil up to the point where they hold me hostage for days. I cannot find a consistent way to pull myself out of these bouts. Anyway sorry for ranting. Love The office it saved my lifeü§òüèΩ\n\n Reframing is key. \n\n Instead of I'm sobering up/getting clean, it's so much easier to say I'm not drinking right now or taking a break atm.\n\n This applies to so many things.\n\nI‚Äôm curious how you turn body sensations towards the positive? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm experiencing right now. There‚Äôs not really a thought I‚Äôve identified that‚Äôs triggered it but for example, I‚Äôve been hyperventilating thinking I can‚Äôt get a deep enough breath. When it doesn‚Äôt happen then I get anxious and the thoughts come. I‚Äôve been working with a therapist doing the ACT therapy and started the supplements (tried meds and can‚Äôt). But like you, they come and go like flashes. I also have a bit of OCD but that‚Äôs a whole other deal.\n\nSince I had high blood pressure (140-150 upper, and \\~90 lower), I was afraid of heart attacks or strokes constantly, and that only contributed to my anxiety... However, I do remember that my blood pressure also had periods where it was perfect (like 120/80) and that convinced me that it is possible to be in a healthy state.\n\nSo when I discovered this technique, I realized how tense I was and how my body was constantly in this fight/flight mode. Thinking the following things made me happier at the moment (which is all that matters, in the end):\n\n\\- in a few days, my blood pressure will be perfect, and I'll be so happy when I see how perfect it is!\n\nThen I imagined how happy I would be. It was possible for me to do so, because the feeling of overcoming the health issues was so empowering.\n\n\\- I'll be so healthy that everyone will ask me how did I do it?\n\nThen I imagined people approaching me asking me for advice, and me smiling from 'ear to ear' because I'm so happy that I overcame what I've had, and telling them all that I have this technique where I imagine positive things, etc - and them being so grateful about it, because then they had their problems solved as well. (all imaginary, but helped *a lot*)\n\n\\---\n\nThoughts such as these calmed me &amp; my nervous system down. Over the following days &amp; weeks, the situation only got better! But I had to practice it every day. I had to re-program my thoughts from being negative all my life, to being only positive. It was a bit of work, but every time I worked on it, I enjoyed it so much!\n\nThis is super helpful, thank you! BP is also a health anxiety of mine so I can use this technique for a few things.\n\nEFT helped me a lot during my anxious phases. Combining with positive reframing might actually be useful.\n\nI did something similar years ago in my mid 20s to get over the bad habit of focusing on potential negative outcomes to situations I had to deal with. I always found myself worrying like for example, when I was going to through a rough unemployment spell, I would catch myself saying \"if I don't get a job soon, I'm going to have to pawn something expensive to pay the rent.\" Then on my way to the pawn shop with my console and video games, I'd say \"if they don't give me enough for this, I'm gonna have to call some family and beg for a loan.\"\n\nFinally, I'd get called for an interview and on the way I'd be like \"they probably won't hire me.\"\n\nJust completely negative shit all the time. I stopped myself one day and just said \"fuck it. Whatever happens, happens. And what's the worst that could happen? I'm still alive. I'm surviving.\" and with that, I stopped worrying. I got rid of most of my anxiety that day. Once in a while, it'll flare up again, but I'll catch myself again.\n\nThis sounds awesome, especially when you mentioned the part about thinking of these situations when you wanted to feel liked, welcomed, but irl you weren't - so you started to imagine how well all these scenes could go and it made you feel good. Ngl, I started to remind myself about my own similar situations just a little bit... and I already feel like crying ü•≤ \n\nI'm going to start a new job in one week or two. Thankfully I passed the job interview positively but I don't doubt that my anxiety is an important obstacle that makes people around wonder if I'm capable of doing my job well. I had a possibility to stay in my previous job and I'm almost completely sure some of my anxious behavior had to make someone convince HQ that I'm not stress-tolerant enough to stay with them for longer (but I don't mind it since I didn't want to anyway, I had some serious issues with that place and some of these people). So I'll try my best to remember your technique and practice imagining some positive situations at my new workplace and with new coworkers (hopefully they will be nice and patient with me). Thank you for sharing with this.\n\nincredible, so happy for your discovery, we love hearing a win. ü•π our patches can help you sustain it\n\nThis sounds like you‚Äôre doing CBT. Unfortunately I have a neurotype that does not respond to it, I‚Äôve found DBT a little better\n\nThanks for this, friend.\n\nMade me smile and cry a bit mate, have the same exact thoughts in my mind constantly\n\nMy anxiety stems from having grown up in family where they constantly think what ifs all the time for all the situations. It was fine initially but I realized negative thinking has become my common norm in all spears of life which only started growing into mountain and then physical anxiety kicked in and now I am stuck in flight or fright. Uncomfortable physical sensations throughout the body which make me think/believe I have some health issues or in fact dying of heart attack. I constantly keep telling myself that all my negative scenarios never came true so to help my perspective turn towards positive side. What‚Äôs worst is like in OPs case I had a discussion with my parents about how this kind of thinking affects us and they think if not thinking this way how else to think then? How sad! I don‚Äôt care or want to change them I want to find a way to manage my anxiety.\n\nAh, I have only started to get better once I distanced myself from them - by going to another city for college. Sadly, my siblings are still stuck in the same ways of thinking, since they remained with my parents. \n\nParents do strongly influence how we think, and if they have unresovled issues, it's very hard to overcome them on your own. I do wish you best of luck in overcoming anxiety! :)\n\nThank you so much. Your post truly reminded me of how can positive thinking, changing perspective influence anxiety. Even though I realize that I have to make a consistent effort like you mentioned may be block 10 mins  every week to just think positive thoughts, it make be alien at the beginning but with practice I am confident it can get better. I am going to implement this and see how it goes. Appreciate you posting this today. Made me think that all my thinking is just in head not in reality.\n\nWish you good luck as well to continue living anxiety free!\n\nIt was good to hear from someone who laid out my newly-identified anxiety (as i had labeled it simply as being significantly on the austistic spectrum (which i only discovered about 20 yrs ago.) Before that i knew i had always had a problem with becoming easily depressed &amp; overwhelmed.\nI am now about to turn 81.\n\nThru testing, I learned i had significant autistic characteristics -which amazed me. I always thought i was just quirky; but i did have personal traits which i used to beat myself up for repeating over &amp; over again; unable to modify my behavior.¬†\n\nA lifetime of berating myself for neurological reactions i had not much control over; plus lots of depression and meds off &amp; on, which never solved the problems.\n\nLoss of literally everyone i had ever loved, and found comfort in, brought me lower &amp; lower; and in the last 3 yrs i knew the anxiety and continued losses were finally beginning to destroy my heretofore good physical health.¬†\nIt all started at ages 15 &amp; 19, when i lost both parents to death.\n\nSo I fought it all my life by myself, and not until age 46 did i cry uncle and give my life to the Creator of everything around us, knowing He would lift my burdens and carry them for me.¬†\nAll i needed to do was to look at this incredible ball that we float around on daily in space. There has to b a Creator, bcuz there is no earthly being who can create anything out of thin air; let alone a blade of grass even, or the incredible human/animal bodies and their intracacies, from conception forward.¬†\nEach living thing on earth was created with one phrase: ‚ÄúLet there be . . .‚Äù ¬†-zillions of living things. Not to mention the moon and stars ; one for night light and one for warmth and daylight, and for giudance when traveling. And try explaining infinity!\n\nIt was miraculous, the release; but my job had just begun. Many, many fears and betrayals to let go of in the process; many tears for what had been lost along the way, -and many, many tears of thanksgiving as i continue toward my final destiny.¬†\n\nAnd the hope that my struggles in the past have helped or will help even one person is my prayer.¬†\nAfter the initial thrill of ‚Äúcasting our cares on Him‚Äù there comes a time to learn and grow exponentially in a world that is in deep conflict; which piles on an incredibly heavy¬†load for the rest of us; esp those who are extremely sensitive.¬†\n\nBut there is no other antidote for true peace.\nPick up your Bible, find a church body to study and pray with.\nHe is a free counselor 24/7, and His Word has stood up against naysayers, archaeologists and scholars for over 2000 yrs.¬†\nMay God bless your journey.\n\nYou beautiful mfer, I think I needed to hear this rn. I've been laying on my stomach for two days trying to keep calm and not do anything to aggravate my symptoms. Which will immediately make me feel like I'm going to die from heart provlems, but now in my head that's my bodies way of telling me I need to get up and do something about it instead of coddling my anxiety. You helped someone today, good job dude\n\nWOW i do the imagine thing too i just thought i was crazy or too negative for no reason just wow üò≠\n\nReally recommend reading Self Compassion by Kristin Neff :) She discusses how we can better accept our anxieties and missteps because it‚Äôs truly human, and how we deserve comfort instead of self criticism. \n\nHappy that you‚Äôve figured out something that‚Äôs been working for you OP!!! Power to ya!!!\n\nThanks, I‚Äôm going to read this book. I need to learn to accept.\n\nI think deep down this is about compassion, indeed. It takes a certain level of self love to really believe that good things will happen to you, and then to gift it to youreself, these positive thoughts.\n\nHowever, if one feels like lacking in the self love department, I think this approach, if practiced daily, should improve it.\n\nThanks for this wonderful tool OP!\nI have been able to manage a lot of anxieties using this method. My mantra is ‚Äútake every thought captive.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt understand quite what that meant nor how to do it consistently &amp; effectively til recently. It is literally controlling my thoughts, corralling them &amp; putting them under my control. Then I can change them to realistic, proper, positive tracks.  Very empowering!\n\nTake every thought captive....2 Cor. 10:5.  Also, whatever is right, true, lovely, admirable...think on those things. Phil 4:8 - All keys to positive thinking from the beginning of time.\n\nYes! Has helped tremendously! üôèüèº\n\nIt looks to me like you‚Äôve locked into CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) quite nicely. \n\nI don‚Äôt know you personally, but there‚Äôs a pattern in your writing, you seem to have really ‚Äòkeyed up‚Äô high energy, fast thinking vibe. It reminds a bit of a manic phase, but I do hope I‚Äôm wrong and you‚Äôve found your balance .\n\nOh wow that's interesting. Subjectively, I'm feeling calm though, especially the last few weeks since I started taking magnesium threonate - I've felt more... balanced, in a sense. Not that it was drastically different before, but I've had ups &amp; downs. \n\nI love analysing my thoughts &amp; behaviours so I'll try to research what you've said.\n\nAlso I felt really motivated to write this post since it helped me a lot and I loved spreading the word - to my closest friends, initially. Maybe the hype has gotten to me a bit too much :)\n\nYou‚Äôve managed all this without meds in the last year?\n\nYep. When I didn't yet discover this method that I've described above, I used CBD oil for 1 month. It helped a bit but didn't resolve anything. Just soothed me\n\nI feel like you wrote this specifically for me almost lol I‚Äôm the same age as you- also struggling with anxiety that meds haven‚Äôt been able to fully sort, and I‚Äôm going to give this a shot!\n\nI can see more of what I have done to myself from what you have said. I didn‚Äôt realize this only parts of it. Being adhd makes it hard to not hyper focus on things but I have to do something. I have really been messed up this whole year with anxiety and now I realize as depression.\n\nI'm definitely gonna try this! I already obsessively imagine bad scenarios, so I guess it wouldn't hurt to obsessively imagine good ones for a change haha\n\nPerfect! :) I hope it helps you.\n\nMy 6 months work with therapist just described there. I'm glad you slowed it, man ü´Ç\n\nI love this. I used to live like this too. But had a health issue in August and have been anxious since it will come back. Im starting being positive again right now. Thank you üòä\n\nmy dilemma is that if i am too happy, the thing i worry about will come true so as a result i am stuck worrying because i believe worrying will cause the outcome to never occur\n\nThis happened to me, as well - and hey, sometimes it still happens. The technique I described can help you with this.\n\nI think it's a result of our anxiety and past traumas, and it's also a false belief. \n\nI searched on the internet, and it seems that the scientific name of this fear is \"cherophobia\" / \"aversion to happiness\". \n\nIt's something you can fix, just work on it :) sending hugs your way!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis long as shit post peaked my anxiety\n\nYou sound unstable¬†"

    "body": "I knew caffeine could affect your anxiety, but I didn't know it could be THAT bad.\n\nSo, the story is that I went to a job interview with a CEO of a company, who took me to a fancy coffee place. I was already tense cause of the meeting, but had downed a benzo before it, so I thought I would be ok.\n\nThe meeting dragged out for 3 hours, which was a good thing, cause the guy liked me, but he also wanted to buy me different kinds of expensive coffee, and we ended up on 3 cups in a row.\nAfter the 3rd cup I got a really bad heartburn. I am obese and have had reflux issues for years, so I knew it was coming, but it has never been this bad before. My whole chest was on fire.\n\nI struggled to keep conversation while trying to keep my stomach content. Then things started to spin and my anxiety was triggered. Luckily the guy had to go, so we parted ways. At this point the world was rotating and my chest was killing me, so I tried my best at keeping balance and sticking to the walls.\n\nAn hour later I returned home, and my anxiety levels kept growing until I entered a full blown panic attack which lasted for another 3 hours. I was hoping it would calm dowm once my wife got home. The heartburn had gotten worse too and my chest pains spread to my shoulders and jaw. I remember my wife coming home and I got up from my seat to greet her. Next thing I know I am in ambulance. My wife told me that I simply collapsed after getting up.\n\nMy blood pressure at that time was around 210/114\n\nI was rushed to the ER, where they could find nothing wrong with me other than my blood pressure and the fact that I was in a state of panic.\nThey spent the next few hours pumping me with antiacids and benzos.\nAfter a high enough dosage, by BP finally began to drop and my panic attack stopped.\nAll of this lasted 9 hours...\n\n3 f*cking cups of coffee.

    "all_comment_text": "I can‚Äôt even drink any coffee anymore, last year I would drink about 2 cups every morning-noon but now even half a cup will make me extremely anxious all day\n\nMan I feel you. My anxiety can make my blood pressure &amp; heart rate shoot up. Every time I see a doctor they tell me I‚Äôm healthy, just need to lose some pounds. But wow, my anxiety has sent me to the ER 5 times‚Ä¶ each time it‚Äôs been just a panic attack.\n\nGiving it up changed how I feel almost 70% better with my anxiety\n\nDude. All it took was ‚Äú3 cups of coffee‚Äù? You had a high stress meeting with a potential new boss, you‚Äôre popping benzos, you‚Äôre obese, you have serious acid reflux and I‚Äôm assuming your normal blood pressure levels are through the roof. The cups of coffee didn‚Äôt send you into your panic attack , they were just the cherry on top.\n\nI have to agree with this. While the coffee was a contributing factor, the other stuff all played into it.\n\nThis.\n\nLol my thoughts exactly\n\nit was a whole cocktail¬†\n\nThis\n\nRight?!? Use some common sense!\n\nNo need to be rude, especially on the anxiety subreddit of all places, lol.\n\nYes please life is tough enough on us already\n\nBenzos can interact negatively with caffeine sometimes causing a paradoxical effect like heart palpitations. The easiest explanation is the upper and downer opposite effect. I enjoy coffee too, but I separate it from when I take pills. Coffee can cause terrible anxiety on its own as well for sure. \n\nI would stick to decaf or only have a cup here and there not 3 at once so you can get used to the caffeine at a lower amount.\n\nWow! I didn‚Äôt know this about benzodiazepines üò≥ I thought that if you were having heart problems you should take a mild benzo, like 5 mg Valium, to calm down?? I have beta blockers but sometimes they don‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve also tried baby aspirin but as it‚Äôs an NSAID it can make my GERD worse. Between GERD, cardiac issues, and anxiety, I am constantly having palpitations\n\nI missed drinking coffee. My blood pressure is always normal (90/60) yet even a sip of coffee will bring me panic attack. Will I ever enjoy coffee again?\n\nIt's interesting, well I think it is, every time my anxiety gets really bad the first thing to go is coffee. During my last 'episode,' which can last months, I was tired and frustrated enough to try coffee. \n\nIt actually lowered my anxiety. I don't know anyone else that has the same reaction. I have since tested the theory and it does seem to check out for me. Its kind of a curse because now I think of it as a bit of a crutch and doesn't last all that long. \n\nI don't drink or do drugs so if coffee is my worst habit I guess I'm doing okay.\n\nDo you have ADHD? Coffee has a calming effect on people with ADHD\n\nOn some people with ADHD it does, but I have ADHD and it either helps me hyper focus or it makes my thoughts race like crazy, it never makes me feel calm\n\nSame here. I have ADHD and caffeine is definitely an anxiety trigger.\n\nIf I stick to ONE cup of coffee, it calms my ADHD. But if I drink 2-3 in a short period of time, it makes my anxiety worse. I also have to forego coffee when my GERD is bad or when I‚Äôm really stressed.\n\nI have heard that and explored it with my therapist but he doesn't seem to think so.\n\nI do. Coffee actually lowers my stress, heart rate and improves my focus very much. I do suspect i suffer from undiagnosed adhd or something like that.\n\nYES this happened to me once too! I was going through withdrawal (from caffeine). Had anxiety anyway (despite cutting out coffee) so I decided to fuck it and have one and it calmed me down like a benzo. Stopped withdrawal. I asked my doc about it, he said caffeine is a complex drug and anxiety is a withdrawal symptom.\n\nIsn't anxiety wonderful....\n\nIf you truly enjoy coffee, switch to decaf.\n\nSame enjoyment, negligible caffeine.\n\nI tried.\n\nDo you miss the taste or the energy?\n\nThe taste, the energy, the company\n\nMushroom coffee might help with the energy. I understand it to be a healthy alternative.\n\nI will try this, thanks for the recommendation!\n\nLet me know what you think! Would love a personal review.\n\nI drink decaf to avoid the high levels of caffeine. Keep in mind that decaf is not caffeine free and it ranges based on the brand. Kroger‚Äôs decaf coffee is great!\n\nYes good point but I think decaf has to be like less than 10g or something so still really low but can affect everyone differently\n\nSame üòî\n\nExcept it didn't just take 3 cups of coffee.\n\nIt was a three hour high stress meeting, benzos, obesity, reflux and coffee that caused it. I suspect it was the stress of the meeting and the reflux pain, rather than the coffee.\n\nThis one. Coffee caused a tipping point. The glass doesn‚Äôt overflow if it‚Äôs not already almost full. Your body is taking to you and letting you know you gotta do some self care.\n\nI have actually stopped coffee. Now I only drink tea/chai which is still not good but I am addicted\n\nThis! Way less caffeine than coffee especially green tea and chai is still only around 60-80mg I think\n\nOh I drink like a big mug lol\n\nStill better than coffee which has like double\n\nUgh, I know this feeling all too well. I remember taking a sip of my boyfriend's coffee not knowing that he had put an extra three shots of espresso in it. I drank it on an empty stomach. \n\nI was laying in bed when all of a sudden my chest started to feel really tight and my heart was beating really fast. I got panicked and disoriented. My head felt like it was disconnected from my body. I got so panicked I started hyperventilating and extremely hot. I thought my body was failing or something. I got really nauseous and went to throw up. I immediately threw up the coffee I had just drank and almost instantly felt better. \n\nI was still a little shaky the rest of the day, but since that day I'm wary of how much caffeine I consume. I'm so sorry that happened to you. It happens randomly. I used to be able to drink coffee at night. Now I need to have decaf or at least have a meal before I try coffee. And I most definitely can't have it past 9am lmao. So silly!\n\nWeirdly enough I've always had a really high tolerance to caffeine even though I have anxiety but recently I got put on buspar and it's made me extremely sensitive to caffeine,like I had to cut wayyyy back and have to space out my coffee and medication at least 3 hours which is a pain in the ass. If I take it to close together it triggers really bad anxiety all day long üò≠ \n\nGlad your doing better, anxiety and panic attacks seriously suck.\n\nBuspar did the same to me, as well as Doxepine I was prescribed for sleep.! I'm not on either anymore, because I had other side effects. But certainly medications and other factors can cause a new caffeine intolerance.\n\nYeah which sucks cuz I love my coffee üòû\n\ncoffee is a massive trigger for my anxiety and reflux. that combined with stress would send me to the ER too. so sorry this happened. i've become a lot more comfortable telling people \" im sorry i have really bad reflux and i can't have that.\" It takes practice. Hard when you're trying to impress someone or fit in or whatever but you have to take care kf yourself! hope you got the job lol\n\nI've been drinking decaf half-caf, and herbal teas for about 8 years now due to anxiety. At one point I couldn't have chocolate because I was so sensitive. \n\nI went to the ER from having milk tea a while ago. So you're not alone at least üôÇ\n\n3 cups of coffee would not even faze me I‚Äôm so caffeine addicted\n\ni can only drink coffee if it‚Äôs the super fluffy crazy dessert coffee early in the day as a rare treat in the smallest portion possible. can‚Äôt do regular coffee, caffeinated sodas, energy drinks. anxiety through the roof, dissociating for hours. terrible time. especially on an empty stomach\n\nOh I know how bad it can be. Ask me why I don't drink caffeine :p \n\nThankfully I don't get actual panic attacks, but what I do get is anxiety that stays at like an 8/10 for weeks and months on end. I work in mental health and I've never known anything like it. When my psychiatrist described the peaks of anxiety, I'm like \"what peak?\". It plateaus for weeks at an unbearable level. I've even had medical investigations to see if there's a physiological reason for it, like a tumour etc. Nothing found. I do get the usual physical symptoms like fast heart rate etc, but I have asthma and can't take beta blockers, so I take other meds, but they don't work completely. My adrenaline is so high all the time that I barely sleep, even with sleeping tablets. Nightmare really.\n\nThis sounds horribly nightmarish. Did you get the job?\n\nA hiatal hernia could cause this.\n\nI miss coffee, specifically I miss my Dunkin iced caramel lattes with sweet cold foam. However, due to my tremors from my movement disorder (essential tremor) I had to cut it out. Caffeine itself made my tremors more violent. Anxiety makes my tremors worse. Caffeine triggers my anxiety. I think you get the picture, it was a double whammy. One really bad panic attack that lasted hours after only drinking one latte (about 167mg of caffeine) was enough for me to complete cut it from my life. Now if I want caffeine I drink green tea.\n\nMay I ask why you didn't take another benzo upon returning home?\n\nI am sorry that happened to you!\n\ncaffeine relaxes the LES muscle, causing acid reflux in people with Gerd. It should be avoided. Caffeine can cause anxiety &amp; acid reflux can cause anxiety because it's triggering the nervous system.   \nThis should be a wake up call for you to change your diet and lifestyle. Things will only get worse.\n\nI personally believe that between the mix of your obesity - assuming that you already suffer with high blood pressure as well as having to deal with high stress from meeting with your CEO, the coffee was only a small portion to the cause of your panic. \n\nI, too, get sooo anxious drinking coffee. As a matter of fact, the other day, my wife got me a Chai Tea with a shot of espresso, and man, was I anxious. It didn't help that I was attending my best friends funeral in two hours of that time. I've learned to just stay away from any type of high-caffinated beverages. I go to the gym regularly, and I once thought that I could take pre-workout lmao. That resulted in a very bad anxiety attack. (For anyone curious, beet root powder and creatine will give you the best pump with the most natural energy.) \n\nI would suggest getting into some type of physical hobby. Focusing on your physical health will make a huge difference with your mental health, especially reducing your BP. Again, minimal caffeine as well. I've noticed that soda doesn't do anything towards my anxiety in small increments, if that's any consolation. \n\nPanic attacks are known for having people pass out from intense hyperventilation episodes, but your blood pressure sounds like it was the main cause. As hard as it is to accept, people with panic are limited to certain things, and it's far better to respect it and adapt than to fight the stress. I hope that you find a solution that works best for you!\n\nI used to drink 2-3 cups of coffee a day until I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and having panic attacks. Was always worried about my bp and that I might die soon lol then I stopped drinking coffee while taking sertraline and sometimes benzo.\n\nStop taking too much caffeine, as much as you want it, refrain. You'll see ER again if you try\n\nI am now drinking cocoa drink which also gives energy but does not have too much caffeine in it. You can also drink coffee, once a week perhaps, but not once a day.\n\nI have a very bad reaction to caffeine as well so don't drink it anymore. Im sorry this happened I had a similar but not so bad episode once after drinking 4 coffee's in one day.\n\nI used to drink like at least 3 cups daily. Now I just drink 1 cup weekly because of Anxiety. Sometimes it causes an attack or a headache but sometimes it doesn't.\n\nWhen I‚Äôm in anxiety mode, one coffee at the most. I also try to make sure I‚Äôve had something in my stomach like a piece of toast first.\n\nLol I rarely drink coffee these days. Used to drink multiple cups a day while working on an office but ever since working remotely, the caffeine compounds on top of my anxiety.\n\n210/114 is a lot and very dangerous. I suspect your pannic attack had nothing to do with coffee, but rather with what you physically felt in your body, head and chest from such extremely high blood pressure. And coffee most likely contributed to high blood pressure which was already high due to high stress levels from the interview. I had non-stop panic attack which lasted for over 24h a few weeks ago while I had blood pressure rollercoaster due to covid. The physical sensation of blood pressure crashing  up and down every minute was so so bad and mortifying.\n\nIve also gone to the ER over an all-night panic attack. Not fun at all ü´Ç I'm glad you're safe now, and I hope you recover fully.\n\nAlso, I suggest switching to tea. I've found that once you massively overdo it on coffee once, your nervous systembis much more sensitive to caffeine after that. To avoid a repeat or similar experiences, maybe switch to something half caff, like Chai.\n\nGood luck üëç\n\nHey friend. I‚Äôm sorry that you went through this.\n\nI think it‚Äôs probably more than three cups of coffee. You also had a three hour interview! That is a really impressive feat for somebody with anxiety.\n\nSounds like the interview went well, which is awesome. I tend to find that after intense experiences, even good ones, if I am in a bad place with anxiety, I just get overwhelmed afterwards. I‚Äôm going through this now after finishing my dream vacation, which went well.\n\nI started my anxiety journey obese too. I started eating better and exercising to control the anxiety, and ended up in good shape. I find that it makes the physical side of anxiety a lot more tolerable. Taking a holistic approach to your health would do a lot of good.\n\nMan, the last time I drank a full caffeinated cold brew was when one of my family suffered a medical emergency and I flipped out. I had a full on panic attack - rapid heartbeat, hyperventilation, tremors‚Ä¶ Basically the whole nine yards. \n\nI‚Äôm not obese and I‚Äôm pretty healthy but that being said - I didn‚Äôt even drink half of that thing and I was reeling for HOURS. \n\nIf you have anxiety you‚Äôve got to be really careful with caffeine. If you‚Äôre going to drink coffee try decaf or half caff.\n\nCoffee is a drug, most of us are used to it and have lost so much control and drink coffee every day and dont notice our stress or anciety levels. The thing is that it is still a drug. \n\nAfter 25+ years you should worry about the things you put into your body, being obese might make you sensitive to inflammation as well and it can make these things have a worse effect. It would be good to fast 1 or 2 days to completely get it out of your system but man, panic attacks are scary. I experienced one as well and had to go to the ER as well. \n\nI wish you can recover soon and next time just drink one or maybe half a cup on a non empty stomach Opie, I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you\n\nI have almost abstained from caffeine. One light latte every 3-4 weeks. I'm tired but I feel better overall.\n\nTake better care of your body.\n\nAs a person with zero tolerance to caffeine cuz I never consume it:\n\nOne bottle of anything and I'm done. It's a strong af drug.\n\nOoof I know the feeling too well. I had to stop taking coffee even though I used to love coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, etc. Makes me sad. üòî I drink decaf sometimes, but even decaf sometimes make me edgy\n\nIm curious for those who have gone cold turkey on coffee, would you still consider drinking decaf if you like coffee for the taste?\n\nI‚Äôve been doing this, one cup to start the day then a decaf to follow. I think coffee overall just brings me comfort caffeine aside\n\nI switched to decaf after realizing that caffeine made my anxiety worse. I always enjoyed coffee for its taste rather than its stimulating effects, and my anxiety improved significantly once I made the change.\n\nI still drink coffee even though it can make conditions favorable for a panic attack. I really want to be able to live my life as normal as possible despite my anxiety. I had a coffee yesterday on a flight and had two short panic attacks but I‚Äôm still going to have coffee today. I know this isn‚Äôt possible or preferable for a lot of people but I think it‚Äôs working for me.\n\nAlso for some people caffeine can stay a long time in the system.\n\nIf I take one coffee once in a while it‚Äôs fine.\n\nBut if I take one coffee today and an other one fuckin tomorrow. I won‚Äôt be fine. The remaining caffeine of the day before mixed with more today would fuck me up.\n\nI very stupidly thought this lotion I bought was just coffee scented but apparently it had caffeine in it. I put it all over me and not even 5 minutes had a full on panic attack. I had to shower and eat a lot of carbs to feel better.\n\nIt happens. At least there are some good lessons to take away from it: \n\nWhen it‚Äôs better to politely decline an offer. Avoiding caffeine in general if it sets off your reflux and anxiety. Prioritizing both your health and mental health since they‚Äôre dependent on one another.\n\nI only have 1 cup a day, but I wasn't measuring the grounds. I went a few weeks feeling super caffeinated even at night, sort of floating, high speed, extra anxiety and I decided to stop caffeine to see if it helped\n\nI got a headache. So I decided to do half caff and I'd measure it. When I did that, I realized I had been maybe tripling it or more for quite some time. My one cup was like four\n\nMeasuring a real single cup of coffee, half caff, has fixed that overly hyped feeling I was having. Go figure\n\nThat's sounds awful üòñ glad you felt better afterwards. It's like a nightmare you cannot wake up from. Take care üôÇ¬†\n\nTake it from me, I would get extremely anxious after drinking a medium iced coffee and now I have to get decaf or go for alternatives. I literally just have no caffeine. It fucks with your anxiety so much. I‚Äôm surprised no one talks about it.\n\n3 cups of coffee is my limit too- just the WORSt anxiety, palpitations, awful!!\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry you had that experience sounds similarish to an experience I had with DayQuil, sent me to the er with a horrendousssss panic attack from the dextromethorphan/phenylephrine, we careful y‚Äôall with those ingredients. Anyways avoid coffee!!! I‚Äôve never been able to tolerate caffeine even green tea will make me jittery I cannot imagine three cups of coffee on top of an already anxious day. Hope you‚Äôre feeling better now!!! Take it easy.\n\nYeah coffee is the devil to me. Only tea is what I can handle. I had a vendor meeting and had one cup of cold brew and felt like I was dying and had to go home promptly after my meeting lol. No more! Hope you are feeling better now!\n\n1 cup of coffee sent me to urgent care 5 years ago with a full day of panic attacks that wouldn‚Äôt stop. From then on, I never consumed caffeine again lol\n\nI have nearly the same reaction only it doesn't matter caffeine or not,¬† just any coffee.¬†\n\n\nIt's cumulative in my system.¬† I can go a month or so one cup in the morning and it gradually gets worse.¬† Take a month or two off and it's not bad at all.¬†\n\n\nEveryone's chemistry is different.¬†\n\nI am seriously so sorry that happened to you. And it really fucking sucks that health problems- whether mental or physical- are so stigmatized that you felt you couldn‚Äôt say anything. I don‚Äôt have any solutions except to throw everything you can at it- supplements/nootropics, psychiatric medication, TMS therapy, talk therapy, meditation, group therapy, the gambit. We don‚Äôt deserve to have to live like this.\n\nMy God that is absolutely terrifying!! I hope you‚Äôre doing better and please do not drink any more coffee again, only decaffeinated. Caffeine is not for you and that‚Äôs totally fine it‚Äôs the same for me. Hope you are feeling better. Say no next time and tell people you are very sensitive to caffeine if they give you weird looks just ignore it¬†\n\nExpensive coffee? Some of that, depending on specifics, can have incredibly high caffeine. My anxiety allows me half a cup of regular joe per day. Any more and I get anxiety and jitters.\n\nThis sounds like a nightmare out of a movie scene! How awful. And scarey. Coffee was probably the jet fuel type. Ug. So glad ur ok\n\nEasily\n\nI completely empathize with you because I have a caffeine intolerance. I have really cut back on caffeine due to acid reflux, panic attacks, and muscle tension.\nI usually can only handle one coffee a day and two if I'm really lucky. I have switched to having decaf on days when my anxiety is through the roof because I do love the taste of coffee.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYikes!!!!\n\nI can‚Äôt drink coffee anymore, I throw it up after about 10-15mins. My body can no longer handle it. The caffeine never did anything for me anyway, just jittery and anxious. Now I just stick to tea ü´ñ\n\nCaffeine is a bitch. My heart absolutely hates it now, had to switch to decaf except when I'm cheating with McDonald's $1 iced coffees üòÇ I keep Taurine around now for caffeine because it curbs the side effects significantly\n\nObesity was the real issue here mate, address that you can do it !\n\ni used to drink coffee constantly but its become a source of anxiety and I've started drinking green tea instead in the morning, I've found it has just enough caffeine to get me started but not enough to trigger anxiety\n\nI haven‚Äôt consumed caffeine or alcohol in almost 15 years. Both will cause anxiety among other health issues, both acute and chronic. Just not worth it! \n\nDon‚Äôt listen to those saying it wasn‚Äôt the coffee. 3 cups is nearly 300mg of caffeine which is equal to a little less than 4 Redbull energy drinks. It was absolutely the coffee.\n\nI remember I had one cup, but might have made it super concentrated. Downed it in 15 minutes - a brutal panic attack‚Ä¶ my chest hurt the rest of the day and I was a little shaky.\n\nI drink coffee every day - usually espresso or lattes. Didn‚Äôt know this one cup of joe would send me! It‚Äôs the worst you feel like you‚Äôre dying üò≠\n\n9 hours is a long time! I hope you‚Äôre ok now.\n\n3 cups in such short time is risky but i think it is more that you got into a cycle where your reflux went crazy and boy does stomach give you all the symptoms of a heart attack.\n\nYou were already tense-stressed and chugged coffee which put you in a spiral likely‚Ä¶\n\nAnd combo with a benzo?\n\nI ended up in the ER and was hospitalized after having Celsius and a coffee a day for 2 weeks or so my body couldn‚Äôt hand it anymore I guess I work a desk job and all of a sudden my heart started beating like a fucking car engine absolutely horrible no more caffeine for me and I feel great without it even though some mornings are really hard to get up for work. Mint and peppermint tea help wake up nowadays naturally caffeine free!\n\n3 effing cups of coffee AND a 3 hour job interview.\n\nI'm shocked your weren't having a heart attack\n\nI‚Äôve noticed caffeine sensitivity for a while now and although I am more of a tea drinker than a coffee drinker, I have to either have a small cup of regular coffee or do 1/2 caff. or decaf. Plus a lot of coffees upset my stomach with heartburn or trigger my IBS-D. \n\nMy guess is your anxiety level raised already with the interview, plus not feeling well with the heartburn sent you into feeling panicky. I‚Äôve noticed sometimes with acid issues I can get or another lain like a headache ir sinus pressure will start to make me feel panicky. I am supposed to have sinus surgery soon because I get a lot of sinus infections and headaches, I plan on telling them that sometimes before surgeries I can feel panicky just from knowing I am going to be put out. It makes me feel like I am going to die or something.\n\nDid you get the job?\n\nI really can‚Äôt stop laughing. ü§£. Glad you‚Äôre ok. After a strong morning Joe, I have a conversation at the office and I feel like I‚Äôm about to lunge at my co worker.\n\nHe was trying to show out by acting like he was a coffee enthusiast and the coffee won ü§£\n\nI only had issues with coffee when I was vitamin deficient. Low tone made my heart palpitate. Now! I love it\n\nJust one cup gives me anxiety and shakiness , I have to be careful even drinking coke so I‚Äôve switched to decaf. 3 cups in a row is crazyy. Especially since caffeine is a literal drug used to treat heart problems.\n\nnever drink anything with caffeine when taking benzos. also don't do alcohol either, had the same chestburn as you for Christmas. ‚ò†Ô∏è\n\nYou might look into SIBO &amp;/ or roemheld syndrome.¬†\n\nI switched to decaf over a year ago. Now even a quarter cup of caffeine gives me heart palpitations and makes me edgy. I really miss the pep in the mornings! But I just don‚Äôt see ever being able to go back.¬†\n\nMaybe low comt\n\nI can't even drink half an energy drink without going into a panic attack üò≠\n\nEnergy drinks are coffee on crack bro\n\nIt is crazy to think about how easily accessible caffeine is lol it is straight up a DRUG. Last time I had a full cup of coffee I had anxiety so bad and my heart was beating so hard I could feel it beating in my back.\n\nCutting coffee is SO necessary to not get panic attacks.  No matter what test or thing u have NEVER go for coffee , I‚Äôve recently started green tea because coffee made my hands weak and tremor for a whole day almost .\n\nThere's nothing wrong with saying you're cutting down on coffee. If you want to abuse yourself to get a job, you don't need that job. That seems like toxic culture to me.\n\nO\n\nM\n\nCoffee sends me the same way"

    "all_comment_text": "No puking, but a lot of shitting. The GI tract is very sensitive. There are a lot of nerves involved. In my language it‚Äôs even called the ‚ÄúDarm-Hirn‚Äù (intestine-brain), because of how greatly it reacts to emotions.\n\nUrgh same here. As soon as I‚Äôm feeling a little anxious, BING! My stomach starts to trigger\n\nI study acting at university. The toilets before an exam or show get truly and utterly violated by every single one of us.\n\nI switched schools and cities the first time in elementary. Day one of school I had both ends involved. I‚Äôve always had a ‚Äúnervous stomach‚Äù and always say my stomach hates me.\n\nSo sieht's aus.\n\nSame bro\n\nDarm mit Charme!\n\nDamn what language do you speak\n\nGerman, where we have words for every strange occasion, such as shitting due to emotional damage üòÇ\n\nDamn I wish I spoke German that sounds pretty cool\n\nYes quite frequently. It‚Äôs a pretty common symptom of anxiety (GI issues in general). It‚Äôs exhausting because you just have to go on with your day after.\n\nyes. For me, it happened a lot in the morning when my cortisol was high &amp; there was a lot going on in my life.\n\nahh that makes so much sense! when in anxious periods I too have felt most nauseous in the mornings\n\nSame with me. It happens close to every morning.\n\nI've been under a lot of life stress lately and also recovering from a major surgery. I thought I was losing it because I wake up so anxious every single day. I've never woken you anxious like that for more than a day here and there and this has been months. I didn't know this was common.\n\nNever puked but I sometimes get the feeling of wanting to vomit, yet I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a weird sucky feeling. It doesn‚Äôt happen every time I get anxious but when it does, it‚Äôs frustrating\n\nWhen I get panic attacks I get to the point of puking. It‚Äôs led to me developing a fear of getting sick in public. This fear is now what triggers a lot of my panic attacks when I can‚Äôt leave a situation such as a class that lasts a couple hours or riding in the car with people that don‚Äôt know about my panic attacks. I‚Äôm on some pretty strong meds that sometimes help and have been in therapy for years\n\nI‚Äôm alright around close friends and family, but I no longer participate in a lot of activities that I‚Äôd like to. I‚Äôve opted out of vacations, concerts, job opportunities, and various other things over the years because of this. I hate myself for it but have still been trying to get out of my comfort zone and live a normal life. I hope one day I can get over this fear completely\n\nI struggle with this exact same situation, the fear of being sick in public stops me from going out most days, it‚Äôs so hard to overcome it.\n\nI have this aswell and it completely ruined my life. Even if I do go to events I constantly live with the fear of being sick, which makes it completely impossible of enjoying anything regardless of whether I puke or not.\n\nLiterally story of my life.\n\nI feel the exact same way, but specifically getting sick in a car. Best of luck to you.\n\nI have the same exact thing. Do you also get really bad stomach aches and diarrhea? Every panic attack I get both so it has made me too scared to go anywhere cuz it means I could either shit my pants or puke randomly.\n\nI used to have a pretty big fear of puking in public or in social situations too.\n\nI can't say it's 100% gone, but it is much better than it used to be. Some things that helped:\n\n1. I told my friends about my fear. They were pretty supportive. One of them also pukes when she's anxious, and another is very susceptible to food poisoning and consequently has several memories of puking in public. Learning this helped.\n2. The puking is probably more predictable than it feels like. Mine usually happens at the very peak of a panic attack, and if it's not at the peak it's at least deep into one. Once I realized this, I worried less about it happening in other situations.\n3. The puking is probably more controllable than it feels like when it happens. I used to worry a lot about puking in the middle of a crowded room, but it's actually been pretty uncommon that I couldn't get to a bathroom or a trash can. And again, once I realized this I worried less about the possibility of puking in public. (Though when I'm anxious, I do sometimes scan rooms for trash cans or routes to the bathroom just in case.)\n4. The puking is probably rarer than it feels like. I would say that over the past few years I've puked because of a panic attack roughly once every three months. But it's been way more common for me to worry that something will cause me to puke, and it's even been more common for me to worry that something will cause me to puke, try it, and it doesn't do anything. (I do endorse trying stuff that you are worried will make you puke, especially if you are alone at home.)\n5. The puking is probably not as bad as it feels like. Unlike a lot of the unpleasant parts of a panic attack, it's over very quickly. And I have had some cases where I was actually sick to let me compare sick nausea and sick vomiting to anxiety nausea and anxiety vomiting. Lemme tell you, when your body really does have a good reason to evacuate the contents of your stomach, it is much more committed to the effort than when you're vomiting because you're scared. Weirdly, those experiences made me worry about anxiety puking a lot less.\n6. After several years of experience of this fear, and lots of cases where I've puked because of a panic attack, the only two times I've puked anywhere near other people it was because I was sick for other reasons. (And one of those times it was because I specifically asked people to come over and keep me company.) Or in short, I have never puked in front of other people because of a panic attack. There's something my brain is doing unconsciously to cause me to puke that it just doesn't wanna do in front of other people. I even remember a situation where I went out with friends despite being pretty anxious for various reasons, and every time I went to the bathroom I dry heaved but was totally fine for 45-60 minute periods straight when around my friends. It was bizarre and kinda unsettling at the time, but it does make me feel less scared of puking in public.\n\nPuking was a huge pain in the ass for me while i was battling constant anxiety. Lost bunch of weight as well\n\nYes I get nauseous and puke when I am forced to be around large groups of people, like when I tried to start college or sometimes when I go to work and there are a lot of people that day.\nFor me, I get extremely overwhelmed and i cant think. It's like my adhd makes it so I'm paying attention to everyone else too much and i end up over processing information involuntarily. I may also be traumatized by \"group behavior\" psychology in general. People behave much differently around groups compared to when they are alone or 1 on 1.\n\nI do frequently. Usually because of work stress. Sometimes during panic attacks.\n\nI always think I‚Äôm going to puke and feel extremely nauseous but I never actually puke. And I‚Äôll take that as a win tbh\n\nI would throw up weekly almost during my first year of college. My stress and anxiety was so bad that I would throw up every night and feel nauseous all the time\n\nNo, but I‚Äôm constantly nauseous and get diarrhea. üò¨\n\nYes it happens a lot with me. Especially in situations where I get really really nervous. I was an anxious kid (still is) and I get a gag reflex almost everyday in kindergarten and early elementary. It's way controlled now that I'm an adult but I still can't seem to fully eradicate it in my life.\n\nI used to wake up before work and just vomit nonstop until I had nothing left; finally figured out it was anxiety and got on meds. Definitely helped at the time.\n\nThis was me for 3 months straight where I had to go out on medical leave.  What meds helped you with the anxiety/puking?\n\nMy Dr prescribed me Celexa at the time. It worked well for a while then I switched to Prozac or Zoloft during pregnancy as it was safer; can‚Äôt remember which. \n\nI tried to go back on Celexa and it caused issues with my private flora, but my life circumstances are much better than back then, so now I‚Äôm off medication.\n\nYes. And I get nauseous frequently. What makes it even more fun is I have emetephobia, so it's a big cycle that repeats itself. I get anxious, so I get nauseous, so I get more anxious, then more nauseous. The times I have vomited from it is when I have to leave the house and be with family or people that I don't like. Something so simple yet causes me to yak. When I had a job I would frequently get sick before leaving for my shift too.\n\nYes. When I get extremely anxious, I occasionally get explosive expulsions from the rear, too. It‚Äôs horrific, sometimes.\n\nI sometimes puke a little bit of stomach stuff ( Hardly anything) in the mornings when im really anxious. A couple years ago I had gone through some weird life changes that caused me to puke in that small way, but every time I did I felt as if it was my anxiety letting it self out my body. Recently I went through a tough time and it happened for a few days and scared the shit out of me until I realized it was just a moment in time and it goes away on its own. I had to learn how to calm my self down better.\n\nI used to ALWAYS have stomach aches over anxiety literally almost every morning. A few times I did throw up from anxiety but after I got on zoloft it all went away!\n\nNot puke, but when my anxiety is high it can sometimes make me need to go number 2 or pee a lot, both of which suck and very annoying.\n\nI had this issue for a few weeks, if I wasn‚Äôt physically sick I was dry heaving, lost a lot of weight\n\nI've dry heaved a few times in really bad moments. I also frequently get nauseous when I'm anxious.\n\nAll the time. I wake up and dry heave.\n\nWhen I‚Äôm not medicated yes I often puke from being anxious. This past week I had an episode where I almost puked. Also have bowel issues when anxirty\n\npuking and shitting it‚Äôs was awful the first time before i met my long distance bf i was puking for HOURS and the second i saw him all the anxiety faded away and i stop feeling so sick\n\nI‚Äôm dealing with this now. I have been puking everyday for a week because of my anxiety. Wish I knew how to help :(\n\nUsed to do it before I went to school as a kid, now I just dissociate\n\nConstantly. Before every test, job interview, date, hang out or confrontation. \n\nI want to puke every time I have to use a stop sign when there is multiple people waiting in line.\n\nLiterally all the time‚Ä¶daily, sometimes even multiple times a day. Zofran is my best friend.\n\nI‚Äôve been ‚Äúlucky‚Äù and only puked once due to anxiety. \n\nTypically, mine is extreme nausea that turns into diarrhea or ‚Äúbutt vomiting‚Äù as I like to call it. \n\nLiterally as-if my GI tract got flipped upside down. Same force, different orifice.\n\nNausea? Yes. Actually throwing up because of it? No. Vomiting is a sensory nightmare for me so I go out of my way to avoid it as much as possible, even when it would likely make me feel a lot better after it‚Äôs done.\n\nwhen i started getting panic attacks they made me puke, but im good now. took a long time to rewire my system.\n\nNo but I did feel like I was having a heart attack, had to go to the hospital for them to tell me I was having an anxiety attack.\n\nBoth pooping and puking. But the anxiety shits were worse\n\nI‚Äôve recently been puking due to withdrawal from my meds that I‚Äôve been tapering from. It‚Äôs the weirdest kind of nausea. It starts in the throat and then works its way down\n\nI have only puked from anxiety twice. I have a extreme fear of puking and after my sister got the stomach bug, I freaked out so much that I puked as well. Though only once. Which proved I definitely wasn‚Äôt sick like her (she kept running all night).\nThe other time was when my sister once again puked, this time only once and I had no idea. I was completely fine and ate my breakfast. Then my mom mentioned how my sister got sick and puked once in the night. Once again, I freaked out and after a while I puked as well.\n\nyeah. i also have \"episodes\" where i'm unable to stop puking for hours on end.\n\nQuite a few times. It hasn‚Äôt happened in a while but back when I used to work in fast food (which was a nightmare for me as a socially anxious person), I would often throw up in the morning if I was scheduled for a morning shift. Something about anxiety mixed with having just woke up just sent me straight to nausea. My lowest moment with this was when I drove all the way to work fighting off the nausea, and then ended up throwing up in the parking lot right next to my car. I just pretended it didn‚Äôt happened and walked in for my shift. Anxiety is wild.\n\nNo, but I gag and nauseous a lot\n\nYup, and like many people said it‚Äôs very common. From what I understand it‚Äôs because anxiety kicks in our fight or flight adrenaline. So your brain is telling you to either burn food into nutrients, or turn it into waste rather rapidly. And the quickest way to achieve that is either vomit or diarrhea. Todays gross fun fact.\n\nIt‚Äôs mostly the stress caused by the anxiety but yes and it‚Äôs awful. \nAnything that makes me dwell on something and when I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it, I‚Äôll just randomly get unbearably nauseous and throw up until everything is out for the day. \n\nIt‚Äôs so easy to tell the difference between health related nausea vs anxiety related nausea too because the nervous nausea (as I like to call it) LITERALLY just happens out of nowhere. Sick or not, empty/full belly doesn‚Äôt matter.\n\nI started hyperventilating and couldn't breathe and almost threw up from that. It was a bad panic attack.\n\nNot very often, but I have. I thought I was having a heart attack\n\nOccasionally, but I personally pass out occasionally instead. I‚Äôve had to get a shower chair bc I was experiencing it a lot in the shower. Had a million cardiac/test all came out fine, ruled it anxiety (like I figured from the beginning).\n\nYes especially mornings\n\nIts happens when Im about to do public speaking and its sooooo embarrassing. Like that one pitch perfect scene\n\nNot often, but it has happened. Usually when I am already gastrointestinally compromised for some reason. For example, I once donated plasma without eating beforehand, and then went into a very stressful situation, meeting up with a person I was having problems with in a not-so-neutral location. The first thing I did when I arrived was run to the bathroom to puke. \n\nNow, I have donated plasma on an empty stomach before and felt a little queasy afterwards, but I haven't puked. I have met up with the same person in the same place and had anxiety without puking. But the combination was clearly lethal.\n\nYes, the day me and my husband decided on divorce. Emotions were high, anxiety was higher I‚Äôd been crying for hours and eventually threw up\n\nYuuup\n\nI puked on the first day of a new school when I was a kid.\n\nI've gotten close enough that I get it.\n\nThe most common scenario I hear about is people with intense stage fright.\n\nyup\n\nNo, but it has happened out the other end several times from anxiety and stress. Not sure which is worse, lol. Hang in there!\n\nYes unfortunately anxiety can really tear your stomach up which makes the whole situation worse.\n\nI puked a lot, now it happens very rarely. But in the past, i was not able to control it. Ive taken xanax and a lot of therapy and it got better :)\n\nYes. I went to the club with friends yesterday for one of their birthdays and I was going to puke. The lights, the loud music, and a room packed full of people was a recipe for me to have a panic attack/throw up.\n\nYes, but very rarely. It is a fairly common symptom for some people\n\nyes, i used to puke in the same situation as a teenager or felt like i'm about to throw up before going to a work that i didn't enjoy. i'm not on meds anymore but i got slightly better and it hasn't happened recently, it's only the frequent need of using the bathroom now.\n\nI threw up once when I had like 3 different meetings in one day, on 5 hours of sleep and almost no food, while having strong PMS. At the end of that day my crush invited me to watch a movie, he gave me some noodles and I could barely eat them, as I was so nervous around him back then &amp; my anxiety peaked there. I went home like 30 minutes after I arrived at his place, and threw up his noodles lol... It was a mixture of high exhaustion, stress from that day and having my usual anxiety around people I really like, and it was almost standard that I had pretty strong nausea around him especially.\n\nI was really hoping that vomiting wouldn't start to be the usual answer to my anxiety, thankfully it didn't, though soon I'm in my new job and I hope for the love of god that my anxiety won't get so strong anymore that I have to throw up again... \n\nMy therapist said \"Even if you're gonna puke, it's okay. The world wouldn't end there and people will forget about it. And even if they don't, that shouldn't be your concern.\" This helped me a lot because then I feel like I won't be so afraid about it anymore, and the anxiety wouldn't be as much. I hope this can help you too maybe!! :)\n\nNo but recently I had a feeling that I would puke. Happened on couple occations when I got really anxious. Didn't actually puke though\n\nHappened the other weekend driving home from another town.\n\nYes I definitely have. During college I was so stressed in the morning I was getting sick. Two times on the train to school I actually threw up embarrassingly. Luckily the second time it happened I had a bag with me to puke into instead of on the train üòÖ\n\nWhat did you do after?? This is a big fear of mine that usually makes my anxiety worse and I think hearing someone go through it and be okay might help me. I hope you‚Äôre doing better now\n\nIt‚Äôs a thing. I tend to think that brain-stomach connections are the easiest to imagine/understand. \n\nI knew a guy who would start sweating and yawning non stop. Another guy started sneezing during a bout of anxiety. For me, those were like ‚Äúhow could anxiety do this?‚Äù\n\nI get insanely nauseous but I‚Äôve never vomited from anxiety alone\n\nNo but I got in a cycle of being nauseous because of the anxiety, not eating because I was nauseous, being nauseous because of not eating etc etc. Ate nearly anything for 2 weeks. Lost 7kg. That was really unhealthy.\n\nMy dad was very anxious during his divorce. He puked a lot :( he also lost an insane amount of weight\n\nYes :(\n\nI‚Äôve definitely felt like I was coming close to it because of anxiety. It wasn‚Äôt so much forcing myself into an anxious situation, but dealing with intrusive anxious thoughts. Not fun at all.\n\nNormally when my anxiety is so high I end up having a panic attack I get so worked up I can dry heave. I can‚Äôt remember if I ever actually vomited. It really sucks for me because one of my biggest fears in life is vomiting.\n\nA girl I liked cooked dinner for me once, after that she started flirting with me a bit, made me anxious, then I threw up the dinner on her shoes and myself and cried as she cleaned me\n\nYes.\n\nI have vomited many times in the past before going to work, while I was working as emergency room nurse\n\nIt only happened to me once, but my anxiety got really bad for it to get to that point. It hasn‚Äôt happened since but I‚Äôm afraid that my anxiety can reach that level again :/\n\nOnly once, but yes.\n\nYuuuuuuup\n\nYep. Hadn‚Äôt been this bad since I was a kid but I‚Äôm going through family drama and my husband‚Äôs narcissistic family hating me. It‚Äôs stressful and gives me so much anxiety that I‚Äôve been vomiting multiple times weekly. Super sucks.\n\nYep only once in my life tho\n\noften\n\nIndeed I have.\n\nEverytime. Stars with nausea and before I know I throw up everything and then it doesn‚Äôt stop until my anxiety calms down\n\nYes. I puked every day during my divorce.\n\nSo much so that I keep a prescription for zofran.\n\nI developed an entire eating disorder centralized on puking because of anxiety. So yes, definitely. Don‚Äôt fucking feed into that, the relief of puking is encouraging your brain to put you in the mindset of wanting to puke to purge and get that release. Beginning of a very terrible cycle.\n\nOh yeah‚Ä¶ to the point of being diagnosed with gastroparesis/cyclical vomiting syndrome. Funnily enough once I was an adult and moved far away from my main source of stress (my parents) I rarely if ever throw up anymore.\n\nAbsolutely.. it happens.\n\nWhen I moved overseas, I was so anxious I threw up in the airport parking lot. I've gotten nauseous from stress, but that was the only time I full on vomited from stress and anxiety.\n\nIt nearly happened. But I hold back and most of the time I burped when I was in a slightly relaxed state.\n\nI bumped into an ex who cheated on me, he was with her, and I froze in place as they stood behind me in a line. Then they left. I puked about 10min later from the residual panic. That‚Äôs the only time that ever happened.\n\nIt usually comes out the other end for me. But I have puked before in situations that hit me more suddenly\n\nOnce or twice when my anxiety first started in school aswell\n\nYes.  So much.\n\nI‚Äôve recently been puking due to withdrawal from my meds that I‚Äôve been tapering from. It‚Äôs the weirdest kind of nausea. It starts in the throat and then works its way down\n\nOnce, but man is the nausea unreal!\n\nWhen I was at my most anxious (college graduation, job hunt, plus a stomach bug) I would dry heave first hung in the morning every day. Even nowadays with a lower dose anxiety medication if I have a big event like a job interview or breakup I‚Äôll likely end up dry heaving a few times prior to\n\nYeah I have puked from being anxious. Starting the school year was always something that made me extremely anxious, even if it was the same school. I once puked while walking to the bus stop on the first day. In highschool, I would sometimes feel the urge to puke in the morning and sometimes I actually would puke. I‚Äôve gotten much better since, but there will still be moments.\n\nYes I even had to get medicine that dissolves on my tongue that helped it because it was preventing me from going to school.\n\nYep, happened in school and it was a presentation and for two day I'd puke the night before now it's mainly shitting it's like whenever I'm super anxious I have to use the bathroom.\n\nYup. The day I had to go to court to make a restraining order permanent. I did not know if my abuser would even show, my attorney said they usually don't. I almost could not go\n\nGetting ready, I got so sick, heart racing, dripping sweat, I had to lay down a few times to calm down. \n\nHad to pull over once and throw up on my way to the courthouse , and again in the parking lot. \n\nHe showed up. I had to run into the bathroom and be sick again. I could not drive home after court, No one went with me because no one thought he would show up, and that since he was out of the house, I must be OK. I wasn't OK. \n\nThis has happened before, but I never actually threw up, this time though., there was no stopping it.\n\nYes but only twice in my life and I am 32. Once when an ex broke up with me and I was about to see him for the first time afterward and another when I felt a lump on my armpit that I was sure was cancer\n\nYes\n\nYeah I have thrown up, bad stomach is always a given anyway\n\nI very often fear being sick to the point I feel like I could be. I know that isn't what you asked but I just thought I'd say cause I think I haven't been sick cause of the coping mechanism I use - I find that dripping cold water on me helps weirdly. It's just grounding. It at least irradicates the anxiety I have about being sick which seems to be enough to stop the nausea and bring me out of a panic attack\n\nI've been damn close to it\n\nYeap, at my lowest point id throw up daily before going to work and on especially bad days at work too. Handy to have a toothbrush in your locker to ¬´¬†freshen up¬†¬ª after\n\nDuh\n\nHasn't happened in forever but I used to puke almost every night from being so anxious. SSRI's have been life savers üôå\n\nYes.\n\nNot puking, but diarrhea, passing out and a fall in blood pressure. Nice effect üëå\n\nAll the time. Well not really. But it‚Äôs common for me at the higher end of my anxiety\n\nThis was common for me as a child. I don‚Äôt experience it much now but I had an awful job once and I‚Äôd puke before going in almost every day. I do get nauseous and if I‚Äôm feeling anxious in the morning I tend to poop lol\n\nI throw up nearly every time I have a full blown panic attack. I never used to. I'm an emetophobe but it literally purges my system of adrenaline so I feel better almost immediately.\n\nYes, in the street.\n\nI have nervous/ stress vomiting but it‚Äôs mostly only at home. With the exception of when he first happened when I was a teen it‚Äôs never really in public.\n\nI have, multiple times. It can occasionally make me nauseous. Once it caused me to pass out.\n\nSevere anxiety gives me diarrhea, stomach ache, and I tend to start retching. So far I haven't actually thrown up though.\n\nwhen i still went to school i was throwing up every single day in the school bathrooms because of anxiety. tbh it doesnt matter HOW anxious i feel. anxiety = throwing up for me\n\nI‚Äôm a stress puker dude, it sucks. GI issues as a response to stress and anxiety. When I was a kid it was so much worse. It‚Äôs a lot more rare nowadays.\n\nall. The. Time. Since I was little üò©\n\nLMFAO Y E S---\n\nFor some reason I was terrified of boarding my flight and I ended up vomiting with how afraid I was. My anxiety eventually piped down a lil but it sucks because I was never afraid on flying airplanes before.\n\nYeahhhhhhh it is not fantastic. Idk what evolution was thinking.\n\nI have :(\n\nYes.  All the time.  If I get super anxious my GI tract is what reacts.  I have anxiety, not on medication but usually have it under control with therapy and mindfulness.  But sometimes it gets the best of me and I start to worry and catastrophize about stuff and it has gotten to the point a couple of times where I start vomiting from the stress.\n\nWe all react differently to anxiety and stress, and unfortunately for me it‚Äôs GI stuff.\n\nI puke 3-4/7 days of the week. Every time it‚Äôs in the morning. I feel much better after the puke, but it‚Äôs really messing up my throat.\n\nYes a lot of time then was diagnosed with an ED due to the massive amount of weight I dropped. So now anytime I have that feeling it‚Äôs dread and even more anxiety\n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever puked but I do get nauseous because of anxiety which is only made worse by emetophobia\n\nI go to the restroom to cool down, so that doesn't happen to me.\n\nAll the time! I felt so stressed and anxious that I threw up at my high school graduation (luckily after I had walked)\n\n100%  I throw up due to anxiety\n\nYes, when It was a bad a lot of dry heaving especially in the mornings. When I was in management I was in stressful situations that made me puke, I wasn‚Äôt eating much because of the anxiety at the time and practically puked water. Fun times\n\nPuking and shitting.  It‚Äôs great\n\npersonally, no! but i‚Äôve been close to it many, many times lol\n\nOnly once when I was in a CT scan. They have to pump u quickly with dye intravenously and it started making me feel a little different which my health anxiety doesnt like and i started panicking and dry heaving during the scan.\n\nA lot of times I have nausea that I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs connected to a lot of stomach issues I have or if it‚Äôs compounded by the anxiety I have, I do find that there is certain things like the fear of vomiting that gets to me a lot and if I have something that doesn‚Äôt agree with me, I get anxiety about my anxiety, which is usually anxiety about throwing up, which is why talking to my G.I. specialist about this? I‚Äôve been able to get Zofran or the generic of it which is called ondansetron, which usually helps to prevent not just motion sickness, but also ability to limit vomiting and occurrences of nausea, which usually is a precursor to having to throw up. I also find talking about it is a good way to mention it not just to your doctors but the other people because just like having an anxiety or having stomach issues/IBS, which for me occur right before I need to go out, the more you can address certain things the more you can take controls so that they don‚Äôt control you. I find drinking a lot of water a lot of broth. A lot of hydration in between meditation techniques certainly helps one to also getting better.\n\nOh absolutely. Lol but I have serious PTSD/anxiety/panic disorder. So‚Ä¶ it wrecks my whole body. Not just my stomach.\n\nI‚Äôve gotten close, but I‚Äôve gotten GI issues more often\n\nit‚Äôs one of my first major symptoms. gagging and then straight up puking\n\nYes, especially in the morning. \nIt happened a lot more in my youth and that was my main physical symptom. \n\nNow as an adult I am more prone to GI upset\n\nwhen my ex would hangout/get really close to this one girl, i use to have panic attacks and throw up anything i ate for a few days. that‚Äôs when i called it quits in that relationship‚Ä¶ although situational (that‚Äôs when my anxiety would be the worse), i still struggle sometimes on a daily basis but am thankfully not feeling any of that terrible anxiety any longer. it gets better, guys. even if it‚Äôs not always situational‚Ä¶ keep working on helping yourself and your symptoms. keep up the hope ü´∂üèª\n\nA panic attack caused a vomiting episode that lasted hours for me. I had never experienced that before. It was terrifying. I now have anti nausea medication for this if I need it. Good luck!\n\nUsed to get nauseous with anxiety before every first date from apps. Moral of the story - I don‚Äôt do well meeting strangers on first dates. The anxiety makes me crazy.\n\nOh my goddd yes I used to puke a lot, like way more than I normally would because of anxiety.\n\nYes when I was younger I developed really bad anxiety so much so I would throw up. Especially when leaving the house or meeting new people. The worst symptom of anxiety ever. It eventually stopped and meds helped\n\nwhen i was first diagnosed with anxiety it was so bad i wouldn‚Äôt eat cuz i was scared id throw up with how much i was throwing up at the time\n\nYes. It‚Äôs horrible because I‚Äôm shaking at the same time. And my stomach is usually empty too.\n\nDry heaving over the sink in the morning was the norm for me for yeaaars\n\nYes, I've chundered due to anxiety. It sucks.\n\nI have, but I'm more likely to have the shits first. I get anxiety gas so easily, it's not even funny.\n\nMy boyfriend has anxiety and has puked once. I have panic attacks to the point I can‚Äôt stop shaking and can barely function and I‚Äôve never thrown up from it. I think it‚Äôs completely different for everyone\n\ni have really bad health anxiety. And there would be times where I would wake up so anxious/nauseous that I would gag and then puke. it sucks but it doesnt happen that often, just on some of the worse days.\n\nPuking or shitting. My anxiety connected stomach is my least favorite body part.¬†\n\nId say from stress but it‚Äôs hard to tell the difference. I was vomiting all morning the day of my mom‚Äôs funeral and was barely able to go. I had a stressful relationship with a woman and was often feeling sick to my stomach. Etc.\n\nDefinitely get nauseous. Pepto chews are my best friend\n\nYes, when interviewing for a job I want.\n\nAnxiety. Ugh, it's effects on my GI tract have been the bane of my existence since as long as I can remember. In first grade it was birth of social anxiety (I have only recognized this reason since I started therapy in my last 20s.) and my parents claimed I was just lactose intolerant because I would go to the office cuz I didn't feel good just an hour after school started. Lactose intolerance was claimed because I had milk w my cereal just a couple hours prior. Anyway. I'm still not well. I got I'll before piano recitals, soccer games, all the stuff a kid could be anxious over in middle class early 90s US. It never got better, tbh.\n\nif i have a bad enough panic attack yes i almost always throw up when it gets that bad. but most times i just have an upset stomach.\n\nI once had a casual lunch \"date\" with someone I had a crush on. In prep, I was nervous and - for some reason - I drank a ton of water. During lunch, I threw up all over my date. She was cool about it and we stayed friends and laughed about it. Needless to say, any date after that, I knew it couldn't go as bad as that, so I guess I failed forward :)\n\nnot only did I puke.. It was so fast, it was all over my bed. zero time to react. only happened when I lived with my father for a while after college.\n\nMy anxiety was so bad my freshman year of college I threw up basically every time I ate, I could only keep down dinner if anything. I ended up around 120lbs before I got on anti anxieties (I'm 5'11 so that was pretty underweight).\n\nAlmost every day. Its my most hated symptom\n\nI shit a lot. I cant take an exam without taking a shit like 3 times\n\nI throw up all the time from anxiety. I wake up and am super nauseous‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs usually how my anxiety starts.\n\nYup. Was dry heaving or vomiting when I got through episodes usually from life events but was in a constant state of panic for too long and it led to me having anxiety induced vomiting.\n\nYes. This is pretty much a daily occurrence in the morning when I wake up early and have to get ready for the day. I‚Äôve just gotten used to it.\n\nI vomited when my first bf and I were breaking up\n\nevery single morning since 2017...I'm on meds for it now but they don't always work. haven't been able to hold a job because of it...\n\nUnfortunately I have quite a bit during periods I‚Äôve been more anxious it‚Äôs definitely been worse and more frequent :(\n\nYes. I had some work friends who used to throw parties at another's house. I typically love being social, but ironically get severe social anxiety where I can barely talk. On multiple occasions we'd start pouring shots and before we even started drinking I'd just run to the bathroom and vomit due to all the anxiety I was feeling. Normally I can take a few shots afterward and I become a social butterfly\n\nI‚Äôve never actually puked because of it but anxiety has made me extremely nauseous to where I thought I must be sick or pregnant bc it‚Äôs so intense\n\nOne of my customer service jobs made me SO anxious (especially because my boss was a huge dick). I found myself extremely nauseous and puking all the time.\nI had to take anti-anixety meds almost every time like clock work to just push through my shift and even then, I would sometimes find myself in the bathroom gagging.\n\nThere was a time where I was nauseous after everything I ate and couldn‚Äôt keep anything down. Therefore I didn‚Äôt eat at all for a week. Had to go to urgent care.\n\nYup. I used to throw up every time I saw my ex because I was afraid of him.\n\nYeh, or if I cry too much and am too upset I end up puking\n\nIf there is a stomach and ick feeling to be had I‚Äôve had them all. It‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm anxious and now need to worry about not pooping my pants.\n\nYes. Many times. And the ‚Äúanxious situation‚Äù was just high school"

I told the nurse I felt shaky inside and she didn‚Äôt know what to do lmao\n\nThe internal vibrations is so tough. The tingling takes forever to leave my hands üò≠\n\nOmgggg yes this happens to me! I‚Äôve always kind of described it as that feeling of your teeth uncontrollably chattering‚Ä¶ but in my stomach lol\n\nYes but I also have POTS.\n\nSame. Used to last about 5 seconds and would wake me from my sleep\n\nI've had so many odd symptoms but the one that makes me feel so strange is when you feel like the room is spinning around you or that sensation of dropping. You literally feel like your body is dropping from heights.\n\nThis is most accurate shit ive ever seen, the dropping feeling is SCARYYYY bro and room spinning actually sometimes I think im losing my shit slowly.\n\nIs this an anxiety thing?! I‚Äôve had feelings like the world is spinning or my brain is spinning and could never explain it well enough to someone else. I went down a rabbit hole once of trying to goggle it but that did not help\n\nThat was an SSRI thing for me.  When I stopped taking it, the vertigo spiked for a couple weeks then I haven't experienced it since.\n\nThat is the worst. It‚Äôs been happening a lot to me at work.\n\nYes! I feel like I‚Äôm walking on a boat or something\n\nI just experienced this today, so incredibly jarring!\n\nI hate this feeling, makes me feel like when they do the dolly zoom in movies\n\nFeeling like I wanted to jump out of my skin at every unexpected loud noise.  I just figured I was sensitive to loud noises.\n\nHaving difficult conversations with manager or co-worker.  Hey, they're difficult conversations, so that's it, not anxiety.\n\nFeeling very uncomfortable in a new situation where I'm supposed to be in charge.  It's just because I don't know what I'm supposed to do and I lack self-confidence.  It's not anxiety.\n\nShit i feel u, i have same thing but also i get really easily scared of random stuff.\n\nI'm so jumpy I always look dodgy!\n\nI have the loud noise thing too, but it ONLY effects my tongue! If a loud noise scares me it feels like my tongue swells up to 10 times it's size and it feels like it gets zapped, but that weird feeling only lasts like half a second at most. It's so weird.\n\nSelf-isolation. I've likely had social anxiety for most of my life, but since it doesn't impact me in *all* social situation I never put it together. Within three sessions my therapist had me clocked. Now I finally understand that my self-isolationist tendencies are a type of avoidance which of course makes a ton of sense.\n\nI‚Äôve developed agoraphobia and monophobia since Covid. I live in isolation most of the time. Life has not turned out the way I imagined.\n\nYou can reverse it or ‚Äúheal‚Äù your anxiety about going places. My oldest developed a fear of leaving the house and then it became a fear of not leaving the city. With a trusted friend of hers she was able to go further away from home and her city over time. It‚Äôs basically ‚Äòexposure therapy‚Äô. You do a little each time to break your developed anxieties. Don‚Äôt be hard on yourself if it doesn‚Äôt work as fast as you‚Äôd like. I wish you all the best.\n\nDigestive issues like morning diarrhea\n\nAhh, what I like to call ‚Äúnervous poops‚Äù\n\nI thought it was just me. I can be fine but when the anxiety suddenly hits I need to find a bathroom quick.\n\nbeing in this situation and reading this really made me laugh thanks man\n\nNot even just the morning if things are bad enough\n\nEvery weekday for me. Never on weekend mornings. Has anyone found a way to prevent this?\n\nmake every day a weekend\n\nI've been researching mental health and it's relation to gut health, it might be beneficial to take a probiotic\n\nI had also for a while, not better\n\nMy latest one is this creepy sensation of not being \"real\". I don't know how else to explain it. Yesterday I just had this feeling like I was walking in a dream or reality wasn't really reality. I feel better today, but man it was such a weird and disturbing feeling. Felt like I was finally loosing my mind. I've been under immense stress so that's likely the cause, but idk man. It messes with your head. I don't like it and hope it goes away.¬†\n\nDerealization really is the worst. It‚Äôs definitely my least favorite and scary symptom of anxiety/panic. It makes the anxiety that much worse because it gives me a sense of loosing control, and touch with reality. Like I‚Äôm tripping but without the good parts lol\n\nIt's the worst. It definitely feels like I'm loosing control and it will never end. I feel better today but it was *freaky*, and I wasn't sure what triggered it or how to stop it. It's so easy to panic and think you'll just be like this forever. Ugh it's so CREEPY! Everything just \"doesn't feel right\" like you've stepped into a reality you don't belong in. I hate ittttttt.¬†\n\nYup, and from what I‚Äôve read the only real way to make it go away is to just accept it and not let it bother you but that seems impossible. How are you supposed to just ‚Äúaccept‚Äù the sensation of living in a dream world lmao\n\nI can assure you it does get better. I used to have derealization pretty constantly for a year or so and over the last 7/8 years it only happens when I have really bad panic attacks. Just have to accept that it is harmless and eventually it will slowly wane away. Much love to you.\n\nHow did you make your derealization go away? I‚Äôve had it pretty severely for 4 years straight now (with very few moments of relief) and I‚Äôm losing hope. I know not to be afraid of it anymore and I‚Äôm mostly used to it by now, but I dread the possibility of living like this forever\n\n[deleted]\n\nAh, so that's what it is. It definitely feels like some weird \"safety mode\" my brain switches to when it's really stressed. I hate it. It's hard to even articulate I just hate feeling like my head is being messed with. Sorry you're going through it too. :( hopefully we can both get better¬†\n\nIndecisiveness. Frustrating, painful indecisiveness.\n\nIt's not just having a hard time making a decision. It's not being able to, feeling physical pain just wasting time weighing pros and cons for what feels like eternity.\n\nNo decision is good enough... Everytime I feel like I made a decision, I change my mind, it never stops. It's so frustrating\n\nI feel you on this, when I get more anxious my ability to make decisions like plumets. It feels like I am locked in place and cant move\n\noh my god the decision making drives me insane. I stayed in an unhappy relationship for 5 years because of this. I kept overthinking what to do even though deep down i knew what the right choice wad\n\nI‚Äôve had to manually train myself to stop doing this and go with the thing that I first thought of\n\nSometimes I get \"unstuck\" doing this! Or going with what I find more fun, despite the cons. I try to remind myself of what my therapist tells me about anxiety. The only way out is through: the only way to decrease anxiety is doing what makes me anxious, and realizing that the thing I'm scared of doesn't happen, or if it happens, it's not as bad as I think and it's easier to fix.\n\nI might try this\n\nTotally relatable, you worded that perfectly. The 'solution' that I encountered is just go for one option, the first that you thought or even randomly (only take this advise for everyday choices, not big ones). Your mind will tell you to do the other thing in fear of not being the perfect decision and you have to tell yourself: and? What is the problem of not being the best solution, at least I'm doing something and not stuck, which is worse. Takes practice, but as soon you realize that inaction due to indecisiveness is harmful, it becomes easier.\n\nChest pain. The first time. I thought I was having a heart attack. It was so painful. Got checked out, nothing's wrong (apart from an old issue). I still get chest pains sometimes, but now I know their reason stay calm.\n\nThis is mine. Just always saying \"this is your stress and anxiety..you're not having a heart attack\"\n\nThen my brain goes, but what is THIS time it is\n\nThis sounds extremely familiar too, but I do also have OCD so that doesn‚Äôt help.\n\nAbsolutely. I went to the ER on two different occasions because I thought I was having a heart attack. It‚Äôs terrifying!\n\nOmg thank you for saying this! I regularly get unbearable chest pain and find it difficult to breathe through the pain or move even a little bit. \n\nGot all sorts of checks and nothing. Everything is fine physically. And I just couldn‚Äôt figure out why it‚Äôs happening!\n\nBreathlessness. The kind where it feels like someone is literally smothering you. It was fucking terrifying to know that there‚Äôs air around me but it just won‚Äôt go into my lungs and no matter how much I ‚Äúbreathed in‚Äù, it wasn‚Äôt enough, and I started to black out. Ended up in the emergency room that day.\n\nHow did they ‚Äúcure‚Äù you? Not like cure (I wish anxiety had a cure) but help breathlessness, or symptoms similar to that (what was the result?)\n\nSo at that time, I didn‚Äôt actually realise it was anxiety. My city has extremely bad AQI during the winter, so I actually thought my breathlessness had something to do with the toxic air. I was extremely stressed at work, ended up going to the ER because I stopped breathing. The doctors were dealing with emergency surgeries, so nobody _really_ looked at me initially. But then I kept asking for the doctor, and she finally came to me. Asked me about my symptoms. Her questions were pretty simple- when did I start feeling this way, what did I do (I‚Äôm a lawyer), how had work been lately, etc. They checked my blood pressure, oxygen levels, etc. Everything was normal. I just felt like my body was gaslighting me, and I started crying when I started describing everything to her. They were understanding, if a little detached.\n\nThey actually had patients who required surgeries and urgent care in there. So they gave me some anti-anxiety medication, gave me an IV drip and fed me soup and sandwiches. They had purifiers going and it helped soothe my fears about the toxic air. I then got a text from my then boyfriend, and he figured out something was wrong, although I didn‚Äôt exactly tell him what had happened. So he kept calling me until I picked up. Started crying while talking to him again, and he stayed with me on call for about an hour until I had calmed down.\nAfter that my dad called me and also figured out that I wasn‚Äôt well, and stayed with me on call for some time after that. I booked an emergency session with my therapist for that night, and she also prescribed me medication for future use. \n\nMy workplace was extremely toxic, so I hadn‚Äôt really been talking to anybody or even eating properly because of my insane work hours. I suppose the medication, IV and having people who cared about me actually speak to me, and then my therapist being there for me helped me out mentally and physically.\n\ni‚Äôd suggest a short yogic breathing exercise video like Yoga With Adriene on YouTube for moments like these\n\noh man, that‚Äôs me. the breathlessness sent me to the hospital a couple of times - i just couldn‚Äôt calm down. The Drs didn‚Äôt help, but one particular wonderful, beautiful nurse told me to get on YouTube and look for breathing exercises and to use them right at the moment the breathlessness starts. Thank God for nurses like her üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI'm feelin like this right now not as bad but damn\n\nEverytime I would get home from work I would be freezing like putting 3 blankets on and a heater when it was the middle of summer. After I got medication for my anxiety it has stopped.\n\nI get freezing too. My hands get so cold!\n\nThe anxiety response in the body pulls blood flow from the extremities to the inner body\n\nPins and needles is arms and hands.\n\nIn my face. All day every day...behind the eye sockets. So tired of this feeling.\n\nAlways having the feeling in your chest that your lungs are getting no oxygen, and always having to heavy breathe. And the chest heaviness that feels like concrete is on your left chest \n.\n\nYep during my worst years of anxiety I was genuinely wondering if I had athsma because I would just be laying down and it would feel like I had sand bags laying on my chest, it was so tight. No pain for me just an intense pressure. \n\nI could breathe but the sensation just stayed no matter what I did. I couldn't relax no matter how much I wanted to. Like wearing a corset that was 2 sizes too small 24/7.\n\nI get this, and I also have asthma, so it's nearly impossible to tell what is asthma and what is anxiety. I know they trigger each other though, so I feel this way all the time.\n\nThis feels dumb compared to everyone elses' answers but, never using the bathroom when hanging out with other people. Ive literally slept over at a friend's place and theyve said \"wtf how have you not had to pee in 30 hours\". I am so disconnected from my body when masking around others that i dont realize until I'm alone that i had to pee / eat / etc.\n\nMines the opposite i find i have to pee like every 30mins to an hour if im really stressed. Unless certain people are around then i have paruresis.\n\nThis, putting so much emphasis on getting through the day that I completely forget about my body and it's in shambles every time\n\nThough sadly it doesn't extend to the peeing part, cause I have to every 30min when I'm out. Winters are much worse in that regard\n\nA globus? Or whatever they‚Äôre called where it feels like you have something stuck in your throat. I swore I had a tumor\n\nNot feeling right like my body just isn‚Äôt able to work as efficient as everyone also.\nNever feeling 100% well.\n\nTinnitus.\n\nThis makes so much sense.\n\nMine is usually at a 4. With anxiety it's definitely all the way up.\n\nBack pain.  Whenever I am having a particularly bad time of it the big muscles on either side of my spine ache. I use a heating pad which helps but it's very uncomfortable.  After having any physical issues that might be causing it checked out with nothing apparently wrong, it seems (as my therapist put it) the anxiety just 'settles in my back'.  &gt;.&lt;\n\nMy whole body aches. Not even just my back but everything hurts. It's been a roller-coaster since I've had my first ever panic attack. Oh my days...üòî\n\ni feel really hot\n\nYes! I feel like it rolls off my skin in waves of heat.\n\nAccording to my doctor, my memory loss¬†\n\nClenching my jaw.\n\nThis is the worst. Currently suffering from sore jaw, neck and constant head pressure due to clenching my jaw during bed.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry you deal with this too! I do it all day and likely all night. I‚Äôll catch myself (or hear my teeth grinding‚Ä¶yikes). I can‚Äôt remember what it feels like to have no headache. It‚Äôs a constant ache.\n\nI have spent hours on the internet looking for relief from this. It got so bad, it was more like gnashing my teeth. I considered botox, hypnotism, or acupuncture. The only recent medication change was increasing my burpirone dosage from 30 mgs daily to 45 mgs daily, so I started there. \n\nI found a ton of studies linking SSRIs with bruxism (teeth grinding). And do you know what they prescribe for relief? Buspirone. This led me down the rabbit hole, and I discovered a term called \"paradoxical reaction.\" It's when a medication has the opposite effect on you. I cut my dosage back down to 30 and the relief was amazing. I still have to keep reminding myself to un-clench and sleep with a night guard, but it's so much better.\n\nI have an appointment with my provider tomorrow. I'm looking forward to the conversation about this.\n\nAll. The. Time. I hate it, I always have neck pain and headaches. I thought they were from car accidents until I took Ativan one morning and I was so relaxed nothing hurt, apparently I‚Äôm just tense 24/7. So exhausting\n\nNausea, feeling dizzy but  being able to ‚Äúfunction‚Äù properly, intense headaches, partesthesias‚Ä¶\n\nChest pain - chest tightness and heart palpitations \n\nAbsolutely hate it !!\nAlways been an anxious person ü•∫\n\nHeart palpitations, \nHeadaches, \nConstant nausea + vomiting,\nDerealisation,\nHaving trouble taking a deep breath,\nSo tired, but body wont sleep,\nSo hungry, but body cant eat,\nFatigue,\nMuscle spasms, \nShaking like a leaf (not cold),\nLoss of appetite, \nAggressive/aggravated/irritated/snappy,\nInsomnia/waking up at random times in a panic and not being able to go back to sleep,  \nSore muscles, \nHeavy/tight chest,  \nDiarrhoea, \nConstipation, \nWhole body feels weak‚Ä¶\n\nThe list really just goes on‚Ä¶ \nI‚Äôm hoping that medication helps, because I am so tired of this, it‚Äôs constant, every hour of every day, and no matter how many breathing exercises or whatever else is helping.\n\nI could of wrote this myself. You‚Äôre not alone friend. Also my meditation has helped me control these feelings but my god when stress is through the roof i feel so helpless\n\nDo you feel faint?\n\nI learned a couple of years ago that peeing a lot can be a symptom (yes I've been tested, I'm not diabetic).\n\nShaking violently. I get ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre shaking so much!‚Äù often. Yes, I‚Äôm anxious. All the time.\n\n***hugs***\n\nI act out social situations in the shower; what I would say, what the person would say back to me, pretend that I'm teaching someone about a subject, pretend that I'm convincing somebody to agree with me, etc. A lot of times it's a situation I will never find myself in. My therapist told me that I'm trying to control others and have a sense of control through imaginary situations, and to prepare myself if I am going to run into that situation. Figures as much, I've had OCD for as long as I can remember\n\nI‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one who does this\n\nFood noise/chatter. It‚Äôs taken me 36 years to realise my constant concern about food (when I‚Äôll eat, how much, how often, what‚Ä¶ etc etc) has nothing to do with food and everything to do with my anxious brain.\n\nEarly am abdominal cramping\n\nSo many parents don‚Äôt understand this with their children who get anxious about going to school or having to do tests. They just think it‚Äôs the child trying to pretend to be sick to get out of something. Poor kids need help relaxing somehow‚Ä¶ or a break from the pressures put on them day after day.\n\n Brain shocks.  Those quick little buzzes in your head that are painless but feels like your brain got electrocuted. \n\nBack pain. \n\nIt took me being on Prozac to stop most of the shocks and back pain. I still get them when my anxiety is through the roof, but not constantly dealing with it is so nice‚Ä¶\n\nThe fatigue is real. Sometimes I have to wait to see if I actually caught the flu or if it‚Äôs just this draining mental illness.\n\nA weird one for me was ‚Äúmorning anxiety‚Äù. Waking up stressed, heart racing. I didn‚Äôt realize it was a common symptom of anxiety. I thought it was separate and then looked it up and realized they were connected to elevated cortisol levels in the morning and I felt relieved knowing it was all connected.\n\nFeeling hot in the neck and shoulder area. I thought I was going to have a cold or fever.\n\nAutoimmune disorders, dysautonomia, allergies.\n\nSame here! POTS &amp; a bunch of random ass allergies that aren‚Äôt consistent along with asthma.\n\nthe feeling like your chest is made\nof concrete and it neverrrrre ever goes away. weakness and loss of coordination were also big ones for me.\n\nGetting sick after eating breakfast and lunch, only being able to eat dinner\n\nI'm almost never able to eat breakfast especially because I'm nauseated until I finally don't feel hungry. Like you, the only \"safe\" meal is dinner - unless I have something that feels \"big\" coming up around dinner, then I can't eat at all that day.\n\nFeeling dizzy, shaking\n\nNo need to name more since about 90% of those listed i have dealt with over the past 3 months. On meds now that seem to be helping. Keep your head up everyone, it can get better.\n\nTinnitus\n\nRealizing its from anxiety was both a relief that im not going deaf and a \"COME ON FR?\" Moment\n\nIBS. \nAs far back as I could remember, 6 years old, anytime I‚Äôd go into any kind of store, instantly had to go. Stomach would be killing me.  \n\n\nWould also flair up on work trips or when i was stressed or just Mondays \n\nI‚Äôm 38. Got* anxiety under control a year ago. No more ibs ü§Ø\n\nDry throat, like I have a needle in my throat, and the need to clear it so I start to cough, and I feel like a bitter taste.\n\nForgetting how to breathe. Whenever I‚Äôm close to people or the room is completely quiet I forget how to breathe. It makes me so scared that other people can hear me breathing so I‚Äôm always holding my breath and trying to teach myself how to breathe againüò≠\n\nDerealization\n\nThis is also me. I am so sorry OP. So sorry. We‚Äôre all in this together.\n\nSorry but this brings me comfort because it really sucks and I‚Äôm going through it right now, I‚Äôm sorry your going through it (because it‚Äôs a horrible feeling) but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not alone ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nDoes anyone else get brain zaps? Like you're being electrocuted from the inside?\n\nHead tremors. I literally was convincing myself I was in the early stages of Parkinson‚Äôs disease.\n\nHeadaches. I used to wake up in the morning already withe a strong headache that lasted the whole day. By the end of the day I could barely keep my eyes open due to the intensity of the pain. At the time I thought I was probably sleeping in a weird position or that my pillow was to old or that my mattress needed to be replaced. Painkillers didn't work. The only thing that worked in the beginning was - surprise - sleeping again. But after a few years not even that was a sure remedy. I had up to three days in a row of constant and excruciating headaches that left me miserable and useless for anything. Got checked, nothing wrong with my skull or brain.\n\nOnly after coming across an article that summarized many of the most common symptoms of the anxiety and depression combo did I finally start to understand what was wrong with me. I still wake up sometimes with a headache but then it's never as strong as it used to be and only rarely does it last the whole day.\n\nYAWNING I never realized when I was younger that I yawn a lot when i'm anxious. I still do it now when I have anxiety\n\nApparently to my brain, loneliness is the worst possible thing in the world, so during two instances of feeling incredibly lonely with my mind going down such an exhausting rabbit hole, to snap out of it I would tell myself to just end it all then, if loneliness is really so unbearably awful, then just end it. And I mean this would snap me out of it because I would never, ever end my life, so it was kinda a way to tell my brain to stfu then. I told my therapist this and she said it‚Äôs a response to my anxiety, which I never would have thought. So, that‚Äôs my point of explaining all that.\n\nBeing physically stuck\n\nfeeling like your skin is burning\n\nlosing feeling and control of my hands. it was the scariest thing that's ever happened. my hands clenched up and my muscles would barely move when id tell them to, and it was numb up to my forearms. my feet were also tingly and numb.\n\nFeeling like my heart would stop beating\n\nI had the same symptoms. As a kid I always complained to my teachers that I ‚Äúfelt sick‚Äù aka my throat closed up, I always gagged or puked, I felt like a knot in my stomach and also in my throat. Well turns out at age 7 I got diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.\n\nTo this day at age 30 it‚Äôs still my main symptom. A tight throat that feels like it‚Äôs closing. Butterflies in my stomach making me feel nauseous and unwell. Having to literally dry heave and gag if I try to even walk or talk, because my body is so tense that I freeze up.\n\nRandom chest pains. I remember as kid asking my mom to rub my chest because it would just hurt for no reason. Still happens. And yes!! Feeling sick. In elementary school I would refuse breakfast because I constantly felt like throwing up. I'd spend all day my desk praying I wouldn't throw up. Thank you religious trauma!\n\nUpper back pain.\n\nMe too! I always had intense stomach aches as a kind when I was in anxiety-inducing situation. \n\nAlso, I have these anxiety twitches/shivers?? They're almost like tics but idk\n\nI also overheat and sweat a lot when I'm anxious\n\nThe weirdest one is sometimes my skin feels itchy, anyone else experience this?\n\nMy ears ring when I'm stressed and anxious üòü.\n\nI get these overwhelming feelings of having to get out of where I am and ‚Äúescaping ‚Äú the situation. Just feels like I‚Äôm going to loose it or faint .\n\nMine was peeing all the goddamn time. There was a point where I thought like it was multiple issues at once, esp having a vageena can be so complicated ‚Ä¶ i went to the doc like 3 times to get tested and every test was negative. My anxiety is at the point now where I (don‚Äôt wanna psych myself out on this but..) have to pee EXACTLY 3 times before I sleep but during the day I use to pee 3x every hour? (esp during the time I was going thru a bad break up) and had no clue what that meant.\n\nWeird feelings in my head like bubbles or a cloth being dragged through my head. Internal vibrations.\n\nHorrible, awful chest pain. I always thought I was having a heart attack, even went to the er once. Scared for my life literally lol. The other one is getting sick like you said, I used to go on school field trips as a kid and every time I‚Äôd be sick all day and then throw up from nerves. Then I‚Äôd magically be fine. Super odd.\n\nZaps, or like a super fast disassociate episode. My hands tighten up\n\nAs I‚Äôve gotten older my anxiety symptoms have changed to some extent. I‚Äôm easily startled and jumpy now. And I have to be cognizant of movies/tv shows that may exacerbate these symptoms.\n\nFeeling lightheaded for months. Didn‚Äôt go away until I started taking SSRIs. I was shocked when my doctor told me that it could be a symptom of GAD.\n\nCrying or getting a frog in my throat during any kind of serious conversation. I didn't understand for the longest what it meant.\n\nSpacing out or having complete blank moments where I forget common words mid speech.\n\nGod feeling nauseas and sick has been a huge issue for me the last 2 years . I never used to get my stomach issues this bad and i know its stress related .. it makes me so depressed to feel that way  to\n\nHands going numb was a new one for me recently. Not a fan!\n\nI have GI distress and issues to where my health anxiety jumps to stomach cancer. Hate it. Hate it hate it hate it.\n\nI get the normal feeling fear, like I can‚Äôt breath, and have trouble concentrating.  However, when my anxiety is at its highest, one that I get that is weird (I think) is I run a fever.  It is insane.\n\nScalp and beard psoriasis....something very recently diagnosed by my doctor.  I just thought my scalp was dry because I'd do a deep conditioner treatment and I'd be good for anywhere from six months to over a year.  But life is enjoying watching me take two steps forward these days and knocking me five yards back so to say stress and anxiety are getting the better of me would be an understatement.\n\nNeck and jaw pain from clenching \n\nNausea randomly\n\nMy most dominant and usually first warning symptom and one I wasn't aware of at first is my buzzing fingers and lower face.\nI suffer from ppa so I dont have any reason for anxiety, just hormone related so I dont know when its going to hit me. Soon as I feel that symptom now I know anxiety is coming so I can start my managing the \"anxiety flare\" early.\n\nSnapping on other people.\n\nChest tightness and feeling like my heart isnt getting enough oxygen crazy chest discomfort, feels so real im still wondering if its even anxiety or if there is truly something wrong with the bloodflow to my heart lol although it never gets worse with exercise which is a good indicator that it isnt my heart as you truly wouldn't be able to do something like that if there was something wrong with your heart.\n\nAnxiety shiver, but it‚Äôs not just any shiver, it‚Äôs super intense (and embarrassing), and only ever happens when I‚Äôm talking to someone about something really anxiety-inducing\n\nThe anger/irritability for no reason. Even people you love dearly can grate on your nerves just for talking at a normal volume because you‚Äôre so overwhelmed. It makes me feel so guilty\n\nDerealisation. Feeling like I'm not here or outside of my body\n\nThrowing up/gagging profusely when brushing my teeth.\n\nDream flash backs\n\nLock jaw. I have to remind myself multiple times a day to stop clenching my jaw so hard and I have to wear a night time guard because I ground my teeth so hard it was causing tooth pain. I didn't even know until the dentist mentioned it.\n\nIn the past I thought it was just people being scared over nothing but actually experiencing anxiety and panic attacks is terrifying.\n\nShortness of breath, your heart feeling like it wants to burst out your chest, the pit in your stomach. When your anxious you feel like everything is out to get you, you don't want to move or something will go wrong, you don't want to do the things you like because your terrified, the general feeling like crap. I now understand how my friend felt when he got them\n\nOver swallowing or feeling like there‚Äôs something stuck in my throat. It‚Äôs only recently when I saw people on here said they felt the same did I realize it was an anxiety thing.\n\nFatigue, feeling my head is heavy and I have no energy at all and I can‚Äôt concentrate, +my vision becomes blurry. This happens to me every other day at work.\n\nTics!!! Hate hate hate hate hate it so much\n\nSlow healing of the skin\n\nBurping üôÉ\n\nRacing heart... sometimes it just overwhelms me.\n\nSense of dread and hives\n\nYep. I would physically get nauseous and throw up when I get too anxious. I would get sick everyday before school. It was the worst. Then it became a fear of getting sick in public or on the bus. Always worried where bathrooms were. But strangely once I‚Äôve thrown up it was instant relief and anxiety was gone. I still get this occasionally as an adult. For instance, going to a concert and feeling anxious.. if I‚Äôm passenger in a car while feeling this anxiety it can trigger that feeling for me.\nLuckily I‚Äôm prescribed anti anxiety meds for this reason. They are a life saver in these situations\n\nAnger and irritability\n\nHot flashes during the middle of the night was the worst for me! I literally thought I was going crazy.\n\nThirst. It freaks me out because it's a sign of diabetes so I always end up checking my blood but constantly having to drink water is becoming overwhelming for me\n\nI get these brain shivers, my eyelids flutter and I can't look at anyone (human) when it's happening.\n\nnausea. like i never knew anxiety could cause that. i experienced it around a year ago for the 1st time and i had nausea for 2 days straight, then when i started to eat again i had diarrhea (bc i ate too much ice cream prob) i was anxious so nausea came back and since then it happens quite often\n\nSweating\n\nYawning. Since I was a little kid, if I was nervous from anticipation I would perpetually yawn despite not being tired at all. Anyone else?\n\nI went to medical school and this is my 3rd time trying to to this job but the symptoms are always the same which is like a bubble gut type of nervous feeling, the runs, gagging and vomiting sometimes...dizziness is a new one that I didn't expect. \n\nI really didn't expect any of these as symptoms...my next symptom will be quitting the medical field since I have done it 2 times because of these feelings and am about to do it a 3rd.\n\nI always get that gag/vomit sensation. After checking it with multiple people it was a symptom.\n\nEverything that ever happens to my body, according to my doctors.\n\nAcid reflux lol\n\nRaynaud‚Äôs - I have an autoimmune disease and when I‚Äôm anxious or stressed my Raynaud‚Äôs act up.\n\nNausea and feeling sick for sure ! I used to cry in school all the time and go home with a stomach ache‚Ä¶ which would subsequently go away as soon as I got in the car with my mom. I was 25 years old and in nursing school before I realized that I had anxiety. And me ‚Äúfinding this out‚Äù lead my mom to get diagnosed as well. We were just suffering in silence because my grandma always said we were just ‚Äúbeing dramatic‚Äù etc. and she had it, too. Xanax was literally invented for that woman, I swear. And the self awareness level is 0 she would just fly off the handle all the time and not care who she brought into her spiral with her.\n\nApart from the digestive issues, after a few days of intense anxiety I start to question reality. I lose my ability to discern the anxiety from reality and logic. I think it‚Äôs from the exhaustion of trying to reground myself constantly when the anxiety is really bad. It makes me rethink my past and recast events in my mind to be different and worse than they were and really wears on my self image. It‚Äôs rough and takes days/weeks to fully come back to reality.\n\nForgetfulness, I thought it was ADHD, turns out that i have generalized anxiety.\nThe more anxious I feel, the more i forget.\n\nDizziness\n\nMental problem solving. My psychiatrist recently told me not everyone goes around with tons of lists in their heads and solutions, and I said \"then what do they think about?!?!?!\"\n\nI could never tell if the anxiety caused my stomach to be upset or my upset stomach caused me to have anxiety\n\nOver washing my hands, forever checking that the door is locked and that the stove is shut off, superstitious counting and constantly making sure that my wallet and keys are in my purse.\n\nNausea. My anxiety has always presented with heart palpitations and other cardiac symptoms, so when I started feeling nauseous I was confused. Turns out that was just anxiety as well. Needless to say I have bad anxiety! Lol\n\nWeight gain and hair loss. Turns out it wreaks havoc on your body, not just brain.\n\nIrritability and not know what the actual issue is and being quick to snap at my loved ones.\n\nConstantly feeling like I have to rush around or I‚Äôm running out of time\n\nHeat intolerance üî•üî•üî•\n\nI think feeling like you can't swallow is one?\n\nI tend to have that feeling on long road trips where the altitude changes or when I have allergies and feel stuffy. (It's not anything severe either) I usually grip my pants or something when I try to swallow and can't. The last time it happened I told myself to take my time and take another breath before a swallow so I don't think about it and then I did it normally. Scariest sensation though!\n\nLike I want to literally jump out of my skin. I don‚Äôt know what exactly that would entail but it‚Äôs what my brain is requesting my body to do. Had no idea others felt like that too.\n\nThe inability to sleep through the night without having night terrors. Night meds made them worse. Cold hands and feet- to the point where they were and are like ice. Heart palpitations. De - realization. Having to hold my tongue because the spit is piling up and I feel like I can‚Äôt swallow and as a result, can‚Äôt sleep. (If that last one makes any sense at all- it‚Äôs terrible)¬†\n\nI know this is old... just recently started having new weird symptoms..but does anyone else when the sensation of something rushing from head down to toes every second? I don't know how to describe it..."

My daughter started puberty this year and is very emotional/sensitive and I think the ending when she was having the anxiety attack just set something off in my 9 year old. The part where Joy helped calm down Anxiety is what made her cry her eyes out. We couldn‚Äôt even stay for the ending it was so bad. I felt terrible and now I really think my daughter is expecting the worst in middle/high school. She just calmed down when we got home.

    "all_comment_text": "I had to walk out of movies when I younger too, but because it was too scary or violent for me. I was able to watch most of them when I got older, maybe she could watch it again years later. I like things that I can relate to, but not everyone wants things that hit too close to home\n\nYeah she loved the first one but second one really hit close with her.\n\nI think for movies to work they have to put the main characters through hell. The adversity is what makes it compelling. But that can be hard to watch if you‚Äôre young and sensitive and over-identify with the characters because you have too much empathy. \n\nIt‚Äôs bad that this has happened but your kid is probably going to grow up to be an amazing person.\n\nI am 22 and watching movies/tv shows with anxiety and panic scenes are a big trigger for me. It‚Äôs weird haha\n\nI‚Äôm 31 and it is for me too\n\nwow for me its the opposite. I love watching movies with scenes like that because its finally something i can relate to\n\nI‚Äôm 24 went to see this myself and I was also very much anxious through most of Riley‚Äôs scenes\n\nWhen I was younger I could watch stuff and not bat an eye, but now there‚Äôs things I can feel it impacting my current mental state. If it‚Äôs rough, I start getting really antsy.\n\nYou may have learned some very useful things. Possibly with some gentle prodding, give her space to talk.\n\nDefinitely\n\nI‚Äôm 30 and the scene where she pulls anxiety from the console thing during the anxiety attack and when she put anxiety in the chair made me cry. I‚Äôm not an emotional person at all. She‚Äôs not alone!\n\nMy 11 year old son told me that‚Äôs how he feels during his anxiety attacks, like when everything was swirling around.\n\nI agree! When my anxiety gets bad (which it is currently) I feel stuck. Like literally can‚Äôt even talk sometimes. It was a great representation and I think a lot of the movie made anxiety seem productive, but that moment really brought it all together. I think it was a great movie actually\n\nDitto. I started sobbing. I suffer from an anxiety disorder and having the film visualize how to not throw away anxiety but have it relax and take a back seat really stuck with me. I was starting to clear my tears when the final line of the film came on and then the tears came again\n\nI‚Äôm 32 and same!\n\nI'm 36 and currently in a really good mental health space so while the scene hit home, it didn't trigger me. \n\nThat said, a few weeks ago I was in the thick of a months long depressive episode. That scene would have triggered the ugliest of crying. It would have been big, gut wrenching sobs too.\n\nOne day when she‚Äôs older and rewatches it she‚Äôll want to run and give her 9 year old self the biggest hug. Good on you for allowing her to feel her feelings and not dismissing them, she‚Äôll want to run and give you the biggest hug as well.\n\nSaw it last night, cried many times, felt seen and I‚Äôm 51 ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø\n\nI am 48 I instantly thought there must be the same button for menopause. I definitely related many times to this movie and want to watch it again. Side note: I need that anxie Tea lol.\n\nI just saw this movie yesterday and the panic attack scene gave me horrible anxiety. Something about seeing and hearing it on the screen made my heart rate increase and I felt dizzy for a while. I think it perfectly represented a real panic attack for younger people and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so triggering. I‚Äôm 24 and been dealing with anxiety since I was 13 or so. It‚Äôs gotten better with age but I totally understand why someone wouldn‚Äôt be able to watch the scene. Sorry that happened to her it suck‚Äôs to not be able to do normal things like see a movie because of anxiety.\n\nYup!! I‚Äôm 18 and suffer from panic attacks/anxiety. I had to step out of the movie theatre after the panic attack scene because my heart was racing so bad :(\n\nFor a second I thought I was going to actually have a panic attack but then I disassociated for a minute and was able to focus on my breathing. It‚Äôs weird how just seeing it happen can trigger the same thing in you.\n\nI took my kids to see this movie opening day and it helped us discuss anxiety and how it affects us. Inside Out (1) was recommended by child psychologists due to how well it represents each emotion in a visual way. Inside Out 2 does the same thing in spades.\n\nThe scene that hit me hardest as an early 40s man, was when Riley was calling for Joy to return to the console near the end of the movie. It's how I wish to have joy return to me after a panic attack, it's crazy how well that movie was made.\n\nSupposedly the next one will be about depression. I think Disney should keep on making movies about mental health like Inside Out, they are doing a bang up job and help people visualize their own feelings and relate to the characters that represent each feeling.\n\nWasn't the first movie about depression?\n\nYou have a point, but I think it was more about grief rather than the actual disorder.\n\nIt read to me like adjustment disorder with depressed mood. It hit so close as someone who suffers from dysthymia.\n\nThat's when I cried too. As adults we all just want joy to return to us, but it's so hard to hold onto it.\n\nmy sister said she will have a panic attack and i said absolutely not watching that it would be tooo triggering for me {i have anxiety}\n\nI WATCHED IT AND IT WAS NOT BAD\n\nI definitely had to compose myself at that scene because it felt so real and I was close to tears! They did a great job with that scene and I hope it helps a lot of kids who will experience something similar!\n\nI watched that scene and it triggered me too üòÖüòÖ\n\nFunny enough I‚Äôm 20 and me and my girlfriend went to see inside out 2 as an excuse to eat popcorn and goof off in the movie theater.  \n\nI have existing issues with existential crisis that have been so severe that I‚Äôve been put in a hospital, and for some reason around the end of the movie, I began to realize that the emotions are always there in Riley‚Äôs mind and that they can never leave and that they are doomed to see the same thing everyday until the end of time, locked in a prison almost.  On top of that, there is also the realization that at the end of the day we are a collection of emotions and concepts in meat robot suits, and it scares the shit out of me.\n\nI know this wasn‚Äôt the point of the movie, but it began making me think about existence and how as humans were trapped in this reality that has either 2 options at the end based on if a god exists or not: we either live eternally and that seems terrifying because eventually you get bored and when does it end and oh god I can‚Äôt even think about the shit, or you just cease to exist and nothing really matters and to me, I feel trapped and have really bad issues with this way of thinking.  It might not be completely rational, but trust me it fucked with my head.\n\nNeedless to say, I had such a bad fucking panic attack I had to go to the bathroom and throw up.  No joke, inside out 2 fucked my head up horrible that night, perhaps not intentionally. But that‚Äôs just what anxiety does and it sucks.\n\nI just wanted to pop in and say I‚Äôve had similar thoughts of what you posted and with therapy and some choice medication, I‚Äôm on the other side and am able to acknowledge those thoughts without letting them consume me.  \n\nSometimes they might get a stronger grip on my brain but behavioral cognitive therapy has really given me some great tools so I can wrestle back control and allow myself to be lost in the beautiful chaos of my life, living in the moment and not worrying about things that are ultimately out of my hands. \n\nI hope you find the same peace. I just wanted to share that it was possible for me to get here and I hope the same for you.\n\nThank you, this actually was really nice to read.  I have had some really awful experiences with existential crisis, it‚Äôs good to know there might be some way to peace.  I do need to get enrolled in therapy again now that I think about it.  Antidepressants helped me for a bit, and they made me feel better, but even now, I can barely even get in the shower without thinking too hard about reality and freaking out.\n\nThank you so much though and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre doing better! It‚Äôs a tough road\n\nI used to struggle with this kind of thinking a lot when I was younger... Therapy and just getting out in the world and seeing other people living life all over the globe really helped me to see it as an adventure. It's not always a FUN adventure, but I had a near death experience in an almost plane crash, and a shift happened in my head where, just when we all thought we were goners, I was overcome with this crazy euphoria of -- \"DANG! Even though life is hard as heck, this was a fun ride! And even if I couldn't change a thing, I would do it all over again.\" As someone who battled crippling anxiety and depression for most of my life, I never would have expected that to be my final thought. It rocked my universe and changed how I feel about everything. That's not to say I don't still battle anxiety or depression when life is really scary or hard... but I have a different perspective and context for it now. I recently saw the Indigo Girls documentary \"It's Only Life After All,\" and I was so struck by that line from their song \"Closer to Fine.\" The documentary is amazing, and highlights how both of these incredible musicians wrestled with similar demons... but also that song, \"Closer to Fine\" (brilliantly chosen as the theme song for claiming your own path in life in the recent BARBIE movie), and that line -- \"it's only life, after all,\" both sort of sum up the easier relationship I now have with this whole LIFE journey... I don't know if any of that rambling will be helpful to you... but I guess I just wanted you to know, it really does get better over time... your lens will change, either slowly or all of a sudden, but it will change... biochemically it's inevitable, even if you aren't in a near catastrohphic plane crash. I so hope you can find good tools to carry you through in the meantime... Seek out help. Find it where it works for you. I promise, it gets better...\n\nThank you so much for the words of encouragement, I‚Äôm glad you are doing better and this helps beyond imagination.  Thank you again and I hope you do well!!\n\n20 is a HARD time biochemically. And when you have an overactive, super-analytical brain, man... it can be such a struggle. But -- the key is to somehow get to the point where you mostly focus on NOW. That's not to say you don't plan for the future or work towards goals, but -- as much as possible -- you find a way not to fixate on it and catastophize about it. Because, when we do that, we miss out on what's happening right now. And right now is usually pretty okay. Sometimes it sucks, but it's still not usually as bad as the crazy stuff we worry will happen in the imagined eventual someday. Sometimes right now turns out to be surprisingly super awesome, when you really look at it. Even in its grandest simplicity. It's the projecting about the unknown and worrying about future awfuls that likely will never transpire (people have been trying to predict the future since the caveman days, but none have been terribly successful on a regular basis) that stirs up our cortisol and gets us running from imagined predators. Our bodies and brains still think we're in those caves with inevitable T-rexes outside the door... but we aren't. We're almost always safe (at least those of us lucky enough to be going to the movies for popcorn and chatting on Reddit in our free time)... If you can find a way to hone your sense of humor (such a gift!) and to continuously remind yourself to re-focus on NOW, I really believe you'll turn a corner sooner than you can imagine. Whenever you start to spiral about the future, redirect your brain to literally clinically catalogue what you're experiencing RIGHT NOW -- what are you physically feeling from head to toe -- write it down if you can -- and then (for me, a great key was), count 5 things you are grateful for in the moment (sometimes they'll be VERY small and hard to come by -- but they still help!)... Again, write them down, if you can. That can be a very useful tool to put in your coping kit. Eventually your body will stop churning out all that cortisol. You'll have burned through these questions and worries so many times, your body will release them as \"lesser concerns\"... you just have to get through these crazy chemical rollercoaster years... (Apologies if I'm projecting too much of my experience onto you... but -- I wish I'd had people who had been through this to talk to when I was 20... so -- I'm sharing in case it's helpful. If it isn't, just know -- there are a lot of us out here who were on that same train, and it does come into the station eventually and let you change directions...) I will genuinely be thinking of you and pulling for you!!!\n\nThis was beautifully written, I couldn‚Äôt say it better myself.  Thank you so much, I hope you have a wonderful life!  This helped a lot\n\nI'm so glad... Take care of yourself, my friend. I hope YOU have a wonder-full life, too!\n\nI relate to you so much. I also had a panic attack during inside out 2, had to leave the movie theatre and sit on the ground. I get these thoughts at least once a day and it‚Äôs terrifying, I just try to distract myself when it happens.¬†\n\nMe too man.  Showers are where I get them the most, but a lot of things can trigger them.  Probably just need some heavy therapy haha\n\nI saw interstellar and had an anxiety attack so bad I threw up in my bag of popcorn. Sometimes movies hit so hard and real. I feel for your daughter.\n\nawee i hope you feel better :)\n\nIt was years ago. I‚Äôm doing okay! Promise\n\nThank you xo\n\nYep, interstellar gave me a panic attack in the cinema too :/\n\nNow I'm intrigued.\n\nAgreed that it was a but triggering, but I appreciated the visual the movie provided about sending your anxiety to her chair. Try to use that and the other representations as positives to teach her how to cope the next time she has a panic attack.\n\nNot only the chair but something big that a lot of people overlooked was the real technique of countering negative self talk that Joy used. ‚ÄúAre any of these things happening now?‚Äù And points out that they can‚Äôt control/change any of those possible outcomes so let‚Äôs focus on things we can control. It took until my second time watching to realize it and it blew me away. \n\nI think Pixar should partner with a mental health organization to make shorts with the emotions acting out more countering techniques!\n\nThey also touched on the 5-4-3-2-1 coping technique with Riley when she was in the penalty box.  I was so impressed with how well this movie portrayed anxiety and real ways that it is dealt with.\n\nI watched the first one the other night and bing bongs death really fucked me up\n\nI just got out of the movie. The panic attack had me bawling. I'm still trying to convince my gf I was laughing in pain at a kink I had in my neck that was why I had to turn away from her.\nDefinitely use this as a learning opportunity. Your kid is sensitive. She's definitely gonna have a hard time and you should approach her issues with love and understanding always. And if you lose your head... then you know to show her kindness by apologizing because as a parent you have to teach responsibility by example. Good luck to you and your daughter. Thank you for sharing this with us. I was looking for someone who felt the same way. I'm a 33 year old man though...\n\nWhat would be wrong with your girlfriend knowing the truth, that you were having a panic attack?\n\nThis movie hit waaaay too close to home. They did such an amazing job portraying all the emotions.\n\nAs soon as she started doing the 54321 steps, I completely broke. I was having anxiety myself, stimming and gripping the seat. My heart was beating out of my chest. As SOON as she started doing the same coping mechanisms I had been taught from years and years of panic disorder, I burst into a puddle of tears. Violently. \n\nMy reasoning? \n\nOne, the obvious emotional tension. Seeing anxiety gripping the console and the speeding up had my anxiety flaring. I haven't felt that in a movie in a long time, not even for horror movies.\nTwo, that is coping mechanisms that I had been taught from multiple sessions of therapy. Riley experienced anxiety 3 days before the event of the movie and already had the knowledge of how to pull herself back down without aid. Meaning Riley learned that somewhere. \nThree, this movie and puss and boots are where the next generation of kids are learning these coping mechanisms right out the gate. The next generation IS Riley, learning how to process emotions in a healthy way and being given tools to help cope with complex emotional problems. The next generation doesn't have to feel defective or disgusting for having anxiety like I had to, like my parents had to, like my grandparents had to.\n\nI swear just posted about this! Haha\n\nI nearly had a panic attack at the cinema, but it happened to me with puss in boots, and miraculous ladybug too, I think it is because i relate to them. \n\nJust to note, im a grown ass woman. Your kid feelings are justified, that scene is so well written, it just gets a reaction.\n\nI as an adult wanted to see it but it made me cry from the beginning. It started with seeing parents bringing their children with their big cute plushie. It was something that my parents would never let me do so and they hate cartoons and cinemas.\n\nWhen Riley got the panic attack, shaking her legs and panting, and Anxiety froze and couldn't get go, that was the worst. That's how I felt many times, and of course my parents would dismiss it and would always say I'm ruining their fun by being a Miss Negativity.\n\nI didn't realise it would affect me this much, and I wish my parents were there to watch it with me and understand what I have been through.\n\nIt's a good thing that you as a parent are aware of her emotional needs and are there to support her. It makes a lot of difference. ü´Ç\n\nooooh i have really vivid memories of having huge emotional reactions in the movie theater when i was that age, just big crazy feelings and sobbing, it‚Äôs a crazy age to be and movies are so good at pulling those reactions out of people. i wouldn‚Äôt worry about it TOO much, but definitely have a talk with her about big feelings and ask her to describe how she feels and take her through it.\n\nI also had an anxiety attack watching the anxiety scene as a 27 year old. It really was quite accurate in how Joy couldn‚Äôt grab anxiety because of how fast she was moving around the console. While it was uncomfortable to watch it also made me realize that I‚Äôm not alone, and that representation is just going to benefit others. I was about your daughter‚Äôs age when I had my first anxiety attack, but due to my age many doctors felt uncomfortable diagnosing it as anxiety.\n\nHormones are just so cruel for girls. :( Honestly.\n\nI got my anxiety when my hormones came on, right when my periods started, and I feel SO bad for younger me. Two decades of fear and pain and stress and a brain that was so mean to me, that made everything 100x harder than it needed to be. Exhausting and physically painful. I was so lucky I had a mom that didn't rush me or try to make me feel bad. I always had a home and an ear and a hug whenever I needed it.\n\nI really thought with as bad as my anxiety was, I would never find a way to get out on my own, but somehow I went from an introvert with no social life and a bad high school diploma, to an engineering degree, left home at 28 and lived in two countries and now married with lots of friends.\n\nIt feels like after awhile my brain snipped whatever synapses that agitated the pathways in my brain that made me so fight or flight after awhile. But growing up I wanted desperately to have medication but I didnt think it would help, I didn't want to mess up my brain, and it was expensive, on top of the potential stygma of being labelled medically as a mentally unstable person.\n\nThe thing that eventually helped me, personally, was daily minipill. Progestrone is a calming hormone, cortisol is a stress hormone, and when your body produces cortisol is actually supresses natural progestrone.Progestrone also tells your body to produce the calming neurotransmitter GABA - so high cortisol means low progestrone and low GABA.   \n  \nMinipill also stopped me from having to have periods, which always put your body through a hormone rollercoaster, and it's painful. That was a big part of my social anxiety- it made me tired and always afraid I'd get angry at people and only realize when it was too late. Maybe in the future you can see if the minipill helps her.\n\nAnything that affects hormones can affect people very differently, some people dont react well to hormone therapies/ BC at all, but I thought I'd mention it since it felt like it did so much for me once my body adjusted to it in a few months.\n\nFor someone who has generalized anxiety disorder, I gotta admire Pixar visualization of an Anxiety Attack is like an endless twister.  The scene when she's in the penalty box perfectly captures the feelings and sensations of anxiety, where you feel trapped inside of your own head and feel like you can't breathe! I've had moments üò∞\n\nI started tearing up and crying as Anxiety was frozen in place as Joy was trying to talk sense into her. What they both want is for Riley to be happy. üò¢\n\nI'm sorry to hear that. It's important to be mindful of how movies and media can impact individuals differently, especially children. Ensuring a supportive environment and discussing any concerns with your daughter can help her feel more comfortable and reassured.\n\ni felt similarly with watching the newest puss in boots in theatres where he has a panic attack running away from the evil wolf character (i forgot his name). dreamworks absolutely KILLED what an anxiety attack looks and feels like and it almost set one in me whilst watching.\n\nyeah im 31 and it was that and when she was in the box holding her chest and sweating. I was almost at the point of getting up\n\nI am 26 and struggle to watch that stuff too\n\nI said it about the first and I‚Äôll say it about these - as a grown woman I don‚Äôt get why this is focused as a kids movie. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love them both but they are emotionally HEAVY. And especially younger people who have a hard time emotionally regulating. Does she regret watching it?\n\nIs she in therapy already? If not, get her a therapist.\n\nId also reach out to her future school counselor and notify them. Ask if there's any supports they can provide.\n\nIdk where you live but if you're in the US, if you can get her a diagnosis of anxiety and/or other mental health conditions, you can request what's called a 504 meeting to get her counseling in school and some minor accommodations to support her mental health.\n\n30s, anxiety, panic attacks, etc. and even I was worried that scene would get me as it started. I think I even said ‚Äúoh no‚Äù but I was ok. I did let some tears out when Anxiety was zoomin on the control panel tho. But Puss and Boots: The Last Wish??? THAT panic attack?? got me. it felt so real.\n\nIt will end up being a tremendous learning experience for her.\n\nYeah, even as a adult I find animated movies sometimes hit harder. Especially with the expressions and things. \n\nYou can tell your daughter that Puss's panic attack scene in Last Wish almost reduced a 30-something to have an episode. \n\nIt's totally fine to walk out of a movie. I used to always do it in the scary bits and then come back for the end!\n\nI‚Äôm 40 and have GAD- and the whole movie made me cry and have anxiety.\n\nThis movie for sure should have come with a trigger warning. I lost it during the anxiety attack. When she couldn't move her hand off the controls. I was crying so hard, my kids (7 and 5) were wondering if I was okay and I felt so numb and unable to engage for like 10 mins after. I mean I get the point of it, but I still feel like lots of adults were fucked up after this scene. Anxiety wasn't acknowledged for us millennials when we were growing up (or at least by my family), so it was hard to watch as if I was brought back to 13 again\n\nI'm sorry to hear that the movie was just too much for your daughter to handle emotionally. I'm sorry to hear that her anxiety was so severe you had to leave the movie theater, forcing you to skip the ending scenes, even the post-credit one. I guess she was just too sensitive to that particular scene. I had a panic attack while watching the movie like your daughter did, only mine was not as severe.\n\nI had a panic attack just like she did, only I did breathing exercises until Riley calmed down. It was also the only movie where I actually had a panic attack.\n\nWhen I saw Inside Out 2 and Riley had a panic attack, I also had it. I saw the movie twice, both with my mom and dad. Both times, for some reason, I felt an increase in my heart rate when Anger called out Pouchy, and it lasted until Riley calmed down. When I saw it on a flight, I didn't have it, although I came close when I looked at the corridor. \n\nMy heart rate went back to normal when Riley calmed down. I didn't shed tears when Anxiety shed a tear. I did breathing exercises for the duration of it.\n\nI saw it twice on DVD, unlike you and your daughter. I cried three times, unlike the first movie. I would have watched it on DVD a third time if it had the French and Italian versions on it. \n\nUnlike your daughter, I cried once my heartbeat went back to normal and Riley apologized to Bree and Grace. I saw the ending and the post-credit scene.\n\n36 here and just found this posts by searching if I‚Äôm the only one that has been having anxiety after watching the film. I‚Äôm already a big ball of anxiety and didn‚Äôt get the attack right away but did while sleeping which was an hour after watching it and let me tell you. I will not be watching this movie again. Not because it was bad but it literally screwed me up bad.\n\n1. It is ok for your daughter to cry. Did we not learn that in inside out the first time? 2. If she related to it use it to your advantage and have a conversation about how Riley went through hard things but what did she/ They do? Joy helped her think of great future possibilities(imagination land), they gave anxiety all the things that help her calm, what could those be for your daughter? Riley took deep breaths and took cognisance of her surroundings. And joy helped anxiety refocus on the things she can control. Anxiety doesn't have to run the show. People almost give up when they are given the label anxiety but it is like being an alcoholic it is something you suffer from but not who you are and with the correct tools you can live a healthy life where anxiety doesn't control you. If things were triggering, ask why? \nThe whole movie was so beautiful! So many wow moments! And I just love that it is giving us language to explain emotions we had no way of expressing before.\n\nMe and my sister Mandy have just finished Inside Out 2 yesterday it was a really great movie it really was!\nI‚Äôm sorry you and your daughter didn‚Äôt stay for the ending of the movie!\n\nI honestly know I've had panic attacks in the past, but didn't recognize it was still such a prevalent thing for me until I saw the panic attack scene, I literally started having one as well. I deal with depression. Too so I usually write off most things as having to do with that.\n\nI‚Äôm an adult and it just gave me anxiety lol cute movie but it just caused me to feel that way\n\nMe personally, i didn't watch inside out 2 until it was on disney+. i still haven't even watched the whole thing and that was a good idea to wait. It really triggers my anxiety so i probably don't recommend it.\n\nAfter all these years the 1st one still agitated me. I've said this so many times and have seen so many articles on this. That movie needs heavy parental supervision. I think it is very relevant but I see it triggering even 70 year Olds.¬†\n\n\nRiley is a helpless kid with all those intense emotions... I cannot even as an adult compute it all.¬†\n\nSpoiler alert!\n\nInside Out 1 and 2 made me cry a lot. I took my 6 and 8 year old to see it and the anxiety attack and build up made me cry. My daughter said Out loud \"why are you crying?\" I said I wasn't and she said \"yes you are\". I explained to her that that made my embarrassment emotion cringe because others in the cinema could hear her. I then explained that anxiety is hard because mummy struggles with it and I felt a lot of empathy for Riley...recalling my own youth.¬† Also the way in which core beliefs are formed - \"I'm not good enough\". I identified with this so strongly and that made me cry too. I hope my kids can pick up on how beliefs about oneself are formed through our finding memories as \"evidence\" (bias) to prove the belief and solidify...and¬† ignoring the ones that prove otherwise. All very CBT based. This was highlighted by Joy desperately hiding negative memories and by anxiety picking out all the negative memories....the \"what ifs\"(negatively) and striving for perfection and all negative possibilities and how exhausting anxiety truly is....when really all of the memories needed to be fully integrated into Riley's belief system and overcome for her to be fully her authentic self. Sometimes we have to go full circle to learn to regulate all of our emotions in a balanced way.\n\n\nThe first film made me cry a LOT. Both times I've seen it.¬† The depression, shut down, dissociation, lack of understanding from parents berating her actions and not looking to what is underneath the iceberg to trying to \"fix\" and then to connection (beautiful).¬† Was so impressed with how emotions were explained and even schools use their characters for the Zones of Regulation in our school. I hope my two continue to watch these two movies and learn something new each time, though I felt the 2nd was a little old for them in truth... I loved the concrete yet fantasy way in which emotions, memories and beliefs were depicted and explained visually in this movie.¬† Just genius..and works ao well for children...highlighting how our emotions work as separate and integrated entities and affect us in so many variety of ways as we grow up and even as we operate as adults...even to how we form core beliefs about ourselves and how these beliefs get stuck sometimes and askew. Just brilliant.¬† I hope schools use these movies to discuss through PHSE classes.¬†¬†\n\nI find it wild that people actually have a emotional response to the movie I‚Äôm not judging but i find it amusing"

    "body": "Yesterday I woke up normal, Drove into work got breakfast and took my Prozac, within an hour I got an email that I felt changed my whole mentality for the day. I just started to feel off.. felt nauseous, and like I was having trouble breathing, but I maintained. It wasn‚Äôt until 4pm when I got back to the shop I told my buddy I wasn‚Äôt feeling good. We went inside he got me a Gatorade but told my boss I wasn‚Äôt feeling well. By then my entire body was shaking, having trouble standing up, felt shortness of breath, etc. all the typical symptoms I get during a panic attack. My boss suggested calling the ambulance. So they did. \n\nThey took my vitals and all while I was in the office and everything was great, heart rate was 75, Blood oxygen was 98, blood pressure was a little elevated which is typical when I have this issue.. I ended up going to the hospital in the ambulance, I walked out, hopped in. When I got to the hospital I was already feeling better, not great but knew it was cooling off. They took an EKG, no issues with the heart, or lungs. Ended up giving me Atarax (that stuff is AMAZING, btw) and my mom gave me a ride home. \n\nBut god I feel embarrassed. I had 4 people standing over me during a panic attack at work. Get hauled off in an ambulance, all for a panic attack.. granted I have been under an ENORMOUS amount of stress at work from my boss. But I never thought I would be hauled off in an ambulance at work because of this.\n\nShould I feel embarrassed? I feel like I don‚Äôt want to show my face at work again. I‚Äôm fricken 35.. I hate feeling like this. \n\ntl;dr: feeling off all day, made it until 4am(quitting time) and it hit me, boss ended up calling ambulance, I got sent off with good vitals etc, they gave me atarax, and I went home with a sick note for the next day. Should I feel embarrassed? ",

I'm sorry that happened to you, I know it's hard, but at least people cared about you. Maybe it will make your boss think a bit more about how he treats you too.\n\nThis is the right answer¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nNew fear unlocked\n\nShouldn't worry too much, the seizure has more marked Symptoms, like pain irradiated to the left arm or jaw, a sharp oppressive pain in your chest. Cases where the symptoms are not so obvious are a low percentage. Still, recommended to make routine exams every year, even more so if you have other pathologies like Hypertension, Diabetes, Dyslipidemias or overweight. If you have any chest pain, maybe even epigastric pain or other symptoms, it's better to get checked right away just in case because those pathologies raise the chances a looooot. \n\nMedicine student recommendationsüëç\n\nOh, you thought anxiety doesn't give me those same symptoms? It definitely does üòÜ\n\nUhm med student or not those aren‚Äôt the main manifestations of seizures dude. Those are actually WAY more common with anxiety than seizures. \n\nSeizures most immediately affects vision and sensory perception and possible shortness of breath with the impending doom feeling.\nThe amount of epileptics misdiagnosed as anxious is astounding. Please don‚Äôt bring this idea of ‚Äúmain manifestations are heart attack symptoms‚Äù into your practice if you ever work with neurology. Which is a vast and complicated field that takes many many years to become competent in. \n\nPlease don‚Äôt take a med students words over an epileptic or a neurologists anything. Most GPs and even regular neurologist have zero clue about epilepsy and seizure. My neurologist and GP themselves admit this and send me to an **epileptologist** who would look at you very confused right now. \n\nThe most common initial manifestations of seizure, whether partials or tonic clonics, etc, mirror anxiety. Myoclonic not so much but y‚Äôall don‚Äôt care about that.\n\nFucking heart attack symptoms Jesus Christ.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs interested in what it actually looks and feels like: Seizures can present in various ways depending on the type and area of the brain affected. Here are the main signs of a seizure.\n\n1. **Generalized Seizures:**\n   - **Tonic-clonic (formerly known as grand mal):**\n     - Sudden loss of consciousness\n     - Body stiffening (tonic phase)\n     - Rhythmic jerking of the limbs (clonic phase)\n     - Possible incontinence\n     - Biting of the tongue\n     - Postictal confusion or fatigue\n\n   - **Absence (formerly known as petit mal):**\n     - Brief, sudden lapses in attention or staring spells\n     - No postictal confusion\n     - Occasional subtle movements like eye blinking or lip smacking\n\n   - **Myoclonic:**\n     - Sudden, brief, shock-like jerks of a muscle or a group of muscles\n\n   - **Atonic:**\n     - Sudden loss of muscle tone\n     - Possible falls to the ground\n\n2. **Focal (Partial) Seizures:**\n   - **Simple focal:**\n     - No loss of consciousness\n     - Unusual sensations or feelings (aura)\n     - Jerking movements in one part of the body\n     - Sensory changes (taste, smell, sound, or visual disturbances)\n\n   - **Complex focal:**\n     - Altered awareness or consciousness\n     - Staring blankly\n     - Repetitive movements (hand rubbing, chewing, walking in circles)\n\n3. **Other Signs:**\n   - **Automatisms:**\n     - Repetitive behaviors such as lip-smacking, picking at clothes, or walking aimlessly\n   - **Emotional Changes:**\n     - Sudden feelings of fear, anxiety, or d√©j√† vu\n   - **Sensory Symptoms:**\n     - Hallucinations, unusual tastes or smells\n   - **Autonomic Symptoms:**\n     - Sweating, nausea, changes in skin color, or dilated pupils\n\n[deleted]\n\nI‚Äôm active there. These are all the symptoms they talk about, because they‚Äôre epileptic.. I‚Äôm confused what you‚Äôre saying.¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nAhh ok.\n\nOooh, okay I fucked up with the terminology. My bad, I don't speak English. But yeah, those are heart attack symptoms, IAM (infarto agudo al miocardio) in Spanish. I just kinda assumed from the context, thanks for the correction.\n\nI realized after I posted that this wasn't in the epilepsy subreddit.\n\nNoooooooo\n\nOh goodness, how terrible üòß I hope you are/were ok.\n\nYes, that was about six years ago. I've had great treatment since. I thought this was in the epilepsy subreddit at first, but then realized where I posted after this and am terrified I made a lot of people very anxious.\n\nYES. ME. I had ‚Äúcrippling anxiety,‚Äù but turns out I just have epilepsy!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe med student replied and said English isn‚Äôt their  first language and they in fact did not get it right based on a misinterpretation.\n\nYeah like everybody else said it‚Äôs great your boss cared, don‚Äôt be embarrassed, it‚Äôs such a difficult thing to be dealing with and there shouldn‚Äôt be any embarrassment for it happening cuz you cannot control it when it comes to\n\nYo! This is insane. The same thing just happened to me today.\n\nI have a perfectly normal start to my day, feeling good. I get into the office and work as usual and then I get a completely unimportant phone call that I fumble a tiny bit. I'm awkward on the phone. This sends me. I get a headache, I'm thinking it's an aneurysm for some reason, I start sweating, I tense up, I think I'm about to pass out and I just can't ground myself.\n\nLike you say the worst part might be the embarrassment. Can my coworkers notice? Do they see me hunched over in my chair all tense not doing anything? Haha.\n\nI'm very new to anxiety but I already had 3 or 4 episodes so I was fairly sure that I wasn't going to die but man the embarrassment...\n\nI have an even worse story. I have an attack in the middle of the night. I struggle to fall asleep again and boom it's 6am, gotta get ready for work. There is no way. I can't work 8h without sleeping. S*hould've just called in sick, idiot* So I sleep in, walk in late, go to my boss and apologize for coming in late. I live in Germany and I don't even know what anxiety is in German so I blurt out \"I had fear in the night, couldn't sleep, sorry\". He was probably as confused as me so at the end of the day he says \"Have a good weekend and good dreams without nightmares\". BRO!!! He thought I came late because of a nightmare. I feel too much shame to talk about this so I just left it there. He's a good boss but he must think that I'm insane now.\n\nAnyway. As someone who has experienced an anxiety attack I have nothing but compassion for you. If other people knew how bad it can feel they wouldn't look down on you. I won't feel embarrassed if you won't!\n\nCould be worse. I was once threatened by a doctor that they'd have the police come and arrest me for having an anxiety attack while I was in the emergency room.\n\nCome on now, you can‚Äôt just leave it here we need details\n\nDetails? Had Covid and a badly sprained ankle. I could barely walk and not far. Woke up one morning and couldn't breathe. I was told that I needed to call 911 so I did. Ambulance came and the panic set in. They said my vitals were going crazy. They got me into the emergency room. The panic was so bad I felt like I was going to faint. The breathing issue did not help.\n\nThey brought out a wheelchair and the nurse told me if I fell she'd just leave me on the floor. They wanted to do blood work and such and I asked them if they could give me a moment to collect myself and get the panic under control. They said no. This was refusal of service and they were going to discharge me. I tried to explain that I just needed time to get the panic attack under control. I wanted to get checked out but I needed to stop feeling like I was going to pass out.\n\nThey didn't listen. They told me I needed to collect myself and agree to leave or they'd have me arrested. I had no choice. I agreed. The doctor threw the discharge papers in my face and the nurse threw my backpack at me so hard it knocked some of the wind out of me. They wheeled me into the waiting room. For four hours I sat there trying not to faint and waiting for my ride.\n\nWhat!!!!\n\nWow. That‚Äôs such a nice doctor. Great person.\n\nThe people need details!\n\nAnytime I have a panic attack at work I very specifically tell them not to call an ambulance unless I pass out or I specifically ask for it. The last thing I need is the american healthcare system getting involved and fucking my anxiety up even worse.\n\nYou can play it off as something physically was wrong,  I mean they don't see the results of the hospital tests.\n\nI was thinking the same thing! Do they know it was a panic attack? Otherwise OP could blame it on low blood sugar, migraine, reaction to new medication etc\n\nDefinitely don‚Äôt be embarrassed. It‚Äôs good that your boss cared enough to get you checked out. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to judge you at all.\n\nAre they sending you the medical bill? If so, I would be more pissed than embarrassed unless you have really good insurance. I know they were trying to do the right thing, but if that were me and they stuck me with the crippling debt of an ambulance ride, I'd almost be inclined to sue üòÖ\n\nIf they are paying for it, it may be a little embarrassing, but at least you got some vital information about your health and that you're doing well you wouldn't have gotten otherwise!\n\nThis was my first thought if OP is American. Ambulance rides don‚Äôt come cheap. People here with bad or no insurance will literally put off vital health care and hope things work themselves out to avoid incurring those medical bills.\n\nAmbulance rides are the biggest scam in America.  Almost $5,000 for the last one I had taken.  We should have just driven ourselves.\n\nI may have misread, but I don‚Äôt think OP took an ambulance ride. Their mom picked them up. So it‚Äôs oftentimes a much different story on cost. \n\nBut even still, what else should they have done? The ambulance is there to save lives and help people in desperate need. The number one rule in first aid and emergency training is always call 911.\n\nThey went to the hospital in an ambulance. Their mom picked them up and took them home when they were released from the ER.\n\nGod I swear I read that twice and somehow missed that. Guess that‚Äôs what I get for reading while I‚Äôm in a store. But anyhow. Thanks for explaining because this comment was too far down for me to feel justified in scrolling all the way back up to check again and then all the way back down, instead of downvoting me.\n\nThat‚Äôs a kind thing to do, if you‚Äôre not able to function, it‚Äôs okay to get help. Sounds like a compassionate boss, to be honest, at least in this regard. \n\nIt might help him to evaluate the pressure he‚Äôs putting on you, but if not, it might be worth a conversation about what you need from him in the relationship. Calmer emails, talks in person, less work, additional hires? Good chance to reflect and share about what‚Äôs not working for you. A good boss will work FOR their employees, not against them. And his response demonstrates that he is at least willing to take compassionate action in a crisis situation. This may extend more generally to your work as well if you can talk about it. \n\nBest of luck, and hope you feel better today\n\nI think sometimes it's good for people to see what anxiety can look like, and how it is out of your control - as it's often invisible to an outsider. It's good they took your health seriously. You should not feel embarrassed, I hope you're feeling better :)\n\nNo. Times are tough. I think we‚Äôre all falling apart a little. You‚Äôre human and anxiety is no joke. Nothing to be embarrassed about. Take care of yourself.\n\nHave you done a full blood panel to check for diabetes? I don't think it's a coincidence you started feeling better after the gateraid, could have been low bloodsugar or an electrolyte imbalance,  wich can happen from poor diet, dehydration, or even caffien even if there is no underlying condition.\n\nUgh don‚Äôt be embarrassed it happens to a lot of us.\n\nSorry I don't want to come out as rude or insensitive but can you please explain or someone what happens in a panic attack.\n\nWhenever I am searching for jobs and I can't find any or receive no call back, and when I wake up the next day. I feel shaky, tensed and all anxious very bad.\n\nYesterday due to some fight in my home with my mother screaming, I was almost sleepy before he screaming happened but after that I was crying, and then caught up with an headache and then later after so many hours of trouble sleeping I slept. But in the middle of the sleep I felt a trembling/vibration in my chest area and idk üòîüò≠ I just want to know what is this jittering is? Is this what a panic attack is? I was also wanted to sleep early and wake up early to go somewhere important\n\nNo that‚Äôs anxiety.  Panic attacks are bodily responses to literally zero external stimulus.  Nothing wrong is happening around you.  You‚Äôre fine one minute.  The next minute, for me, my heart is racing, my left arm goes numb, I get sick to my stomach, sometimes I can‚Äôt breathe, I tremble, sweat, feel like I might throw up‚Äî it‚Äôs the heart racing and arm numbness and being sure you‚Äôre having a heart attack that‚Äôs scariest.   Sometimes I can get a Xanax down bc I feel it coming on; sometimes it hits me too fast for anything to stop it.  But it isn‚Äôt caused by anything externally upsetting‚Äîthat‚Äôs an anxiety attack.\n\nAh ü§ïü•πüò≠üíîüò© this broke my heart. More power to you üíñ and please take care of yourself, love yourself üíñ.\n\nAnd sometimes I get such anxiety even without any external factors, no one said anything, no fight. Could this then include panik attack?\n\nPanic attack is still a medical event. Would you be embarrassed if you add a heart attack? Heart attack, nervous system attack, asthma attack, all are health conditions.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMight be harmful if the person has an underlying heart condition.  (Not trying to be a jerk towards you ‚ù§Ô∏è)\n\nThis happened to my friend about a year ago. She is a lawyer and it happened during a deposition. She was so embarrassed, but it‚Äôs truly nothing to be embarrassed about. Plus, it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs business what caused you to leave in ambulance. At least they cared enough to call it for you. Don‚Äôt worry about it. If they asked what happened, just say they aren‚Äôt sure yet, but you are feeling better.\n\nHey EMT here, definitely nothing to be embarrassed about. We run a lot of silly calls and this doesn‚Äôt sound silly at all. We‚Äôre here for people who need help and it sounds like you needed some help.\n\nThanks that‚Äôs reassuring. I just feel like ima show my face at work &amp; everyone is gonna ask how I‚Äôm doing over a panic attack.\n\nAlso happy cake day!\n\nFuck no. That scared your boss. Maybe he/she will notice the crushing workload by SEEING your physical response.\n\nI had the same thing happen at work!! I pissed blood, absolutely freaked out, had a panic attack. They called an ambulance on me too. I ended up going to the hospital by ambulance and all they discovered was a UTI üòÇ Shit happens. I always try and change the lens when I start to worry about what other people are thinking of me. Like‚Ä¶if I saw someone who looked unwell and was scared and possibly needed emergency assistance, would I be laughing or judging them? No. Anxiety sucks!\n\nWhat‚Äôs embarrassing is having panic attacks when you‚Äôre perfectly fine no problems whatsoever lol would happen to me all the time. I have been on Prozac for 11 years I still will have a panic attack if things get to me like too many things building up in the day that are emotionally taxing to me but other than that I‚Äôm great. I‚Äôve learned my body is just freaking out because of my thoughts. And my thoughts are just thoughts my brain makes.\n\nDon't be embarrassed.  To be honest, your boss sounds great and was concerned enough to call the ambulance for you.  Those typical symptoms for you looks like a different health concern to other folks so I would prefer they err on the side of caution there.\n\nThis incident may have helped your boss understand this more and potentially find ways to reduce stress at work.  \n\nHope you're doing better now!\n\nDon‚Äôt be embarrassed! This happened to me two weeks ago but I didn‚Äôt go to the ER. I actually work at a hospital. I started to have a bad panic attack. Sweating, increased heart rate, shaking, couldn‚Äôt stand up, dizzy. I had to lay down in the doctor‚Äôs office on a couch. In the moment I was so embarrassed but then I realized that I shouldn‚Äôt be. The people at my job who care for me will understand what I‚Äôm going through and screw what others think. We shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed of it!\n\nNope. Never feel embarrassed. I wear it as a badge now. It fucking sucks. It's the badge of shit. But you know what it is. Tell people, \"Panic attack...talk me down I'm good\"\n\nI went into the EMS after flagging a security guard down today because I didn't want to emergency xanax my way through the day. They brought me in, EMS talked and breathed me down. I was okay. I still am feeling off. But it is what it is. I'm sorry we both have this.\n\nPanic attacks aren't like the movies. At least not for me. No \"heavy panting and feeling like you can't breathe\" type shit. \n\nNo, for me they're physically painful. Always centered directly within my gut. Profuse sweating, intense, dull, abdominal pain, extreme nausea, maybe a couple bouts of vomiting. I can't stress how bad it is. Every time I have an \"episode\" I thought I might die. I know that's a hallmark of panic attacks but THAT's how insidious they are. Even though I'd been through it a million times the symptoms didn't change. And with the vomiting, stomach pain, and nausea, I just thought I had some rare gut-related illness. Despite a perfect workup every time. And this is someone with a history of pancreatitis\n\nDon't feel ashamed. Please. Nobody needs to even know why you were there. And even if they do, I consider a panic attack a psychiatric crisis; and the feeling of dread + despair mixed with feeling like you're going to die... it's a worthy reason to get an ambulance.\n\nYour company should feel embarrassed for pushing their employee to this point. It sounds like it was a traumatic experience, I hope you‚Äôre doing ok and have support. You have NOTHING to be embarrassed about.\n\nNot to give you another panic attack, but I'm just curious how much all that cost, if you dont mind. üò¨\n\nAlso, the fire/ paramedics didn't show up? In my neck of the woods the firemen/paramedics do everything and the ambulance just sits there in case you need to go to the hospital.\n\nIt says his boss called 911 which sends the ambulance. When they check you out in the ambulance you can say you don‚Äôt want to go to the hospital and that you‚Äôre fine, which is called a refusal.\n\nI think that was an cool move on your boss. \n\nPanic attacks are a bitch. But he did what he thought it was right.\n\nAlso happened to me at work, my managers had to call me an ambulance too and I spent the rest of the day in hospital getting my vitals checked. Panic attacks are the worst, they literally make you feel like you‚Äôre dying even if you feel fine. It‚Äôs debilitating. I was so embarrassed too and felt like I wasted the paramedics time, but they assured me not to feel bad, it happens and we can‚Äôt control it\n\nMonday nite and last nite.   I went to bed with a smile on my face   decent day.   Just to be woken at 1130pm full blown panic attacks.  Missed work Tuesday.  And nearly missed today.     This never ends.\n\nI ended up in the hospital on a field visit with two new staff after having a severe panic attack. I‚Äôm sure that made a great impression. Shit happens, mental illness awareness has never been better. I don‚Äôt even attempt to hide it anymore and I have found some relief in that.\n\nYou had symptoms of a potential heart attack and your boss cared about you.\n\nIf it had been a heart attack he would have saved your life, and the best thing for everyone in this situation was that it was only a panic attack, as painful as it is.\n\nI'm sure everyone is just glad it didn't turn out worse and there's no reason to be embarrassed.\n\nI've had an ambulance called twice because of a panic attack. It's only embarrassing for us. The other people just want to know you're okay. I'd just let them know you're okay and you must have had a panic attack. Guarantee you they're not going to judge you or treat you differently.\n\nSimilar thing happened to me when I was 35. I was watching a video about a YouTuber that was talking about heart attack symptoms and of course, my anxiety brain just went from 0-60 (neighbor and my wife's uncle died of a clogged heart a few weeks before this) and I felt a panic attack coming on so I got up and tried shaking it off with my arms. Then I started to feel like passing out. Hearing and vision was deteriorating which freaked me out more. Coworker told me to sit down and then asked if I wanted him to call for help on the radio. I hesitated and then said yes. I felt really embarrassed because the whole plant knows now. Safety guy, my boss, 2 other supervisors come down and by that time I'm better but drenched in sweat sitting on the floor feeling absolutely stupid that it was a panic attack.\n\nSo yeah, it's embarrassing but all the people around you are your work family and care for you. They're much happier that it was a false alarm than being something more serious.\n\nI hate it when I have those numb hand symptoms and nausea. I try to think of positive health mantras or start humming songs, that keeps me distracted.¬†\n\nNo but I know how you feel. I had a panic attack at work and I was having trouble processing a transaction. I couldn‚Äôt see hands started shaking, couldn‚Äôt type. I pushed through and then told my coworker I didn‚Äôt feel good. I showed her my heart rate on my Fitbit which was 138. They sat me down, told me to drink some green tea and a granola bar. \n\nMy boss wanted me to go back to work but I wasn‚Äôt feeling right. I went to the ER and got checked out and was fine. I went back today and felt super anxious but pushed through. I started taking the Olly stress gummies which have helped a bit. \n\nI was so embarrassed I could not do my job and had to leave early. I really hope that doesn‚Äôt happen again.üò≠\n\nI have Atarax. Works so well but damn it makes me sleepy so I only take a 4th of the pill.\n\nThat‚Äôs what I do with my seroquel. I take it for sleep, and only take a 1/4 of it and it knocks me out.\n\nYou have no reason to be embarrassed. You need to take steps to address why this is happening to you. That will probably involve a chat with your boss about why work is so stressful for you.\nIf you carry on like this you run the risk of burnout.\nYour panick attacks are your body telling you it can't handle what you are going through. It's important to address the root cause. Take care.\n\nDon't be embarrassed. I had a massive panic attack out of the blue at work month or so ago. \n\nWent to the bathroom stall, tried some breathing exercises to calm down, passed out in the floor of the bathroom stall. \n\nI felt embarrassed, left, called 911 as a non emergency so they could check my vitals at home, and was fine. \n\nPeople care which is why they called in the first place. Remember, not everyone is familiar with panic attacks and have no idea how to handle them. I'd just explain more about them to the folks who tried to help and you will feel more confident about it.\n\nI think many of us here can relate to your embarrassment here and I've definitely been there. It's hard to contain feelings like these physically, and after a certain point it just spirals out of control. I luckily haven't been hauled away in an ambulance, but I've had dozens of doctors and plenty of of clinical tests reveal that there's \"absolutely nothing\" wrong with me.\n\nThe mind is a powerful, awesome machine and our brain chemistry controls every aspect of our being, not just our physical self. Although anxiety affects many of us deeply, the best we can do is practice the mental exercise of choosing how we allow it to affect us.\n\nas someone who has had public panic attacks, i can tell you that it is extremely vulnerable and it‚Äôs okay to feel what you‚Äôre feeling, but i highly doubt anyone is judging you. what would you do if someone you worked with was having an asthma attack, or an allergic reaction? would you judge them for a medical condition that they cannot control and that actively makes them feel like they are dying? anxiety is a very real, very physical disorder. i hope you can find some peace.\n\nI‚Äôm out at a farmers market right now &amp; feel like I‚Äôm having trouble breathing walking around. I‚Äôm figured I had to get out of the house and do something because me laying around wasn‚Äôt solving anything. I feel fine sitting at the house.. not sure what happened lately. I always feel like I go through phases of this. It‚Äôll come and go. It‚Äôs extremely annoying\n\nI went through the same some time ago and now I'm just more sensitive to people that go through the some situation and I try to help them. Your body reacted that way for a reason and you shouldn't feel bad for it.\n\nI understand. Don't feel embarrassed or get upset with yourself. This condition usually happens to very caring people. I'm one of them. You are not a freak but aniexty is the monster. I know it's embarrassing and no one understands until they go through a panic attack and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.¬†\nIts takes the energy out of you and you feel like you've been hit by a 18 wheeler!¬†\nI would advise you to go see your doctor and tell him/her. There is medication that can help you through this rough time. It may make you feel worse in the beginning but I promise you it gets better, actually I will swear üòâ just remember you are Not losing your mind and there is help. You are a sensitive person and we are the ones that seem to have panic attacks.¬†\nWRG\n\nYour boss should feel embarrassed not you. These folks work for others and want others to do work like if we‚Äôre machines! They should be shameful. I was going through stress my last job and I had to walkout and quit. Stress shouldn‚Äôt be a thing in our everyday life routine.\n\nHey! Sorry you had a panic attack. I can totally relate to this. I have a VERY similar experience- both at work and in the gym. BUT I never felt embarrassed. And you shouldn't either. The thing is, nobody else knows what it's like for you. They'll just want you to be okay. They don't know the details. If somebody is not well and an ambulance arrives, that's just normal - it's a duty of care. Nothing odd about that. Seriously, don't give it a thought. I've had some situations that I look back on and I think that most other people would feel mortified about having a panic attack in the situations I was in, but I don't care, for the reasons above. It's all cool. Glad you're okay üëçüëçüíØ\n\nI think most people on this subreddit can relate to that feeling. I went to the ER earlier this year for a \"blood clot\" that turned out to be a sprained ankle. It's not your fault that you're under so much stress and your brain reacted accordingly, that can happen to people even without anxiety. Nothing to be ashamed of, don't beat yourself up\n\nDon‚Äôt feel embarrassed! I once went through a similar thing. However, instead of having my boss seeing it, it would be my friend‚Äôs relatives (whom i barely knew). It wasn‚Äôt a bad anxiety attack either üò≠ I was just having palpitations but my health anxiety convinced me that I was dying so they brought me to the ER üò≠\n\nResults were pristine, good, amazing even‚Äî but I was crying my entire stay there because of how embarrassing and stressful it was to take up space there .\n\nDon‚Äôt feel embarrassed. Stuff like this happens and it‚Äôs great you have a boss/coworker that cares for your wellbeing.\n\nI was having panic attacks at work for a long time before the tipping point for the big one and the ambulance got called. Mine was all down to a horrible boss who found fault in everything I did (she mistakes were also my fault) \n\nThat was the point I knew I would never work for her again and was off on sick leave for the better part of a year because of it.\n\nDon‚Äôt put off your health because of embarrassment. If you had a heart attack you wouldn‚Äôt just take a day and go back to work with no changes, you need to address your mental health.\n\nYour boss needs to manage better to take the stress off of you or you need a new job, if you carry on like you are then this will keep happening\n\nNo need to be embarrassed, they saw you needed help and intervened.\nI‚Äôve hidden under my desk during an exceptionally bad panic attack.. we shame ourselves more than others ever will for our issues. Remember to be kind to yourself.\n\nDon‚Äôt feel embarrassed. The ambulance was called for me multiple times in back high school since they didn‚Äôt know how to deal with panic attacks, which made me panic even more. I don‚Äôt believe 15 and 35 is very different in terms of getting panic attacks‚Äî it can happen to anyone and it‚Äôs not embarrassing.\n\nDon't feel embarrassed. One time at work a combative employee made such a stir over a personal conflict with me that a special meeting had to be called with the directors. This guy started off the meeting yelling at me and I got so anxious that I tried to respond but instead passed out cold. Everyone was worried about me because I just fell over asleep for about 30 seconds. My doctor gave me a cardiac stress test and I did great. It was determined to just be a syncope from the stress of that moment. Nobody blamed me for it. The jerk eventually got fired for his conduct.\n\nSame thing happens to me last December, don't be embarrassed and embrace the thoughtfulness of your staff as you would help them when they need it.\n\nNever feel embarrassed even though it‚Äôs what us anxious people feel best.\n\nThe ones who should be embarrassed are the ones who pass judgement on someone for experiencing and struggling through a mental health crisis. I would never wish anything like this on to another person, and feeling compassion for those who struggle is what is needed\n\nYou're stressed at work.\nYou had a medical event that everyone saw and now they understand is a proper medical event. \nIf there's ONE thing.....one tiny sliver of goodness in my poor mental health it's that when other people see it's a true medical issue, I can leverage it to get the help I need.\n\nTalk to your doctor about a letter for stress leave if your work is extremely too much. If it's not just a note that you may need medical accommodations at work would help you. Take things slower and get back in control.\n\nEmbarassed? Heck no.\nBut use this as a sign to get better.\n\nIt is unfortunately part of the affliction to find something like this humiliating from your own perspective. But the best way to help yourself get over that is to think about if things were in reverse. If you were the one who had to call, would you be judging the other person? Also in my experience, a person who knows to call people for a severe panic attack - because that‚Äôs sometimes the only way to get someone out of one - is not often a person who will judge. Judgmental people would have ignored you or told you to go home, oftentimes. \n\nDon‚Äôt worry too much about it. If they treat you negatively after this, you know it‚Äôs not an environment for you. If they don‚Äôt, or if they check up on you and ask how you‚Äôre doing, it‚Äôs a safe place.\n\nPanic attacks are the absolute worst and freakin scary. It does feel a bit like you're having a heart attack. I'm sorry that this happened to you, but at the same time you have nothing to be ashamed about. This happens to millions of people.\n\nWhy did you find Atarax amazing?\n\nJust calmed me down within 10 minutes. Now granted I couldn‚Äôt drive after taking it. But it definitely helps with relaxing. A plus side is it‚Äôs also not a habit forming drug like Xanax, etc. the hospital gave me a scrip to take as needed when I feel one coming on. It‚Äôs not for every day use because you can build a tolerance to it and it won‚Äôt work.\n\nWhat dose?\n\n 25mg\n\nI had an almost identical experience while at work, you shouldn‚Äôt feel embarrassed at all I mean I did at the time but literally all the guys from work were supportive and stuff afterwards which was nice for saying the kind of work environment I‚Äôm in is like real hard ass dudes you know? But even some of the HUGE built, real headstrong guys have said they have had similar stuff in the past and it‚Äôs completely normal which kind of made me feel more at ease with the whole thing. \nI hope you are feeling better!\n\nDude I have panic attack disorder too, you got to leave work for a while &amp; get some nice relaxing drugs. Double win.\n\nThis might be a way of your body telling you that you‚Äôre very stressed and need some exercise/\nother ways to cope better.\n\nNo, don‚Äôt feel embarrassed. \nMost people have their first serious panic attack, and end up calling EMS. My husband witnessed my first serious panic attack, and he thought I was dying of a heart attack or something, so he called EMS while we were already on the way to the hospital. I was passing out on the way, so that‚Äôs why he pulled the car over. \nIt‚Äôs nothing to be embarrassed about. It happens all the time ü©∑\n\nMedical condition\n\nFor what it‚Äôs worth I totally get the embarrassment. I‚Äôd never judge someone for going through mental health emergencies‚Ä¶but when I have‚Ä¶.i want to crawl in a hole and never come out. I don‚Äôt think we should feel that shame but it‚Äôs next to impossible. But as you process just know everyone just wants you to be okay.\n\nPlease dont feel embarrassed. I haven't had an ambulance called on me but I've had terrible panic attacks at work and I promise you, any decent person (like your boss) just wants to make sure you're okay and healthy. Panic attacks are no joke, and observers can definitely think something more is happening because they're so powerful. \n\nI was honestly deeply moved by how nice my colleagues and manager were to me after I returned to work after a bad spell. They were so lovely and accommodating. You will be surprised by how understanding people can be.\n\nNo you shouldn‚Äôt feel embarrassed. It‚Äôs probably even happened to some of your colleagues before.\n\nI‚Äôve called the ambulance literally hundreds of times in public and at home, even gotten random strangers to do it for me.\n\nMany people‚Äôs first panic attacks involve calling an ambulance / going to the ER too.\n\nNever feel embarrassed for having a health condition, mental, physical or both.\n\nNo, don‚Äôt feel embarrassed man. This happened to me once - I was working as a server at a restaurant and my manger called an ambulance and the entire restaurant along with my co workers watched me have a panic attack and go in the ambulance. It is what it is, they were probably just scared for your safety more than anything. You were just getting the help you needed\n\nInget the feeling but You have some good colleagues that care for you. They were concerned and they want you to feel good.\n\nGet a script for lorazepam\n\nUse this incident to your advantage and maybe the boss will ease up on making your stressed out. I had an experience like this once, went to ER, was fine and was prescribed Atarax. I cut the pills in half cause they made me drowsy. What do you like about it? Makes you feel calm?¬†\n\nYea it made me feel calm, not ‚Äúcare‚Äù so much. My only concern is I do HVAC &amp; not sure it‚Äôll be the best thing for me to take on the job.\n\nThere isn‚Äôt an age limit on panic attacks, please don‚Äôt feel embarrassed. Also, panic attack and heart attack symptoms are very similar. Based on the symptoms you described, I would‚Äôve called an ambulance too. It‚Äôs not worth chancing it\n\nI take atarax regularly for panic attacks and it works wonders if you get the timing right. I do get a bit woozy tho.\n\nYea, it was great when they gave it to me. I do hvac work, so I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll be the best thing for me to take at work. \n\nI do hope this Prozac starts to kick in soon and actually helps. It‚Äôs been 9 days today I‚Äôve been on it.\n\nI take sertralin and quetiapin and I barely have panic attacks anymore. \n\nUsually SSRI takes 2 weeks to kick, I am sure you know that lol \n\nI hope it works for you and especially soon\n\nCan Atarax cause addiction like Xanax etc?\n\nNo, it‚Äôs supposed to be non addictive. Atleast based on what I‚Äôve been told &amp; read.\n\nI might have to try it then, thanks! I hope you feel better soon &lt;3\n\nI totally understand feeling embarrassed. Before I graduated, my anxiety became increasingly severe my junior and senior year. Depending on how bad my anxiety was, I was either in the nurses office or the counselors office multiple times a week. I felt awful because I was in there so much‚Ä¶ I felt like it was too excessive, or that I was being too much. Regardless, my nurses and counselor always helped me when I did have panic attacks.\n\nStill feel embarrassed about it lol, but I realized that my nurses and counselor actually did care about me and were just as worried as I was. They always welcomed me when I needed it most, and never became overwhelmed when I would have a panic attack in their office. So‚Ä¶ I was very embarrassed, but when I realized that they were just happy to help, I became a bit less embarrassed and just embraced the fact that I do have panic attacks and those panic attacks are out of my control, for the most part. Just apart of having anxiety.\n\nIt seems like your boss was just doing what anyone naturally does while someone else is panicking. They just wanted to make sure you were all right, and that your panic attack wasn‚Äôt a medical emergency. I‚Äôm sure your boss does not think any less of you because of it.\n\nSounds like you need to do better personal safety planning around your anxiety attacks. You need to learn how to triage yourself and know when to send yourself home early so that isn‚Äôt happening AT work. Anxiety days are ‚Äúcall in sick‚Äù days if this is the outcome from you powering through. \n\nEmbarrassment aside, that was a very *expensive* anxiety attack if you rode in an ambulance. Your boss did the right thing given the circumstances. But you yourself can plan better and avoid stuff like this.\n\nAllow yourself space for understanding, we're the hardest judges on ourselves. I think most of the people were more worried for you than judging you. It's okay, services are there to be of use.\n\nThis isn't a joke but i have this weird feeling that i like when someone knows that I'm sick lol. It makes me feel mysterious and people exert lesser expectations on me which is what i wanted\n\nPlease remove the embarrassment from the equation. I talk from experience cause I really struggle to not feel the embarrassment of my own insecurities or panic attacks, but the fact is that what we live is already hard as it is, why would we put a whole other level of difficulty on top of that? Embarrassment has no room in self-acceptance. Instead look at yourself and praise yourself for doing what you have to do, for being brave, for going on in spite of the shadow that is our anxiety. We are amazing, you are amazing! ü©∑\n\nDon‚Äôt feel bad for what others think.\n\nDon't be embarrassed, its nothing you can help and its good to know your buddies were willing to get you help. I'm sure they understand, and I wish you the best with ur journey and hope u get better :)\n\nHydroxyzine amazing? lol alprazolam and benzos are yeah¬†\n\nEmbarrassed? No.\n\nYour boss and co-workers IMHO did the \"right-ish\" thing to do in the event of a potential medical emergency, they didn't likely know you were having a panic attack and a lot of the symptoms can look like something far more severe (heart attack most commonly).\n\nThey did what was best for your care, which was getting you medical support.\n\nEspecially at 35... where a heart attack is more likely than a panic attack.\n\nThey also likely did that for liability reasons, they can't have an employee just dying in the office/shop/etc because it'll be a workplace incident.\n\nDon‚Äôt be embarrassed but I would‚Äôve refused going to the hospital when everything was fine with your vitals and you knew it was a panic attack. The bill will prob give you another one\n\nCall an ambulance???? In America he might as well have fired you since they'll steal your life savings and future wages for a decade for daring to seek healthcare. So the person responsible for your stress also makes a decision on your behalf that harms you financially. Fuck these pricks man"

    "all_comment_text": "I'm 31.  \nI was anxiety free until I graduated college.  Then 2020.  Moved back in to my parents' house.  Then became very depressed and anxious.  Then i started sleeping in later and later and later.  The anxiety makes me so tired that it infuriates me!!  \n  I feel like i'm 12 again most days.\n\nSomewhat similar to me, anxiety started 2nd year I moved out for college, moved back home..been struggling ever since and essentially housebound since. That was 19 years ago......Luckily I was able to get my first job 2 years ago and it hasn't gotten any easier.\n\nWow. What do you do at work?  \nI hate being home-- it makes me feel more depressed.\n\nI ended up getting laid off of it this year but I was working on a hobby farm, so I was by myself just tending the vegetable rows. I'm sad it ended as I don't know where or how else I'll get another job. Thinking of trying to apply to be an overnight janitor. But since then I've been pretty much stuck at home entire time.\n\nI wish I had the talent to start a youtube channel.\n\n[removed]\n\nYour post was removed due to low karma and/or low account age.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Anxiety) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nYes I feel this way all the time. It‚Äôs kinda frustrating because you‚Äôd think with more experience, we would feel wiser and more resilient. But every year I am more of an anxious mess. More to lose. Lower threshold for stress. More inevitable worries (like aging parents or pets). I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve made it this far. I felt like 5 years ago I was less anxious than now (still anxious but it wasn‚Äôt this bad) but at the time k was just too naive to know any better. I also felt like my family were a support system that were my fallback or safety blanket. But now I can‚Äôt rely on them for hardly anything. If anything I fear I will need to take care of them and I won‚Äôt be able to. I don‚Äôt know how to get better.\n\nThis is the same for me. I had minor anxiety in high school but as soon as I graduated and moved away from home it felt like it fit infinitely worse. I still call my mom like every other day when I'm having a panic attack or need someone to talk to. I feel like a child again even though she's so supportive. Scared this will never go away and my adulthood anxiety will only get worse as I get older.\n\nThis is very much me.  Unfortunately, I've seen some of these anxieties realized.  My dad died my senior year in HS.  And my mom passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2017.  For much of my adult life my mom was my fallback/safety blanket.  Now she's gone.  I'm married, but my wife doesn't get it.  She's supportive in her own way, but her reactions to my anxiety and agoraphobia are net stressors.  I look back at times when I was less stressful and functional and feel like I'm remembering a different me.  Anyway, at 46 things definitely don't seem to be improving.\n\nI'm 52, and I feel this way. You literally described exactly what I'm going through. ü§Ø\n\nYes! Sometimes when I‚Äôm anxious I feel like I can‚Äôt do the simplest things and it‚Äôs so embarrassing\n\nOh absolutely. I was just thinking about that the other day. One of the things I hate the most about anxiety attacks is how vulnerable they make me, as if I'm 6 years old all over again and begging for reassurance from \"adults\". It puts me in such a disadvantage. For good or ill there are very few people I turn to in these cases (and most of them are professional) but even the thought of being perceived this way makes me angry and sad.\n\nthis is exactly how i feel! you are not alone and i‚Äôm 25 lol. def relate to asking for permission or just making sure.\n\nYes absolutely. For me it‚Äôs everything you said but your friends also infantalizing you but instead it‚Äôs the way they see you and think about you. One of my friends told me point blank that her and my other friend thought of me as the baby of the group, which I hate. Sucks cause that was an important friends for me and it hurt.\n\nYessss omg, I wish more people understood when I act all awkward and childish, unable to make my own decisions and stuff. I'm only like that when I'm feeling anxious tho, although that is most of the time now:(\nIt made me quit my job! The team I had around me were super judgemental and I felt myself start regressing into a child, making them even more confused and mean towards me, so i quit and went back to my parents bc i literally felt like a little child that needed their parents haha. Still too scared to get another job...\nAnyway, thanks for making me feel less aloneüòÖ\n\nyes, all the time. I'm often scared that I'll be caught for something and get in trouble. why, at the age of 20, am I scared of doing basic, human things? not sure. the other day I was worried I was going to get in trouble because I got up to use the bathroom at night 3 times. I didn't make any loud noises but I thought that someone was going to get up and yell at me.\n\nYES. I have so much trouble with this. \n\nI often find that I regress to thinking and acting like a child (sometimes even talking like one) when I am feeling overwhelmed/anxious. I just kind of ‚Äúglitch out‚Äù and cry and panic and don‚Äôt know what to do. Or I overthink at a million miles a minute and end up in decision paralysis hell. I also still feel like I need to call and ask my parents‚Äô permission before making any consequential decision.\n\nOne of the places I struggle the most is with interpreting verbal instructions. I almost always ask for clarification, sometimes multiple times, which makes me anxious because I feel stupid and annoying but I really need the confirmation/repetition. I get really anxious if the directions aren‚Äôt specific enough (Did I hear them right?  Did I interpret what they said correctly?)  Anytime there‚Äôs an assumption I need to make, I panic unless I have someone to reassure me it‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm doing the right thing.  I get so anxious I nearly pee myself (no, really) every time I have to do a new task on my own. I always take notes on what people are saying so that I can reassure myself, but even that isn‚Äôt always effective, because I start wondering if I even heard them right when I made the note.\n\nIt sucks because I feel like people view me as a child\n\noh god, via text or email, I am okay, but when my boss gives me verbal instructions I instant panic and go into autopilot\n\nYes. And both my therapist and my best friend often reminds me this is a very wrong definition of adulthood. Anxiety isn‚Äôt exclusive to childhood. We just have an unrealistic expectation from adulthood.\n\nI felt this way recently. The feeling of not being able to act like my age has gotten me chained to anxiety and paralyzed\n\nThat‚Äôs how I feel like with my anxiety/OcD and adhd. Especially when I was getting screamed at it would feel like age regress it was awful.\n\nYes. You're definitely not alone in this. I used to have a professional job, I used to be able to do simple things like go to the store by myself.\n\nYep. It sucks\n\nI feel like it‚Äôs forcing me to allow people to take advantage of me in a lot of situations because I think I‚Äôm Trippin all the time. I hate this.\n\nThat's exactly how I feel. Worst part is the image I have of myself is that of kid who has no experience in anything and who is always less than anyone else. (I am almost 30 now though)\n\nYes, because the symptoms of an anxiety disorder are the same as being shy, nervous, or afraid, all shared symptoms with the social ineptitude of children. To someone who does not know, a person with an anxiety disorder could appear very similar to a childish person. Sometimes we make this mistake ourselves. It is why many people confuse actual anxiety disorders with people who simply need to \"man up\" or \"toughen up\" or \"pull up your bootstraps\" or \"face your fears\", \"touch grass\", etc., because it can appear at face value to be very similar to exactly that, people who actually do need to do all of those things. The difference is that people with actual anxiety disorders generally have already done all of those things and still have issues, and require treatment and learning ways to function and live while having the issues.\n\nYup. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in therapy\n\n‚Ä¶. Now I do. I have a really hard time calling and scheduling appointments and things like that too.\n\nThough last week, I found I needed to modify some of our infrastructure to get my code to run (I‚Äôm not new, I have 17 years of experience.) I had typed in teams to ask permission and then I realized my lead wasn‚Äôt on and I wasn‚Äôt going to get to do what I needed to do if I waited so I just edited my question into a statement and made the change. I felt very proud of myself.\n\nI‚Äôm 38 and I stutter. I feel mature enough to make decisions and give advice, and people say I‚Äôm smart. But I get scared when I have to talk to others, especially strangers, even just to order coffee or give my name for medication. I feel relieved when I can handle things online without speaking, but I sometimes lose money to avoid interactions. I feel ashamed and useless when someone has to help me in simple situations. I‚Äôve accomplished a lot, but I know if I‚Äôd been braver, I could have done even more.\n\nI‚Äôm 24, and feel the exact same way when my anxiety ramps up bad. It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm devolving, going backwards\n\nYes I feel the same way. My bf is so supportive sometimes too supportive that it has gotten to the point of me not being able to drive alone or go grocery shopping alone cuz he always wants to do those things for me. Not I work remotely cuz I‚Äôm afraid to drive into the city. I stay at my parents house when he can‚Äôt stay with me cuz I‚Äôm afraid to be home alone cuz I‚Äôm worried about having a panic attack. Definitely feels like I‚Äôm becoming a child and I‚Äôm scared to get older and still have this midnsrt\n\nYup yup yup!!\n\nI'm 26 and very dependant on my mum, she's my safe person so my anxiety isn't so bad if she's with me.\nShe'll often speak to people for me because I get anxious about  talking.\n\nI feel like I'm so behind everyone else as well and like there are children who are more independent/capable than I amüôÉ\n\nNearly 30 and I struggle to make a phone call or write an email without help üôÉ\nThanks anxiety\n\nYes. It is also because a lot of our anxiety is rooted in unhealed wounds of inner child and inner teen. That‚Äôs why it is necessary to address this and heal to feel more confidence in self and live a fulfilling life. \n\nI did somatic exercises, breathwork and mindset training and when I don‚Äôt feel that sick feeling in my belly anymore I wonder how I could have lived without this calmness all my life. Also when I deal with situations now I feel like an adult, calm and assured that I can overcome this. Hope this answers your question ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nI‚Äôm 58, I went through the worst panic attack of my life, I was crying, extremely emotional and couldn‚Äôt makes sense of or do the simplest of tasks.\n\nyeah :/\n\nThank you for putting it into words. I  feel the same way and felt like a freak. And it really helps to know that so many of us experience this and that I‚Äôm not a freak\n\nI use to feel like that in my twenties, eventually you get to the point where you say fuck it. Tell the boss if i get anxious for any reason im stepping off the floor, im an adult and i can make that call\n\nI‚Äôm not aware of anything I‚Äôm doing to make me look like a scared kid but other adults treat me that way so apparently I‚Äôm doing something wrong. It pisses me off to no end\n\nYes. It makes me feel the need to be comforted and reassured that everything is going to be okay. And it makes me feel weak when trivial things scare me to do\n\nAll the damn time. I‚Äôm 25 but whenever I get anxious I always feel like I‚Äôm 5 hiding behind my mum‚Äôs leg at the school gates again.\n\ni use to be so brave and be able to do everything myself and make decisions and now it‚Äôs like i can‚Äôt do my work, need extra help with things, decisions when i‚Äôm in a panicked state are things i can‚Äôt do. my minds running a million miles a minute and i feel stuck when trying to make decisions. i‚Äôve just moved out for uni and i feel like i should be able to do all these things. if i even have an incling in the back of my mind that i‚Äôm going to struggle i just won‚Äôt even try which i feel like is the worst thing you can do. repetition will eventually get your mind use to it\n\nI'm not sure if it's anxiety for me since I actually do have a developmental disability but honestly I relate to this so much. üò≠ it's embarrassing but when I get super stressed I'll have thoughts like \"I want my mom\"...I'm 27...I don't even have a good relationship with my mother ironically enough. The more anxious I am, the more childish I feel.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm 22 and I feel the exact same way.\n\nYup. I‚Äôm 33 and I hate asking for help and seeming incapable of doing something.\n\nI‚Äôm nowhere near an adult yet but I feel this way. While most other people my age are super extroverted talking with everyone I just feel like a child who doesn‚Äôt wanna talk with anyone.\n\nYes\n\nYes, especially social anxiety. And I feel like society doesn't help by implying if you don't do xyz, you're a failure.\n\nI was shouted at in the store the other day and broke down in a panic attack, I never felt so small and scared and just like I did as a child being shouted at by my dad. Every time I have an attack I feel like a scared little kid :(\n\nI even find it difficult to speak words correctly üò≠\n\nAll the time. That's the worst part of it. Being anxious that you behave like a kid. \n\nWhen I want to change that, guess what. I behave like a kid again.\n\nAbsolutely, I'm 35 been struggling with anxiety since my early 20's. It definitely makes you feel helpless. Don't feel bad though. It's a primal part of our system going haywire. It can reduce us to our basic instincts. I have found yoga and tai chi to help a lot. I can still focus even if I have some anxiety in the background.\n\nYes I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I haven‚Äôt been able to work for a while because of it. Every time I feel like things are getting better or I find a job or whatever my anxiety comes back. Now it‚Äôs getting a bit worse than when I was a teenager which sucks because I need to work.\n\nYep, can't drive, can hardly be alone, can hardly keep up with anything anymore. I still live at home and have no money and feel completely useless. I feel mentally impaired most days, my psychologist says it's something to do with psuedo-dementia and derealization.¬†¬†\n\n\nI think the embarrassment of it all really keeps me from trying to better my situation. It makes it harder to talk to new people out of fear of judgement, which eliminates a lot of potential for opportunities in my life. The few friends I do have are doing what's expected of them as adults, and then there's me.¬†\n\n\n\nMy panic attacks started with one REALLY severe one that pretty much lasted a week straight. I could only get some relief when sleeping, and I couldn't stay asleep for more than an hour or two at a time. I ended up asking my parents if I could sleep in bed with them for a couple nights. I was 23 when this happened, and I got to thinking about how I hadn't done that since I was 4 or 5.¬†¬†\n\n\nIt's pretty humiliating, but I'm just thankful to have people that care for me so much that I CAN be a total head case without worrying about holding down a job or paying bills. In a way it's brought us all closer together and forced us to have the hard conversations that we otherwise may never have. My partner has spent countless hours taking me to doctors appointments and sitting with me in the emergency room when I am spiraling. It's exhausting for everyone, but as my anxiety likes to remind me, it could always be worse.\n\nYep and i'm\nautistic and now I don't care, life is too weird to care how we are perceived I love being in childlike wonder everyday of my life\n\nAround 2 months ago i start to feel anxious for no reason and restless too.¬†\n\nIt later ended up exhibiting physical symptoms.¬†\n\nStiff muscles on left side of body\n\nMuscle spasms¬†\n\nInvoluntary movements in lower left muscle.¬†\n\nShortness of breath.¬†\n\nDizziness¬†\n\nSpasms in face .\n\nI got concerned and went to the ER 4 days ago.¬†\n\nRespiratory check was done, ecg was checked, a¬† ct scan of the brain was done an etg on all jerking muscles was done too during a period of 3 days. Neurologist said my etg was good nothing unusual detected. He said that the movements i was making wasnt neurological but i made it myself its entirely voluntary. No sign of stroke no nerve damage.¬† Blood work was all good. Vitamin deficiencies was all good too.\n\nHe gave me 1x1 mg pill of Ativan . Everything immediately stopped. I felt at ease, breathing was normal, stiffness disappeared too.¬†\n\nHe said it could be linked to anxiety. He asked me if i had stress i told him that i dont have stress that im aware of.\n\nCan anxiety do this ? Can it just be actived while even being at ease.¬†\n\nHe said i should go speak to mental health Doctor next week.¬†\n\nWhat can i expect?\n\nWhat type of medicine will help with this problem? . And how long will i maybe be on this medicine. The benzo he gave me was just to check how I reacted to it. And it really worked.¬† I remember after taking it all was ok.¬†\n\nAbout myself.¬† I am a none drinker, fair healthy di√´t, exercise 3 times per week. My hobbies are normally reading books, playing video games. I do smoke cigarettes but maybe just 2 per day . I work a stress free job. Just a normal administration work from home job for my Uncle Company.¬†\n\nSome guidance will help guys please.¬†\n\nalmost 22, most days i feel like i'm back to being my old middle school self where i was a scared little kid that felt incapable of everything. i feel you on this :(\n\ni have a hard time believing people when they say i'm mature just because i still feel like an infant that's blindly navigating this world for the first time\n\nI think something that is weird is how much we promote in the workplace mental health as a priority (well as a trend and best practice in many workplaces especially nonprofits and ‚Äòhip‚Äô places like Uber) yet I definitely sense that when you‚Äôre honest about mental health affect ting you to the point where you take a part time role or don‚Äôt put as much on your plate as a result or if you refer to certain poor performances as being due to heightened stress and poor mental health, it seems to be seen as an overall professional flaw. For instance, I have been less involved recently at work like if I‚Äôm asked if I can come in early, usually I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm dealing with other things. But it makes it seem like I‚Äôll never come in early. So like mental health isn‚Äôt stagnant but how we deal with it seems to be seen as a stagnant part of our character which sucks and definitely causes me anxiety. You‚Äôre valid for feeling infantilized. I think the world had yet to catch up to what mental health actually is. I get to work in outreach for people experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity so I feel really proud of being able to say that I do really get it. Anytime I have an angry, frustrated, or emotional client I give them time and I have a lot of patience. A lot of times someone comes back and apologizes for how they were to me and I do t just say it‚Äôs fine in an autopilot type of way. I can really relay that my team understands them and that we‚Äôre glad they still trust us to come back to us. Without babying and while still providing dignified interactions, I tell them that their anxiety is 100% normal.¬†\n\nHey, I once had anxiety about becoming blind to the point where I started obsessively visiting my eye doctor. And I cried to my roommate about it who gave me a hug. I have glasses but I‚Äôm definitely not losing my sight lol. So I always tell my clients that anxiety can manifest into many crazy things but that they‚Äôre not crazy. I mean unless they tell me they think ppl are reading their mind, that I‚Äôm still figuring out how best to address and help them. If it‚Äôs a woman I‚Äôll let her hug me and I‚Äôll tell her that it‚Äôs okay to feel how she feels.¬†\n\nAgain, we feel infantilized because the rest of the world is kind of in denial about how real and vast anxiety is. And babying yourself is a coping mechanism carried out by ppl who want to cope with stress. ¬†It‚Äôs probably a healthy way to cope and self soothe. After all, we‚Äôre still our inner kid with just more experience and further brain development. Plus trauma often brings out certain ages in us. Like we all regress to childhood trauma in one way or another. Crying might feel silly, but to an extent you‚Äôre actually overcoming the emotion and trauma by letting it out. Just put a cold or warm pack on your face after as crying does physically stress your face a lot. But we have to cry in life for our health when it comes naturally.\n\nIt's funny you should notice this because Dr. Russ Kennedy (The Anxiety MD)'s model for healing anxiety is centered around childhood trauma being the root cause of anxiety. So when you feel like a child when you're anxious, it's likely because inside you are that same scared child again. :( Be kind to yourself, just as you would be to a scared child. &lt;3\n\nThis sounds like it should be in the n.p.d. 1.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nR/narcissistic parents 1."

    "title": "Nurse just told me to accept that im going to be an anxious wreck forever.",
    "body": "Ive been seeing this nurse for a couple of years now. She initially put me on sertraline, after me telling her about my social anxiety and rumination. \n\nIve done it all. 15 years on and off therapy, citalopram, sertraline, hypnosis, cold water therapy, exposure therapy etc... Nothing seems to have shifted this crazy adrenaline response i get when im anxious. I live a life where im pushing myself out of my comfort zone often. Nothing seems to be working. I must say, when im not anxious im a lot more ballsy and glass half full. So the above has worked in that sense, but nothing for this strong surge of adrenaline that i get when i feel like im the center of attention. My arms and legs go numb, heart races, sweating...\n\nBut yeah, she told me that the sertraline is helping my anxiety more than i think. Even though we only catch up 1-2 times a year? and while talking to her today i was visibly shaking like a leaf. As we went through my previous notes nothing had positively changed in my life. Then she tried to convince me to stay on the drug and said how im just going to have to accept that this is who i am and live with the anxiety. So basically shes saying i should give up and carry on taking sertraline which from the start, isn't making me any less anxious.\n\nIn the end I told her im stopping the sertraline. Im going to go down a different route as i dont agree with what has been said. It pisses me off because i know for a fact there is light at the end of the tunnel. She could be saying this type of thing to so many people who dont know better. If i was a child and she told me that i was going to have to live life shaking like a leaf and not able to get any words out whenever a stranger talks to me then i would have probably gone down a bad path.\n\nDont know if im just batshit crazy at this point or if this Nurse is fucking clueless? \n\nIf anyone else has had a similar experience with a mental health nurse, please dont give up. It is absolutely possible to change your brain and subconscious response to things. Yes, i get that Anxiety is a part of life which is healthy...but if it's at a level where its ruining your happiness in day-to-day life, dont let anyone convince you that you will never get past it. \n\n\n\n\n",

    "all_comment_text": "She's probably trying to convey that anxiety is not something you \"cure\" but rather something you \"manage\". Think of it like hypertension. It's a chronic condition that you can manage with various strategies.\n\nAgreed. I have generalized anxiety disorder and that‚Äôs just what it is. I have it, I always will have it, but I‚Äôm managing it so I don‚Äôt end up sleeping 20 hours a day.\n\nWait fuck is that why I sleep so much??? Can you elaborate???\n\nI sleep a lot as well and also have GAD. For me personally, sleeping is an escape when I start to get overwhelmed or too anxious as it works as a ‚Äúreset‚Äù button for me.\n\nSo it‚Äôs sorta ‚Äúcorrelation not causation‚Äù here? I was wondering if it was my anxiety making me so physically tired. I know stress does that to you anyway, but I was wondering if it was deeper.\n\nLittle of column A, little of column B. \n\nUnchecked and ignored mental health issues will, in fact, start to take a physical toll on your body. \n\nIf you've ever heard of fibromyalgia for example, one of the going theories involves poorly mental health.\n\nSame exact sadly. I miss out on so many things cause I sleep to feel better or cope with the intense anxiety\n\nDo something against anxiety. I tried pharmaceuticals like ssris/snris, bensos, pregs etc. Ssris made it worse and bensos and pregs worked at first but caused strong dependency, cognitive/memory impairment, gave me rebound anxiety due to downregulation of gaba and much other mental issues. Tianeptine worked decently when I tried it in 20-30mg doses, just don't abuse it.\n\nI have had much better luck with the natural anxiolytics longterm. They have changed my life, I don't need to suffer anymore. I used to need bensos daily due to horrible anxiety, panics, social phobia, fear etc. And don't need it anymore.\nMy doctor even thinks it's better that I use the natural milder options instead of bensos, pregs cause this doctor knows that I had much issues with it and is against using it for anxiety longterm.\n\nAnxiety is exhausting. Leaving the house takes it out of me because my adrenaline is pumping the whole time. I have been having a flare up of my anxiety and due to that I‚Äôve been sleeping for three weeks straight it feels like. Also, if it keeps you from getting restful sleep at night that can make you exhausted and sleep during the day.¬†\n\nA new (and really amazing) integrated health doctor I‚Äôm working with educated me on why I get so tired when I have anxiety but don‚Äôt have depression. It‚Äôs because some folks with GAD also have extreme overwhelm, where our brains are so overwhelmed with processing that we often take naps or get really tired and need a break.\n\nPeople who suffer from anxiety can sleep?!?\n\nIt literally causes me nightly insomnia and has done for the last 20 years and when it's really bad sleeping is impossible. \n\nDon't know how anyone is sleeping 20hrs per day when they are an anxious mess with all that adrenaline running through your body, your mind racing, sweating, heart thumping out of your chest, impending sense of doom and being hyper aware of every sensation in your body and emotion you're experiencing.\n\nRight? I wish anxiety put me to sleep\n\nYes I also had much insomnia due to anxiety.\n\nI don't have insomnia at all anymore, or almost never, internet can interrupt my sleep but that is my own stupid choice to use it for so long (it is actually very addictive).\n\nThere exists many natural sleep aids that work well. I wouldn't be able to live a normal and fulfilling life without it, cause without sleep you feel horrible.\nExercise during daytime also helps me. A good diet is helpful too. Sex or masturbation before bed seems beneficial too.\n\nOfc it's better to try sleeping without but some people have irregular imbalances in their brain which makes it very hard for you to sleep and your baseline is basically anxiety for other people. You can use nature to get that balance back. I promise it can help a lot, even very difficult anxiety and insomnia. I am living proof of it.\n\nI've tried every natural remedy under the sun 100x over and none of them so much as make me yawn.¬†\n\n\nMy diet is 99% good and even when hitting the exercise hard daily it has no noticeable difference on my ability to get to sleep or stay asleep.¬†\n\n\nWhen my body and brain let me sleep then I sleep otherwise not much else makes a difference.\n\nI‚Äôm pretty sure everyone‚Äôs anxiety is different when it comes to sleep. Mine is. Some days I sleep all day long, than other days I don‚Äôt sleep, and when I do sleep I have insane gorey super realistic nightmares that put me in a daze the rest of the day, or I won‚Äôt sleep for 40 hours, than when I do sleep I wake up every hour in a sweat and don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm at or who I am. One time I even woke up and didn‚Äôt know what I was, like I didn‚Äôt know I was a human or I was alive. My therapist says it‚Äôs ptsd and trauma responses working my brain and my dreams. Lots of dreams about death and killing and dying. Even dreamed once my daughter had been raped, and I had to pick her naked body off the floor after she had been gang raped and when I woke up I could smell the rape from dream, all day I could smell it. Anyways, my point is, anxiety works differently for all of us, some days I sleep all day long literally till the evening, than some days I don‚Äôt sleep at all. Or some days I am normal. üëå\n\nI used to have it really bad daily together with much panics but living a healthy life-style &amp; using natural anxiolytics (think adaptogenics, herbals, vitaminer minerals and man acids - some have long term effects so I feel better when of it aswell), not abusing drugs or alcohol, not being dependent on bensos, exercise, finding a hobby, faith and a goal in life has basically removed the anxiety. Therapy (regular and musical) has helped me aswell.\n\nI basically don't have anxiety anymore(nor depressions), I am sensitive when it comes to stress due to ptsd but otherwise no anxiety at all.\n\nMy thoughts exactly. Just knowing that I have a condition I can manage, rather than be at war with all the time, has helped me manage it well, even in the worst scenarios.¬†\n\nThats what my therapist said and I believed for too long. Yes strategies to manage anxiety, calm yourself and endure it if necessary are very helpful. But if a situation is so strongly linked to  anxiety it will trigger it every time and if just enduring that anxiety does not lead to a positive outcome it won't get weaker in my experience. My life was a horror for the time I tried to fix my problems with therapy alone, only after I found the right medication my healing process began. Only because I started to get positive outcomes as I tried to conquer my anxiety.\n\nTotally agree. When I said \"strategies\" I was being comprehensive -- that includes medications.\n\nSame medication or therapy alone didn't work for me. What did is finding the right medication lowered but did not cure my anxiety. It allowed the fog to dissipate and me to realize my thoughts were irrational. Therapy helped once I was on the right medication to give me the tools to manage my anxiety. I still have some bad days but can say where I was 10 years ago is not the person who I am because the medication. along with the therapy I am more able to manage my symptoms.\n\nI completely understand and went through the same thing 20 years now, I have been fortunate enough to have found my first Dr that diagnosed me at first it started off with chronic panic and agoraphobia disorders, And he prescribed me Zoloft 25 mgs to start and put me on Valium 2mgs 3x daily, Which over the year's I started going to therapy sessions every week sometimes 2 times weekly, And my diagnosis have unfortunately developed with more mental health disorders over the years, But honestly currently what I am on and has worked the best so far for me is Taking 1 25mgs of Paxil cr once daily with Cymbalta 20mgs once daily, Valium 5mgs 4x daily, 5mgs more as needed, For sleep I just started Lunesta 1mg back in Feb, And I just got bumped up to 2mgs before bed as needed and it's really helpful, And I see my psychotherapist once every week and I attend a mental health and recovery Group every week as well,¬†\n\nI hope so. Its nothing personal towards her its just a shame that nurses part of the nhs have this ridiculous script to follow. I think after 15+ years of struggling with my mental health, they'd look into it a bit more. Could be something as stupid as a food allergy. Sertraline is like spraying air freshener when there's a dead cat under your sink.\n\nit took me 7 years and countless GPs to finally get one that understood and gave me a psychiatrist referral because i always knew that something more was wrong than just anxiety and depression. I spent 5 of those years on medication that made it very difficult to give a fuck about anything, which destroyed a lot of my life.\n\nafter my diagnosis (cptsd and autism, surprise surprise), i had to be on a waiting list for therapy. once i finally had a therapist that actually knew what to do with the diagnosis i had, 6 months of therapy gave me more progress than the entire 7 years of medication and GP appointments.\n\ni know its difficult to get through to some nurses and GPs, but if this one isn't understanding you, please fight for yourself and look further.\n\nfor what its worth i think its absolutely horrible that it's so difficult to get a psychiatrist to get properly examined and diagnosed. so many people can't access this and are improperly medicated and misdiagnosed by GPs who do not have the necessary time or knowledge. i love GPs and they're a critical part but the NHS is failing mentally ill people by not providing proper care.\n\nDamn‚Ä¶\n\nyep! fucked up my university grades, i almost didnt graduate, didn't apply for a master's degree, couldn't find enough motivation to properly look for work, so i was stuck in horrible jobs for 5 years, etc. just 7 years of missed opportunities and fuck ups because i was so deep in shit and the NHS didn't help me dig out, just kept giving me more and more medication without a proper diagnosis. im very happy i survived, because multiple times i was a few bad days away from not making it.\n\nnow when i finally know what's up, i obviously still have a massive amount of work to do to recover. but at least i can tell other people what happened to me, and that they really need to fight for the care they deserve, because the current system is set up in a way that will prevent them from getting it unless they demand it aggressively.\n\nIf it's a food allergy then you will have obvious symptoms (hives, swelling etc) and they'll show up on a simple skin prick test, go to your GP and describe your symptoms of allergy and ask to be referred for a skin prick.\n\nGreat advice, really sound, and very heartening!! You may be one-mad-chihuahua, but you're also one great hope-giving cheerleader @OneMadChihuahua¬†\n\nThanks for the kind words. :)\n\nI think one of the biggest issues in mental health is finding a provider who understands you. Second is being able to find the will to keep looking w out giving up ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThe best thing about my doctor now (my PCP) is that she trusts me enough that if I tell her I need something she‚Äôll prescribe it for me instead of making me play medication roulette again like other doctors have. First visit I told her I needed lamotrigine and clonazepam because they‚Äôre the only things that worked to me. Normally you can‚Äôt just tell a doctor you want benzos but I told her I use them very cautiously and I know the risks and that I‚Äôve already tried all the alternatives and none of them worked. It‚Äôs such a relief that there are doctors out there who do understand you and don‚Äôt end up just making your life harder.\n\nUgh sounds like a dream\n\nI mean, she‚Äôs right. Anxiety is never going to go away, there is never a cure no matter how many meds we take or therapy we get. What I don‚Äôt agree with is her pushing the sertraline. It doesn‚Äôt work for everyone, you have to find what works for you sadly.\n\nI think that's what has wound me up. Serotonin is not the only chemical in our brain. I told her from the start that depression wasn't my issue. I just get a huge adrenaline surge in situations that there's no reason to.\n\nHave you never tried propranolol? It would probably help a lot with that. Sure does for me\n\nAgreed. Propranolol is a game changer for me. It works enough to be able to work through the root of the anxiety with my providers. \n\nHydroxyzine is a milder anxiety medication that helps as well.\n\nI take hydroxyzine during bad episodes and despite baking me groggy, it can break the cycle super well and let me off of the ride long enough to get it together.\n\nIf the OP has been going to the Doctors complaining about anxiety for 15 years and never been prescribed Propranolol then I will literally be speechless as it's usually the first thing given IME being such a low risk medicine, non addictive, not habit forming, most people tolerate it well, not as heavy duty as SSRIs etc.\n\nThough for me it's not all that useful when I'm hyper anxious and in panic attack states and won't calm me down.\n\nWhere it does work is if I know I have to go to a social event / place full of people and I'm really not feeling in the mood of that because I can feel I'm going to be anxious but haven't quite gotten to the anxious state yet it seems to work OK for me and keeps me calm if I take it an hour or so before the event.\n\nBut for crazy off the charts anxiety? Even 80mg 3x per day won't do much for me personally.\n\nMy anxiety was from untreated and undiagnosed adhd, the right meds ‚Äî not SSRIs did work. And the I just had to clean up the trauma from mistreatment.\n\nI totally get that, I‚Äôm luckily sertraline works for me but it obviously isn‚Äôt working for ya. I‚Äôd suggest trying others but adjusting to meds sucks\n\nI'm happy for you that it's working. Its helped so many people üôè\n\nA bit late, but I was exactly like you! I now take .2 mg of clonidine 3xs a day. It CHANGED MY LIFE! No more shakes, sweating, flushing. It's all gone!!!! Please please please seek a second opinion. Life can be so much better, darling ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nGood for you I nearly went into circulatory failure with pulse rate in the 35-36 range.\n\nYeah and dorsal raphe caudalis suppresses the hell out of the Mesolimbic DA system that projects to the Lateral Accumve  shell possibly inducing apathy. The medial raphe is best enhanced by GABA locally released by glutamate caudal VTA neurons (paranigralis et parainterfascicularis)via D2 and mGlu2/3 receptors on the IPN inputs to the paramedian raphe and B5v.\n\n&gt; I mean, she‚Äôs right. Anxiety is never going to go away, there is never a cure no matter how many meds we take or therapy we get. \n\nI'm more hopeful than that.\n\nIn some MAPS trials, a subset of anxiety patients have had \"loss of diagnosis\". Basically a clinical cure.\n\nSearch for a different provider, preferably a psychiatrist.  It is not unusual to try different meds in order to find one that works for you.\n\nRight. How come a nurse is prescribing medication anyway?\n\nI‚Äôm assuming a nurse practitioner, who can prescribe, but they do not deal with this day in and day out.\n\nMoney saving and worse off, induction of threat to fire them for rx ing you know, the few agents that work which see low potential for abuse CIV‚Äôs. This country is a scam.\n\nYou can definitely be managed. But also acceptance is a big part of healing. Maybe that‚Äôs what she was trying to help you with.\n\nNope it‚Äôs not. Not when I was healing back in the day. Treat it till it‚Äôs gone enough you can live you dreams: I have autistic manic depression with transient earlier  in life psychosis btw. No longer and nor do I take neuroleptics: Effexor, Alprazolam, prn Benadryl, and self prescribed extra GABA Pam for which they never say ‚Äúbad boy you evil nonconformist‚Äù no they know they‚Äôre system is rigged. I do better than on 40 mg olanzapine per diem (around 1200mg ThoraZINE). So yes.\n\nTo everyone looking for help, Ill share my experience:\n\nIm 31 years old and I suffer form GAD and Depression since I was 19/20. \n\nFirst of all‚Ä¶ YES! GAD isn‚Äôt curable but manageable. I did the same question after years of treatments and while the doctor said the depression can be treated, my anxiety will only improve but I shouldn‚Äôt expect it to disappear. It‚Äôs who we are. Anxious people \n\nHowever, after 10 years I started testing with Venlafaxine and mirtazapine some months ago and it is doing wonders. That chest feeling was gone for days after 2 months of taking it. I started doing things that I stopped like taking a long shower or walking home after work. I would spend hundreds of euros with ubers. They even increased the dosage cause it was giving me some very depressing episodes at first but it worked fine after.\n\nNow I have to stop Xanax and the switch brought the chest feeling back but Im fighting it and you should do the same. Anxiety is a big B. Just be bigger. Sometimes I feel drained and mentally exhausted, true but after every crisis I feel better. Think about it. \n\nYou can try this: Sometimes I just sing a lot‚Ä¶ even when im going somewhere. It feels so good. Humming also helps cause the vibration stimulates the vagus nerve. \n\nYou will get an expert in anxiety (trust me!) but never expect it to go away. You will get disappointed everytime she comes back. Just cherish every good moment. Celebrate everything. If you go out, if you go to take the trash‚Ä¶ whatever. Feel good for you and all the things you do. It will help you feel a bit better. \n\nGolden tip: Talk to another doctor if you must, but take the pills exactly has prescribed. Wait at least 2 months and keep in touch with that doctor. If you feel terrible just go to the hospital. No shame in that. Suicidal thoughts or whatever. Ask for help right away. No need to panic. But be aware that it‚Äôs a side effect of medication and not a sudden death wish of yours. Also, avoid changing medication to much. Sometimes doctors fail to understand how long you are taking a certain medication and they prescribe a new one. Changing medication many times can be problematic. It happened to me once and now I write everything down so that any new doctor knows exactly at what point I am in treatment. \n\nIn my journey I have tried many medications and I know many techniques like meditation, deep breathing and whatever. Try them, they will help. Sometimes I think they don‚Äôt but then I remember that I could barely stand an attack years ago and now I can do it alone even the scary ones. \n\nThis is your journey and it pains me to know that you are suffering with anxiety. But we are tough cookies. Tough cookie‚Äôs can break some teeth. Stay tough! Stay strong and always ground yourself. Be realistic and kind with yourself. Its just anxiety, and it will pass.\n\nI loved and needed this, thank you. I've had a shitty month and the increase in sertraline isn't working as quickly as I'd hoped. Still having heart palpitations constantly, adrenaline rush, it's been exhausting.\n\nThis gave me hope\n\nHeart palpitations are one of the most scary feelings but they are mostly harmless (especially if you already had your heart checked and everything is ok). Just try not thinking about them when you have them. Ignore them. Just keep doing what you are doing or distract yourself with something else. It takes time, but you can teach your mind to relax and not overthinking around them. \n\nIf Sertraline isn‚Äôt working after two months talk to your doctor again. Some drugs let you more energized while others will leave you more lethargic. If I recall, Sertraline is more on the active side. If that is the case you may feel anxious but more capable of doing things. Its a very weird sensation and quite hard to explain. Feels like your anxiety is trapped in a cage. Fluoxetine is also more active and I had a very hard time with it. Specially because I didn‚Äôt know what to expect at first. Always ask your doctor what to expect in during the first weeks. It‚Äôs very important to know what can happen so you can take a breath and talk yourself out of bad situations if you face any. \n\nYour routine may also help a lot. Sleep at regular ours and try to stay in that path. If you feel like you start your day great but have a hard time at certain hours, talk about that with your doctor. He can help you rearrange your medication so you have less symptoms. Like taking something in the morning, afternoon, nighttime and before sleep instead of taking something once a day in the early morning. \n\nAnd do therapy. It‚Äôs your best friend. Specially to let everything go and talk crap with someone. Sometimes we don‚Äôt notice how full we are and thats when your body will release your anxiety trough an attack. \n\nFive days ago I went to the hospital cause I was having a big one. My blood pressure even spiked. I could barely talk or eat. Once I arrived at the hospital I talked like a parrot. ü¶ú\n\nYeah or be crafty and not avoid thr type of s****ual assault by the hospital Johns with a half a brain that digitally penetrated me at ages 19.21,22 and I‚Äôm 36 and still never had interdourse with a women. Just put your self I my shoes.\nWell I did get the place shut down (words of the clinical director there with a grin like ‚Äúthank god you stood up to this sickness‚Äù). Did you feel okay with being subjected to that?\n\nSorry. English is not my first language. I don‚Äôt understand what do you mean by digitally penetrated\n\nBecause ssris are for depression.    Benzodiazepines are for anxiety.   And these fucking doctors won't give us the drugs we need to live our lives.    And before anyone comes here about how dangerous they are and aren't on ssris and lise their script or on snris and lose their script and miss a day or two and you don't get brain zaps and dangerous withdrawals...  and think only benzos are the devil then your apart of the problem.   We have people suffering day to day when a couple mgs a day of a bemzo can fucking give peiple their life back.\n\nBenzos are effective, but highly addictive. There‚Äôs no denying that. Many people end up needing their doses increased and increased again. They can lead to seizures, labored breathing, and death if not weaned off properly which can take years. Some people have been on them for so long there is no safely taking them off. They also increase the risk for developing cognitive dysfunction, weight gain, memory impairment, and you absolutely cannot drink alcohol while taking. \n\nI‚Äôm a provider in psych, I‚Äôve taken Xanax a couple times in my life. It made me feel so carefree which was amazing. In the end it really freaked me out realizing how easily people get addicted to that feeling as I was thinking about it deeply myself. We have to learn to cope. Meds won‚Äôt always be there and are not always the healthiest option.\n\nSSRIs are the gold standard treatment for GAD as well as MDD.\n\nXanax doesn't make me feel carefree. It makes me feel like a normal person without an anxiety.\n\nEveryone‚Äôs experience is their own I guess.\n\nHighly addictive no. Moderately. They‚Äôre CIV not like oxymorphone IR ten mg tabs which I find quite addictive despite them not bringing available for decades. My mental issues and aggressiveness were cured without any any sedation or lack of aware esss of impairment.\n\nI feel this to the core.\n\nLexapro helped tremendously with my anxiety for years. Literally went from content spiraling thoughts to being relatively unconcerned. Got off and the anxiety came back hard. SSRIs definitely can help anxiety, just depends on the anxiety and the person.\n\nNot saying you're wrimg about benzos, but SSRIs saved my life and I was prescribed them specifically for anxiety as people often are.\n\nThey are not like the doctors pre conglomerate of their independence to rx- I can‚Äôt reveal more as it‚Äôs between me and my vulnerable provider who tells the truth at least: need to pay for wronged death, some agencies will pay to the coffer if and only if this person will lower her bzd rx by a percentage I won‚Äôt state as to not induce terror or retaliation (it‚Äôs in justice.gov) I live in west Michigan\n\nHm ?\n\nFor me it was a symptom of undiagnosed ADHD and peri-menopause. Those two form Voltron together. I had accepted that life was just going to be this way forever, I still kept trying, reading everything, etc, but I was applying for disability because my doctor's had signed off on things not improving and I was functioning like a potato. Had been for years at that point. \n\nIf you've tried everything and nothing's worked, try getting other things checked out (if you haven't already). Anxiety like that can be a symptom.\n\nI‚Äôm in the same boat with perimenopause starting and undiagnosed autism that I wasn‚Äôt aware of until a few months ago. Once I realized I was autistic so much of my anxiety finally made sense and I‚Äôm able to understand my triggers better and cope with them instead of just having an internal meltdown which looks very much like anxiety and panic attacks. I was also misdiagnosed with panic disorder for the longest time because of what turned out to be POTS.\n\nI'm a nurse practitioner. I highly doubt she told you, you would be an anxious wreck for the rest of your life. Having said that, yes, you probably will have some degree of anxiety for the rest of your life. I'm a NP and I accept this to some degree. There will be times in my life it will be better and times when it's worse. If you really don't feel the Sertraline is helping you you can either ask to change medications or ask for a referral to psychiatry for a another assessment and recommendations. There is no reason to stay on a med long term if you don't think it's helping.\n\nI agree! Definitely comes and goes even on meds! I was blessed to have a good 5 year stretch managed on meds, but I‚Äôm in a middle of a new med change and it‚Äôs back full swing! But a part of getting through anxiety is acceptance and maybe that‚Äôs what the NP was trying to do here.\n\nSo being a NP,  are you willing to have your patients try anything and everything under the sun so they don't get to habe benzos.     If your patient told you they have numerous panic attacks a week..  have spent 8 months in delirium over it all and sobs all day because their sick with anxiety and panic.. would you tell that person they do not habe a panic disorder.      I'm trying to figure out why these so called specialists with education..  don't seem to show their educated.\n\nNo I would not. I myself was prescribed Clonazepam recently by my family doctor while I waited to see a psychiatrist who not only renewed the benzos but also renewed my sleeping pills. Just so I could function until the Paxil kicked in. But it was understood that both the benzos and sleeping pills were short term solutions.  I don't take either now, just the Paxil. But this took a few months to work it's way out.\n\nYes then there's the \" benzos are long term \"    and that's nonsense itself.   The fact that ssria also are now linked to dimentia and other issues.   I mean think about the fact they will prescirb meds like ssris that cause people insomnia,  heart burn, low libido,  lack of emotions.. feeling dull.. lethargy.  Among other issues.  Or take a benzo and have zero side effects and live on.   I've read plenty of stories people being on benzos for 20 30 years and their in their 60 70 80s and doing fine.  And if they caj cause issues  at least they got there happy...  anyways my issue is extremely severe..  I live in an absolute state of hysteria and delirium from panic attacks thst just started from no where.  I never had a problem in my life before and then poof now I cannot even take showers or eat regularly.  I have tried many places and I tried ssris which make me sick and all they ever offer me is clonzapam as well which does NOTHING.  I still suffer panic on them and they do not last.     How can we be told that the drug lasts 8 to 12 hours and has a long half life to reduce withdrawals. Yet even with 1mg dose 3 hours later I'm already sick with panic stuck 30 mins away from home now.. currently.    I keep telling her it doesn't work well enough to bring me back down to a stable state to work on things and she keeps ignoring it saying om trying t9 use benzos forever.   When I have bottles of them on my counter.    \n\nAlthough I can say this same thing happened to me in 2020 and my doctor then just regular family docotr have me 3.5mg of xanax a day and it helped me tremendously.  It actually worked me back down over tome and I was living a perfectly amazing life .. started a new business and working over tome and life was grand..   at this juncture i cannot even make it a day at work and I'm going to lose my job all because these people won't try other things with me.    I'm sorry to rant at you but when people don't listen it's going to end up causing people their health or worse.    From the first script she gave me they hardly worked.  I have looked around too.    People don't understand or even seem to care thst I was living a normal as hell life until a crippling panic attack that forever stole my life away.\n\nSteve Stahl busts on anti bzds. better than me. Read his books.\n\nBro. Stop with this attack pushing for benzos. We are highly educated people on this topic. There‚Äôs a huge problem with them. \n\nComing from a psych NP that works with anxious people daily. Me also being one.\n\nNo your educated on what your told to be.      And it shouldn't be your call to make.  If someone trust 20 plus pills and are living a nitemare but a couple bemzos a day makes them live a wonderful life who the fuck are you all to decide their fate.\n\nI didn't mean that she said those exact words. But i am pretty much an anxious wreck, and she knows that as ive been very honest. Its also on my records over the past 15 years. She proceeded to say that my anxiety is something that cant be permanently fixed...as though its like im just overexaggerating having butterflies. I know that Anxiety is normal and we need to have it to stop us from making bad decisions... But to the point where i can't make any friends or form relationships? \n\nThere are people claiming unfit to work due to anxiety. But as a male who drags himself out of bed every morning with no other choice and tries \"man up\" as people say, i feel a bit let down. \n\nI went in there to ask for advice on the next step. I know there is an underlying cause to this anxiety response that i am having. This doctors is the only place i can afford to go to in order to make any progress at the moment. But mine is just another one of those that throws sertraline at everyone, completely disregarding the fact that it could be related to something other than seretonin levels. No talk of blood tests, or healthchecks or anything like that. \n\nMy sister in law had her first and only panic attack ever recently and was given blood tests, time off work, referrals to specialists, etc... Whereas i get some sertraline and a pat on the head. Not once in my life of breaking down in doctors' offices or with therapists, have i ever been referred for a blood test or a day off work.\n\nYou should definitely get bloodwork done! Anxiety is often a multifactorial issue. I have some endocrine issues that really exacerbate my anxiety. For instance, thyroid has been closely tied to anxiety and depression. That being said, I think a medication other than sertraline could help you. There are so many others, and sertraline doesn‚Äôt always work for everyone. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this and not getting the support that you need. I can absolutely understand feeling frustrated. The health system can be incredibly invalidating.\n\nI'm not sure how old you are. You could get some blood work done, but honestly if you are under 50, it's not likely your anxiety has an underlying physical problem. I do think you may have anxiety for life. As I said, I likely will too. That's just our particular chemical make up. Just like some other people have other health issues. But like any other chronic illness it can be successfully managed. I agree. You need more than just Sertraline if it's not working for you. Could you go back and have another discussion? Or ask for a referral to a psychiatrist? It's also not a big deal do run some basic labs to put your mind at ease and at least rule out anything. Personally, I would check your hemoglobin (anemia can cause high heart rate that mimics anxiety), thyroid (hyperthyroid can simulate anxiety), B12 (low can cause tingling). I don't think there's a ton of work up needed if you are in generally good health.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSometimes a different med even though it‚Äôs the same medication type won‚Äôt have the same effects. So I understand trying different medications even within the same class. One thing you can ask about is an add on of Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin is also an anti Depressant but it‚Äôs not an SSRI. It can be used with an SSRI to you counter the sexual side effects of SSRIs.\n\nHi I‚Äôm just throwing a few ideas out that worked for me after SSRIs sometimes made my anxiety worse: hydroxyzine (antihistamines to sleep and calm), Gabapentin and GABA supplements at a low dosage, Wellbutrin, Lemon Balm. None of these at low doses made me feel off/disconnected, or like a wound up numb person like SSRIs. I also wasn‚Äôt afraid to try different nurses/practitioners if I felt like I wasn‚Äôt getting anywhere. Keep the faith, you deserve peace.\n\nRight? That‚Äôs something that‚Äôs so frustrating to me about the traditional healthcare system too. Most providers are taught how to diagnose conditions and which medications to prescribe. Rarely is there ever any time or capacity for the providers to ask, discuss or actually work with you on any other of the extremely important facets of health. Diet (including possible food intolerances, allergies, how you‚Äôre genetically able to absorb/process vitamins and minerals), sleep quality, exercise, stress management, just to name a few, almost never get discussed.\n\nThank you üôè I think you're bang on with that.\n\nYou're saying you've been going to NHS Doctors for 15 years complaining of the same issues and no one has done any sort of health check or blood work?\n\nHonestly I find that hard to believe, it's literally one of the first things Doctors will usually do. Get some bloods done and see if they find any answers from those tests.\n\nGo and ask for them to be done because you're concerned there might be an underlying issue and want a full checkup, most will oblige.\n\nIf they don't or you don't want to go back then you can order a do it at home blood test online from a private provider without any referral from your GP and prick your finger, put some blood in a test tube, send it to their lab and have a full range of blood test results (vitamin and mineral levels, heart, liver and kidney health, testosterone, cholestorol, blood sugar levels and more) within 72hrs. \n\nNuman are one of the companies I know of that do it (they call it the \"Fear Nothing Blood Test\" last time I checked) and I'm sure Boots and Superdrugs Pharmacy section of the website offer similar as will many other providers.\n\nIt will cost you about ¬£120-ish in my experience for the test and the results and a digital overview from one of their Doctors telling you what the results mean.\n\nIf they find anything they are sometimes able to offer treatment for the more simple things (vitamin deficiences or testosterone) or you can take the results back to your GP and show them what they found, they will have to act on them if there's proof of an issue.\n\nThat‚Äôs rude of her\n\nMy psychiatrist basically said the same thing about my depression but even worse she made it sound like I‚Äôm eventually going to kill myself. Like bitch it‚Äôs your job to find a way for me not to do that. I need a new psych.\n\nGood cut that creep loose\n\nI got told that sertralin is better for depression, not anxiety. Fluoxetin should be better for anxiety.\n\nSertralin is used for treating depression, OCD, and anxiety disorders. But I guess everyone reacts differently!\n\nI have anxiety, major depressive disorder and trichotillomania and what I‚Äôm about to say may get taken down but honestly I‚Äôve been on a bunch of different meds since I was 13 and I go cold turkey on each one when I realize it‚Äôs not working after 3 weeks so at some point I started hearing things about üçÑso I tried some after researching it deeply and it was the only thing that has worked and I didn‚Äôt have to take every single day only had to take every week-2weeks and it fixed all three problems I don‚Äôt take üçÑ anymore as I can‚Äôt it find anywhere (vape shop üçÑ will make you sick) only real ones help and only when you take a medicinal amount not a party amount you want to help your anxiety and depression not go on an heroic trip so you wanna take 2-3 grams not a whole baggy or heavily concentrated tea that‚Äôd be bad I mean you wouldn‚Äôt üíÄ but you may flip out if you‚Äôre not in a calm environment with calm ppl so start small if you were to try this method and only get it from someone you trust or an Amish pasture near you\n\nIf you are open to reading some literature, I have one book recommendation that has helped me a lot and it talks a lot about what you are dealing with as far as your fight or flight response being overactive. The book is called ‚ÄúThe Body keeps the score‚Äù by Bessel Van Der Kolk. It is very very insightful and discusses a lot of research about the trauma that causes our anxiety.\n\nGet a complete thyroid panel done. TSH, Free T4, thyroid antibody. I had social anxiety. Turns out it was caused by hypothyroidism. I didn‚Äôt know that. Doc put me on levothyroxine. My anxiety completely went away.\n\nThat nurse is a dick. You can work on it. It's hard, and it will take a long time. But you can do it.\n\nOr you can get a doctor and love lifr\n\nI hear you, it sucks. I shake like a leaf, break out in hives and sometimes faint from feeling put on the spot. I‚Äôve never had solid relationships, I just find it so hard. Everything is so much harder so I‚Äôm always tired! \n\nI‚Äôve had to ask for blood work, check my thyroid.. you have to advocate and demand for yourself in a time like this. I‚Äôm so sorry you aren‚Äôt being helped in a way that makes your day to day life easier.\n\nI‚Äôve tried sertraline, Effexor, Wellbutrin and now two years ago I asked if I could try Prozac cuz what can it hurt. The only med that truly helps is clonazepam but I get addicted to that when I was working a demanding job so now I only take it in the am when my anxiety is sky high! My doctor even said she needed to stop prescribing it because here in Canada they want to stop prescribing certain meds but I had a sob and was honest about how it helps my day and she said okay.. so it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask or be honest about how much your suffering because of anxiety. \n\nLong story short.. I‚Äôve accepted I will deal with anxiety (and other mental hurdles) and learn how to adjust my lifestyle like walking or quitting that job that was soo detrimental. Just being open about anxiety eases it a bit\n\nI wish you all the luck and you‚Äôre not alone!üíï\n\nShe‚Äôs not wrong. GAD is generally not curable.\n\nBut that doesn‚Äôt mean you just try one drug and if it doesn‚Äôt help you you‚Äôre fucked. You can try different drugs, different coping techniques and maybe something will take the edge off of it for you.\n\nBut it‚Äôs generally not a curable illness. It‚Äôs something that you learn to manage.\n\nNeither is Manic Depression but I have not threatened random people for no reason then run I. Fear for 17 years because I am self aware because I had a good doc and good psychological treatment (NOT SOCIAL WORK).\n\nlol - what in the world are you talking about? Wrong thread?\n\nNurses don't order and choose your medications....just by the way\n\ni take buspirone 3 times a day to help with constant general anxiety.\n\nTell her to jut stop being a nurse cause she obviously sucks at it\n\nI was told that I was a worst case scenario twelve years ago. I live a good life now. I do have anxious episodes, but they are never as bad as when this first started. You absolutely can heal with time.\n\nCool \nMan am the only 36 yo who is not obese from unneeded D2 blockers, can flirt with women again and grateful for my life\n\nGo find a therapist.\n\nFinding a good one where I live is like finding a needle in a haystack. I agree though, theyre lifesavers for many people.\n\nSame here. My neuro suggests a neuopsychologist, but the closest is in the same building as his office. I am finally going to see a psychologist, which is something I've put off for decades.\n\nThat's so cool to hear. I hope you get to the bottom of it üôè\n\nIn this day and age, video calling a therapist in another location or even country is totally practical and effective. I would look at that option.\n\nTried beta blockers?\n\nI have, they work really well. I feel bad relying on them though.\n\nDon‚Äôt feel bad. Propranolol has no risk of dependency, and there‚Äôs no tapering needed to get off of it. It‚Äôs been hugely successful for my panic, which sounded similar to yours. I take extra for really important speaking like a job interview I had recently. (Psychiatrist approved beforehand.)\n\nBeta blockers are pretty safe, non-addictive, and not bad for your brain like benzos! You deserve to suffer less and they can help you do that.\n\nWhy are you a Puritan?\n\nSo sorry you are dealing with this.\n\nI too ran into the exact same situation. I very naively had no idea what anxiety really was. I just thought it was a 'one and done' type of worry. I had no idea it was something that lingered and could truly disrupt your sleep, work, and every aspect of your life. Almost mimicking a heart attack or sickness.\n\nI went to my doctor after a MAJOR panic attack. They dismissed me. This went on about 4 more times at various appointments, ERs and urgent care trips. Until I FINALLY found a doctor who listened, and understood I was dealing with intensive anxiety. \n\nDo not give up. It sucks, but keep visiting doctors to get the care you need. Many in the medical field are checked out and truly overworked.\n\nI used to take sertraline and it helped my anxiety but I had a lot of severe side effects so I switched to fluoxetine, would recommend trying different meds or a combination of a few to find what works for you\n\nHave you read any books by Dr. Claire Weekes? There are also videos of her on YouTube. She told people to accept their nervousness and float past it rather than reacting to the anxiety and bringing on a second fear, as in more adrenaline.\n\nHave you tried a beta blocker like Propanolol? It really helps with the adrenaline showers.\n\nWhy is noone suggesting Pregablin\n\nIt‚Äôs true that anxiety is a lifelong condition. No management ever works 100% of the time for several reasons. That said, if something is not working for you you have every right to seek a better solution. Nobody should ever give up\n\nMan, my Dr did the same for years. Sertraline did nothing at all. About 6 months ago he actually changed my meds, put me on Effexor. Game changer, most anxiety is gone, the worst of it, the constant overbearing intrusive thoughts that absolutely overwhelmed me is totally gone. In my mid 40s, thought I was doomed for life to be this way\n\nGo to Jesus. I'm serious. I had debilitating anxiety for years, like, I'm talking in and out of the hospital, medications, counseling... I did the whole thing. Finally broke down and asked God for help and He came and delivered me from that suffering. Only He could've done that because there was no way I was getting better on my own.\n\nNurse is clueless. You can live without anxiety. Venlafaxine worked for me.\n\nGo above the nurse. Take this to their clinic director or equivalent\n\nWhy are you seeing a nurse and not a psychiatrist or psychologist?\n\n&gt; I live a life where im pushing myself out of my comfort zone often.\n\nThis really struck me. Without knowing anything else about you or the context of your life, I wonder if you can do things to make yourself feel more comfortable and relaxed. There‚Äôs no shame in that.\n\nWhat a discouraging practitioner. Don't take no for an answer, please. There has to be an avenue for help for you. Scour the internet. You deserve a life free of this discomfort and I am sure you can find it.\n\nEver try beta blockers? Lotta socially anxious people swear by them\n\nI‚Äôd encourage a change in who you see for sure. I had a whole new experience after more than a decade of feeling helpless. I now have real help and feel heard and supported.\n\nI worked in healthcare and had a doctor admit with a client there she only took the minimum in mental health and didn‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in anxiety/depression. This same woman was also a Hippa breaking moron I noted with other times I was around her. I still get mad thinking of her poor advice and the client and I found a better provider.\n\nWhy see any nurse for psych meds??  I only trust a pyschiatrist,  I'm a complex case.\n\nI thought i had GAD my entire life and i could use it to my benefit in high school, and then it became unmanageable in college. Turns out i had undiagnosed adhd the entire time. Got diagnosed at 28. A few non stimulant and stimulant trials, and holy shit my anxiety and depression legit never have been lower in my life. The ‚Äúusing my anxiety for good‚Äù was just me hyperfocusing. Now i have meds and coping skills! Sobriety helped too obvs. Not just removing substances, but doing step work. Made me change my way of thinking. With a lot of self work. My drinking and drug use was the symptom of my messed up thinking. Not perfect. Takes constant work. But progress not perfection\n\nHow did you find out it was adhd instead of anxiety? I've always had anxiety but wonder if it could actually be adhd\n\nI had just turned 26 and a coworker said ‚Äújesus christ julia you have the worst adhd i have ever seen!‚Äù And i was like ‚Äú?!!! I‚Äôm a pharmacist? You are telling me I did pharmacy and residency with an undiagnosed learning disorder? I just went through life on hard mode? THE PSYCH WARD MISSED THIS?‚Äù Finally asked my psychiatrist about it in 2020. Got the diagnosis questionnaire in the mail cause it was covid lol. Had that same coworker fill it out with me. It was adhd all the time. The impulsive behavior and gifted child syndrome made sense, cause i was just hyperfocusing on things i found interesting hahaha. So basically trial and error and an outside party seeing things that my undiagnosed neurodivergent dad just thought was normal (and my neurotypical mom doing a ton to help with executive dysfunction eg rotating our drawers cause out of sight out of mind if i cannot see it it doesn‚Äôt get worn). Now i have meds and coping skills like folding my clothes via marie kondo style and using CLEAR storage bins.\n\nThat's amazing. It's wild that stuff can go so long without being noticed like that. \n\nStrangely enough I relate to a ton of that. The hyper focusing and talented and gifted child thing is definitely me. I'll have to ask about a questionnaire next time I'm at the psychiatrist. \n\nWhat medication did you end up going on and did it help?\n\nI tapered off setraline with cbd oil small dose twice per day. It took about two weeks before I noticed it was working.\nStill does even as a spot treatment. Just wanted to offer the option. I haven‚Äôt been on antidepressants or antipsychotics in over 6 years. I‚Äôm not left but I manage. No pressure to use anything you‚Äôre not comfortable with but for me it helped.\n\nFor me what helps is rather than fighting against it, accepting that it's a part of who I am and embracing it (social anxiety). Since I just accepted this is who I am it's a lot more manageable and rather than it having control over me it's like there's a mutual understanding and compromise where both it and me are able to exist mostly at peace.\n\nIt might not be for everyone though. \n\nWhatever your journey is, don't give up! No one can tell you what's right for you except you! üëçüëç\n\nI have that same adrenaline surge. I‚Äôve been having it for years now, probably since i was 19/20. \n\n\nReally dangerous situation? Adrenaline, fine, proper response. Watching a movie? Adrenaline response. Something very good happens? Adrenaline response. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs as if my body‚Äôs receptors for what is dangerous and what isn‚Äôt are completely out of tune. My therapist even told me that it probably has to do with living in constant fight or flight, without ever being able to relax. \n\nWhat greatly improved this is working on my environment and the people i surround myself with. So i try to control what i can in my life, in order to make it less stressful, and while that helps, it is not enough. So when i have these adrenaline surges, i intentionally slow down my breathing while telling myself (outloud or not) that everything is in fact fine, and that it‚Äôs just my mind wrongly assessing the situation i am in. Doing this helped A TON. Adrenaline rushes are subconscious, you have to take conscious actions repeatedly in order to stop the adrenaline surges. Give it a try for a few weeks/months and see how it goes. I went from running to the ER with massive panic attacks to ‚Äúsolving‚Äù them in 10mins. \n\n\n(i am medication free, most i‚Äôll take is 0.20mg of xanax in extreme cases, but most of the crap they gave me never really helped).\n\n&gt;Really dangerous situation? Adrenaline, fine, proper response. Watching a movie? Adrenaline response. Something very good happens? Adrenaline response. \n\nHoly shit this is it. I've never heard anyone else say that. I hate the cinema because i just sit there getting huge adrenaline rushes and feeling like everyone knows. But if i was to get into an icebath for example...nothing. You're right its like our bodies are out of tune. Ive always felt like my upbringing has completely messed up my adrenaline response.\n\n\n\n&gt;So when i have these adrenaline surges, i intentionally slow down my breathing while telling myself (outloud or not) that everything is in fact fine, and that it‚Äôs just my mind wrongly assessing the situation i am in.\n\nThanks for this. Whilst in the waiting room yesterday before i saw the nurse, i was on the verge of having a panic attack. I noticed i could snap out of it for nano seconds when I would widen my gaze and focus on the sensations. But only for nano seconds, as i say. Maybe repeating this will eventually make those moments of calm longer with practice? \n\nBut yeah you've hit the nail on the head. My adrenaline goes nuts when im safer than ever, but if i was in what other people might consider danger, it's there, but not an issue.\n\nHave you tried EMDR or psychedelic therapy? Just curious if you‚Äôve worked with anything that works on neuroplasticity\n\nI have not, but i would love to. I could be wrong, but legit, safe psychedelic therapy is a bit scarce? I read a lot on psychedelics from Sam Harris. I would love to try.\n\nI remember I was 13 when I first asked for help after years of self harm and a few attempts and my doctor told me medication probably wouldn't help me because I have a \"depressive personality\". Insisted on going to a psychiatrist who told me it's a phase and I'll \"get over it\". Jokes on them, I'm 30 now and I'm being treated for bipolar.\n\nMakes me sick. I hope you're in a better place now. Sounds like you're tough as nails. Im glad that you spotted their Ingorance üôè\n\nSo I jave been off my meds for 2 years now.  I went to a psilocybin and ketemine therapy place in San Diego.  My anxiety is from ptsd but I was at the same point as you.  So I tried it.  I still have maybe 1 or 2 panic attacks a year and they are from direct triggers but it's changed my life for the better. \n\nNow once a year my current doctor peracribes me 10 .25 mg benzo pills for emergency use only.\n\nSorry you're going through this homie.  I wish you the best\n\nAcceptance is one of the most effective ways of changing your anxiety. Rejection of a feeling will only make it worse. So I think the nurse had good intentions, but maybe they didn't communicate that very well.\n\nI don‚Äôt think it sounds right. I‚Äôve experienced clueless nurses that sounded similar, and also very attentive and understanding nurses.\n\nIt‚Äôs true that acceptance is a big part of recovery. Ironically the more you accept anxiety and even lean into it the less power it holds and the less strong it is. It‚Äôs usually our need for certainty, and yearning to get rid of anxiety which helps keep that cycle going. But I don‚Äôt think she is talking about this.\n\nIt sounds like she is telling you that you will miserable forever in some sense and to get used to it.\n\nWhilst anxiety disorders are not something you ‚Äòcure‚Äô you certainly can bring your anxiety levels down back to a healthy level and change your thinking patterns, it just takes a lot of work.\n\nTherapy is the first port of call, then medication, and the one with the worst outcome is medication alone. If you‚Äôre on a med, you should be in therapy. Even if a medication makes the symptoms easier to manage, you‚Äôre not changing your thinking patterns and responses which can be deeply ingrained even from childhood, and that‚Äôs the real source of the issue.\n\nChemical imbalance theory is outdated and no longer relevant to modern psychiatry. It‚Äôs NOT like a diabetic who needs insulin, so an anxious/depressed person needs serotonin. With a diabetic you can precisely calculate the amount of insulin needed and observe exactly how it affects the body. With SSRI, SNRI, etc. no matter how much serotonin you get. It‚Äôs trial and error. You can‚Äôt measure and observe what‚Äôs happening in the brain, and plenty of people take these meds long term and either have no change, side effects or actually get worse. Now I am NOT anti-med. They also do help some people a lot, save lives even. But ask anyone and it‚Äôs a trial and error thing. And have a read about chemical imbalance theory and you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs debunked, yet GPs still tout it and prescribe meds before therapy.\n\nYou can bring your anxiety levels back to a normal, healthy level through a combination of therapy, exposure and medication if you need, and don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise!\n\nDon't want to sound like I'm undermining anything....but how's your other stuff: diet, exercise, sleep, drugs, coffee etc\n\nLots of armchair psychologists giving you advice here.\n\nStop seeing your nurse for mental health issues...she's not helping you.\n\nSee a mental health professional.\n\nIf he/she doesn't work out...find another, then another... until you find the right one.\n\nI have social anxiety. I will always have social anxiety, but it has gotten better for me‚Ä¶in years of transformation. I say keep looking, keep growing. I get it. One time I almost had a panick attack trying to talk to a teacher. I used to not be able to look at people in the eyes‚Ä¶I am better today. Somehow, gradually, I learned to give less of a f*** of what other people think of me. You have to keep fighting‚Ä¶it‚Äôs probably not going to be an overnight process, but rather very slowly gradual. \n\nWhat I hear here is that you do want improvements about your anxiety. I say, keep searching‚Ä¶\n\nShe‚Äôs right. I respect her for giving you the truth cold and plain but accurate. Think of anxiety as something embedded in your hardware. I came to terms with my anxiety that its not something to ‚Äúcure‚Äù but to be managed. Trust me on this one but the sooner you accept this, the happier you will be.\n\nIt‚Äôs insane for her to insist you stay on this med. Sertraline maybe visibly made me appear less anxious, but I was still internally anxious. I ended up discontinuing it once I realized that the severe suicidal thoughts were because of it lol. \n\nIt‚Äôs not insane for her to say you‚Äôre going to deal with this forever. You probably are. Focusing on managing it and talking yourself off the cliff of anxiety is the only thing that will truly help long term. Meds will not cure you. \n\nMy anxiety is often situational but the things that have helped it most are hydroxyzine, propranolol and honestly, grounding techniques.\n\nHave you tried any antipsychotics? Seroquel is very effective for anxiety off label. These are non addictive meds (they‚Äôre not benzos). My anxiety didn‚Äôt go away with sertraline/ ssri meds in general. I needed the stronger meds. I never knew I could feel this good.\n\nI was that way for 17 years and I'm now signicantly better and enjoy a normal life. She's full of crap.\nStick to therapy. Especially talk therapy. CBT is useless for many. Find a good analyst who will give you the space you need to heal and develop a stronger sense of self.\n\nIt‚Äôs a shame the medical industry could give two fucks about us people with real anxiety\n\n Have you tried keto? Being in ketosis changes GABA in your brain and honestly got rid of all my anxieties. Made me feel incredible! Diet can REALLY change how your body and mind function.\n\nIve tried every anti anxiety drug. It took me to go to prison and see a psychiatrist who gave me pregablin. Its a miracle drug. Zero anxiety zero suicidal thoughts as a bonus. Withdrawal is only problem. Just dont miss a dose. Magicüòâ\n\nA doctor basically told me this too lol. He saw the list of SSRIs and stuff that I‚Äôve been on and off of that hasn‚Äôt worked and said life‚Äôs hard lol.\n\nI think I'd switch providers.¬†\n\nSounds like you need the Big Boys; Klonopin, Valium or Xanax\n\nThere's no cure, so yeah that's true\n\nI‚Äôm getting the same response on my anxiety- though like I was on a medication before but since it‚Äôs a benzo- after failing to find something to work instead said yeah no your just going to be anxious cope with it and avoid stressors‚Ä¶\n\nAre you per chance autistic?\n\nI had to try multiple different meds to find something to work for me plus be put on a low dose of an extra ‚Äúas needed‚Äù medication. Most people have to try different meds, because one med will work for someone but it might make it worse for someone else. Sadly, that‚Äôs just part of it.\n\nI'm glad you know better than to give up!\n\nSo sorry for your experience. I also have terrible anxiety and have had mixed experiences with a couple NPs. You deserve better. Yes it‚Äôs true that you‚Äôll always have anxiety, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you always have to be super anxious. I hope that you can find a better provider who will work with you to get you to the point where anxiety isn‚Äôt controlling your life.\nFor me, I found that BuSpar, hydroxyzine, and clonidine (for adhd) worked way better than SSRIs. I‚Äôve also had a prescription for very low dose ketamine troches for about a year. I\nHighly reccommend that you look into ketamine therapy because it‚Äôs the closest thing\nThere is to a cure. Traditional psychiatric meds generally decrease the frequency and intensity of symptoms while ketamine  promotes neuroplasticity so you can actually change your brain for the better. \nAll the best!! üçÄ \n\nhttps://www.joyous.team/daily\n\nI re read your post, if your fine then your not it seems you could use an endocrinologist to get a full blood panel and see if you don't have tumors on the adrenal glands causing this problem.\n\nHey, I normally wouldn‚Äôt do this, but your symptoms sound a lot like mine so I think it could be helpful. Have you tried propranolol? It stops the adrenaline from actually doing anything, and gave my my life back. No more racing heart, sweating, shaking, doubling over because of your stomach, etc‚Ä¶ all gone since i started.\n\nIt sounds like the smart thing to do is to stop seeing this healthcare professional. The relationship sounds broken. However the message she has is sound: after 15 years of different treatments this will likely be a permanent part of you.\n\nSo I get fed up too. It's like one day your life was all sunshines and rainbows and then next, here comes jerk face anxiety which is then followed by depression or vice versa. Happened to me back in 2019 and I haven't been the same since. Tried a few meds and I'm not into meds at all. But I just couldn't take it. Only thing that ever worked for me was Ativan. But I didn't want to keep getting used to it. All the antidepressants I tried just gave me more anxiety. So now, I take a bunch of supplements which helps a lot more than the meds, but unfortunately I'm still stuck in this crazy downfall. I know there's a way to fix it, but it literally will take trial and error which I'm in the process of doing right now. I know for me, smoking hemp flower helps ease the symptoms. If your into that I would give it a shot.\n\nShe's not wrong. I'll go months without feeling anxious and the next moment I feel like I'm in quick sand. Sometimes you have to tell you're to \"Just Breathe\" and  realize nothing I truly the end of the world.\n\nI have had anxiety my whole life. It isn‚Äôt going anywhere. I use it to be efficient. It can be a superpower if you let it be\n\nI was where you are.  It may not be for everyone but microdosing has changed my life (and my anxiety) significantly.  It may be worth looking in to for you.\n\nI‚Äôm not able to be medicated any more, for a long list of adverse side effects.\nI have to live with untreated bipolar, anxiety, depression and PTSD \nIt‚Äôs going to be ok once you accept that this is how it is. \nThere‚Äôs not a cure that works for everyone and some people find there is no cure.\nSo people like me just have to manage with nothing but the occasional talk with a therapist of some sort.\nIt‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶not easy but I know what it is.\n\nIf you have physical symptoms from anxiety you may be better off with a beta blocker like Propranolol‚Ä¶very well studied and safe. Def not sertraline lol too much if you only have anxiety, unless you are also suffering from depression\n\nThat nurse sucks.¬†\n\n\nIf I were you, I'd find a psychiatrist who specializes in anxiety, but even if not, I'd try Buspirone. It's specific to anxiety and the only thing that helped me. SSRIs fail so many people.¬†\n\n\nDon't give up!\n\nI had to try multiple SSRIs/SNRIs before finding one that actually felt like it helped me. Lexapro personally helped me the most. I tried Zoloft, Celexa, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, etc. Celexa was much better for me than Zoloft, but still didn't help enough. Lexapro 20mg helps me, although I do still have issues with depression/anxiety, I don't feel like I'm living over the edge anymore as long as I don't miss a dose. The withdrawal from these depression drugs are HORRIBLE, so make sure to always have some and refill on time. I feel like complete crap within an hour of missing my daily dose now. I still need medical cannabis along with gabapentin personally for the anxiety.\n\nI mean chronic anxiety probably is something that you will have to manage for the rest of your life ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è like every other mental health condition that most people deal with in one way or another really it not a magic I worked hard and over come it. Daily victories and being mindful of your mental health is the way to keep a healthy hold on your mind and body for the most part. Not meant to be negative but reassuring, you are making progress even if the anxiety never fully goes away. Managing it and its effects on you and your life is the goal.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt tried practicing mindfulness, I would really recommend that you give it a serious try.¬†\n\nFirst of all, you need to accept what is. Accept this condition.\n\nEverytime a troublesome thought occurs, let the thought ‚Äúsimply‚Äù pass and focus all your attention and energy on the underlying feeling, and be with that feeling/emotion until it slowly but surely begins to dissipate - and rinse and repeat.\n\nThis will in time re-program all your bodies unnatural anxiety response triggers.¬†\n\n- It‚Äôs going to be extremely hard at times, but it‚Äôs the only way to really free yourself from this anxiety disorder.\n\nMy psychiatrist told me the same thing a few years ago. I was already in a very bad place and an \"expert\" saying that just made me completely hopeless. I knew I didn't want a future if the anxiety will never really leave me. No reason for me to live then.\nThrough a few beautiful coincidences I stumbled upon psychedelics. It's safe to say for me now that what the psychiatrist told me is complete and utter bullshit. I'm not completely healed yet but I'm able to live my life which wasn't the case before. it's going in the right direction. \nI wish you all the best!\n\nI get this too in certain situations. Today at 30 I know when it's about to happen, what triggers it, and kinda like a strong wind coming we just have to manage it. Focusing on mundane things seem to help a tiny bit for me. Where feasible, the \"notice 3 things with sight, 3 things with hearing, 3 things with touch\", then 2 then 1 can fool my stupid heart into calming the hell done.  Wearing something that doesn't smell just because I cold sweat helps a lot, since I hate feeling icky. Also of course context depends, and if the anxiety hits temporarily where I am actually unsure of the outcome it's more of a \"just suffer through it and try to ignore it\" Vs if it is stage fright where I have eons of time to prepare.\n\nDefinitely don‚Äôt give up. Zoloft made me so much worse I stopped taking it. I‚Äôm back on Lexapro.\n\nI‚Äôve had this problem before, doctors and nurses can be so dismissive. Only you know your own body and you have autonomy over your own body. \n\nMy doctor to told me the other day I need to do exposure therapy and that will help with the anxiety. The thing is I took a job a year ago that is exposing my anxieties every day and I‚Äôm pushing through but I have seen zero improvement. These exposures aren‚Äôt making my anxiety any easier. I think the longterm effect of exposing myself to stress is doing more harm than good.\n\nHave you ever been prescribed beta blockers? I hate to throw another medication out there for you, but if not, you might want to ask your doctor about it. They are sometimes prescribed for high blood pressure &amp; while they‚Äôre not technically an anxiety medication, they‚Äôre sometimes prescribed for anxiety too. I was prescribed them for my tremor which gets embarrassingly bad when I‚Äôm anxious. I‚Äôm prescribed the lowest possible dose &amp; I only take them as needed. All they do is block a receptor in your brain that causes a lot of symptoms that typically come with anxiety, they help me with my shaking, sweating, that heavy feeling my chest, racing heart rate, basically the physical symptoms of anxiety. \n\nCBD is also something I swear by (*just* CBD, not legal THC or anything). It is the only thing that has ever successfully stopped a panic attack for me or stopped me from having one. I feel that it helps slow down my body‚Äôs reaction to anxiety &amp; slows down my racing thoughts enough to think a bit more clearly. Both CBD &amp; beta blockers have no kinda ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feeling. Both of them seem to help with the physical symptoms of anxiety, which I find helps with anxiety itself a lot. \n\nAside from that, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard &amp; tried everything in the book, but meditation can also be very helpful. I don‚Äôt mean meditating at the moment when you‚Äôre feeling super anxious, I mean meditating on a regular basis. Studies have shown that meditating regularly causes a huge decrease in anxiety &amp; depression. If you‚Äôve tried it before &amp; felt like it wasn‚Äôt for you, let me just say that it feels that way for everyone at first. It‚Äôs a skill, &amp; like every other skill, you‚Äôre not going to be good at it in the beginning, but you can practice it &amp; it gets easier. With meditation, you practice patience, forgiveness, &amp; acceptance, &amp; the more often you practice it, the more patient, forgiving, &amp; accepting you become to yourself &amp; your environment in your daily life.\n\nLastly, you might want to consider seeing a different provider. You‚Äôre absolutely right though, you don‚Äôt have to live as an anxious wreck forever &amp; there absolutely is hope!\n\nHow long have you been on sertraline? I‚Äôd try switching. I‚Äôd also try getting a neuropsych testing done to make sure the diagnosis is anxiety and not adhd or ocd\n\nHave you ever gotten a comprehensive nutritional panel done? Magnesium, Vitamin D, potassium and other deficiencies can all cause anxiety, which medication won‚Äôt do much to help with. If your adrenal glands or thyroid aren‚Äôt working optimally it can cause anxiety too.\n\nI started smoking weed in college just socially but after I graduated and time went on my anxiety had gotten significantly worse to where I‚Äôd vomit repeatedly. Whenever I was stressed like that id smoke to make myself feel better, but then I realized it just overall helped with my anxious symptoms (esp the nausea which was BIG for me). Of course my problems didn‚Äôt go away, but the weed made me feel good enough that I could face the issue without quivering or blacking out. Not saying you should start smoking or even that you‚Äôd be able to if you have a job that drug tests but that could be an option. It kinda changed my life. I will say now I‚Äôm interested in being tested for ADHD as I personally think that‚Äôs where my anxiety could be stemming from.\n\nWhat a bunghole nurse! You should seriously consider seeing a highly recommended psychiatrist and a highly recommended therapist. The nurse is only hurting you worse.\n\nI switched to a psych NP and she figured out a lot of my anxiety was from undiagnosed untreated adhd. I'm now on Azstarys for the adhd, and Lexapro and Buspar for the anxiety. It has made a massive difference!\n\nPregablin no1 for anxiety\nEven some opiate painkillers are extremely good for anxiety\n\nIf you've tried two SSRIs, would you consider trying a med with a different mechanism such as an SNRI? You might simply have a different chemical imbalance to deal with.\n\nShe‚Äôs delusional and antiBZD . No helping person would ever say this until 2021 when they got their egos hurt because people wanted anxiolytics so they could go to work rather than bull carp short term therapy that may be or may not be useful. And it can be useful but still insufficient as in my case: Benzos plus begging for hard core therapy finally fixed my neurosis but I have tried each separately with only minor effects (well the benzos worked well but you ‚Äòd drive all about on 5 mg Xanax as I know.\n\nI am so sorry you had this experience.¬† You are not alone. So many of us have these extreme physical reactions to anxiety.\n\n\nI just wanna say, I resonated with you so much in what you said. I feel the exact same way when I feel people are overly focused on me. All the same symptoms.¬†\n\nI guess I‚Äôll say the Bannable: these quacks are not the only sources of medicine even though the media would make that seem impossible. That‚Äôs it. You know what I mean. If not/ what naivite. I don‚Äôt encourage it but this is life and life with hellish misery so you all seem to say. Think and choose.\n\nSorry if it's already been said or is against the rules, but have you tried beta blockers? They can affect the physical adrenaline response\n\nI think you definitely need to find another np or Dr. That will actually prescribe you your antidepressant, but also give you a choice of a benzodiazepine medication that works for you instantly, and be able to function better in life, My primary Dr and my Np and psych all know and have all my prescription medications and medical records which I signed release forms so they are all in the same page and both My primary Dr has my mental health medications and my valium 5mgs 4x daily in my MyChart to where i can just hit request refill, But that's a backup more so i see my¬†psychiatrist every month and he puts 2 refills each on my Valium and my Lunesta since their controlled substances you can only have 2 refills each month, If something went wrong I am able to have it refilled through my PC, I understand doctor's psychiatrists nurse practitioners etc hazard license on the line but at the end of the day people are coming to you with these real diagnosis and their debilitating we can't live life right and to punish us for people who like to abuse medication, is not right or fair to people like Us who take these medications just to be able to live day-to-day and function as much as we can\n\nI like listening to somatic tracking on YouTube, by the steady coach, who helps people with chronic dizziness from anxiety. She gets you to sit in your sensations and really lean into them while telling you to be curious and that they can‚Äôt hurt you. I also do the somatic tracking for my sensations of normal anxiety like tight chest etc. \n\nThere‚Äôs just sometimes so comforting and empowering about it. I recommend it, it feels kind of in line with the idea of managing anxiety not always aiming for it to be gone.\n\nBut I do sympathise because I‚Äôm in therapy at the moment and it‚Äôs made me realise he‚Äôs teaching me to live with it, not get rid of it. Made me sad last week too. But I do feel like accepting it is what makes half of it go away."

It‚Äôs funny but exhausting at the same time üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nOmg I just had this thought the other day and freaked myself out. It's valid though.. Doesn't help that there was that news story (may have been local to me) where 2 sisters were playing in leaf piles, hiding in them and were ran over by an unsuspecting truck.\n\nThat is horrifying\n\n\nEveryone in that story is worse off for no reason\n\n: (\n\nAhhhh I'm not the only one!!! I usually think I've hit an animal and it always ends up being, like you said, a stick, or sometimes a pothole or bit of trash.\n\nThis actually became debilitating for me with OCD - although I‚Äôd be more worried about dead animals, it‚Äôd often leave me circling the same patch of road for close to an hour at least, finding new reasons to be worried\n\nIt was a person, i saw it\n\nOh my god me too!!\n\nI have this especially at night! I use to check the outside of car when I'd get home to make sure there was no blood.... I don't check anymore, trying to fight it.\n\nVery We Happy Few vibes from that one lol\n\nNot sure if this is the same thing exactly, but as a kid I was TERRIFIED that I would eat a barbie shoe and have to go to the hospital. I had no desire to eat a barbie shoe. But I was constantly thinking about if I did.\n\nSomehow this was not applicable to legos or batteries or other small objects. I just thought I'd eat a barbie shoe.\n\nThis is so weirdly specific I love it ü§£\n\nI did this too!!! I actually had a Pok√©mon ball that was like huge as a kid and anytime I couldn‚Äôt find it I was convinced i swallowed it!!! I‚Äôve never known anybody else who‚Äôs had this problem.\n\nI was afraid of swallowing coins when I was little. I have this vague memory of sucking on quarters when I was very young. I think maybe my mom came and yelled at me and from then on I was afraid. If not, I might have had a dream about swallowing coins??\n\nI loved sucking on coins when I was little. I know that I did accidentally swallow a coin AT LEAST once (possibly more lol).\n\nYes! I had a similar fear of olives when I was a kid, but that I would shove it up my nose and then it would go into my stomach. But that it would poison my nose somehow in the process! But I also had zero desire to shove an olive up my nose\n\nSomeone in kindergarten told me if I ate the black seeds in a watermelon it would grow inside my stomach and I would die and I was terrified of them for years and still think about it sometimes ü§£\n\nOMG I thought this as a kid as well üòÇ\n\nGoing into your stomach is actually the best thing to happen to the olive in that circumstance, I think.\n\nI shoved a cocoa puff up my nose, it got stuck, and I had to crush it and blow it out. Then I drank orange juice and my brother made me laugh and orange juice came out my nose and it **burned**. I haven‚Äôt had Cocoa Puffs or orange juice since\n\nThis somehow reminds me of staying the night at my grandma's all the time and sleeping in my aunt's old bedroom. She had this...taxidermied puffer fish hanging on the ceiling above her bed and I was TERRIFIED of it somehow spontaneously falling on me and hurting me. I wouldn't sleep at all when staying over and I would just stare at the fish all night in fear. I have no idea why I never said anything ??\n\nPretty sure I did swallow a Barbie shoe when I was little. Opposite end of the spectrum I guess lmao, had no thoughts about it, just an impulse to swallow a Barbie shoe so I did it. No worries about going to the hospital, no need to go, all good, just one less Barbie shoe.\n\ngood to know, i wish i could pass this knowledge back to my child self somehow. it'd save me a lot of anxiety lol.\n\nMy most terrifying/hilarious one is so similar!\n\nEat the rock.\n\nSometimes if I‚Äôm in a job interview, or an important meeting, and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôm meeting someone, my brains goes ‚Äúwhat if you just pissed your pants?‚Äù\n\nAwh üòÖ When I am in professional situations, job interviews etc. I always get this thought that what if I started to act completely like an asshole. What if I cussed at them, how would they react.\n\nThank god I haven‚Äôt done it. But maybe it would be funny to see.\n\nDon‚Äôt you love when your brain thinks of the most inappropriate think you could possibly do and then is like hey what if you did that and then you have to find a way not to lose focus of what‚Äôs happening in the meeting while also telling your brain to shut the fuck up\n\nI have IBS with my main trigger being stress and always get so worried it'll hit me during a meeting or something.\n\nI don't have stomach issues like that (I'm chronically constipated so never have any urgent bathroom emergencies) but I genuinely think someone poisoned me with laxatives once.. Like it was a complete disaster that will forever haunt me. It started in the middle of meeting with my boss and another staff person we had to fire. It was a nightmare.\n\nI get this one! Or what if I just threw up on the floor right now like it‚Äôs third grade. Why? I don‚Äôt know. Hahaha\n\nOmg. I have this thought all the time and never even realized til now. It's always in the back of my head.. Just projectile vomiting and collapsing in a random public place üòÇüòÇ\n\nLiterally!!!\n\nMine is ‚Äúwhat if you just started kissing this person‚Äù like what\n\nI have this thought during presentations for some reason\n\nwhen i was a child i was extremely worried i had a tapeworm, at all times. no matter how i was feeling. it was tapeworm time\n\nlol why does this crack me up\n\n‚Äúit was tapeworm time.‚Äù üòÇ\n\nI still have this! \nAnd when I was in my teens and 20s I always thought I was pregnant - even though I wasn‚Äôt even having sex.\n\ni‚Äôve been there üò≠ i‚Äôm still anxious about health stuff but there‚Äôs at least sound reason behind it LOL\n\nOmg this always happened to me too in my teenage years üíÄ I am a virgin so yeah.. not possible but it still freaked me out.\n\nSame! To this day! It's always tapeworm time.\n\nThis was a serious fear of mine because of that show \"monsters inside me\". It came out in the early-mid 2000's and the tapeworm episode was in season one. Good god I was MORTIFIED.\nI sometimes think about rewatching the episode from an adult perspective but it would probably fuck me up again. I don't think you can even tell you have tapeworms unless you have bloody stool, you're losing weight, or one....yknow...*comes out*.\n\nAs a child, I used to be terrified that I would suck one of my eyeballs out with the vacuum cleaner hose. Mind you, I never put the vacuum near my face, I just worried about what if I did?\n\nHey I still have this one!\n\nIt could be possible... please don't try it though.\n\nDamn. Now I‚Äôm worried about that. I saw a video of a dad sucking up his daughter‚Äôs hair to put a hair band on it, as some kinda life hack. Now I‚Äôm thinking he coulda sucked out his daughter‚Äôs eyeball!\n\nAlmost every time I hold a baby, I imagine dropping it on accident and the baby bleeding out from a cracked skull\n\nI have a 6 YO and an almost 9 month old and the baby related intrusive thoughts kill me. The other day I had my 9 month old on my hip blending up some food for him and I thought what if the bullet blender malfunctioned and flew up and he got cut up on the blades. I could see the blood so vividly in my head i had to step away and put him down before I could finish his food.\n\nThe baby ones are so bad. When my younger son was a month old and PPA hit, I would have thoughts of his neck getting tangled in the ceiling fan pulls. So dumb because I‚Äôd need a ladder to even get him close to them. Anxiety does weird stuff to the brain :/\n\nI worry about the neck thing. Like the supporting it. Had bad dreams about that. Also dreams about accidentally rolling onto a baby. I don‚Äôt have kids lol.\n\nMe neither\n\nOmg I have horrible moments like this imagining my dog getting hit by a car because I accidentally dropped its leash. It‚Äôs awful :(\n\nOkay what I want to know is how did you get to the point where you can actually 100% trust yourself again? I think I know intellectually that my intrusive thoughts are stupid, but the self mistrust is still there. Particularly in times of anxiety and/or sensory overwhelm.\n\nhonestly for me, it was acknowledging that it was only a thought and has nothing to do with me as a person and just letting it go. a big treatment for OCD and anxiety is exposure therapy, which essentially asks you to accept these thoughts as just a passing thought, sometimes even being like ‚Äúyeah what if i actually did that‚Äù in a nonchalant way in your head. it gives the thought less power. it‚Äôs kind of funny because it‚Äôs asking you to do the opposite of what you would naturally do which is kinda freak out from your own thought. but the less you give it power, maybe even laugh at it, the thoughts will eventually subside. at least, that‚Äôs what has helped me anyway\n\nYeah, I'm not a fan of the traditional exposure therapy; however, I've read about some newer things like ICBT, Acceptance and Commitment, and Metacognitive which seem like I might like to try applying some of those principles to my situation. Still a way of practicing getting more nonchalant about the pesky thoughts but less harsh.\n\ni‚Äôve never actually gone through exposure therapy myself, i‚Äôve only implemented the ideas of giving the thoughts less power. but yes sounds kind of if intense to trigger yourself on purpose\n\nYou describe it so well!\n\nI don‚Äôt trust myself 100%, but I have a compromise: in matters of safety, I always follow the anxious thought.  Like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting on this elevator with that man‚Äù, is that intuition, trusting your gut, or just anxiety?  If I could end up being murdered I just follow the anxious thought and don‚Äôt do it.  If it‚Äôs interpersonal matters like, ‚ÄúSomething feels off between us‚Äù that is so much harder for me to judge.\n\nOh well, yes, in discernments pertaining to personal safety one should follow one's gut because often there are subtle red flags picked up on subconsciously. And we are trained to discount them in the name of politeness. I read a whole book about it, *The Gift of Fear* by Gavin de Becker.\n\nMy attitude is always to default to better safe than sorry. Since there‚Äôs no way to know in advance, how something will turn out, I always just choose the safer option. That saves me the wasted time of having to debate myself in my mind, and get all confused and indecisive, every single time something comes up. Instead, I just remind myself that I already decided in advance, that the best option for me is better safe than sorry- so I just stick with that. It makes it so much easier!!¬†\n\nI want to know this too. It feels impossible.\n\nPractice. Practice. Practice. But before that I had to have at least a little bit of willingness to believe that just cause I think something that doesn‚Äôt make it true. In other words, that no matter how sure I thought I was about something, I had to believe there was a possibility that my thinking was just flawed. And then the practice was to begin challenging my thoughts on a regular basis. Considering that I could be completely wrong, and if I allowed myself to think something else, it could be totally fine.\n\npersonally i still have intrusive thoughts, but oftentimes they go in cycles, or so specific to a situation that there's an opportunity to look back and think of how silly it was. you can also be fully aware that something's ridiculous and still have the intrusive though, hence \"intrusive\". it takes practice and mindfulness to be able to kinda talk yourself down. wishing you luck and you're not alone!\n\nI had a weird fear of becoming a flat earther so I‚Äôd genuinely panic and become anxious for hours on end everytime I felt that I started to believe in flat earth conspiracies even though I never actually believed in them üò≠\n\nThis gave me a laugh I needed, thank you üòÇ\n\n[removed]\n\nI was in a lot of water sports most of my life (swim, diving, water polo) so I definitely got that one out of my system when I was younger. It was fun when we push each other in. \n\nBut honestly, after a few years of lifeguarding, I‚Äôm like hyperaware of anything that could potentially cause an injury, so the idea of pushing someone in just isn‚Äôt a thought that even crosses my mind anymore.\n\nMine is that I‚Äôm convinced someone will push me into water if I stand on a dock or by a pool, because I can‚Äôt swim I don‚Äôt go to those places lol I‚Äôm sure no one would but they could.\n\nWell you definitely could. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it though.\n\nOo I‚Äôve got another one.  As a child for years I slept stick straight in the middle of my bed.  If I turned toward the wall, monsters would come in through the door and get me as my back was turned.  If I turned AWAY from the wall, monsters would come up from the crack between the wall and my bed.  I also had to sleep with the blankets pulled up to my chin or vampires would get me?\n\nI had the same fear as a kid and I was a side sleeper so it was the worst! And I STILL like to sleep with the blanket covering my ear so that somebody doesn't come cut it off in my sleep. Don't know why.\n\nSaaame.. Feet had to be covered otherwise they'd get tickled by a demon.. Also, if I opened my eyes too fast in bed, I would see a ghost face right in front of my face.\n\nI slept on the couch for a good year for similar reasons. I figured that if my back was to the wall, I was better protected, and the room layout would have made it harder to sneak up on me.\n\nSame with the vampire thoughts! I wore turtlenecks to bed for a few months when I was in elementary school lmao\n\nHaha! Yes! After reading a National Geographic article about Pompeii, and seeing photos of dead bodies curled up in the fetal position, I worried that if I slept like that I‚Äôd also instantly die a horrible volcano death. Also sleeping with arms crossed = instant dead body.¬†\n\nThat I had forgotten how to pee properly and that I would have to go through life not knowing if I had to pee or not‚Ä¶. This was like 2 months ago - utterly ridiculous\n\nI got really fixated on peeing for a summer when I was a teenager and had to go every half an hour or so. Once I had to hold it for three hours because of some event and I peed for so long afterwards that I was terrified that I would literally never stop. So yeah being afraid that I would PEE FOREVER was probably my silliest fear.\n\nThis is funny because I worried I had forgotten how to hold my bladder and would pee whenever out of my control ü§£\n\nI‚Äôve had this one!\n\nI do this about swallowing and then legit can't swallow\n\nI had one that sharks swam at the deep end of the pool. I should have known then üò≠\n\nI‚Äôm afraid that a shark will come out of the light in my parents‚Äô pool. I won‚Äôt even tell you how old I am,\n\nHahah once I had to get out of a public, indoor pool in broad daylight because I was convinced a shark was going to get me.\n\nThese all have me rolling. I so relate. Only fellow anxiety disorder/OCDers can really get how insane these things are but understand that we are completely, truly terrified about these things at the time.\n\nOMG! I used to be a life guard for a community pool. Pools outside and inside. The inside pool can get VERY DARK. I remember training to be a lifeguard and we had to get a brick from the deep end which was about 13-14 FEET DEEP, I remember being sooo nervous about sharks but just did it lol\n\nOh my god, I KNEW they weren‚Äôt real but I couldn‚Äôt stop picturing it!! \n\nI kept telling myself it wasn‚Äôt possible, but the feeling and doubt stayed. I thought, I can‚Äôt see well underwater so for all I know there could be a huge pipe that connects to the ocean because that‚Äôs how the water gets in. \n\nJust the (feeling) and dread, worry, picturing it again and again in your head, different variations all of them resulting in the thought that there‚Äôs *some minuscule chance* a shark COULD be in this pool. While maintaining rational knowledge there is no way a shark could be in this pool and there are so many things preventing that!! Yet still, that feeling would get to me. I knew to hide it too, so the rationality was there.\n\nThat I would just scream out when I was supposed to be quiet, like during a test. At church. Etc. I was so terrified that I would scream out horrible things.\n\nI did this too! Would have to like restrain myself cause I was afraid I was gonna start screaming in church lol\n\nI still think about this!\n\nWhenever I have a near-miss kind of situation, I get stressed out thinking about how, if the multi-verse theory is true, something terrible happened to me in some other timeline and now Other Me has to deal with it.\n\nMe too! Especially with near miss, almost car accidents. It pops in my head that that's where I died in an alternate universe.\n\nOh my goshhhhh yes!!! I sometimes wonder about all the timelines where my accidents didn‚Äôt work out so well\n\nWhen I was young I had no idea how the reproductive system worked so I thought I could get pregnant from using a toilet seat after a man did. I was always scared I was pregnant when I went to someone‚Äôs house and used their toilet.\n\nThis reminds me of when I was 9, I literally thought I was giving birth on the toilet ü§£ I held hands with a boy that week and was like welp guess it happened to me üò≠ turned out to be poop\n\nI also thought I'd get pregnant from using the same towels as my family (even though they'd been through a wash cycle) so I remember crying that I had the same towel that my 15 year old brother had used the week before.\n\nMy obsessive fear and intrusive thoughts of pissing myself üíÄ I would wear pads everywhere just in case and even considered diapers at one point JUST IN CASE u know. I was super nervous during car rides bc I was like omg what if I pee everywhere and then they start calling me piss girl üòî\n\nThis is the same for me. I changed my route to work because of the fear, to include a public bathroom. For the  \"just in case moments\". I was worried that if it happened people would judge me and I'd embarrass myself.\n\nOh my god i‚Äôve never had an original experience. Had the same exact thing happen and it ruined my life for 6 months and looking back on it I laugh because its so ridiculous!!\n\nWhen I used to play solitaire on the computer, I always heard a running commentary criticizing my every move. It sounded like one of those hushed sports commentators who speak over \"quiet\" sports like golf or  \"indoor\" game matches (like billiards, or poker).\n\n\"She's playing badly today...seems to be choosing on impulse, like a first-timer. She's using up her undo options, and shaving down whatever points she gained. Oh, she missed that very obvious red Queen - a rookie mistake. If I didn't know better, I'd wonder if she'd been mind-swapped with a complete amateur. And again, with the hasty choices. I think she's cost herself the round now. I've never seen such a bad string of decisions, folks.\"\n\nI actually stopped playing online card games entirely for several years because it brought me down all the time. Happily, now the Negative Commentator has had his position eliminated, and I'm able to shift around imaginary cards in peace. :)\n\nOmg, that‚Äôs one of the funniest things I‚Äôve ever heard!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£ You should do stand-up comedy!¬†\n\nOh you poor dear that must have been horrible.  So happy for you that the commentator is no longer there.\n\nThat if I was up someplace high I would just involuntarily throw myself off? I feel like it‚Äôs pretty common, I‚Äôve heard from other people who don‚Äôt have anxiety that they have the same fear lol\n\nThere's an actual thing or word about it... Unfortunately, I only started looking it up because I got too scared! I'm always afraid that I'll jump off a bridge I'm walking across.\n\nGood news... So far I have üíØ percent success rate in NOT jumping!\n\nMe too! I think we‚Äôre doing pretty great\n\nWhen i was a kid of 4 to 6 - cut off hands and heads were under the bed and would use fishing poles to fling drugs up into my mouth while i slept if my mouth was open. \n\n7to8 - id have to fight the urge to turn my bike into oncoming traffic\n\nYikes on that first one.\n\nMy grandfather was a medical doctor, in the, 50s he left us his old medical encyclopedias. I had a new (old) medical problem at least once a week.\n\nOmg, I would read these as a small child! Like 7 years old.. I learned a lot but combined with health anxiety, was  not good\n\nOnce when my window screen was broken, I became obsessed with the thought of a bird flying in my room.  I thought about it all the time, and it scared the shit out of me.  For weeks.  I‚Äôm not afraid of birds.  I had nothing super valuable or breakable in my room.  It‚Äôs not a huge room, I could have ushered a bird out easily.  I could not get over this!  It makes me laugh now.\n\nWhen I was very young and long before being diagnosed with OCD and anxiety, I thought if I stepped on a cigarette butt, I'd end up addicted to cigarettes as an adult. Currently 26 years old and have never smoked ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI once convinced myself that a SweeTart I had swallowed weird was lodged in my throat/ lungs. Idk, I just FELT it there for weeks, and eventually broke down crying to my mom because ‚ÄúTHERE‚ÄôS A SWEETART IN MY THROAT HELP MEEEEE‚Äù. I was 8-9 years old üò≠\n\nI convinced myself I had coffee stuck in my lungs, breeding aspiration pneumonia that was going to kill me. I choked on it a bit and swore I inhaled it.. I even went to the ER. this was right after my brother died of something choking/lung related so it makes sense now but damn, i was so scared.\n\nI did it with a hard LIFESAVER! YES THE ONES WITH THE HOLES THAT GAVE IT IT‚ÄôS NAME! I was absolutely convinced that it was still stuck in my throat for such a long time, the nurse ended up telling me there was nothing left in my throat and it should be gone because I couldn‚Äôt get myself to throw up. I felt it for so long, and eventually it just stopped and I forgot about it!\n\nI used to lay awake at night as a kid and frequently would have intrusive anxious thoughts about ways my family or pets could die. I thought of everything, seriously. Down to what if a wolf burst through my bedroom window and ate my gerbil? \nIt wasn‚Äôt until I was older and in therapy that I learned not being able to sleep as a child due to paralyzing fear of loss was in fact‚Ä¶ not normal. It‚Äôs funny now to think of the absolutely insane scenarios my little 10 year old brain thought of randomly in the middle of the night\n\nAww I feel so much for that little 10-year old. I bet so many of us suffered so deeply for so long not knowing we had a brain issue.  What a relief it was to find out it could get better. And now all these years later it actually is better. Waaaay better.\n\nI‚Äôve almost convinced myself I was a murderer and just kind forgot, I‚Äôd pretty much convince myself I was secretly a horrible person\n\nI was terrified to push the button to advert the bus driver that I need to stop in a specific place, so in many many drives I just get late or didn‚Äôt came at all because I couldn‚Äôt step up of the bus üíÄ\n\nAwww... I can relate. I still feel some anxiety in my throat sometimes when I have to pull the string thing. Social Anxiety is a b*itch.... It wastes time, money, energy, brain power... Sigh.\n\nTake care buddy!\n\nA couple months ago my anxiety was not controlled. The \"fear\" went so much further than that. I KNEW it would happen, and that fear was based off signs of wolves near my house and I KNEW they were waiting in the woods to kill my dog. It was crippling. Now I've got the meds straightened out and although I don't think the fear was funny, I realize it was not as rational or literal as my brain was making me believe. Anxiety sucks so bad.\n\nI'm glad you're feeling better now, that must have been so scary for you to go through.\n\nOne of my fave go to's is:\n 'Anxiety is Your Mind Lying to You'\n\nMy health anxiety gets pretty funny\n\nI think it‚Äôs those ridiculous ones that cured me actually, when I started seeing that i am also just a bit messed up. \n\nCause imagining yourself pounding someone to death cause they cut you off in traffic is actually quite hilarious if you step back &amp; think about it and it isn‚Äôt really an intrusive thought just overindulging your sick imagination. LOL\n\n[deleted]\n\nI have this weird fear that sometime I‚Äôll just wake up in the middle of the ocean. Like, something will just teleport me to a random spot in the middle of the ocean. \n\nTbh still have it sometimes. It usually starts in dreams and then I wake up freaking the fuck out for an hour and not be able to get back to sleep.\n\nMan we all have intrusive thoughts in this thread huh\n\nDeath\n\nI had fears near any body of water that I'd drop something in and lose it forever. I went mini golfing with my family one time and we dropped the score card or a receipt in a pond. Ever since then I've had this fear, specifically about my glasses. Even though mine fit very well (I have a friend whose glasses would fling off all the time) I still hold them onto my face when I look down into water or just take them off.\n\nAs a kid I had pretty bad emetophobia, but it's gotten a lot better in recent years. I would worry that I'd randomly be sick and I'd plan what I would do in case that happened. Even when I felt totally fine.\n\n I've also been afraid of hanging my legs off my bed because I thought somebody would grab my ankles and pull me under. Sometimes I wanted to get off my bed but terrified it'd happen the second I stepped down.\n\nOh my gosh. I just remembered that when I was a kid, for like a period of 10 years I was always afraid I was going to drop my camera into any body of water.\n\nSame with the bed/ankles thing.. Also, I have a fear when going over sewer grates that I will drop something of value and lose it forever.\n\nI have these same intrusive thoughts and I am happy to see a kindred spirit that suffers from the same thing, though I am sorry you have this too. My thoughts pop out of no where and are related to whatever I am doing at the moment. I won't share them to not give others with the same problem any new ones to fear. \n\nI have to say, these bring about the worst type of anxiety. I have GAD, so I experienced all kinds of anxieties, from agoraphobia to health anxiety to social anxiety but the worst anxiety is from these intrusive thoughts. It is also the worst one to manage. I have been able to obtain long stretches of remission from health anxiety and social anxiety through exposure therapy but nothing has made a dent on those intrusive thoughts. \n\nSo, unfortunately, none of mine seem hilarious to me yet, though I know they are absurd. Hopefully, they will get to be hilarious at some point. I'll keep my fingers crossed... lol\n\nI was out of town recently and my indoor/outdoor cat disappeared, though my sitter swore he was left inside.\n\nHe may have hid somewhere to die, I thought, (bc cats do that), but someone would have smelled him, surely‚Ä¶. ***!Unless*** ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî the kitten ate him. \n\nSo that‚Äôs what I was sure of for four days until he showed up. My kitten ate my cat.\n\nActually now that I think about it I had an 18 yo kid come in for therapy bc he was experiencing intrusive thoughts that were HI (mental health abbreviation) in nature and he told me that he was thinking about taking a glass clock that was hanging on the wall and bashing it into my head and then would use the glass to cut the skin off my face. That was my first year as a therapist. I‚Äôll never forget that. üôÇ\n\nYou‚Äôre a saint.\n\nAs a child I would lay in bed at night and get so upset thinking about eternity in heaven ü§£ like the thought of existing in some capacity FOREVER terrified me. I imagined day after day after day and a flood of panic would wash over me.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSwallowing my plastic retainers. I know they are very wide and I‚Äôd probably gag if anything. When I was younger and had gotten my braces off the first time I feared swallowing the metal wire kind too. I swear I‚Äôve even dreamed it because I‚Äôve woken up gasping and once almost wanted to make myself throw up to get it out until I licked my top teeth and realized they were still in place and I could breath. It does make me wonder if there is a statistic out there for those things coming out of place during sleep. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs low ü§î\n\nIt‚Äôs the hitting people with my car ALL THE TIME. \nAnd ironically one day I‚Äôm driving on a semi busy road. Minding my business and BAM I hit SOMETHING. I continue to drive because I‚Äôm not sure if it was anxiety or what. Come to find out, a deer ran into the side of my car on the HIGHWAY. \nSo now, it‚Äôs every time I get in the car, not only may I run someone over, I may get hit by a deer\n\nWhen i was little I thought the Kool-Aid man would chase me at night when im riding my bike home lmao üò≠ i would get so scared\n\nOh yeah!! ü§£ü§£\n\nWhen I was little and would go running In school for P.E, I was absolutely terrified that the world was gonna go upside down and I would fall off of it, it was literally so dumb, and nowadays, I‚Äôm terrified that that little pain in my chest or lung is actually a pulmonary embolism/ artery blockage/ heart attack (probably just sore from working out) so I hope I can get to the point where these become silly little fears I laugh about too someday\n\nI was deeply concerned one point in college that I had herpes on the tip of my nose.\n\n‚ÄúWhat if I just zap out of existence‚ÄùüôÉüôÉ\n\nWhile swimming, I always thought about: what if I just stopped swimming right now, sunk, and drowned.\n\nGrowing up, I kept getting nightmares that I'm driving a car with no brakes. The hilarious part is, to this day, I haven't learned how to get a car. I don't really need a car tbf because of public transport, but I often wonder how much of it is because of these dreams\n\nThat every single open cabinet door corner is somehow going to end up poking me in the eye. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs five inches or ten feet away. Also, it‚Äôs less of a ‚Äúonce thought‚Äù thing and more of a ‚Äústill-to-this-day‚Äù thing.\n\nThe names of some people I am attracted to. Including one that treated me the worst since we were teenagers.\n\nIf I am walking in the street I feel like there must be a wolf behind me. I have to look and see if it‚Äôs there.\n\nYEAH SURE in the middle of a busy city, there must be a wolf, makes total sense! üòÇ\n\nI spent my childhood in a rural area so maybe that‚Äôs where it comes from.\n\nMust be from growing up in a rural area! A wolf once WAS behind me one night when I was visiting an aunt who lived in the mountains. After that, I always look behind me when im in any similar foresty place.\n\nMines pretty random but at night I get sketched out about being close to windows because I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs outside in the distance and I feel like someone is going to shoot me from outside. Over here just waiting for my first psychotic break. ü§£ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI told my husband I was scared I was going to grab a knife from the drawer and stab myself. He was like, ‚Äúremoving them won‚Äôt do anything? You could just run into the street and get hit by a car? Or stick your finger in a socket?‚Äù\n\nI went through a random bout of thinking there were cameras in every house including mine. Like, there would be a hidden one in the fridge even. Why? No clue.\n\nI used to cycle home from work, and my job was on top of this enormous hill that opened up onto a roundabout. While riding, ide get intrusive thoughts of just letting go of my breaks and letting myself fly out into oncoming traffic. \n\nJust my luck that one day my breaks fail when I'm flying down this hill, tried to break by dragging my feet but ended up just sailing through the oncoming traffic and hitting the curb, and then using my face as a break. \n\nI never got the intrusive thought again after that!\n\nWhen I was in middle school, I would randomly be hit with the terror that I was going to blurt out the n-word in a school assembly (I‚Äôm Asian). I‚Äôve never said the n-word in my life, nor had any desire to, but I swear, it was my biggest fear for, like, two years straight.\n\nAs an adult who loves to hike, my biggest fear is now, ‚ÄúWhat if I snapped and pushed my best friend over this cliff right now?‚Äù The ol‚Äô reliable of intrusive thoughts: what if I gave into my nonexistent murderous urges?\n\nMine is when I‚Äôm driving on a highway, I think about jerking the wheel and rolling my car ‚Ä¶ just to see if I would live!\n\nThe sun was setting and so it looked larger in the sky and I was afraid that meant that by some freakish event of physics the earth had spun closer to the sun and we were all going to incinerate.\n\n I always thought I/ other people would fall through floors suddenly and die. It preoccupied me for years. I was 112 lbs.\n\ni was scared for years of the sun exploding. every sunset that was a bit too orange i freaked out\n\nI was always TERRIFIED as a child that someone would vomit on me. I had a huge irrational fear of vomit. It caused me so much stress going anywhere as a childü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I even used to have nightmares about if.  Now in my 30‚Äôs with 3 kids and no longer triggered by my fear of people vomiting on me. I guess I had to overcome it haha.\n\nI have so many. My intrusive thoughts were crazy: I would think I was going to accidentally just throw myself off a bridge, I would be afraid I was going to throw my child out the window, think I might just accidentally run in front of a train. \nI always thought my car would get into an accident if I didn‚Äôt say a prayer and then imagine an angle on all 4 corners. And this isn‚Äôt scary, but it‚Äôs super weird. I would get sooooo much anxiety thinking how arduous a task it is to mow all the grass in the highways across the country. Like I would be so completely stressed out about it. ü§£ü§£\n\nThat when I was nauseous if I burped it was a 100% guarantee I wouldn't throw up. \n\nYeah not true. Definitely burped and then got sick üòÖ\n\nSometimes I get bored and want to cut my eyelashes with nail clippers\n\nIf I stared into the mirror long enough, I'd see someone.. Same with the dark, or cracks in an open door, or windoews at night. I couldn't be in our basement alone either and if I was coming up the stairs, I'd have to run so an invisible thing couldn't grab me. \n\nSpeaking of invisible grabbings, every single time I ever went into a pool, I thought of the \"are you afraid of the dark?\" ep where a bloody skeleton would become invisible underwater and would grab the legs of swimming children, pull them down and drown them. The pool was built over a cemetery and they missed a body when building over it or something.. So yeah, every time I went into the deep ends of pools, I'd feel like I was going to get grabbed and would panic swim to grab the edge. From age 5 or 6 to 18. If I went in rivers or oceans, I'd imagine fish biting me so I just stayed out of those. \n\nI had a VERY specific intrusive thought every day getting off the school bus in grade school. I'd walk up the hill and almost prepare myself to see bloody handprints on my front door and find my mom and entire family murdered. Also I'd run up the hill with the worry that someone in a van would snatch me up. The bloody handprint one is funny now because it was soo specific and just insane for such a small child to be worrying about that every day.. For no reason, either. My mom was never harmed and we lived in a safe, suburban area..\n\nI was convinced I had aids for no reason üòÇ mind you, I was a child with no exposure to anything or anyone with aids\n\nI‚Äôve been there. It was probably the worst time in my life. I think it lasted about 2 wks maybe more Idr but I was afraid to be alone with a loved one. It‚Äôs the worst when these thoughts are about people you love. I rarely get them now but when it happens it makes me feel super uncomfortable. I learned that it‚Äôs better to let the thought come like a wave then to resist it. Also your thoughts don‚Äôt define you.\n\nWhen i was a kid I thought eventually there wouldn't be any more room for food in my body and it would just come out of my mouth if I ate too much.\n\nI thought I might need my leg amputated because I walked through a puddle of dirty water with an open wound\n\nIt's not really a terrifying intrusive thought, but for as long as I can remember I've had the intrusive thought to throw TV controllers or mugs when I'm holding them.\n\nLockjaw and quicksand were my childhood bugaboos. Avoid all swampy areas and always stay away from rusty anything.\n\nMine are either ridiculous or terrifying, not both. Like when somebody is walking way to close to the edge of the platform when the train is arriving, I get thoughts about giving them a tiny little push. That's  terrifying.\n\nBut what is ridiculous is that intrusive thought I had about throwing my water bottle as high as I can and catching it again. I also was in the library while I had that and actually did it without giving it a second thought. Like it just appeared in my head out of nowhere and I just couldn't resist it. That actually didn't turn out too bad because the guy next to me smiling like a little kid made me feel better about it, actually.\n\nOr that there was a shark underneath my bed\n\nI live in the first floor of a 14 floor building and the thought of what if the building just collapsed straight down like Tetris or something when i was trying to sleep at night üßê\n\nPutting the fork in my mouth the wrong way while eating and stabbing in between my teeth. And for some reason it would be my foot landing in between a hot open flat iron.\n\nWhen I lived in college dorms, we had an insect problem. I had a huge fear that a spider could crawl in my ears and lay eggs, so I always slept with my ears covered with a blanket. I did it for a few years after college until I seemed to have grew out of that fear.\n\nUgh, I would do the same. A friend of mine went to visit his estranged, drug addicted mom for the first time and ended up having a cockroach crawl in his ear and get stuck when he was sleeping. Nightmare stuff. If I had to sleep anywhere with a big insect issue, I'd absolutely plug all my holes up, lol.. You developed a habit that had a purpose!\n\nFor some reason as a kid I was afraid a deer would break through my window. I think I had seen like 1 article of that actually happening and my brain just rolled with it\n\nWhen I found out that Elvis died on the toilet I was afraid to poop for months because I thought that I would die too.\n\nI still think of this wayyy too often\n\n[removed]\n\nI've never had a seizure ever and too many times, imagined collapsing and seizing in a busy area.. So random!\n\nWhen I was a kid I would make my mom go into public bathroom with me when I had to go. I would take off every stitch of my clothes including shoes and socks and throw them over the top of the stall for my mom to hold because I was scared that I would pee on them.\n\nAs a young child I SO afraid a snake was going to come up out of the toilet and bite my butt while I was peeing. I have zero idea where this idea came from but I forced my mom to stand in the bathroom with me while I peed for like a year.\n\nI live three stories up and when I go out on my balcony my brain says I should do a lil jumpy jump *specifically* to see if I could do a flip before I hit the concrete. \n\n(No form of ideation, promise.)\n\nI used to be paranoid that I had wet my pants -- and I would obsessively check to ensure that I had not. What's weird about it is that I had no history of peeing in my pants as a child, nor did I ever wet my bed -- but despite having a perfectly awesome track record of not peeing on myself, I was very aware that I did not want to do that  and I thought about it often.\n\nI was afraid my eyes would fall out, not because of anything I did, but that they‚Äôd just spontaneously pop out and dangle there. I used to be awake hysterical all night because I couldn‚Äôt stay on guard for it when I was asleep. I kept my family up every night. I think it stopped when I was 7, but was (of course) replaced with a long line of other weird fears.\n\nwhen i was 12 one of my biggest intrusive thoughts was that the police would track me down and take me to prison because i lied and clicked the button that said i was 18 when looking at a porn site\n\nWhen I was little, I shared a room with my younger older brother and we had a bunkbed, so he and I would sleep in the bottom bunk sometimes and our oldest brother would sleep up top or we'd all just pile into my parents' bed for a sleepover. But I would always sleep with the blanket over my ear because my oldest brother picked his nose and I was a bit germ-avoidant as a kid and I was always afraid he'd pick his nose and stick his finger in my ear. Very random fear and a terrible defense since he could just move the blanket. But now, I'm like, even though that brother was rarely nice to me and did a long list of mean shit to me, I don't think that thought would ever occur to him because why? He was always more verbal with it than physical - well, that's actually not true because he used to hit me or pull my hair when I did something like sit in the passenger seat of the car. But still, it's just so ridiculous.\n\nA while back, I also had this thought of me or someone else in my family going insane and killing everyone else in the house, so that was a fun thought. I always think of someone murdering me when I'm in the shower.\n\nevery time i get on a bus i think it‚Äôs going to crash and im going to have my leg severed in the crash and have my bone sticking out‚Ä¶ i think it‚Äôs really funny that it‚Äôs the same thought and my brain doesn‚Äôt have anything more creative than ‚ÄúMY LEG!!!!!‚Äù from spongebob üò≠sometimes i get an image with it and it kinda looks like a cartoon bone sticking out of my leg and that makes it kind of funny to me\n\nWait‚Ä¶. I did t realize other people had unrealistic/absurd intrusive thoughts in the way I do. Like when almost in the moment you know it‚Äôs silly/not realistic, but for a split second still feels scary real. True question: is that a byproduct of anxiety??\n\nAnyway, mine is the time I drove next to a big rig and thought ‚Äúwhat would happen if I just veered out of my lane and into it??‚Äù  I wasn‚Äôt suicidal and I wasn‚Äôt actually going to do it, but it was such a strong ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù that it still sticks either way me 20 years later.\n\nHmm. I guess all of them. Any kind of compulsive and intrusive thought that came to me was pretty ridiculous. One day I had a realization that I just am and that made me realize how ridiculous a lot of my anxiety inducing thoughts were. From getting hit by a car or eating a fly in my soup, or being terrified that others thought less of me. They're just thoughts, they come and go, and they can't hurt you. Working through compulsive and over thinking was one of the best things I've ever been able to sort out.\n\nSo weird but whenever I would get shots as a kid/teen, I wouldn‚Äôt take a shower for days after because I thought the water would get in where I got my shots and make me sick/kill me\n\nAnytime i use or even just stand near a lighter i imagine myself burning my house down with it... driving past telephone poles or on bridges/elevated roads its always \"I'm gonna drive off the side\". Sometimes if i think i eat too much i vividly imagine myself becoming 600 pounds and needing a gastric bypass.\n\nUsed to have thoughts also that my partner was dead in the bed when i went to sleep after her, had others that there would be a dead body under the blankets in the room and if i stopped staring at it, it would bolt upright.... yeesh!\n\nMy most recent one is: I send my puppy to doggie daycare near my job. My brain keeps thinking ‚ÄúWhat if I just go home after work and forget to pick him up‚Äù \n\nWhen I was little I fixated on the idea that someone was going to break in through our windows, kill my whole family, and burglar the apartment. We lived 7 stories up. lol that doesn‚Äôt even make sense brain.\n\nUuuuh You know that song \"Hotel California\"? \n\nI had this intrusive fear of forever being stuck in one space or not being able to see the world; when I was younger, probably 19-20, it lasted with me. It probably didn't help that I lived in a small town but it was always an anxious thought to me. As I get older though, I take more value in living in a place with an easy cost of living and being able to pay bills and not succumbing to intense debt. üòé\n\nThe Leaning Tower of Pisa would fall and create a worldwide earthquake was my irrational fear and first sign of OCD. I was 7 and heard a mini TV on ABC. Peter Jennings was telling us the tower moved an extra bit that year.\n\nOCD can really screw with one‚Äôs soul.\n\nNowadays I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll call in demons into my house. Then I keep saying ‚ÄúThese are intrusive thoughts, I‚Äôm NOT calling demons.‚Äù If that seems too irrational, I also have bipolar 1 so maybe that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre fantastical.\n\nBeing possessed! I wasn't even religious, but in high school it was an obsession nonetheless. My 16th birthday wish when I blew out candles was \"to not be possessed\". üòû I knew it was outrageous, but the \"what-ifs\" won over. \n\nThese intrusive thoughts really try to take our lives from us."

    "all_comment_text": "Woow! I thought I was the only one. I have this feeling since I was younger. Idk if it‚Äôs normal tho. It sucks lol\n\nSame like I legit put a sock in a hole that was in the wall cause I got paranoid their might be a secret camera same with ceiling lights\n\nokay like can someone please respond i really want to know if this is something that everyone fears? i‚Äôm 19 i have had this since i was 6 i remember i thought my 1st grade classmates are all watching me through a camera whenever i went to the bathroom i would start screaming and threatening whatever that was in front of me saying that i will tell the teacher about what they are doing if they don‚Äôt stop watching me\n\nI have this feeling... But I feel like people are in my home sneaking behind me and watching me.\n\nI started going to therapy. Was diagnosed with Bipolar... My therapist told me that what I experience is paranoia and that lots of people with bipolar experience this feeling.\n\nAnyways, not saying you have bipolar, but the feeling is paranoia.\n\nI always had some form of paranoia, whether I thought it was cameras, angels, people outside, ghosts, etc. I‚Äôve also been diagnosed with Bipolar. I didn‚Äôt know it was a common symptom.\n\ni was diagnosed with bipolar\n\nI kind of had this fear, mine turned into being afraid that my ancestors were watching me go to the bathroom...I could not go to the bathroom without freaking out for a while.\n\nThe camera thing was severe for me but not in the bathroom, more like in other instances and I still FEEL THIS WAY. ugh.\n\ni had the same experiences around that age too. i started to feel shy using the bathroom as a kid and would sometimes not go bcus i was afraid that my teacher or classmates were watching somehow. nowadays my fear evolved into being afraid that i‚Äôm not actually IN the bathroom and that i‚Äôm just wizzing on the floor somewhere esp when i‚Äôm at work. i have to stare at my surroundings to double check that i‚Äôm actually in the bathroom and not in my office with my pants down üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nOh my god! I have this exact fear almost every time I use the toilet at home and especially at work (I try to avoid using it at work as possible without it affecting my health). It's so bad to the point where I get very anxious as I'm using the bathroom in my own home.\n\nI used to have this as a child - I thought there were cameras installed in my home. I have OCD tendencies/a family history of OCD\n\nI have OCD too but I never thought it was a symptom! I was also scared of someone watching me through the window\n\nSeeing as how schizophrenia is in the same family of mental disorders as OCD üò≠ you start to understand why lol\n\nOh my goodness I was actually so anxious for months thinking I had schizophrenia! It‚Äôs also a common OCD theme üò≠\n\nMe too. especially the fact that one of my step-siblings is schizophrenic and also how I've heard voices in the past I thought I definitely had it for a bit.\n\nI thought this too‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to cry from relief that I‚Äôm actually not alone, I‚Äôve never known how to bring this up to anybody\n\nTotally felt this, makes me so uneasy.\n\nMy fianc√© and I might get my \"childhood house,\" which I'm still living in because I am still in college. My main worry is what if there are hidden cameras everywhere to watch us. Legit makes no sense, yet I think it!!\n\nMy father has OCD and sometimes I wonder if I have it too.\n\nYep I feel this at night I think someone's watching me and I HAVE to look. Just diagnosed ocd üòï\n\nOh! I have some ocd traits here and there (but not enough for me to actually go after anything beyond talking to my psychologist about it, it just annoys the hell out of me) and it‚Äôs good to know that can be linked to it. I‚Äôve always just assumed it was purely anxiety\n\nI have ocd, and anxiety. I always think the police or other cars are watching me while I driveüò≠other than that I think I blend in\n\nocd runs in my family big time\n\nOddly, I have developed a slight fear especially in public stores or restaurants.  I think the internet has ruined our trust in society in some ways.\n\nDo you have social anxiety? And when you are out do you often feel like other people are giving that same sensation as the recording feeling when you‚Äôre alone? I‚Äôve had that before! I totally feel like it was just my brain transferring those same social anxiety feelings into my home, and instead of thinking everyone was staring at me and thinking I‚Äôm embarassing, now it‚Äôs a weird anxious feeling my like I‚Äôm being watched with no one there. Does that resonate with you at all?\n\nI haven't really been professionally diagnosed, and I don't feel so in public. It's almost always only at my home.\n\nThis helps me!\n\nThat sounds like paranoia of being watched\n\nNo it is a paranoid delusion. You should discuss with your psychiatrist.\n\nDid your parents ever invade your privacy?\n\nall the time and im living with them temporarily at the moment (im 30) and they still do, like they come into my room and load me with questions about random things while i‚Äôm in the middle of something so when i‚Äôm alone in the house i always feel like i‚Äôm being watched which stops me doing silly things that would make myself laugh lol but i‚Äôm moving out soon i just fell into hard times üòÇ\n\nI think this has a lot to do with it. Mine monitored me as much as possible (reasonably so) and made me think I'm always being monitored. Even though I now live alone\n\nLol they either want you out or they miss being parents\n\nlooool possibly, sounds like a them problem though\n\nIssue not an ishme\n\nill be using that one x\n\nStealing this! Haha\n\nAh. Right. The security cameras throughout the house. \n\n(No /s here, lived like that. Stuff like it make it hard to tell what‚Äôs a trauma effect and what‚Äôs common sense.)\n\nYep! We didn't have them throughout the house, but we eventually got a ring camera and that scared me as a teenager. And there is something in the house that I always worry is a camera but I doubt it is. \n\nIt took me some time too to realize why I had that weird feeling all the time. But once it clicked, I started feeling more comfortable in my own home.\n\nThat could either be an anxiety thing or bordering on psychosis depending on what you mean. Obviously I can't diagnose you but believing you're under surveillance without reasonable cause is a warning sign of paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nOn the other hand, you can fully understand that you're not being recorded but the feeling of \"wouldn't it be awful if someone recorded that\" can still get to you. In the back of my mind I feel like I'm being watched even when I'm certain I'm not, just because I feel self-conscious.\n\nCould definitely be a psychotic symptom\n\nAgreed. I feel like I‚Äôm under a microscope when I‚Äôm out in big social gatherings in public, although I‚Äôm quite aware that rationally nobody is staring at me and my flaws. I‚Äôm just self conscious and a perfectionist. \n\nAt home though? Nah that‚Äôs my space - I feel 100% happy safe and comfortable\n\nI actually do relate a little to OP because I only feel that way when I'm letting my guard down. When I'm in public I'm on my best behavior and could really care less about privacy.\n\nAgain, it could still be a psychotic symptom, but I think I understand why being home triggers it. And the fact that it's when they're doing \"embarrassing\" things makes me think it might be a \"what if\" and not an actual delusion.\n\nYeah everyone different I just can‚Äôt ever imagine feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable in my own home it‚Äôs my safe haven and what I say goes there lol\n\nThat seems like a healthier approach to anxiety than the one OP and myself have created. üòÖ\n\nNot one original irrational fear üòÇ\n\nIf you think they are in your home, that's not normal. In public places, it's accurate.\n\nHappens to me, but I believe I'm the star of a sitcom and do stuff to make people laugh lol.\n\nSame!! I‚Äôve never heard anybody describe it but myself, to myself lol\n\nOhhhh my gosh yesss. I almost screamed reading this because it‚Äôs so true lol\n\nI play songs to please the crowd that isn't there.\n\nThis is probably how any normal person would feel with the current state of technology\n\nI have this too sometimes. Especially because I have maladaptive daydreaming where I love to dance to music and imagine myself in an edit. Always scared someone can see me and their reaction if they saw me üíÄ\n\nSounds a bit like paranoia‚Ä¶ do you see a psychiatrist or therapist? \n\nI feel the sense of ‚Äúomg everyone‚Äôs watching me‚Äù when I‚Äôm out in public - even though I know nobody really is - because I have a bit of social anxiety and I‚Äôm hella insecure/self conscious. But at home? Nah I walk around naked (inside only lol)  no fucks to be given\n\nIf you‚Äôd asked that question 50 years ago, I‚Äôd have said no. But in 2024? Honestly I think that‚Äôs pretty normal.\n\nAgree. This is new age anxiety with cameras everywhere. But in your home you should be safe.\n\nHow often did you see a camera in 1974? I‚Äôm not that old but most people didn‚Äôt carry cameras until they were part of their phones.\n\nMaybe look into OCD. I didn't have this but it's a pretty common obsession with friends who have OCD as well.\n\nThis is not normal. I work in psych and this is referred to as a paranoid delusion. If you aren‚Äôt already, you should consult a psychiatrist.\n\nI think it depends to the degree that you feel this hyper awareness. As a teenager I suffered from this phobia. I think I was just petrified at the thought of being caught off guard or without any clothes on. Throughout the years I‚Äôve had my fair share of paranoias but they‚Äôve calmed down dramatically.\n\nThat said my most pervasive anxiety has to do with my health. Maybe a bit of social anxiety, but mainly my health.\n\nI have this feeling as well. But I feel that people are actually in my home and watching me. I feel like they're hiding in the closet waiting to kill me. It's a horrible feeling.\n\nWhat you're describing is paranoia and it can be a symptom of other mental health problems. For me, it's bipolar. For others it could be some personality disorder. If you'd like to find out what it is for you, I recommend seeking therapy. That's how I was diagnosed.\n\nI think it is ü§î. Have you ever watched the trueman show? I sometimes feel like I'm on there being live broadcasted. But I deal better with this now but self-talk. Telling myself it is just a symptom of anxiety and not real.\n\nThis was me a lot growing up. So convinced somedays.\n\nI regret seeing it when I was so little. It messed me up more than my dissociation and paranoia already had. \n\nLove the movie though.\n\nDepending on the degree of your feelings and your circumstances, this may indicate a more serious mental health issue. Nothing to be ashamed of though! The fact that you recognize that these thoughts aren‚Äôt exactly normal is great! Working with a professional could help you get rid of these thoughts and feelings (: good luck\n\nI do feel this way too but I'm schizo affective Bipolar. It's literally exhausting. The amount of camera finding apps I have paid for that don't work.... omg. I hope u find ur peace ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nNo, this isn‚Äôt normal, at least to me. As someone who has had anxiety since I could first process thought, I‚Äôve not had symptoms like that, and I‚Äôve had paranoia. I‚Äôd think about if you have other symptoms and maybe talk to a therapist about your feelings because that can be really nerve racking. But, I know many people feel this way nowadays because cameras are basically all around us outside our homes. Not really for posting embarrassing videos though lol, just keeping us safe. I think expressions of anxiety like this may not be normal to me but maybe to others!\n\nRight???? That‚Äôs maddening! I‚Äôve fully convinced myself there‚Äôs hidden cameras in every single room of my house and somewhere on the deep web strangers are watching everything I do and no amount of logic can shake that feeling out of me. \n\nI‚Äôve thought about how to do something in order not to have that haunting my mind in the future but then what? I build my future house from the ground up all by myself keeping it under my own surveillance 24/7 even during nights and then not let anyone visit? Because that just sounds deranged, but if not I‚Äôll just have to live with this feeling and I hate it\n\nIf you're open to the thought, they might be demons that you can pray away in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nI ~~used to~~ still give the finger to the invisible camera in bathrooms because if the fictional they are going to watch me, at least I can be a bitch about it\n\nIt really depends on how this anxiety affects your life. If it's preventing you from doing things you want to be doing and/or causing you distress frequently, then I really recommend speaking to a therapist about it.\n\nI have been this way my whole life. It is not a consistent, obsessive fear but it always lingers in the back of my mind.\n\nAnxiety is just our subconscious crying out to us about something. It just wants some satisfaction toward that end. I bet you anything if you went out there and worked toward privacy awareness, you'd get that satisfaction your mind is craving.\n\nI've given speeches before on The Google History scandal and the Microsoft Getting to Know You scandal, among many others. When people hear what's actually being done to them legally, their eyes widen. It's quite gratifying and it helps the world.\n\nI actually feel like this sometimes too and I have no idea why. It's not enough that it bothers me or takes over my thinking, but I have thought that someone is watching. Some nights I have to shut all the curtains because I think someone is looking in. Kind of creepy\n\nI have a routine where I go around my entire house when it starts to get dark and close all of my shutters. Every single one of them! And then I always turn on the porch light and double check all of the locks. I‚Äôm pretty paranoid about that, but really home invasion type of shit can happen to anyone. so I find it just logical to do that. Plus, I remember back in junior high, my brother‚Äòs girlfriend had a peeping Tom in their neighborhood. Her mom caught him one time. And there was an ejaculate all over the wall where he had been watching her. Creepy ass motherfucker! I also have a two-story house that overlooks my backyard, I feel like they‚Äôre constantly watching. I have had a very strong thought years ago that when my husband‚Äòs friend came to work in our attic that he installed a listening device. I‚Äôve definitely thought people have left their camera or laptopor recording device in the room and left to see if people were talking about them. What in the hell is wrong with me! Why am I like this? Oh. Sometimes I take my phone into the shower in a waterproof case to listen to podcasts or music and I always think that some invisible psycho is watching me through the camera. I‚Äôm exhausted with this shit running through my mind constantly.\n\nIt's so strange because I only feel like I'm being watched at night time, when it's dark. I'm also afraid of the dark because I can't see the \"threats\" that are trying to get me. I have nightlights all over my house so I can see.\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to pull my blinds immediately when it started to get dark. I always thought someone would watch me through my window. Never bothered me during the day, but at night, it would increase massively. I actually kind of forgot about it until I saw your post. So, I must have gotten over it at some point.\n\nif it‚Äôs not a big fear for you anymore, i wanna suggest a clip that both reminded me of my same fear and made me laugh because it‚Äôs so strange.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, my ex had cameras hidden in our house, some type of recording device linked to our house phone, keystroke tracker gave him access to all of my emails and other personal things, tracker on my car, keys to my office and desk at work (we worked for the same company and he was able to get keys made from the keys that were held in the security office), plus various other insane things that would take too long to explain. \n\nOnce I found out, I've never felt comfortable in my own home since. My husband has a difficult time using the tv remotes so I know he couldn't do anything like that if he tried. I'm still uncomfortable. \n\nI keep my shades and curtains closed. My husband installed smoke detectors and they had lights on them and I checked to make sure there wasn't cameras in them. I've had my car checked for tracking devices, I check to make sure there's no recording devices in my car, I prefer the lights off when we're intimate and I won't walk around my home undressed, etc. \n\nI know I'm being extra but once your privacy has been invaded to that extent, by someone you trust, it's difficult to shake that off.\n\nWow this is borderline crazy I hope you're doing better now.\n\nYeah lol I can easily put it to the back of my mind so it never really bothers me but it is always there. Sometimes I be laughing at myself if I do something embarrassing so the cameras watching think I'm cool. Idk if it's normal but who cares it makes me laugh and hasn't affected my life negatively\n\nüòÇ yesss to the playing cool for the hidden cameras! i do the same thing. Or sometimes narrate my thought process out loud so the cameras understand why I'm doing a weird thing or series of things lol\n\nlol I do similar aswell but usually I'm just speaking inside my head as if the cameras can hear my thoughts üò≠ I might have to try the speaking out loud\n\nMe too... I'm seriously starting to think it's a condition but I'm too scared to tell my psychiatrist\n\nIt‚Äôs just part of anxiety, especially social anxiety. I think it‚Äôs part of how social anxiety manifests once you‚Äôre no longer in social spaces\n\nI feel like this too - always have! Not so much a serious fear, but always a voice in the back of my mind thinking \"but what if there's a hidden camera in here?\"\n\nWhen I was a kid/teen I used to think of it more like \"What if there's just an invisible person following me around who can see everything I do?\" So it's not even really about the internet or technology per-se.\n\nAs I get older I'm able to shush that voice more. I can be more like, \"well if someone's watching me without my knowledge, they get to see me do gross and embarrassing stuff. that's their problem, not mine\" (but it's not really a genuine fear or suspicion for me, just my anxiety being like what if)\n\nOh my god yes. I was trying to explain this to my therapist the other week. It feels like I‚Äôm living in the Truman show constantly??? I‚Äôm so relieved that somebody has put this into words, I thought I was insane. I always feel like big brother is watching, no matter what I do\n\nOh cool I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way üòÖ\n\nI don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs normal but I‚Äôve had a similar fear since I was a kid. I used to be convinced my stuffed animals eyes were cameras, that all mirrors were somehow used to watch me, and someone or something was watching me through windows.\n\nWhen I was vacationing at a rental in Long Beach, I had these ‚Äúoff‚Äù feelings that there might be a hidden camera placed in this weird hole in the master bathroom ceiling. \n\nYeah it‚Äôs probably paranoia, but there are far too many people actually doing it‚Ä¶\n\nI don't know.\n\nI remember as an early teen covering the eyes of all the people in the posters on my walls because it felt like they were watching me. I knew it wasn't rational to do it, but it still felt that way. I didn't do it for very long though, I don't think.\n\nI get this too! And if someone patted me on the back or was around my purse or something, I'm always worried they bugged me.\n\nSame at times. I think bc of the time we're living in is normal to think this. Every device in our house is probably watching our listening just like our phones üò®\n\nI used to have this feeling a lot. I noticed watching reality TV - particularly \"slice of life\" type shows like Real World, Kardashians, Housewives, etc. made it much worse. Exposure to these types of media triggered additional anxiety &amp; intrusive thoughts about it, even panic attacks. I was never a big watcher but I avoid that stuff completely now &amp; it helps. I still get the \"creeps\" sometimes but as I've gotten older it's calmed down a lot, along with my anxiety generally. Good luck\n\nI more of just think I'm being looked at at all times, and I can't make any mistakes or people will see even if it's something dumb like itching my head or looking in my camera to check if my eyelashes are fine\n\nI feel that way too. Though I‚Äôm mostly worried I‚Äôm being recorded, like, through my phone or computer cameras or the eyes of the various plushies i have. Gets pretty uncomfortable.\n\nI don't believe this is \"normal,\" but this also isn't a ton of information. My advice is entirely unofficial and my lowly opinion, but I work in mental health and have worked with clients with a variety of symptoms. I have a few questions.\n\n1. Have you looked for cameras? 2. Do you know who would be behind it? 3. Do you know why someone would care to do this? 4. Have you ever had this happen to you before? 5. Do you know whether strangers in public are recording you, even if it doesn't seem like they were recording once you look at them? 6. Have you had break-ins where there is no sign of how they got in, nothing major is taken, no one is hurt, but things are moved around or you know for sure someone was in your home?\n\n1.Well I have looked around in my room and found nothing but there's always a sense that they have a really tiny camera or hid it really well.\n2.I do have a bunch of people who might wanna do it.\n3.Ive always chalked it up to basic fricking around or someone wanting to be a creep or getting revenge on me.\n4.this has never happened to me before, but before the camera thing I used to think someone was watching me through my windows.\n5.I have had people recording me in public once or twice and when I looked at the camera they don't even stop but I don't really feel weirded out by this so much.\n6.Well obviously I feel like someone is breaking in to set up cameras then again they always left no proof of entrance and I hide the key very well ( I live with my siblings and there's only 1 main key)\n\nSo this is very long but I write it all to try to explain some things and give support to you, my fellow anxious Redditor. At the very least, please read the first paragraph and see if that's any consolation. If it's not and these worries persist, then please **definitely** consider my recommendations after that. I forget if I said it, but I work in mental health. I'm passionate about it and about disability advocacy in general. I say all of this with love.\n\nIn your case, 1. Actually searching for a camera is concerning to me. Anxiety that leads to such intensive action as searching your entire room for cameras is extreme. There's also the fact that not finding anything doesn't matter. If disproving a specific worry like this is exceptionally hard, because the mind always makes an excuse to keep the worry going, then that's concerning. 2. I don't know you. There's a non-zero chance, of course, people have been stalked and such in life, but almost all of us aren't that maliciously significant to anyone. Believing that you're the focus of a lot of attention and effort, especially to hurt you in some way including emotionally, is concerning to me. 3. Goes with answer 2, I suppose I could have asked just one question instead of two. 4. So this has been going on for a while. Not only that, but it's evolving and becoming more elaborate over time. First simply someone watching you. Basic enough. But now, for what you believe to be true, someone must have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on equipment and then broken into your house and room without drawing any attention. They then somehow took the time to exceptionally hide these cameras. If you couldn't find them, they must either be very small or blended into something you own. So very expensive equipment, possibly custom made. The time and resources needed are even more than before. Somehow they also would have needed to set up wires to this tiny camera that can't have much storage or a wireless system to then *get* the footage from the camera, or they would need to break in regularly to get the camera with stored footage (which would mean probably multiple sets of equipment, in order to put things the way they were before they left, which again is another expense; or more time spent in your house downloading footage without someone noticing). Again, more time and resources and effort needed to pull this off. Your concern has gotten much, much more elaborate over time and the view of yourself to this person has become grander and grander. This is very concerning for me. 5. That's good! I'll also point out that it's hard to tell where a phone camera is pointing. You ever try to take a picture of yourself with the *back* camera of your phone? It's hard to tell where the camera is actually pointed. The shape of the lens makes this even harder to tell. This becomes even more difficult to distinguish the further away you are from the phone. However, some people can experience worries like you do in context. They may not be concerned about strangers but are concerned about someone they know. However, I am concerned that this has never happened to you yet it's causing so much worry. If you were an abuse victim who had been recorded, it would make sense to have this anxiety. You have it for no clear reason. 6. This is probably the most concerning thing for me. In case you don't read further, I have worked in a program serving people exclusively with psychotic disorders. Serious concern about break ins that leave no evidence was extremely prevalent in that population and I have personally not seen it in jobs focusing on more general populations.\n\nI don't want to alarm you, but I would recommend seeing a mental health provider of some kind to rule out the onset of psychosis. The psychosis could either stand alone as a disorder or be connected to your anxiety as a symptom. To be extra clear: It is NOT impossible that this all is connected to anxiety more than anything, and it is also NOT a 100% damning evidence that you have a full blown psychotic disorder like schizophrenia. All I'm concerned about is the symptom of psychosis. I have no idea what that means for your big picture mental health.\n\nI of course can't differentially diagnose you, but these thoughts, behaviors, and feelings aren't dissimilar from symptoms of a psychotic disorder or features of psychosis attached to a different kind of disorder. I used to work in a program that exclusively served people with psychotic disorders, for context, so what you've described I've more or less heard before from my former clients. *Especially* feeling like someone is breaking in (and breaking in regularly?) without any evidence of a break in. That is not a typical anxiety thing. I haven't seen it in any other population, personally. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it just means I'm concerned from my personal point of view and experiences in mental health work and studies.\n\nI give my recommendation to see a mental health provider out of hope and genuine care for your well-being. Worst case scenario, the good news about psychotic disorders is that the younger/earlier you begin treatment, the better you are able to manage symptoms throughout the rest of your life. Best case scenario, it's not psychosis at all but you get some clear answers on what this is and how to address it.\n\nTo further explain and answer your original post question, it's \"normal\" (by which I mean not clinically significant) to be creeped out by an open curtain at night. We don't like being vulnerable when we sleep, the fear of the dark is natural, the fear of the unknown is natural. These all can create a visceral, fearful reaction of discomfort and unease. That unease is alleviated by closing the curtains. It doesn't continue once they're closed.\n\nUsing the curtain example, it wouldn't be \"normal\" to set up cameras outside and review footage each day to make sure you weren't watched, to pin who might be watching on someone, to black out your windows entirely, or to run outside because you feel like someone is there. It especially wouldn't be \"normal\" to do all of that and still be concerned about being watched. \n\nI know this is a lot. It also might seem strange to receive paragraphs of information from a stranger on the internet, but I went into the field I did because this is always what I've done. I'd write pages and pages and pages of support for strangers if it meant helping one person significantly and making a few others at least feel like there are people who care. Maybe you aren't in either group, but it was worth a shot to me.\n\nI think this is referred to as the ‚Äúinvisible audience‚Äù. As if you‚Äôre constantly being observed , and all of your actions are being judged by people who aren‚Äôt actually there.\n\nParanoia. I put black tape on my phone and laptop's camera...it helps a bit.\n\nWhen I'm in a really bad mood, I feel like there's a jury watching me perform, like in a TV show. They don't say anything, just watch and listen. My shrink says it's a form of derealization.\n\nif it‚Äôs just a feeling then that‚Äôs fairly common with anxiety, especially if it‚Äôs related to others opinion of you. if you truly believe it, then it borders into paranoia and psychotic behavior and you should absolutely have it checked out.\n\nYes it stems from my mom who was always snooping, staring, watching , judging, invading, every part my my space and existence\n\nI had this feeling for so long. I felt like people I knew were watching me or could see in my brain. I felt like people were watching me constantly in some way. Told this to my therapist and she immediately diagnosed me with social anxiety. I always knew but now I know why.\n\nI think it‚Äôs a fairly common feeling or fantasy. It‚Äôs probably a hangover from when we lived in caves and had to be on the lookout for danger. It sounds like hypervigilance which can happen after trauma or even if you‚Äôre watching scary movies or reading thrillers. If severe then it could be related to OCD or other mental health disorders. It‚Äôs only a problem if it‚Äôs affecting your peace of mind and daily life a lot. Otherwise I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a feeling most people have probably experienced. Try and brush it off and ignore it. If you really can‚Äôt then seek some help to find out the underlying cause.\n\ni had a ver, religious (cult like) upbringing and was always taught that god was constantly watching and judging me, even my thoughts. i'm an athiest now, but this feeling has a really hard time going away.\n\nI used to feel this strongly and would let my imagination go wild with it, it was not fun when I was younger but I'm 40 now, I think it is part of anxiety, and conditions in my childhood, my feelings and thoughts did not matter.\n\n So it transpired that I had to make sure everything was perfect in my house so people would think I was an amazing person, I felt like i had to be a perfect mother and wife and never left the facade faid as i was being judged in my home by unknown people. I even had to be careful with my thoughts as I believed people could read them, I knew they couldn't but it was this feeling I had. \n\nIt was exhausting to say the least. I find it very difficult to relax, like ever,  or just to do nothing, I must do something, it's like my relaxation is washing the car, making the house look beautiful, washing the dog, wiping the benches down, straightening things up, making a delicious meal, I can get very fatigued by it as there is always something to do. And I work also.\n\nI find being in nature really helps, I wish I had a garden because if I just sit down on the grass or under a tree I can really let everything go, or being in water, that's why I bring the 'outside in' as my husband says, plants, feathesr, a beautiful stick, leaves, shells, etc\n\nI found out years later that I was probably really being watched. There is several indications that my father installed a camera in several rooms of the house in which I lived with my family.\n\nThis sounds like something you should get checked out, doesn‚Äôt sound ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.\n\nYeah I have this a lot to the point it scares me bad. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective inpatient a couple years ago so I think it‚Äôs cuz of that but one professional told me that she doesn‚Äôt really agree with the diagnosis and it might all just be correlated to the anxiety cuz she doesn‚Äôt like diagnosing schizoaffective in teens. So yeah. More confusion.\n\nNo, that‚Äôs not a rational thought\n\nIt is normal .....\n\n\n\nOOOON METHAMPHETAMINE ü´†ü´† \n.\n\nYep. Get used to it. Cameras are EVERYWHERE nowadays\n\nNo, sounds like paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nIt all honesty they probably are if you‚Äôre out in public\n\nAlways feel like my every move is being under surveillance.\n\nIt's an opportunity for you to take a hand gesture while looking at the camera\n\nI feel like others may hear me and think about my life more than they probably do\n\nUgh yes. Feel like I‚Äôm being watched from device cameras sometimes\n\nWhat you doing in your own home?\n\nIf it makes you feel better we are all being watched. Be glad you don‚Äôt live in China and deal with their cameras\n\nIt wasn't true throughout most of history. It is now.\n\nI think you might have two things‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this is a heavy paranoia‚Ä¶\n\nnot normally, in fact there is no camera around you\n\nStop I get the same thing especially when I‚Äôm in school cause I‚Äôm homeschooled or whatever but my camera ain‚Äôt even on.\n\nThey are actually along with all of us\n\nTbh ties in with self esteem issues IMO.\n\nI am lately realizing that introverts oftentimes feel insecure about themselves. And to make things worse, many extroverts also feel the same just better acting. Very few humans are actually comfortable in their bodies.\n\nMaybe in smaller group societies or at work or whatever we get used to the environment, but I totally think it's normal to have insecurities given most people we're around are strangers to us (that's semi unnatural evolutionarily imo).\n\nSo, what to do about it?\n\nI have a similar fear. Not so much about a camera considering they're in every store and restaurant and most people have a camera on their porch now. I fear somehow randomly going viral for whatever reason.\n\nI always feel like someone is watching me but particularly though my devices\n\nI feel this way when I‚Äôm at a concert or anything relating to music and dancing. I always feel like everyone is watching me closely and I get embarrassed since i don‚Äôt know how to really dance\n\nI think this stems from using the internet/social media too often. I also feel it at times but just ignore it. No one cares what you are doing or who you are. No one is checking cameras unless there is a reason to.\n\nNot a professional or anything like that, but i can say i think the same thing and got to a point where i would feel a little uncomfortable and wouldn‚Äôt do certain things cause i felt like someone was watching. This is a form/type of delusional thinking, at least that‚Äôs what i was told when i got checked\n\nI felt this way when I was younger. No, it‚Äôs not a normal thing. It‚Äôs indicative of some mental health stuff. Therapy can help\n\nAre you scared of ur parents at all?\n\nNo it's not . You're becoming paranoid, you really need to talk to a psychologist cause this sounds like it could turn into psychosis\n\nIt can be paranoid delusion dear.Consult your doctor\n\nNope. Sounds like possible paranoia\n\nIve started to feel like this when I found a camera in my room 2 years ago :)))\n\nI get this too! thought I was the only one. Had it since I was a teen and still have it now as a 26 yr old who lives alone. Anytime someone comes over, I check for cameras once they leave lol\n\nProbably helps where I live (the UK countryside) but I really doubt I am being recorded. Nothing happens out here!\n\nBut if people were to upload videos of me, it wouldn't get many views... I don't do anything amazing!!\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman\\_Show\\_delusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Show_delusion)\n\nSchizophrenia\n\nI thought I was the only one!!!\n\nThat‚Äôs paranoia and it can be a sign of other mental health conditions besides anxiety\n\nNo that's not normal.¬†\n\nmokumokuren in my house mood\n\nI normally have my family pet sit while I go on vacation. I whole heartedly believe they have put  hidden cameras in my home. I constantly check everything for cameras. I still feel this way while medicated. I‚Äôm bipolar schizoaffective, GAD, &amp;&amp; a paranoid schizophrenic.\n\nI have experienced GAD, panic and agoraphobia but never this.\n\nNot really. I am in the psych field, and this sounds like paranoid delusion. Of course I can‚Äôt officially diagnose you, so please do consult a professional personally.\n\nI‚Äôm so glad that I‚Äôm not the only one but reading it is making me realize that it might be an issue\n\nThey are\n\nI used to have this fear when I was quite young like 6? I used to think people from my school would be watching me in my home and laughing on a hidden camera. I have/had OCD (and a whole host of other mh problems) which was particularly bad at the time. Mine seems to get worse at certain points in my life and around that age it was really bad, was performing like 60/70 ‚Äòrituals‚Äô a day although I didn‚Äôt know what they were then\n\nTbh now I think about it, I do get this fear at the gym with the fact so many people record their workouts and I‚Äôm scared someone‚Äôs gonna film me making a mistake or I‚Äôm gonna walk into someone‚Äôs frame without realising and then BAM I‚Äôm being stitched into a Joey Swoll video.\n\nI think it depends on the context, maybe speak to a dr if it‚Äôs concerning you?\n\nDid you get over the feeling that people you know or neighbors were recording you?\n\nYou need to feel comfortable. Always try to feel comfortable.\n\nI‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one. We have cameras in my house and every time I go downstairs or outside I feel like I‚Äôm being watched. I don‚Äôt like it at all. And for some reason I feel like there‚Äôs a hidden camera in my room that someone is watching me from\n\nI used to duct tape various parts of my room because I was convinced someone had midden cameras in the walls, this phase passed me by but I was convinced for months\n\nExactly whenever I'm alone doing something in middle I turn around and feel like someone is watching me or recording me .\nAnd I would close the windows and doors but still I always thought like what if someone secretly installed cameras in my house.\n\nI have this too. Drs say it‚Äôs abnormal and paranoia\n\nAs an apartment dweller, I sometimes think about this but with mild to moderate anxiety. This usually happens when I move into a new place but typically subsides over time. Most of my anxiety triggers are from social situations, however.\n\nIf you know you don't have any cameras in your house then I would say that isn't good to feel like that. But out in public you pretty much are on camera all the time and just have to get used to it.\n\nFor me, a lot of this was tied to my social anxiety and largely fell away with medicating my anxiety and depression. I think some more fell away from reading studies on gender and self monitoring leading me to consciously release my hypercritical monitoring of my own outward appearance. I really can't overstate how much of my brain it feels like I've freed up since I was younger.\n\nOmg yes I feel so validated\n\nDefinitely not the only one üò≠ I constantly feel watched\n\nEver since I started primary school at five years old I had this anxious thought that if I was doing something I didn't want people to see (showering, toilet) all the 'mean kids' from my class were watching me and were going to show everyone pictures. It's subsided a little as a worry but I do still get kind of embarrassed or self-conscious sometimes even if I know there's nobody there\n\nI would cover my phone camera while doing certain stuff and I used to be deathly afraid of my phone dying because I thought that whoever was watching me on my phone would hack me and post embarrassing stuff.\n\nI get this occasionally and call it my ‚ÄúTruman Show‚Äù paranoia. üòÇ\n\nyou are giving the floodlight consciousness magnanimous attention.  Feel free to think of nothing at all and let the wind take you where it will.\n\n(study w/ Alan Watts on youtube)\n\nthe ego insists on the spotlight, 'all the worlds a stage'.  The next level is to realize that you are a part, apart, from the whole, merely by your mind.\n\nTo be clear I mean experience everything outside of you, as happening, inside of you.\n\nGrow like the trees\n\nbend like the leaves\n\nand live like the breeze\n\ncombination of OCD and paranoia.\n\nMe after I watched the Truman show at ten years old\n\nHey good to know I'm not the only one lol\n\nI don't have this but I also didn't grow up or was a kid with everyone having cameras in their pockets, and where social media wasn't as popular. I'd say this is probably due to that unfortunately and just being hyperaware that many people get embarrassed online. Just remind yourself (constantly if need be) that in your own home you are safe from this! Or you absolutely have every right to be. Also in public, everyone is so focused on their own stuff that no one will be focused on you in a bad way. Don't worry about the \"normal\" , that word sucks. Focus on how it affects you and how you can make your situation better for yourself :)\n\nI do embarrassing stuff also (mostly accidentally sometimes because I like making fun of life), that said the thought of cameras or microphones being in my house never crossed my mind. If you are in apartment I could understand somewhat, when I rented a student apt I didn't feel a lot of privacy (huge building tiny rooms)\n\nThis is a warning sign of psychosis¬†\n\nLiterally every second I‚Äôm high it‚Äôs in the back of my mind, I feel like someone I know it spying on me and trying to catch me doing weed, and I always think there‚Äôs cameras and check for them and constantly peek out the window.I hate it so much I want to quit so bad\n\nI think this may be a sign of addiction üò≠\n\nDefinitely very addicted, jt sucks\n\nI have this and I WAS ACTUALLY IN A SITUATION RECENTLY WHERE THERE WERE A TON OF CAMERAS WATCHING ME!!! It was a job I did and there were ring lights all around the interior. It was really really uncomfortable. Never worked there again. \n\nBut I've also had this fear since I was a kid. Really sucked for it to be confirmed.\n\nAnyone else have this experience?\n\nTruman show delusion falls into this category where you feel like you are being watched and your entire life was one big lie.\n\nI will sometimes just stare blankly at a wall or into a mirror and just a imagine a camera staring right back at me with millions of people watching me live 24/7.\n\n\nIt's very scary!\n\nI feel like everything it's a lie there's my \"classmates\" and everyone I've encountered is watching me like I'm in a experiment or something like there's a camera everywhere watching me it creeps me out\n\nI record music and video and I know the feeling.. I get the feeling in my car and sometimes at a friend‚Äôs house. Is this a skill or just paranoid\n\nI always feel like this! Thought I was the only one!! When I was younger I would also feel like there were a sports announcer narrating everything I did, I would like hear it if that makes sense? Sometimes I do still if I‚Äôm really stressed or haven‚Äôt slept. I‚Äôve always had an active imagination. Now that we live in the digital age with cameras and phones with cameras, I feel like I‚Äôm being watched but usually only ever think about it if I do something embarrassing or go to the toilet haha I cover my phone camera when I use the bathroom if I feel the need to watch a show in there or browse the internet lmao! Can‚Äôt even change in front of my dog if she‚Äôs staring at me I feel judged lol anxiety is all I think is wrong! Since it seems to only bug me when I‚Äôm stressed or anxious! I think because of my imagination being so strong that it shows in this way! :)\n\nI just had an epiphany‚Ä¶our mind is so powerful and in control that we need to release this ‚Äúfear‚Äù or whatever it is to feee ourselves.\n\nSince I was little I always thought hidden spy cameras were watching me and possibly my parents were viewing it. I would wave and talk at corners and imaginary places where they could be. It's gotten better over time, but I still feel like people are looking through my door and watching me some of the time. I don't really feel in privacy. What is it??"

I hope he‚Äôs not your treating doctor and if he is I‚Äôd be finding someone new.\n\nIf you‚Äôre able to, then I‚Äôd suggest finding a different doctor. Best case scenario, he was being too casual. Worst case scenario, he doesn‚Äôt care abt his patients enough to have a proper tele-health call. Either way, you are not being prioritized nor is your care. Not surprised it‚Äôs a male doctor either. In my experience, male doctors don‚Äôt take mental health or female-related problems seriously. Best of luck, truly.\n\nFind another doctor\n\nImmediately\n\nYes, nothing to do with you. Sorry that happened to you!\n\nDoctors can be total dicks. Not overthinking it! Ignore his antics. As an anxiety sufferer, I‚Äôve learned MDs are typically not helpful to our condition, which has caused me not to get annual check ups, etc. also not a good thing, so I‚Äôll follow my own advice and not let the jerky MDs get to me either! Best of luck finding a therapist :)\n\nId have said something. It would make me absolutely shake, but id have said \"im sorry, did you just call me and proceed to ignore me for 3 minutes while you laughed with your coworker? Finish your conversations before you attempt to communicate with me. You're my doctor.

Just a total lack of professionalism. Id be worried if he takes mental illness like anxiety as serious as he should. I would look into another doctor tbh\n\nFrom the sound of it, he could've very well just been bullshitting with his co-workers and one of them said something really funny. I doubt it was you.\n\nStill unprofessional though, gotta dial it back with a client on the phone.\n\nJamaican'me'crazy!!!\n\nThis doctor sounds like a real quack.\n\nBeat me to it\n\nYeah I'm sorry but that was hella unprofessional and super freaking rude, maybe find a different doctor? Sorry you went through that.\n\nNothing to do with you, probably was just talking to a coworker.\n\nChange doctor immediately\n\nThat‚Äôs so rude, I‚Äôm so sorry.

Also, the sugars in bananas are natural and can help reglate blood sugar, and bananas contain tryptophan, which can help with sleep and converts into feel-good serotonin.\n\nSure.  Potassium and magnesium.  Magnesium can get depleted with anxiety.\n\nProbably not helpful for someone suffering from emetophobia like OP, though. I actually have something like the opposite where I get heavy anxiety because I think I haven't eaten enough. Bananas have saved me so many times\n\nGetting out of bed is a good first step. Have a cup of warm something. You‚Äôve got to distract your senses. Maybe go stand outdoors for a second. Free write in a notebook. Get an interesting book out and read it. Cold shower (or warm, whichever snaps you out of your head and into your body). Play a dumb phone game. \n\nYou are okay and this is temporary. \n\nThis is all on top of the good breathing advice here.\n\nHey there, just know you‚Äôre going to be okay. Just try to remind yourself that it‚Äôs just anxiety and nothing is wrong. I have this happen a lot with my cardiophobia and I just have to remind myself that I‚Äôm safe and okay. Something that has helped me a lot is the Dare app. Has a different approach to look at anxiety and guided walk throughs. Please feel free to reach out to me on direct message if you‚Äôd like!\n\nYou‚Äôre not alone üíïhere‚Äôs a list of some YouTube videos that have helped me massively in my journey with panic attacks!!\n\nüåøPanic attack affirmations! This helps me calm down.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pJWY3Bkkaew?si=CT_6bAI3t_33DvJD\n\nüåøHow to stop a panic attack \n\nhttps://youtu.be/wR8oKZ5qTfk?si=x4wIFkaKRSGFSHSJ\n\nüåøWhat causes them? How can I stop them?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IzFObkVRSV0?si=ECZlb1ABJW36cUTV\n\nThis will pass. Always remember that \n\n((Apply something cold to your face, like your cheeks and forehead and your neck. An ice pack works perfect for this. ))\n\nFeet in cold running water and or/cold compress to the back of the neck. These methods help me in my most intense episodes. Sometime barefoot outside to ground myself helps too. Always breathe.\n\nSame! I splash cold water and drink cold water to calm myself down because the nocturnal panic attacks make me feel like I‚Äôm boiling\n\nYes this helps me and counting backwards. Going outside, telling myself it‚Äôs all in my head and I control my own thoughts. It will be over in 10 min.¬†\n\nSame thing happened to be a few months back. It‚Äôs scary!! But trust me, you‚Äôre okay!! \n\nOne thing I had to do was get my sugars up. No clue if it was related to the nocturnal panic attack but my glucose was tested and it came back quite low. \n\nDeep breaths in, and out.  Center yourself. Remind yourself it was a dream and you‚Äôre here now and the dream is over with. Keep cool, be calm and focus on your breathing. \n\nYou‚Äôre okay and you‚Äôre not alone. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI know this is a little late, but im going to drop a few ways I deal with my panic attacks. The shock of jolting awake causes me to have one, about, idk, 75% of mornings. \n- Hot showers with minimal light, just feel the sensation of the water purifying you from your anxiety\n- Going barefoot outside in the grass, closing your eyes and feeling the earth suck the anxiety from your feet \n- Really just find any way you can imagine the anxiety leaving your body, and actively pursue the goofy behavior you think of. \nA close friend of mine recommending shaking my hands, and imagining anxiety falling off like water droplets after submerging your hands in water. It doesn't work for me, but maybe for you!\n\nYou got this...hang in there. You are stronger than your anxiety.\n\nSorry, that feeling sucks. \nJust did the drill this AM.\n4x4 breathing meditation and tapping your thighs (bilateral stimulation) for 30 min.\nMeds help; gabba or ashwaganda if you don‚Äôt like synthetics.\nMindfulness. Feelings aren‚Äôt facts. \nFor me it was stress plus too strong coffee. \nCould be your limbic system overheating from stress.\nCould be past trauma trying to find its way out. Bilateral stimulation (as used in emdr therapy) will help your body move emotional backlog from your amygdala through your prefrontal cortex; otherwise your body will running fire drills and sending flashbacks, nightmares, panic and intrusive thoughts trying to complete this process in its own ways.\nHiking, music, dance, martial arts and dreaming are more common ways to reach the same destination- anything that has both sides of your body moving.\nReducing stress, increasing regular restorative rest  breaks will go a long way too.\n\nIve gotten those alot.. had to call 911 lastime . \nIts something called nocturnal panick attacks\n\nI get those. Waking from a dead sleep in overwhelming panic‚Ä¶\n\nWhat did the paramedics do for you?\n\nthey did like a ekg and other things in my home then took me to the e.r then they just monitor me and gave me medication to calm down and they told me to get help from a phyciatrist\n\nI couldn‚Äôt stop shaking in the ambulance it was horrible , i be falling asleep fine then waking up to a super fast heart rate\n\nHave you had any breakthrough or treatment that worked as of yet?\n\nAny fixes ? This has been happening to me the same thing\n\nSeen that you were online and wanted to talk. Currently experiencing this. I was fine before I went to bed‚Ä¶ and then boom. Have you found any relief?\n\nI had to up my hydroxzene dose to 50 mg and got better relief it stopped after after 4 days of it happening but it will probably return eventually\n\nLet‚Äôs hope not! Glad something is working don‚Äôt yay the moment!\n\nI been going through bad jaw pain again has my anxiety high again\n\nThis is me tonight. I kept wondering why my teeth and jaw were so sore. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm non stop clenching them. This is new. Well years ago I didn‚Äôt but it came back. üòî\n\nI‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, but know you are not alone.   What helps me is cold exposure.   Cold shower, holding an ice cube, standing in front of an AC unit or just running my hands under cold water.  I hope you find something that can ground you and ease your mind.\n\nWatch silly videos of anything, like animals or jokes. That helps me a lot.\n\nBreathe in for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 8. \n\nRemind yourself that you‚Äôre safe at home in your comfy bed. \n\nRepeat until you feel more regulated.\n\nAcid reflux and GERD can trigger these kinds of attacks. These conditions are closely linked. An antacid may help, sleeping with your head and upper body elevated can too. Hang in there.\n\nI have GERD so that makes so much sense. I woke up to such severe nausea/burning in my chest and a horrid panic attack\n\nYou're going to be ok! My panic attacks only happen at night so just start repeating: I'm ok, it's not real, everything is okay and there's nothing to worry about. \n\nNow try to match your breath to your heartbeat. Intentionally slow down your breathing and try to get your heart to sync up with your breath. Visualize your heart and imagine it slowing down, to a normal, steady beat. \n\nGet some cold water or an ice pack- I find the tempature change can snap me back to reality.\n\nOh this brings back memories. I had this happen to me nightly for weeks, to the point I was too scared to go to sleep. Meditation and therapy finally helped but it was such an awful time. I really feel for you and hope you get some help.\n\nthis is late but you'll be okay. this too shall pass. thoughts are just thoughts, they can't hurt you even when it seems like they definitely can. I offer calming thoughts and images of teddy bears.\n\nIt helps me to grab some ice or an ice pack and hold it in my hands or against my face and neck when this happens\n\nThis happened to me couple months back it was so scary I thought I was really gonna die that time but it went away don‚Äôt worry just remember it cannot kill you You‚Äôre way stronger then the anxiety just tell yourself that and it may help.\n\nIt‚Äôs happened to me multiple times when my anxiety was at its worst. Stay strong, you‚Äôll get through this ü´∂\n\nhey, i‚Äôm emetephobic too and often get nocturnal panic attacks. it‚Äôs just the body‚Äôs way to release stress and the only way is to jolt you awake. in your case you had a nightmare and i‚Äôm so sorry, i couldn‚Äôt imagine how awful that would‚Äôve been. you handled it very well. when i have mine, im frantically calling my boyfriend and i‚Äôm petrified of being s* but i never am. you never will be either. it‚Äôs just an awful and uncomfortable feeling. you handled your first one very well!\n\nThank you, friend. I‚Äôm on a sedative medication so usually my only anxiety-free time is during the 8 hours I sleep - it really shook me up being woken up like that during what‚Äôs usually the safest time. Totally understand calling your boyfriend. The only reason I didn‚Äôt wake my mum up (still live with parents due to many factors) is because I was scared it‚Äôd make it more ‚Äúreal‚Äù if that makes sense.\n\nmy god i know exactly what you mean, making it feel real. it‚Äôs the worst. for me, getting up to the bathroom or getting water, makes it real. like, i need to stay in my bed until it passes! \ni‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre feeling better, it‚Äôs normal to feel tired, exhausted and unwell the day after, and i know it‚Äôs anxiety inducing to fall back to sleep after having an attack, i‚Äôm always paranoid of it happening two nights in a row, but your body will be wayyyy too tired to put yourself through that again! in a way, you can sleep peacefully knowing it won‚Äôt happen again! \nand you‚Äôre fine, i still live with my parents too but no one can reassure me like my bf can! i hope you have a good support system too, emetephobia can be hard for others to understand so i hope you‚Äôre okay there!\n\nA few days ago this happened to me for the first time in the middle for the night. My right arm was numb because the way I was sleeping and I thought I was having a stroke. \n\nI‚Äôm recovering well but I‚Äôm not 100% there yet. It‚Äôs been awhile since I have had an attack and it always takes me awhile to mentally and physically recover. But I know I‚Äôm alright and you will be too.\n\nSomeone on here recommended Panic Free TV on YouTube.\n I had struggled with anxiety and panic attacks about 17 plus years ago. I would wake up in the middle of the night from panic, I was agoraphobia. It was awful. I was on Lexapro at that time.  I did an at home CBT and never had one again. Then! In the past year, I had major stressors after major stressors. I had a few small panic attacks. Then more stress. I literally spiraled so fast that i couldn't believe it. I went from driving out of town for work and in less than a few weeks barely able to drive a few blocks without feeling like I was extremely dizzy. The feelings of unreality and disassociation were 24/7. That scared me more than any other symptom I have ever felt. My Dr Rx me lexapro again and buspar, but I don't want to take it.  In my freaking out moments searching the internet for reassurance, I stumbled on someone else's thread, and they suggested Panic Free TV on YouTube. In 2 days , I went from constant anxiety and multiple panic episodes going from 1 to 10 to day 2 of the program. I have been able to see a difference already. This is life changing!\n\nHello friend, the energy is incredibly high lately and everyone is who sensitive is feeling it. You are not alone, and this will pass. \n\nPlease try this energy healing video to pull all the heavy energy from your body, so you can feel more peaceful. [energy healing for anxiety](https://youtu.be/7tBD0W8Tdik?si=ABMxRN1V26B1Ckdk)\n\nI promise you will be okay bro, try to practice some breathing techniques but I'm about to go on a jog. I havent in a year and think it will help w mental health an blood pressure and anxiety...go on a jog with me bro. I'm to leave, maybe that will help. love ya brother god bless\n\nHey! I‚Äôm here. You‚Äôll be okay. Our minds are mean sometimes , but it wasn‚Äôt real. Maybe get a glass of water or eat a soft food. Take some deep breaths. You‚Äôll be okay. I promise.\n\nHad this happen recently, couldn‚Äôt sleep all night for being panicked. Even if you can‚Äôt calm down, just keep telling yourself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get through this, I‚Äôll see tomorrow, I‚Äôll be here still worried and anxious and sweaty when the sun rises and then I‚Äôll shower or drink coffee, etc‚Äù\n\nIt looks like I‚Äôm late here but I hope you are feeling better, and if not sleeping at least resting. Music works wonders for me- soft, easy to listen to nothing chaotic- I‚Äôm Christian and for me prayer calms me down,  I also find a soft blanket and snuggle under it. If I‚Äôm anxious about going BACK to sleep ( I have a hard time with that) sometimes if you are sleeping in a bedroom sleeping on the couch can feel safer and change the dreams, or just in a different room..\n\nHappened to me a lot of times. Watching funny video game videos helps me calm down pretty effectively.\n\nSaw your edit. I feel like when I have a bad panic attack like that I stay somewhat dissociated or depersonalized for a good half a day or so. That‚Äôs just me though. I think it‚Äôs adrenal fatigue.\n\nVery scary I know. If you have somebody you can call I always found that helped. I know it‚Äôs hard at the time but remember your going to be fine your not going crazy this will pass. Also speak to a psychiatrist they will tell you what to do and how to stop or calm them down. After 7weeks I was fixed never had them again. They were called nocturnal panic attacks. Truly terrifying!! It‚Äôs was due to learning the stock market the psychiatrist said my brain was overwhelmed. Hope this has helped. Stay cool everything will be ok I promise üòé\n\nHope you are doing better now üå∏\n\nGetting there as the day goes on, thank you. üíï\n\nI am happy we are all here , i know i am late , but happy we are all here now\n\nI hate these panic dreams I‚Äôve had 2 lately\n\nBeen there friend‚Ä¶ I ended up in hospital once. I would recommend praying and going for a walk outside if you can manage. Also I‚Äôve found breathing exercises very helpful.\n\nhi i hope you're doing better now. nocturnal panic attacks are horrible especially when you have emetophobia. i suffered from both of these when i was around 14-15 years old, and it was awful. praying this was a one time thing for you but if it happens again here's what used to help me:\n- cold washcloth on my neck\n- a fan on my face\n- putting a comfort show on in the background. my favs are gilmore girls, friends, schitts creek, or avatar the last airbender. everything immediately feels lighter and less scary.\n\nNocturnal attacks of anxiety can be associated with hypoglycemia or elevated cortisol. that‚Äôs something worth looking into.\n\ncurrently dealing w this right now. woke up from a deep, dead sleep feeling extremely nauseous, boom, emetophobia panic attack kicks in. \n\nstill trying to calm myself\n\nSo sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this, friend. Hope you managed to get back to sleep.\n\nIt has happened to me. I thought I was having a heart attack. My doctor was very nonchalant about it &amp; said it's just anxiety. I was mad! This was really frightening, and they made it sound like nothing. I was sound asleep when it happened. I could not understand why my body did that to me. This happened a few more times and then subsided. My psychiatrist gave me Xanax for it. My general practitioner was useless. Please take care. ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nPeople needs to stop giving advice on how to fight a panic attack! Or calm yourself from one even.\n\nI know it‚Äôs in good faith, but it will only make it harder to manage in the long run. \n\nThe key to manage panic anxiety and attacks is to let it come. Let it scare you half to death. Open the door and let it in. Allow yourself to go through it and trust that it won‚Äôt kill you. Learn what happens in your body when a panic attack kicks in. The only thing we can say with a hundred percent certainty is that the panic attack will pass. We also know it can‚Äôt harm you. \n\nThe harder you fight, the more scared you will be and the harder it‚Äôs going to be to re-wire your brain afterwards. This might seem ignorant and cold, but trust me, I‚Äôve had many panic attacks where I thought I would die. I only saw improvements when I learnt to trust that they wouldn‚Äôt kill me and when I told myself - bring it! Come on stupid fucking brain! Try your best! \n\nThis is a core component of cognitive behavioral therapy and proven to be a very effective way of stopping panic attacks from taking over your life.\n\ni think it should be a balance of both. it's good to have coping strategies prepared, especially if there's physical symptoms like nausea and chest pain. but you're right that it's also important to educate yourself on the science of a panic attack and try to get it in your head that this can't kill you and you will always get through it.\n\nUgh been there. I hope you‚Äôre feeling better honey. Sending you love. x\n\nSame thing happened to me last night. 145-4 am I was awake because of it. I hope you got the rest you needed after that!\n\nJust now seeing this, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre feeling better. Night panic attacks are the worst! One of the reasons I became a counselor was due to wanting to help others like me with anxiety, panic disorder, OCD, agoraphobia, ptsd.\n\nIf this is not a one-off and you find yourself waking up in panic, talk to your doctor about it.\n\nI used to do that regularly and it turns out I had sleep apnea. When I would stop breathing, it would throw me into a panic attack and I would wake up in panic.\n\nI have not had that happen even once since I‚Äôve had my CPAP.\n\nFun isn‚Äôt it?\n\nI felt this hard. For me it's either a nightmare that caused it (sometimes I don't even remember it but I know it happened). Or went to bed stressed/ate to much/drank caffeine before sleep(even if it's just a nap). I'm glad you hung in there! &lt;3\n\nI once had success drinking a lot of water. I did put magnesium powder in it (small amount) but I think I was really dehydrated. My spaghetti started dogesting from hours prior. I didn't even know there was a problem and wasn't even that thirsty. I drank 2 large glasses and heart beat came down to normal.\n\nYou could also consider benadryl?\n\nHope you're well now! Hang in there\n\nHave you been checked for sleep apnea?   With that you might wake up gasping for air and immediately have a panic attack.\n\nI'm so sorry.): I used to do this all of the time before I got on Effexor.\n\nHow do you feel now?\n\nJust checking to see how you were doing\n\nGlad you managed to get some more sleep. Hope everything is better now!\n\n\nI've been waking up like that - super fast heart rate, cold-sweating &amp; feel like I can't control my body temp, anxiety, nauseous, can't even think or function - every damn time I sleep for the last... Idk, at least 2-3 months! I can't sleep for longer than 2 hrs before I wake up like that! Told my GP and he suggested more CBT. I didn't realize I'm having panic attacks until I read this. Thank you! Now I just need to figure out why!?! I used to love sleeping. Not anymore!\n\n\nHave been trying CBT techniques when it happens. Really, the only thing I've found that helps me is to sit outside or in front of an open window &amp; fan (so it's cold. I stop sweating for a bit and focus on staying warm), and I \"read\" a book, any book (The words aren't registering, it's just something to keep my brain busy). Am going to try some of the things people have suggested here.\n\nhey, this has happened to me a few times. ¬†it just happened again (why is how i found your post), so i know what you‚Äôre going through. ¬†my stomach feels paralyzed rn, i feel so sick but i know it‚Äôs just my anxiety. ¬†it‚Äôs ironic cause my anxiety meds were causing me stomach problems, im coming off them which is giving me more anxiety problems. ¬†health can be so hard and annoying and disappointing, you‚Äôre not alone!!¬†\n\nThe comments on this post made me cry. I had a really bad panic attack at a concert last night. One of the Emts at the first aid tent had the kindest face and it made me feel seen. You don't know how important kindness is until you really need it.\n\nSo sorry, friend, and I hope you‚Äôre feeling a little better now? Whenever I look back at this post the kindness is overwhelming in the best way. We‚Äôre not alone. *You‚Äôre* not alone. üíñ\n\ni am so happy i found this thread because i too , am struggling at 2 am with a panic attack. i don‚Äôt feel real, and i don‚Äôt feel like i recognize anything even tho i can see everything, and i do in fact recognize it. it feels like i have to convince myself. and my eyelids are heavy, but the feeling of sleepiness isn‚Äôt there. just writing about it makes me feel better but if anyone happens to see this (no rush, it pretty much happens every few nights) and has tips on these things, that would be nice to hear :)\n\nHappen to me last night definitely scary as it happen due to a dream‚Ä¶I‚Äôm ok now an just relaxing i don‚Äôt like when have a panic attack I get kinda shaky cause i get anxious but when I start deep breathing I‚Äôm fine ‚Ä¶peace and love to you üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è its ok\n\nI‚Äôm not doing good, so don‚Äôt listen. Get drunk."

Let it go and live better and live out loud.\n\nlive out loud is so true!\n\nI found out someone I thought was a good friend, didn‚Äôt invite me to her wedding either. I never reached out to her again.\n\nIt hurts and I don‚Äôt know what to say to you.\n\n*HUGS* I am so sorry this happened to you.\n\nThe same happened to me a few months ago. I decided to not contact them again as well, but it was hard to hold in the anger that I wanted to express to them... I was going to angry-block them, but realised that even that is more of my emotions than they deserve. I will simply reciprocate their silence, and try to forget them. Sorry that this happened to you too, people suck sometimes.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry that happened to you üòî It sucks. You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs best to just not talk to them and move on, as hard as that is\n\nDid she ever try to reach out to you after you didnt reach out?\n\ndont take personal maybe it was budget..or financial or other family limits..let it go\n\nIt just happens that not everybody holds you at the same value as you do them. Take this as a learning experience and give what you get.\n\nI became a much happier person when I started ‚Äúadjusting‚Äù my expectations based on who I‚Äôm dealing with.\n\nand maybe youv grown apart..forget it\n\nSorry, idk what you mean when you say forget it?\n\njust move on and know they maybe had a reason..but dont feel bad about it .is wgat i meant..\n\nYeah I think you‚Äôre right, I think there are definitely situations where that‚Äôs the best course of action. Hold on tightly but let go lightly or whatever those song lyrics are.\n\nEXACTLY¬† U GOT THIS¬†\n\nand if you are a good looking female.thats another thing\n\nFeel the same - I feel as if I give my all to others who wouldn‚Äôt do the same for me, and it‚Äôs hard to find others that are like you in that regard.\n\nFor a little bit of perspective I‚Äôm planning on having a very small wedding because I can‚Äôt afford to have a big wedding. I likely won‚Äôt invite people I haven‚Äôt talked to in a long time, even if we were once close. That doesn‚Äôt mean any harm or disrespect to them, but it will be mostly family with a few close active friends.\n\nIf you knew those people would expect you to invite them, you could just tell them, it would be so much better knowing it's a financial issue rather than NOT knowing.\n\nI'm saying this as someone who had experiencd being on the other side - the non-inviteds.\n\nThis is why I havnt gotten married yet. Because I'm not wealthy an know I have to not invite alot of people I was once close with an havnt seen in years but I'm sure they will see it on Facebook ect an become upset.\n\nok so dont be brainwashed by the BILLION DOLLAR BRIDAL INDUSTRY all that crap means nothing.invite loved ones plan your life...Live within your means ..a loving bbq in the backyard .is fine BE REAL¬† a wedding shoukd be a bout a special vow and committment..not a riduculous 50k dress ..this is all the product if reality..or NON REALITY TV¬†\n\nElope. And never think about it again.\n\nexactly\n\nYeah I had a few friends from college who had like 250-300 ppl weddings where I was invited. But when my now wife and I got married ours was just under 100. We had to make cuts especially for people who she had never met (and I had gone to their weddings and we were close in college, but 10 years prior).\n\nOne of my very best friends of my whole life invited me wedding dress shopping with her and then never told me about her wedding date or invited me. I found out on instagram that the wedding had happened. It broke my heart so deeply. Took 5 years for us to even start speaking again.\n\nWhy would you want to speak to them again after that? Especially after 5 years..\n\nDid she ever tell you why?\n\nCommenting because I need answers. I'm so sorry. That must have really hurt\n\nOmg that‚Äôs horrible. Honestly I would‚Äôve cut her off right after I found that out\n\nIt was during the height of Covid so she had a more limited guest count, but I didn‚Äôt even know the wedding was happening, so idk if that‚Äôs a good excuse. They had a significant age gap (freshly 20 and he was 32) and she had previously (a couple years prior to this) had a breakdown about the level of commitment he wanted. I was worried and uncomfortable and was a bit outspoken about it. Looking back, it wasn‚Äôt really my place. But I was worried for her at the time. And she shouldn‚Äôt have invited me dress shopping with her if she knew she wasn‚Äôt even going to invite me or inform me of the wedding. Anyway, I love her husband now and they have a beautiful son together. But a few years ago was really hard, I‚Äôd see her pictures for years and just want to cry. \n\nAt the end of the day, it was her wedding and not mine, and she didn‚Äôt owe me the courtesy of an invite or being informed. But it did really really hurt. We are late 20s and her husband is late 30s now, so not as big of a deal as it was then.\n\nWe kinda just picked up where we left off in terms of friendship. Her and her husband traveled to see me out of state, she even came to my grandfathers funeral (she was actually the only one of my friends to even acknowledge it). \n\nTime changes people, age changes people, and regret changes people.\n\nThis is a very mature reaction and reminds me that I need to be more gracious to others. Thank you\n\nok well that explains it .forget it ..\n\nI would‚Äôve never spoke to them again\n\nwell thats weird.who paid for wedding\n\nI am so sorry! I get anxiety over friendship and distrust. \nThe easiest way is to cut contact if they refuse to reach out to you, you don't need them. I have done this with friends and family and it has made my mental health way better!\n\nIf it‚Äôs helpful for your own hurt over this ‚Äî weddings are a really tricky thing when it comes to who makes the list. It‚Äôs not necessarily indicative of the sincerity of the friendship but often is related to the high cost of each guest‚Äôs attendance. Like it does become a bit cutthroat in ways you don‚Äôt expect. Plus there could be extra ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù you‚Äôre not aware of. Like maybe the bride and groom have huge families so the budget only allowed for 10 friends each. \n\nBasically just offering a suggestion to take stock in other ways how that particular friendship has been over recent years. Are you still in regular contact? And if so, idk if i would write off the whole friend or think ‚Äúthey must actually not like me‚Äù (though i certainly get the urge to spiral over it/think of all the ways you have been left out by others).. But maybe give them the benefit of the doubt. I‚Äôd congratulate them on the wedding and ask to meet up for a celebratory hang sometime soon where maybe you could have an organic conversation where the reasoning for the lack of invite comes up casually. \n\nAnyway, hope that helps. I know it sucks realizing something you‚Äôve been left out for but it often isn‚Äôt a reflection of who you are or what kind of friend you are and way more likely to be about totally unrelated stuff!\n\nExactly this. Times are tough and weddings are expensive. Me and my husband eloped for that reason. A lot of family and friends were upset with us but we could not justify spending thousands on a wedding. OP please talk to your friend. Give them the benefit of the doubt. I wasn‚Äôt invited to a good friend‚Äôs wedding because it was family and long term friends only. It‚Äôs an average of $30-$100 to have a person invited to your wedding. It probably has nothing to do with you so please don‚Äôt think that.\n\nA lot of times it could be closer to $100-200 per person\n\nand more its out of control.tv and social media at work making all feel inadequate..rise above it..do the opposite\n\nyes¬†\n\nWhen is the last time you talked to your friend, before the wedding? Did it not come up in conversation that they were going to get married?\n\nBecause if it‚Äôs been years since you guys have talked, or if you guys aren‚Äôt in close enough contact that you knew they were planning a wedding, can you see why you weren‚Äôt invited?\n\nNow if you guys were still in close contact, I could understand the hurt feelings. \n\nBut if you guys had drifted apart, that doesn‚Äôt mean that your previous friendship wasn‚Äôt meaningful to that person. Sometimes friendships run their course for whatever reason.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry you were hurt by this :-(\n\nI knew two friends in college who went and got married and I wasn't a consideration at all. At first it bothered me but now it's whatever. You quickly see who's really a friend and ig the answer for me was...almost none of those people. I don't really have any sage advice. I just guard who I get invested in a lot better now. (I think)\n\nif you are a true Friend .you may understand its not personal..and move on\n\nI‚Äôm sorry, that really sucks. I had something very similar happen to me before and it gutted me. I used to feel really insecure in friendships jn general and often felt like a last choice as well. When I met my now husband he had such a wonderful group of friends who really accepted and included me. It was through them that I also learned to be a better friend. I realized that through some of my own trauma, I was often not always being my authentic self with people and didn‚Äôt actually genuinely let people in all that often (although I thought I was!). I also didn‚Äôt really make an effort to the level that I now realize is needed to maintain strong friendships. Overall, I have done a lot of my own work to maintain close friends but also I needed good people in my life to do that. I hope this comment helps a little to not feel like total trash. Like I said, I‚Äôve been there before! My best advice (and what I‚Äôve done myself) is to maybe do a little therapy to process what happened and try to work toward building some more solid connections.\n\nI announced my wedding engagement to my friend of 15 years and she left me on read. Like, completely ignored it.\n\nShe‚Äôs not invited.\n\nCount yourself lucky! Weddings can be such a pain! Too many people- annoying small talk- mediocre food- the same songs on the dance floor‚Äîhow many times can you hear Mr brightside?\n\nWhat was your relationship with this person now? I‚Äôm not sure how long you are out of college, but if you haven‚Äôt had much contact with them more recently that might be why. Weddings are expensive so they might have limited the number of people to invite\n\nI'm sorry :( I feel like I could have written the same a few years ago after I graduated high school. (Always chosen last, sat at the end etc. And these \"friends\" never contacted me again when we left.) Over the years, I would randomly think of my old friends and break down in tears and anger. I was miserable, bitter, developed social anxiety, and felt worthless.\n\nEventually, I climbed out of that pit (with a bit of help from family) and embraced the truth that my worth isn't determined to how other flawed humans view or treat me. This helped me let the bitterness go so I could heal and move forward... But it took me atleast 3+ years.\n\nOne good thing has came from it: it has opened my eyes to others. When I see someone struggling in a social situation, i remember how I felt and I make it my goal to help that person feel seen. \n\nI want to encourage you that today I feel like Im a different person  - i am confident. I don't really think about myself and how people may view me. Instead I try to make whoever I'm speaking with comfortable and feeling valuable. Also in the last few years I have made some true friends, which I never thought would happen.\n\nI can relate. Was best friends with this girl for 10 years, like 13-23. Hung out and talked all the time. Cried together, laughed together, sang together, you get it. I always put in more effort to the friendship which should have been a red flag but I am an empath. She gets engaged to her boyfriend and asks me to be a bridesmaid. Obviously I say yes, super stoked. We go through the whole thing, shopping for a bridesmaid dress and I bought one etc and helped her shop for wedding decor etc etc. Well, their wedding was scheduled for 2020 but covid happened, so they decided to postpone the wedding as they were having some family drama and stuff too. I was like makes sense, let me know when everything is back on! A few months later we‚Äôre chatting and she refers to her fianc√© as her husband. I said hold on, husband?! Y‚ÄôALL THEY GOT MARRIED AND DIDN‚ÄôT EVEN TELL ME, LET ALONE INVITE ME. They decided to do a backyard wedding and had ‚Äúclose friends and family‚Äù only. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúclose friends and family?!‚Äù She took me on vacation to her family‚Äôs coveted cabin home in the middle of bumfuck PA she made a big deal out of because it was so personal and so special and she hasn‚Äôt taken anybody else out there with them. ?! Tf?! I never responded since. 10+ yr friendship down the drain just like that. Really made me realize she only ever kept me around because I made my own money (which she didn‚Äôt,) drove my own car (which she didn‚Äôt,) and could fill out a spot in her bridal party. Once there was no longer going to be a bridal party, I was no longer needed. Ouch.\n\nSending love and good vibes, love your self!!üíïüíï\n\nThank you so much\n\nHad the same thing happen to me.\n\nThe only difference is we're a group of 6. \n\n3 got invited, 3 were not. I was in the latter.\n\nI was extremely hurt. Cried even. Decided that day never to go above &amp; beyond for friendships, or any other kind of relationship. \n\nPeople will always disappoint.\n\nIn college, I went out with a friend to a bar and spent the evening playing wingman for her with this guy she found attractive. It took all night before they talked. They ended up getting together. I was super excited for her and hyped them up. They were great together! I didn‚Äôt get invited to the wedding. Despite the fact I was the only reason they were together. Hurts, man. She and I had been friends since high school.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôre hurting. I‚Äôve been there and it sucks. I‚Äôm praying for you, if it helps. You don‚Äôt deserve to feel this way\n\nPeople are weird. My childhood friend, after 30 years of ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù (6-36), decided to plan our high school reunion by my back, without telling me anything or inviting me. I did drop her on the spot. Who needs someone like this in their life? No one¬†\n\nOk, don‚Äôt know how old you are or how long it‚Äôs been since you left college. Or how much work you‚Äôve put into the friendship since then.\n\nBut here is some general life advice‚Ä¶weddings are about the person getting married, not you. You don‚Äôt know how much money they had, whether they wanted a small wedding etc. \n\nOn a wider picture I have strict rules about weddings on the same premise. Go where you‚Äôre told, when you‚Äôre told. Eat what you‚Äôre told to eat, seat where you‚Äôre told to sit. Shut up, smile, dance, talk. \n\nBecause it‚Äôs not about you.\n\noh man that sucks and I know that bitter pain and feeling in the pit of my stomach all too well sending hugs!\n\nWedding planning is tough‚Ä¶ and one of the hardest aspects can be trimming down a guest list for budgeting..  have you maintained a close relationship post-college?  The post seems to indicate the relationship was more so in the past ‚Äúgood friend from college‚Äù ‚Ä¶. Perhaps those other friends have kept in closer touch?  I truly doubt anything is personal‚Ä¶ but whatever the reason‚Ä¶ No wedding outfit, travel, weekend plans, or expensive present?  Not a bad trade off!  If you care about this person, the best thing you can do is be supportive of their decision.  Wedding planning is hard enough without anyone making you feel guilty or causing drama amongst the friend‚Äôs group.  Kudos to clapping your hands and moving along quietly ‚Ä¶. Perhaps a little weekend getaway is in order for yourself that weekend!\n\nTry not to take it to heart. People can sometimes misinterpret how close they are to somebody. Or maybe there are other reasons for not inviting you? While it may sting, you have a far clearer idea of how this person sees you now and can act accordingly.\n\nWeddings are really expensive, and this person may have many people in their life who they are close to; I wouldn't take it personally.\n\nThat friend has no manners ,why are you blaming yourself now ?\n\nThat sucks ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not alone . I would ask them about it directly\n\nDamn. That really is messed up. I have nothing to add except that I'm sorry this happened to u.\n\nAll of the drama around weddings has always escaped me. But I understand being publicly shunned or let down by a friend. Someone I considered one of my best friends didn't acknowledge the birth of my daughter and it really hurt me. It was a couple really, although I had been friends with the guy for much longer and thought we were close. We had a co-ed baby shower and they didn't come or send a gift or even contact me afterwards. 4 months after her birth I texted him and he acted like it wasn't a big deal. His wife texted me out of the blue right then and they tried to invite themselves over to see our baby instead of just acknowledging they had been shitty friends. That was 5 years ago. Haven't seen or spoken to them since¬†\n\nThis is what is considered anxiety now? Sheesh. You are lucky you aren't me then"

    "all_comment_text": "Today i saw a reel talking about this and apparently is called \"sense of a foreshortened future\" and is a response of trauma. I was surprised cause i have been feeling like this for soooo long and the more i get old the worst it gets, i get depressed when someone is making plans cause i think I'm not gonna make it, and i feel sooooo sad. So i really get how you feel but we're not alone.\n\nI feel the same. I'm so afraid of dying and Everytime I have pain I think it's cancer and soon I'll be dead. I wanna live until I'm old. I wanna become 100 years old and just be happy. But I always think okay next year it's over and I'm really depressed since I think I can't get children until then and marry. I'm so anxious about death and illness..\nAnd this year they found a fibroadenoma in my breast and since then.. even after a biopsy where they said everything is okay and nothing to worry about, I think I'm the rare case and it'll be cancer or already is and I'm lost now and so on.\nNeck pain in the front I think it's a tumor and no one can find it because u saw nothing without a MRI but I don't get one. And .. so on üò™ I wanna have a full body MRI to be safe but nooo they say it's not possible\n\nLmao i'm the same, especially after losing my father. I thought I was crazy.\n\nNo I lost a friend around 10 years ago. She had cancer and since then I'm crazy and hypochondriac af. I really think that I'm dying and no one can find it. It's so horrible everyday the same fear and panic ...\n\nSo sorry for your loss. I also have an aunt who got breast cancer a decade ago. She is fine today. Just to tell you that cancer isn't always deadly.\n\nYea i know. Well I had a biopsy and they said it's just a fibroadenoma and nothing bad but I read that it can turn bad in rare cases and I always think I'm the rare case. I also have swallowing problems and pain bear my thyroid in the neck and what do I think? For sure a tumor. But I also have a neck problem and stiff muscles and .. I'm stiff in general and have back pain and everything but yeah I always think it's the worst\n\nStiffness in muscles is a typical reaction of anxiety. Dont worry friend, I've had these for years\n\nYes I know but idk how to get those away.. i think I'm gonna call a chiropractor/alternative practitioner tomorrow and pay for that he'll help me with everything cuz idk what to do anymore with the pain and fear\n\nYou should ask your doctor to refer you for a neck / thyroid ultrasound. Best case it helps with your anxiety, worst case you find out what it is and can make a plan.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDid they do a biopsy?\n\nSame here since 2022 after losing my dad, now I take care of my aging motther, it hurts\n\nIt triggers the anxiety. I'm fearing I have a brain tumor or early onset Alzheimer's because I have some memory issues I never had before (or never noticed before). I also have to take care of my aunt with Alzheimer's and she is in total denial, so her anxiety really hits home with me.\n\nI have debilitating health anxiety as well. You are not alone, it‚Äôs very real. I‚Äôve had it since I was in 2nd grade‚Ä¶\n\nThis is me also. Dad passed at 60 from cancer. I'm now 45. Every new pain has me spiraling, thinking the worst. Mostly connected to the gut region. It's so very tiring..\n\nImo it sounds like you may have an anxiety disorder. I used to often feel nausea and tense all the time. I thought something was seriously wrong. I got lab work done and was assured everything checked out good. Almost always when someone has an anxiety disorder, they also have symptoms of depression. Nothing to be ashamed of. Made sense for me as I was diagnosed with depression as a child. I can‚Äôt believe anxiety was never mentioned.¬†\n\nIdk what to do about that\n\nI‚Äôm gonna bring this to my therapist, I relate to what you described, glad to know that I‚Äôm not alone :)\n\nYup i wanna build my family a house but i feel like i dont want to leave them in that debt cause im not going to live long.\n\nThis is an old thread but what you said, talking about the term ‚Äúsense of a foreshortened future‚Äù is such a game changer for me.  Re contextualizing things.  Thank you so much\n\nsince i was little, i thought id develop a disease and die in a hospital bed before turning 40.  my mom thinks its ridiculous but its such an overwhelming paranoia i haven‚Äôt been able to get rid of it.\n\nI used to think that I would die at 33, and thought my parents knew about some illness I had but never told me.\nI am 47 and still around.\n\nI am currently 41 and have thought this way for over 20 years. I still think I'm not going to make 60 and, I'm not sure about the rest of you but I was raised Catholic and I find myself making deals with God or whoever's in charge to give me more time. The logical part of my brain wants to give you some advice and say the time is going to pass between your current age and 40 all the same regardless of if you worry about it but the anxiety part of my brain completely understands the feeling that you have. All you can do is be a good person and help out anyone who feels the same way even just by validating it. There's a power in knowing that you're amongst a group of people feeling this way and not just by yourself.\n\nGreat! Same here!\n\nI had a feeling I was going to die before I hit 25. Approaching my 25th birthday was very scary but IM NOW 25 and still alive! My husband and I had a special birthday party for me to celebrate not dying. It was a huge turning point in my relationship with my anxiety. \n\nThese feelings aren‚Äôt premonitions, they are intrusive anxious thoughts. You are fine, I promise.\n\nEvery day in my life. My grandma is 84. And every time I freak out, I remind myself that I have another 50 years left. But some days it just doesn‚Äôt feel like that. Especially when I start to spiral. Which is often.\n\nVery much so. I thought it was normal but recently found out that it‚Äôs a trauma response. \n\nWhen I try to envision my future, it just kinda cuts off at a point, and I feel like ¬´I‚Äôll probably not make it that far¬ª without a good reason for it. It‚Äôs been this way since I was a child. I just see my future as being cut off at an arbitrary point.\n\nIt really sucks because I‚Äôm not able to generate motivation from future accomplishments because I simply can‚Äôt envision them. Combined with ADHD and a dopamine deficiency due to that, I hardly ever feel like I‚Äôm reaching my full potential.\n\nI don‚Äôt feel like the bad things and consequences from my actions in the present will amount to anything, but also I don‚Äôt feel like the good things will happen. So I‚Äôm just stuck in a state of paralysis where I have to be hard focused on logic instead of my emotions because the latter is simply not leading me anywhere good.\n\nEvery single day, it‚Äôs actually my biggest fear. And I know my older sister feels the same way. I‚Äôm 30 and she‚Äôs 40.\n\nI have prepared a bucket list and I wrote a list of things I want to achieve by 2030 (I‚Äôll be 36 then) as a way to tell my mind that I‚Äôm not gonna die soon, but even then my anxiety comes back and tells me I‚Äôm not making it. \n\nI hate this feeling.\n\nFor you to create that bucket list is something your anxiety is pushing you to do so in a way I think it is benefits to you.\n\nI think so too. It‚Äôs mostly driven by the anxiety, but I hope it helps in the end.\n\n[removed]\n\nI have that feeling too ;(\n\nI worry that I‚Äôll die, my heart used to race alllllll the time getting up while I was sitting (i‚Äôm on metoprolol now and the occurrences have lessened) but i used to and still sometimes worry my heart would race and mess up beating and I‚Äôd just drop dead. I worry that every pain I feel in or around my chest is a sign of something being wrong with my heart and I‚Äôm going to drop dead before they figure out what‚Äôs wrong. This used to immobilize me and I would literally just cry for days. I didn‚Äôt think I was going to make it to my nieces birthday party that was a month ago but I‚Äôm still here so far. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Try to live in the moment because any of us could actually die tomorrow realistically. Maybe not from a health issue but, I don‚Äôt know, an airplane can crash into your house. Is it logical? Not at all. But could it happen? There‚Äôs probably less than 1% chance of it happening. Is there logic behind you thinking you‚Äôll die in the next couple years? I can‚Äôt answer that for you because I don‚Äôt know you at all. Could it happen? Probably less than 1% chance. Is it logical that I think something is seriously wrong with my heart at 21 years old? No. Is there a chance there is? Probably less than 1%. Does it still send me spiraling sometimes when I get a chest pain? Yes, but I know my thoughts aren‚Äôt logical. There‚Äôs no reason for my heart to mess up and I drop dead. There‚Äôs no reason for me to just drop dead unless the Lord just decides to call me home. It‚Äôs hard to live in the present, but enjoy what life you have because it ultimately is all just temporary. Would you rather be 80 years old with great stories to tell to your grandkids or would you rather regret your life and tell your kids ‚ÄúWhen I was your age all I did was sit around and worry I was going to die at 27‚Äù Go live. There‚Äôs so many things you can experience. It‚Äôs hard, I know but go for it. Later you won‚Äôt regret it, I promise.\n\nYes, and I think that what is scary in itself is not dying but dying while being afraid and in pain.\n\nSince i was a kid as far back as i can remember I‚Äôve thought this.\n\nPeople ask me stuff about \"how did you not plan for the future\" when they see my bad decisions. The truth is I thought I was gonna die/ kill myself before I even turn 18. I am 20 now, and that feeling hasn't gone away, it's just I think I'll die before 30\n\nYeah same I feel like I‚Äôm at the beginning of the end times and that my days are very much numbered now. Just have a sense that I‚Äôm not meant to be here for as long as I‚Äôd like and whilst it has always felt sort of inevitable, it terrifies me because I haven‚Äôt fucking done anything yet. I‚Äôve barely lived and I don‚Äôt even know how to change that\n\nI feel this exact same way.. how old are you though, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking.\n\nI‚Äôm 25! What about you?\n\nI just turned 30‚Ä¶ damn, wait, it‚Äôs been half a year since I‚Äôve turned 30 already‚Ä¶ where does the time go?!\n\nNot early enough.\n\nI always believe I will die when I‚Äôm 26. It was a very strong belief ever since I was 13. \nI‚Äôm 30 yo rn, life hits you like a truck when you think you gonna die early and not planning your future because of it. \nUnless you have some serious health issues, I think you will be fine. \nStart making good decisions and don‚Äôt worry about anything else. \nLive your life, have fun and make sure you grow as you go!\nGood luck!\n\nWhy do you think\n\nLost hope in life.\n\nI feel stuck, like I can‚Äôt change my life, and don‚Äôt have the will to do it.\n\nMy energy is so low, that I can't even make myself out of bed sometimes.\n\nAbsolutely, I‚Äôm 16 and am not convinced I‚Äôll live to be 20. I have health anxiety, so that makes it worse, but even before that, I always had trouble imagining myself in like my 30s and 40s, it just seemed unrealistic.¬†\n\nHang in there champ &lt;3 you‚Äôll get there sooner than you think.\n\nThank you ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nLol we‚Äôre close in age &amp; I feel the same. I saw you‚Äôre ftm also and I think (for me anyway) it makes it hard to imagine myself old because I don‚Äôt know any older trans people, and since I‚Äôm pre-t I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôll look like as an adult man if that makes sense.\n\nYeah that does totally make sense. I also don't know any older trans people, so that definitely could be part of my issue\n\n26 year-old transmasc person here, 2 years on T. When I was 16, I had no idea what I‚Äôd look like in 10 years- there‚Äôs still time. I was 18 when I came out to myself; there is a future where you‚Äôll be celebrated as you are, I promise. You are enough! ü´∂\n\nThank you so much, this makes me feel a lot better about things. I‚Äôve been struggling lately, and I‚Äôm not really out to anyone. I‚Äôve just recently fully come to terms with the fact that I‚Äôm trans, so it‚Äôs been a major struggle. I‚Äôve felt really ‚Äústuck‚Äù the past year or so, in deciding what to do, and I had kinda told myself I‚Äôd just stay how I was for the rest of my life. Your comment makes me feel a bit better though, thank you\n\nSafety is the utmost priority, especially given the current climate towards trans folx. Listen to your intuition and know that you‚Äôre not alone, especially when first coming out to yourself!\n\nThank you ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI thought I was going to die young but now I'm 31 and there is no end in sight.\n\nGosh I hope I do\n\nI feel like every day is the last day on earth most days. Always uncomfortable. I stopped keeping track of all my trauma because it's all relative to the person. One thing I find traumatic someone else might not find that big of a deal. When I was heavy into drugs and alcohol I've almost died a couple times among other things (not intentionally but still self inflicted)  it's happened enough though that I know the feeling of a near death experience. I think I was pretty  scared after the first time,  but after that, the people who were traumatized were the ones around me every time I've almost accidently died. I probably fucked my brain up as now I never feel comfortable sober even if I'm clean for a whole year. No one understands where I come from except other people who have lived thru it\n\nIm also 24 and I feel this way\n\nYes, but I have no idea why I think this\n\nYes. I've lost a lot of friends pretty young from various different things. Starting in my late 20s and early 30s, I'd lost a few good people that I knew well, and it's been downhill since. Top that off with a visit to the med express where it was close to closing time, and they told me that I was having a heart attack. Instant health anxiety. My dad passed before his 40th, which he always said he would so starting at 38 I thought for sure I was going you beat him to it and be gone well before 40. I stand here as having literally turned 42 and I'm still trying to understand this anxiet/panic stuff. It's a helluva journey. Keep your head up friend. Get to a doctor if you have a fear and learn to trust the tests.\n\nWe had breakfast for dinner last night and I ate a little too much bacon. Spent the evening thinking I clogged up my arteries and was going to die. \n\nSo, yes.\n\nSame, but it usually happens when something exciting in my life is coming up (a vacation, moving, new job, etc.) I feel like it‚Äôs too good to be true and I may not make it. Could contribute to why I‚Äôm so impulsive, I don‚Äôt plan things and wait because I feel like I won‚Äôt live that long.\n\nAll the time, a lot of it is because of the physical symptoms of anxiety too, this is an evil disease. My heart skips beats and that plays with my psyche a lot\n\nyes and its absolutely crippling. its like this anticipation feeling like you‚Äôre waiting for something to happen and its so distressing, especially when you can‚Äôt tell if its intuition or just anxious thoughts\n\nI hope I do. I won‚Äôt have enough money to retire.\n\nAfter losing both parents at a young age. Yes.\n\nYes, because I already have health conditions due to anxiety, I'm overweight because of years of extreme stress and anxiety\n\nMe every day.\n\nYes because I'm 31 years old and had a heart transplant at 24 years old and continue to have issues I'm currently dealing with aorta issues I have a tear in it just had 2 surgery's in 1 week and I think to Mt self everyday when my last day will be because I just don't see myself living long with what I have going on unfortunately and I'm terrified I don't want to die this young I want to grow old I enjoy living even though I've been in a very shitty situation for a while I enjoy living\n\nI feel like I have issues of seeing myself growing older but then I start seeing signs and wrinkles in places I've never had. Then again, I didn't think I'd make it this far.  Every time I wake up and move even a little I worry it's my last. When I fall asleep, I'm scared I won't wake up, and I won't feel, I won't know... I feel this wholeheartedly. I'm sorry you are feeling this way if this is the case ..\n\nyes and I have anxiety so it makes sense\n\nSounds like classic anxiety playing on a fear of dying. Just keep in mind that anxiety/fear is a liar. The more you keep resisting or trying to ignore the thoughts the more your brain will focus on it. Its just natural the best thing I might recommend is getting a counselor who can talk with you and figure out why you are so afraid of death. If its not just another fear entirely. \n\nWith you being 24 you have a lot of life left. Though around this age is where you come to the realization that you will one day die. Has someone you know or loved passed within the past couple years?\n\nYes, I lost two close relatives to cancer.\n\nAbout the counselor, I have an appoitment in a couple of days to discuss about this issue.\n\nYeah that can be traumatic/hard especially if you were with them through it. Just keep in mind that your relatives wouldnt want you to live in fear. With getting an appointment with a counselor your heading in the right direction. Just be easy on yourself...you got this!!\n\nI have that feeling but it‚Äôs not related to illnesses or anything like that. Since I was a kid I always knew I was going to die young. I‚Äôm 24 and still here. Is not that I don‚Äôt picture my future. I actually do. But I just have the feeling, as if I were sure.\n\nI used to go to bed thinking I wouldn't wake up. I've had lots of traumatic events happen in my life. The one thing I try to remember is that if I really feel like I won't last long I would rather spend it the best way possible rather than wish i would be alive longer because most-if not all the thinking won't affect the outcome.¬†\n\nA little late. When I was 15 i thought i'd die when I was 20. And I also lived like I would. When I was 20 I thought it'd die around 25 or 30. I'm 32 now, still got same feeling that I'll die soon, but started to realize that I shouldn't live like I'm about to die, because time has shown me again and again that there's a big chance I at least have the years I've spent alive left before I die.\n\nyeah, it‚Äôs just anxiety! glad to hear that you‚Äôre doing better now üòä\n\nYes I‚Äôm 25 and feel this way.\n\nYeah i mean tbh I don‚Äôt know how much longer I have left lol. I don‚Äôt know if I care anymore either.\n\nIf it weren't for my wife, whom I adore, I would already be dead. But, I admit, I do still think and at times hope death comes sooner rather than later.\n\nIf I had benzos and opiods to improve the quality of life, I most likely would not feel this way. I know it can be worse, but it can also be better.\n\nYes i am the same and 24 too! It started from when i was a kid , sometimes forgot about it and coming back until 4 years ago when it hint me hard and i had such bad anxiety from it, no energy feeling internal tremors like earthquakes, no attention spam just so bad! But finally started to have a hope , a dream maybe? But i know its gonna be better and no matter what i had a lot of fun in this life and i will laugh and enjoy it until i cant do it ü•πüòÇüëè\n\nI have this feeling too, but it's not unpleasant nor makes me sad in any way. I just have a feeling that tells me that I'll die in my late 40s and I have accepted it. \n\nIt's weird, but it kinda gives me peace.\n\nyup. im pretty young (14) and i always have this feeling i wont make it past 20\n\nYes it normal when we have anxiety .Sooner or later it goes away as life gets better\n\nI had the same hope but time passed so quickly and now I‚Äôm 30, and the anxiety has only gotten worse. I look back at pictures of when I was younger and barely recognize myself.. the spark in me has all but faded, all that‚Äôs left is sad and jaded.\n\noutliving everyone I know is far more scarier for me\n\nChronic stress can lead to a lot. I'm without a doubt going to die early or succumb to my own bullshit. Everyone has a limit.\n\nI‚Äôve had this for a good 10 years now. I am 32. I did the research and found if you‚Äôve made it to your 20s, the chances of some insane cardiac event or stoke are insanely low until you hit 40, then your chances slowly increase. Even with the increased chances of a quick or sudden death after 40+, a sudden death is still relatively low. So what I tell myself, ‚Äúyou wish you are lucky enough to die suddenly, but you are not special. You are going to die a slow painful death like everyone else.‚Äù A little Prozac and a lotta dark humor keeps me going.\n\nToo late \n\nI‚Äôm in my upper 60‚Äôs\n\nI sometimes feel like the way I grew up with my anxiety constantly left my body In a state where no matter where I went I felt like I was lost. I‚Äôd think to myself how can I keep going if I can‚Äôt even manage being in public. Over time it got better. I find the longer I keep this anxiety in myself I can‚Äôt find what I need to do to get through the day. They really aren‚Äôt kidding when they say talking about your mental health can help Increase your life again. Now Is it easy to talk about it. No. But I find that I believe my life is worth living longer if I let people into it.\n\nI‚Äôm about to be 18 and I feel the same. I think it‚Äôs because I finally have a good future &amp; plans ahead of me, and my brain wants to sabotage it.\n\nIm basically 100% convinced I won‚Äôt live past 30. Im 27 now. Been feeling like this for years.\n\nI‚Äôm like 99% sure\n\nEvery. Minute. Of every day. It's torture. But coming here to read that I'm not alone is saving me.\n\nNo, unfortunately; I hope that's not the case\n\nI think i have stomach cancer and kidney failer i have ibs-d pretty bad stomach issues some times im over it and just dont care anymore then my anxiety goes away and then bam comes back it sucks fuck anxiety if you ever need to someone to talk to message me if you want its rough sometimes.\n\nI actually thought I'd be dead by 25.\n\ndon't worry when you hit fourty you'll still worry you'll die soon.\n\nI have MDD and a while back I mentioned to my therapist that even if I do all the right things to better myself, I will still have the depression that ruins my life. I don‚Äôt think that I will live out a full lifespan, tbh. I don‚Äôt have any current intentions on doing anything to myself, but I deeply feel that my depression will lead to my demise, fo-sho.\n\nYup been thinking about this for a while now it feels like I ain't gonna get past 23\n\nHow you feel at 23 is not how you‚Äôll feel your whole life. Everyone over 30 will tell you that because it‚Äôs true. 20s are a shit age, lots of pressure on you at a time when type brain is still forming, you have no money and are still figuring out your adult identity\n\n1000%, I don‚Äôt have anxiety but I just saw this post pop up on my feed. I do have a bit of anxiety (such as my armpits always sweating) but I‚Äôm pretty social. But yeah, just not happy without a girlfriend (I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs my main reason or I‚Äôm just an unhappy person in general). \n\n\nDon‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll kill myself, but I definitely just wanna die by this point. I hope my mind can change for the better though, god bless everyone who is on here and I hope y‚Äôall‚Äôs issues go away.\n\nYes I'm convinced I have an undiagnosed heart condition. And a few vague test results back up my hypothesis but not enough for a cardio to take me seriously. Luckily I'm on CPAP at least\n\nI'm kinda praying for it at this point. I mean it's either die now or die later. And honestly I'll probably be like most people when I hit 60+, homeless, starving and watching the rich plunge the earth into hell.\n\nYep and I'm not afraid of it\n\nI'm almost 58 (in two months).  Everyone in my family have died around 67 to 69.  My parents are dead, one of my sister is already dead.  And my heart is showing signs of being near the end (I was at the ER two weeks ago because of a severe episode of arrhythmia).  I don't expect to reach retirement age (65).\n\nSo yeah, I do believe I'm going to leave this world soon.\n\nI used to. Now that I think about it, I want to...\n\nIm content with dying early, not on no depression shit by any means, my meds been working lately.  But like fine with dying, not fine with it hurting the whole time üòÇüòÇ  imagine, no bills, no taxes, not a care in the world, no anxiety , just poof nothing to worry about\n\nI'm 24 as well and I have lots of health problems so yeah. I feel like I'll die in a few years but hopefully not \n\nI try not to worry but it can be hard sometimes\n\nI thought I was going to die before I turned 18. Specifically, I just KNEW I was going to be shot. I didn't grow up in the hood. I wasn't around guns. There was literally no reason for me to think this, but I have believed that since I was 6 years old. My doctor pointed out this was one of the reasons she was confident I have anxiety üòÖüòÖ I had no idea other people weren't thinking of death at childhood. \n\nAnyway, I'm 46 now and around 22 is when I finally started realizing hey... I might actually LIVE? And then I started doing things differently. Actually thinking about the future... Which I really hadn't paid attention to until that point.\n\nI did when I was drinking near daily to self medicate my anxiety.  I quit drinking, and stopped taking most prescribed drugs including SSRIs, benzos, ADHD meds etc, and only use Gabapentin; my outlook on life never looked better!  Also hearing about any of the potential long term damage caused by drinking if stopped by age 35 will heal back to normal in some time helped alleviate my fears.  If you are drinking/smoking after 35 that's when you see lasting damage to the organs, and the increase in heart related diseases.  \nThis obviously doesn't apply if you had permanent damage already to the liver like cirrhosis\n\nI feel your pain.  I would urge you to look into the Dare method for health anxiety.  Changed my whole perspective.\n\nI just don‚Äôt want to live past 35 honestly. 3 years left to go\n\nall the time\n\nMy hope\n\nmy mom does\n\nBut to be fair, her mom, grandma and two brothers died early\n\nI‚Äôve had this feeling all throughout high school. I‚Äôm in my senior year now and it‚Äôs as prevalent as ever\n\nAlways ü•∫ü•∫\n\nyeah, I kinda accepted it though honestly. i know the way i am living isn't healthy but i lack the motivation to change anything about it.\n\nYes. I cant see myself living past 50. So i still have to go trough this shit for the next 15 years\n\nI thought I‚Äôd die before 30, (car crash to be exact) since I can remember (maybe 10 or 11) I am diagnosed OCD so that is probably why. but when 30 actually came, it changed my whole life. I had not previously thought of my life in terms of after. Now, I live and plan differently. I thought I was the only person to experience this.\n\nYes. I just feel like I will, either from cancer or a heart attack. I‚Äôm up at 2 a.m. because I have pain at the centre of my chest that I‚Äôve never had before. Maybe it‚Äôs heart burn or maybe it‚Äôs my impending doom.\n\nI mean with how things are going im expecting to die fighting for food\n\nThis thought just flashes my mind from time to time and I don't know how to get rid of it...\n\nI think i can die unexpectedly any day. Most likely car crash or getting stabbed or some stroke.\n\nBut if we consider my lifestyle ans decisions, i think diabetes or other diseases will kill me when i get close to 50 unfortunately. \n\nAns yes dying at 50 is too early. \n\nI consider living tk 70 pretty good lifespan, whatever is over 70 its a bonus. \n\nAns yes i hate this life. I mean i hate the fact that we expire so easy.\n\nI am already 28.5..... time flies so fast and i need to work so much just to stay afloat. Not fair. I need to find a way to work  just 9-5 instead of monday to sunday.....\n\nYes my life is comfortable,  i can eat whatever,  travel, get tech but to do this i need to work like this....\n\nRemember that even though anxiety can be bad for your body, your body heals itself. This is through sleep and food!\n\nI‚Äôm probably gonna have a heart attack with all this stress and anxiety\n\nUss bro usss\n\ni mean panicking gets my heart rate in the 200s, i‚Äôm exhausting myself\n\nyess! I have this gut feeling that I‚Äôm going to die pretty young and ideally I think it‚Äôs gonna have something to do with my neck either breaking or being sliced‚Ä¶can‚Äôt shake the feeling and at times my neck feels super vulnerable and i start thinking my time has come and something‚Äôs gonna come out and kill me whether that be a car or a person\n\nFelt this way most of my life. Even pre-paid for my entire cremation and scattering of my ashes. Never thought I‚Äôd see 25 but here I am pushing along in my mid 40‚Äôs\n\nI am so relieved to know I‚Äôm not alone in these thoughts that literally have plagued me every day after losing my mom to a seizure in 2020. It‚Äôs only becoming increasingly worse as I watch my dog and cat quickly approach 12 years of age.. the other day I discovered a manager of mine at work, mid thirties, fell ill to a case of bronchitis.. gone, just like that. No prior health issues‚Ä¶ Death can be so sudden, so easy.. how can it be so easy to end all that we are?\n\nIf only... \nI do have a fear of dying in the shower though strangely enough lol\n\nI know the time and date\n\nI did when I was a teenager. I couldn't imagine living past 20. I'm 35 now so all is good but now I figure I'll die early. I don't see myself lasting to 70 like other people.. Don't know why.. Mostly because I avoid doctors so I basically have accepted I probably have cancer and won't know until it's too late.\n\nThere's also the fact that I am one of 5 kids and 2 of my siblings have already died. My only brother, the youngest, died at 22 when I was 24. My sister died at 42 last year. There's only 3 of us left. It scares me\n\nI feel like im not gonna live to see 18, no first drink, no partying with friends, no marriage no nothing and that's scary af\n\nJust about everyday. There's a lot of reasons to live, but at other times a lot of reasons to live....\n\nYes. Every night I think I‚Äôm not gonna make it to the morning. During the day I sometimes get a strange feeling that I‚Äôm gonna die in the next few years, so why bother with kids you know? I also think, that with my luck, I‚Äôm probably going to die in childbirth. All these thoughts scares me so much. It kinda hinders me from doing anything.\n\nMy parents died young when I was a kid (I‚Äôm also 24) and weirdly I feel the same way. To the point of not planning a future just in case? Like it‚Äôs kinda nice to know it‚Äôs not just me if that makes sense.\n\nMaybe but, honestly, my main fears are just getting old and feeling like I'm not happy with the life I've led, or have never been able to overcome traumatic experiences.\n\nYES. Just moved to another state with no job in mind or money and now my brain keeps telling me im gonna die because im dumb :‚Äô(\n\nAs fucked up as it sounds I don‚Äôt mind dying early while I‚Äôm still considered young I don‚Äôt plan on playing this game called life for decades having to repeatedly do the same thing over and over daily\n\nI used to think there was no way I would make it past 40‚Ä¶ Now I‚Äôm 58.\n\nI have had this idea for the last two years that I will die in February/March/april 2025. The closer I get to that date, the more I feel like it's gonna happen, with what seems like mounting physical and mental issues.\n\nHad no idea this had a name. I‚Äôve capped my life expectancy at 25, I really can‚Äôt see myself living past 40.\n\nSame here! I don't see myself making it to 26. I joke about it often, and I'm surprised I've even made it to 24. I've felt this way for as long as I can remember, but it's also made me live every day like it's my last so that's nice.\n\nPsychologically I know it's a trauma response, but realistically... I am chronically sick, COVID fucked over my immune system and left me more vulnerable and with an autoimmune disorder, I am under the poverty line, I cannot find a job and mine is not renewing my contract. I am severely depressed, but no therapist has any slot for me and I can't afford private or online therapy (see above info of my being under poverty line, we currently have anxiety at home because our landlord died and we cannot afford any other place at all in the entire region - even social housing is too expensive, we looked it up). I am a minority in a country that os slowly growing more hostile to people like me, and I have really bad luck in general... yeah I'm not gonna last long.\n\nAn early death, but the particular hang-up is the pain that it would give my family and friends. I have had countless emotional meltdowns over the last couple of months, imagining what their lives would be like after I was gone, what adjustments they would need to consciously make to accommodate my absence.\n\nI'm supposed to go to a primary today to get looked at. I have three bumps on my head, one bigger than the others. I suspect osteosarcoma, but fingers crossed that it's benign/harmless.\n\ni've been crying all day over this very thing. big health anxiety here, suspected diverticulitis and scared it might be something more serious. thinking of going to the er. hope you get an answer for your issues and it's a good one.\n\nI showed him each bump, he instantly concluded that they are cysts. I'm supposed to do some routine upkeep for our next appointment, but that's pretty much it.\n\nI'm not totally convinced, but I feel like a weight has been lifted off of me and that's miles better than how I was feeling before.\n\nI always assumed I‚Äôd be dead by 40. I‚Äôm 39 now, so I‚Äôve got some living to do.\n\nNope I'm gonna live a long miserable life thanks anxiety\n\nIt‚Äôs more of a comfort thing for me. I‚Äôm not a fan of life so I‚Äôm honestly just hoping to make it as short and sweet as possible\n\nI‚Äôm also 24 and feel the exact same way.\n\nIt‚Äôs actually been really comforting seeing this post and how many responses there are of people who‚Äôve felt similar because I‚Äôve had this weird feeling since I was *young,* and I‚Äôve never known anyone who felt similar.\n\nI‚Äôd say by age 7-8 I had come to the conclusion that I wouldn‚Äôt live beyond 26-29 or so.\n\nYup! I know I‚Äôm going to die before 50 from a heart attack, a freak accident, or something related to transportation. I just absolutely know it. This morning a truck almost hit me while I was crossing too.\n\nAll the time\n\nI don‚Äôt care when I die\n\nYes it is definitely due to excessive trauma. I have been in that thinking loop for some brief period. \n\nI couldn't see myself going above 30-35. My advice for you or anyone who is in the same place is, \n\nFix your problems one at a time. I know you will be overwhelmed and tired. Take some time, \n\nwrite your problems down and start to untangle yourself one thing at a time. \n\nIf you are living with some abusive people, move away. Get well soon.\n\nNot really, I‚Äôm late for everything\n\nI thought I was going to die imminently, ten years ago. Thankfully there‚Äôs ten years of evidence against that feeling of impending doom.\n\nIf these doctors don't figure out why I'm losing mobility and not blaming it on anxiety, yeah I don't think I'm making it to 40...\n\nOpposite. I‚Äôve been convinced since my Dad died when I was 7 that I‚Äôm going to die last and most lonely out of everyone I know.\n\nWorry whenever my heart beats faster before bed (I notice I get it when I‚Äôm tired and forgot I to take my other mental health medication) I think I‚Äôm slowly dying. Or even just randomly pains like one spot of my head hurting or my heart getting an ache. üò©it‚Äôs the worst\n\nI didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it past 27‚Ä¶ but then I turned 28, 29, and 30. My 31st birthday is in February. \n\nIt‚Äôs just the anxiety speaking. You‚Äôll be okay ü´∂üèª\n\neven if that is the case, thinking about it won't do no good. Im more afraid of not living and exploring enough in my short life than being dead.\n\nIt's not just a feeling it's almost like an assurance.\n\nHad a dream about me dying at 80 with Alzheimer‚Äôs (went looking for a doctor to euthanise me and died that way, I was happy when I looked back on my life, I‚Äôm not even 30 yet‚Ä¶) but yeah, i do worry I won‚Äôt make it till 30 sometimes\n\nIdk but at this point I wish I would\n\nmy mental issues already have a great impact on my health. i can‚Äôt imagine it not shortening my life span.\n\nyeah. I've held a belief somewhere in me for a long long time that I'll die in my 30s or 40s. it'll be quiet and there will be no family around me. \nrecently, I've realized I want to make it to 40 because I want to know what the age feels like. since it was the last age my dad got to. \nbut then I can go after that, I guess. \njust can't imagine growing old?\n\nI will. i have severe GI issues for my age and am on a line of psych medications they don't like for where i am on the statistical scale. it seems obvious to me. i don't think messing with drugs has helped either. i can feel it coming probably just a few years off. it's a really visceral sensation by now. i'm not sad about it anymore at least\n\nI‚Äôm surprised I made it to 32. I‚Äôm always thinking about early death\n\nYes, i‚Äôm 18 and have a very fragile physical and mental health. I don‚Äôt think i will live very long because maybe my mental health gets out of hand or maybe i get some sickness that kills me.\n\nYeah..but I have an addiction to poisoning myself basically so it‚Äôs a for sure thing I think lol :/\n\nYes, and I learned several months ago that it's¬†a very strong possibility that I will.¬†I was diagnosed with some serious conditions with my heart and a vascular connective tissue disorder that causes rupture of arteries and hollow organs.\nI nearly died from Torsades de Pointes in January, and I had a heart attack in August.¬†\nI have a heart monitor implanted with telemetry, but my conditions can kill me so quickly and suddenly that it doesn't really help me feel much safer. The only reason I survived in January was because I was already in the hospital when it happened.¬†\n\n\nAfter my diagnosis I really spiraled - I have always had generalized anxiety, and the addition of cardiac anxiety and my other health issues has been extremely difficult to cope with.¬†\n\n\nI'm in therapy trying to come to terms with all of this. I'm unable to have SSRIs to treat my baseline of high anxiety, bc of my heart condition, so I have to just cope with individual panic attacks with Ativan.¬†\nIt's been really hard.¬†\n\nAll the time, I catch myself thinking about it. For so long, I truly believed I wouldn‚Äôt even make it to 18, and now here I am. I‚Äôve reached that milestone, but those thoughts still linger in the back of my mind. That‚Äôs just how anxiety works‚Äîit creeps in, planting doubts and fears that feel so real, even when they aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs exhausting and frustrating, always battling with a part of yourself that makes you question everything, even your own future. Sometimes it feels like no matter how far you‚Äôve come, anxiety finds a way to overshadow the progress.\n\nAfter struggling with this for a year..atlast i was starting to get better. Then suddenly out of no where my friend got a clot in heart and died during open heart surgery. And then another of my friend only 26 yr old died from cardiac arrest after running. I am on the verge of having a nervous breakdown.\n\nI do, but I have chronic health issues and am poor with no support system so my fear is actually quite realistic.\n\nI used to feel like I was dying when I was young. It was all an irrational feeling just in my head. It‚Äôs the case with most people who have the same problem. It‚Äôs a symptom of depression and an anxiety disorder. It‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of as I find most people to be very understanding. I recommend talking to your Dr if it becomes enough of a bother to you. I never understood why I got this feeling. I was always healthy and had a decent youth. My advice otherwise would be to try not to think of it. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done but try to keep your mind occupied with other things.¬†\n\nI know what you're talking about, exactly. I often feel anxious and sad. My wedding is coming up soon and I often feel as though I will never get to unite and tie the knot with my fianc√©.¬†\n\nIm often afraid of having a stroke or a heart attack that would keep me from being able to marry him. Or, alternatively, something happens to my fianc√© where he‚Äôs the one getting hurt. It doesn‚Äôt help having psychosomatic symptoms like palpitations or headaches. ¬†Health anxiety is the worst and I wish it on nobody.\n\nEMDR sessions with my therapist help reduce anxiety but lingering intrusive thoughts are still there thanks to other disorders.¬†\n\nWhat helps me get through it most days is that I tell myself ‚ÄúI made it this far, Im sure I can keep going.‚Äù And sure, it‚Äôs short. I think I‚Äôll last another day, or perhaps another week or two. But slowly and surely it adds up. Before I know it, it‚Äôs already the end of the year and earlier I was convinced I wouldn‚Äôt see my brother‚Äôs birthday. And just last year I was convinced I wouldn‚Äôt see my fiance‚Äôs birthday.¬†\n\nIm sensitive to medication so its hard to find many solutions holistically, but I believe one day this will be just another thing in the far back of my mind.\n\nYoure not alone in this!\n\nMy father died in his 40's from cancer, which came on rather quickly, being discovered at stage 4. Since then, I've been relatively well-adjusted, but I've had the lingering assumption that I'll be dead before I'm 50 years old."

    "all_comment_text": "I mean, that‚Äôs pretty much what a good dose of Propanolol does for me!\n\nI‚Äôve been wanting to try beta blockers! Are they legit?\n\nYes they definitely are\n\nI recently started taking propranolol 10mg for anxiety, and it definitely makes me relaxed. My dr said I can take it up to twice a day, so I‚Äôve been taking it when I wake up and when I go to bed. I like that it helps me fall asleep without making me groggy in the morning, but it still doesn‚Äôt make me sleepy when I take it during the day. Just makes sleep come more easily when I lie down\n\nWeirdly, it makes it impossible for me to sleep.\nI have to make sure I take it no later than early afternoon.\n\nSame. My docs don't believe me though when I tell them it exacerbates my insomnia\n\nI like!!\n\nI use 10-20mg and it does help decrease heart beating, but I still have other symptoms of anxiety.\n\nSo it doesn‚Äôt/won‚Äôt help the nausea, feel like I am going to puke feeling I get overwhelming get with my anxiety?\n\nMaybe but Probably not. What youre describing sounds like psycho-somatic symptoms, where beta blockers just impact physical symptoms of anxiety ( for me at least)\n\nA loved one of mine takes mirtazapine for anxiety-related nausea and it has worked well for them.\n\nThank you! I will ask my doctor about it. When my anxiety is bad I can literally sometimes feel the bile rising in my throat.\n\nNot for me at least. Have you tried any generic nausea meds? Not sure if those could help but might be worth a try. Even if the effect is only placebo it could make your brain think the meds worked and lessen the nausea. \n\nAlso for me breathing deeply in and out seem to help a little bit. Only for a short time tho, so I have to do it continuously sometimes when I'm very nauseous.\n\nDepends on the person. Did absolutely nothing to me besides lower my already low blood pressure.\n\nI took propranolol just before having to give a eulogy at my best friend's funeral. \n\nIt is the ONLY time I've ever spoken to a crowd, in public, at a funeral. It was nothing short of miraculous that I was able to do it. I got so comfortable with it that I shared a funny story, everything off the cuff. \n\n2 days later, it looked like a doctor went mad and pumped my face and arms full of botox. I was allergic. If you get the opportunity to try it, go for it. AFAIK, propranolol is the only med I'm allergic to, just a rare instance. (I also tried to keep taking it for a while after, even knowing I was allergic, coating myself in calamine lotion, hoping I could make it work, but to no avail.)\n\nDef worth a shot.\n\nToo bad my resting heart rate is already pretty low (in the 50's in the evening and dips to 37 at night sometimes). So I doubt I am a good candidate for beta blockers. Sounds awesome though.\n\nStill worth maybe chatting to your doc about! I only take it if I feel my heart rate going due anxiety - it just stops it climbing in its tracks\n\nHow long does it work for? A few hours?\n\nYeah, exactly - I don‚Äôt take it every day, just when needed\n\nI‚Äôm on it everyday, and I still have days where I get palpitations and a higher heart rate but no where near how high it was daily. I‚Äôm also just starting it and getting out of the side effect stage\n\nRight. Well good that you found something which works for you.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah that's my problem. Low resting/sleeping HR. Was given a beta blocker before a cardiac CT and my HR went to about 35 and stayed there. It creeped me out.\n\nYeah I‚Äôm in that situation with the low resting HR, I was prescribed it and it helped for physical anxiety symptoms, it was weird having racing thoughts but my body not physically reacting to them‚Ä¶unfortunately it made me black out when I stood up so I had to stop taking it\n\nGod damn that‚Äôs insanely low. My resting HR is anywhere from 80-120 (Yeah, I‚Äôm a pretty anxious person)\n\nYea its pretty low. And i am not an athlete by any means. I do have a fairly thin build though, maybe that contributes. Cardiologist didnt bat an eye.\n\nI guess 55-60 is normal in rest. And sleep is always a bit lower than that. But dips to 37 is pretty low indeed. I guess under 30 is when they start to worry.\n\nEveryone is different in this regard.\n\nI was prescribed Propranolol but I‚Äôm too scared to take it. Scared it‚Äôs going to drop my blood pressure and mess with my body. I‚Äôm already body scanning all the time!\n\nI was scared of this too. Waited an entire month before I took it because my BP was always just slightly below perfect. Took it one day and I haven‚Äôt looked back. Take it all the time now.\n\nThe dosage rate has a large latitude so if you take a small dose it is unlikely to tank your BP or HR too low. I take the smallest dose and I like it.\n\n\\*Cries in 'it doesn't work for me!'\\*\n\nLol, I came here just to say beta blockers.\n\nI always take propanalol for anxiety but propanalol only helps the physical symptoms but not the mental torment of anxiety ....\n\nMore than 40mg?\n\nI was just about to comment this. 20mg of propranolol when I'm freaking the out makes a noticeable difference\n\nI almost lost my coffee to my laptop screen/‚Ä¶.or scream!   Omg. Lmao! Btw: beta blockers aren‚Äôt the answer for no release of adrenaline. Taking out the adrenals are. I‚Äôd wanna have a bit of adrenaline when I see a train coming and my stalled car won‚Äôt let me get off the tracks‚Ä¶.\n\nYes they're the answer.¬†\n\nWhen u have that adrenaline rush as if in your scenario of the train, but instead there's no train &amp; you're only talking to a human, it's weird to shake and sweat in front of them.¬†\n\nSo yes. They're the answer .. for this day and age, when u aren't constantly sitting in a stallen car while train is coming at you.\n\nJust saying the majority of the \"stonecold motherfuckas\" still would feel a lot beneath, they just have a good poker face.  \n\nTo feel is human.\n\nbeautifully said.\n\nOr they're a psychopath\n\nI‚Äôm slightly under reactive if I am not aware of how I should be ‚Äúreacting‚Äù. I‚Äôm also autistic lol. I use big expressions sometimes just to make those around me comfortable. I spent 9 years in the military where I learned very quickly if I‚Äôm too busy to show it, most don‚Äôt see my stress or anxiety. That‚Äôs from outside stimuli, I also don‚Äôt feel or process physical pain as I should. Internal is different. Emotional disregulation is palpable if you are in a room with me.\n\nI have autism too but people have said my feelings show on my face.I can't hide it. But sometimes people misunderstand me. Like if someone says something and I can't think of something to say in response people have said I look at them like they're an idiot. But actually Im feeling like an idiot because I don't know what Im supposed to say.\n\nI also get really upset about terrible things happening to people or animals. People have looked at me strangely and said why are you so upset over this? Or you obviously feel very strongly about this issue. When Im not particularly interested in that issue and I don't understand how anyone couldn't be upset after seeing that story. I feel a lot of empathy. Like bears or tigers locked in cages or plane crashes like MH370. Me and dad watched a doco about that plane disappearance and he wondered why I was so upset! Its terrible all those people are missing.\n\nYeah reading this I felt like you've described me.\n\nOn top of it all, when I have no response/no interest in a small talk, I'm asked \"why are you so quiet\" or \"are you shy?\"\n\nWhich both makes me upset &amp; I also feel like not switching my psychological mode ON &amp; explain them that my quietness means NOT interested.. etc.¬†\n¬†\nYet that is the topic I can talk on forever, like I do with family &amp; close friends, &amp; also my comments here on Reddit at the size of a mini-book, haha!\n\nAs for you feeling bad for hurt animals.. try telling your brain to \"not care for things you have no control over, especially things you haven't done\".\n\nSociopath?\n\nExactly. The difference is that they've learned to control their response to the adrenaline, and make use of the energy boost it provides.\n\nI came to realize that even just by watching gaming streamers play in an intense situation, say a horror game, where they seem talkative &amp; extroverted, yet, they'd say things like \"my heart will explode/ my palms are sweating\"\n\nWhile I do believe them, in my case, and the OP, and a few others, when our heart beats fast - even our voice shakes &amp; cracks &amp; we visually shake - so it's those symptoms that Propranolol fixes for us type of humans.\n¬†\nI wish my voice wouldn't shake in those social events, then I'd remain a poker face as well - but no, my visual shakiness betrays me.\n\nYou see the difference? It's why Propranolol was a miracle pills to me, while I remain mentally stressful, my HR is calm in stressful events &amp; I can FINALLY pretend a poker face.\n\nI think radical acceptance works. Meaning when worried about something, even the most terrible scenario, tell yourself it may happen and that it's totally fine. Like \"I might die doing this. So what?\"\n\nSounds good, doesn't work. For me at least. In theory it could work. But my subconsious mind doesn't accept that. I get stress hormones for the silliest things, even if I did those a million times before AND I mentally do not care about what is going to happen next. My body decides otherwise.\n\nFor me whenever I have a life threatening experience I usually am zen as fuck for a while afterwards. Because the threshold for stress has risen. Got lost in the mountains in a foreign country during a thunderstorm on a horse riding trip with fucking idiots and wow? Life was chill afterwards? Then it wore off and I was anxious again. But it sure works! I mean obviously don‚Äôt risk your life, but maybe try bungee jumping or something that feels halfway insane but actually is chill. Could work lmao\n\nI get what you are saying totally, like if you talk to the cashier or worker in a marketplace to ask where X product is, and u \"survive\" the social interaction?\n\nThen u feel like u can approach anyone and everyone and talk about anything.¬†\n\nThen the next day I agree with you, the positive feeling wore off and u feel kinda shy/sad/depressed that you're not excited for life anymore.\n\nI've came to realization that life is about doing that everyday: pushing yourself out of the comfort zone, the sad part is the momentum lasts till the moment you fall asleep - I'll repeat myself, but, when u wake up u again feel shy &amp; depressed.\n\nI guess solution is to mentally switch to Let's Chase Adrenaline and live in that high stressful yet successful life ever after, sounds like a fairytale, easier said than done.¬†\n\n...\nI even have explanations why it's easier said than done:\n1.\nIn a scenario you are afraid to ask the marketplace worker where X is &amp; you did ask anyway and surive that adrenaline rush turns into a positive feeling.¬†\n\n2.\nBut, sadly, in a scenario where you apply for a job, and during the interview you said something totally out of context... eh! Now the brain doesn't focus on the \"positive\" part that you 'did it and survived anyways!' But instead it focuses on \"how could you have said that and ashame yourself like that\"\n\nEven though awkward silence would have been just as weird.¬†\n\nA catch-22 situation, damned if you do &amp; damned if you don't say it.¬†\n\nMaaaybe, we must work on accepting the fact that we can be imperfect or EVEN TRICK OUR BRAIN INTO FOCUSING ON BEING IMPERFECT:\n\nLike set a daily goal to do 1 imperfect thing daily!?\n\nAs a result some days we'll be 100% perfect, while others we'll be 101% cringey &amp; weird = end goal being: to be careless about when latter happens.\n\nSomeone told me once to \"do it anxious\" and it actually changed my life. You want to be a stone cold mf badass but your adrenaline spikes and it feels uncomfortable? So what, do it anyway. You're doing the thing, who cares what's happening under the hood - so to speak.\n\nThis is what I told myself when I flew to Australia by myself last year. I was always frightened of doing the thing, and finally thought ‚Äúfuck it, do the thing and do it anxiously.‚Äù So I did üòÖ\n\nCongrats on achieving that!\n I did exactly the same and went to the US all on my own last year, very nearly didn‚Äôt go but I did it in the end full of anxiety and fear. I didn‚Äôt die! Nothing bad happened!\n\nNothing bad happened to me too! Still got to see a beautiful part of the world I‚Äôd never seen before. Go us!!\n\nIt's so empowering! Great job doing the thing! üòä\n\nThank you! You too üòÅ\n\nBest way to go about public speaking imo. If you‚Äôre going to do something you‚Äôve already committed to, the choice is yours\n\nTry The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, its working for me\n\nHave you had your thyroid levels checked?  Everything you are saying is a carbon copy of how I used to be. It's almost like I wrote your post myself.  I was overactive and was given carbimozole to slow it. Then I went on to have an underactive thyroid  , and now I am on propananol 40mg twice a day and 125mg of levothyroxine. I was exactly  like you. Still am sometimes. In constant alert , it's a simple blood test at the docs.  Just have it checked in case as it's a hell of a thing to live with.  Propananol is a great help even if your thyroid is ok.  Good luck üëç\n\nYou need more than just therapy at this point. Probably emdr and trauma counseling\n\nI hear you, and it's really hard to push through that. It's not easy to maintain your character in your own actions when you're feeling like that, but it is possible. You may not be able to control what your poor body is going through, but you can control how you choose to perceive it and react to it.\n\nSo ? Even if you get anxiety symptoms, like fast heart rate, hyperventilating, dizziness etc, you shouldn't freak out and should just continue with what you were doing. It's The only way to cure anxiety disorders, meds are only supportive therapy.\n\nIt does work, you just didn't do it, and I explain why in scientific terms. The amygdala part of your brain is what basically controls fear/anxiety/panic as emotions, this part of the brain is unable to be told how to work, if it gets input that it thinks is real it will cause panic, like for example a tiger. Problem is it literally can't tell if it's a tiger or a panic attack about health anxiety, or social anxiety, etc. HOWEVER, the thing it can tell is our response, so if we respond to the fear with avoidance and trying to do anything in order to not feel this way, this part of the brain 100% believes it's real, and thus intensifies the fear. \n\nI say this as someone who had panic attacks every single day, HOURS, not minutes, HOURS a day a few years ago, for several *months.* It was like nothing else, I felt like I was physically dying. Literally the only thing that worked was either being on benzos, or accepting that the fear is literally in my head, and can be indirectly controlled by my response. \n\nI had basically no more consistent panic attacks after 2 quite painful weeks, but that was it, after that I get panic attacks coming on like once every 2nd month, but I just ignore it and it literally goes away *in minutes.*\n\nYep this. Have to be okay with whatever you view as the worst possible outcome\n\nIt's not pretending not to care about any outcome. Like you still want the good outcome and don't want the worse one but you okay with either\n\nCould this, in theory, also be irrational and unsafe though realistically in some situations?\n\nYes I think absolutely. But it can be incredibly useful when used right. For example for health anxiety. Get checked once. If everything is fine, use this acceptance and tell yourself what you're scared of might be true. In this tone in your head. So doing it only after getting checked makes it safe.    Or when driving a car, afraid you might crash. You can use this approach, but still make sure to pay attention. I heard a saying which went something like \"Never fear the road, always respect the road\". I think this principle is the best for all kinds of scary situations.\n\nThat depends on how deep you want to go down the rabbit hole. The basic concept is very close to stoicism, and Epictetus does a pretty good job of talking through the logic of why it makes no rational sense to fear death or pain. \n\nThe key is that while you have no need to fear these things, it still isn't a reasonable choice to seek them out. Don't make choices that will invite harm, but if harm comes anyway, then it is what it is and you have no control over it. The only thing you get to choose is how you react. Choose to face it head on, as an internal test of your own virtue. Can you hold to your values and present yourself with honor and dignity while in a tough position? \n\nIt's a bit more involved than that, to be sure, but that gives the general idea. I'd read The Enchiridion by Epictetus if you want to dive deeper. Discourses is for further reading; it's like an expanded version of Enchriridion.\n\nThat's the only thing that works in reality. Hiding from anxiety doesn't help.\n\nRadical acceptance worked twice, but the process was agonizing.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it.\n\nYou could always remove your adrenal glands and sell them on the dark web\n\nDIY tutorial pls\n\nI got my adrenalectomy at Claire‚Äôs üòä\n\nOMG they left a speculum in my body after surgery..\nIt totally became infected even though they said it was nickel free.\n\nThis WAS a Claire's inside of a Wal-Mart, though.\n\nhow do i do that?\n\nFinish. The fucking. Story. What happened?! What about the glans?!\n\nMirtazapine had me like that at the end, was emotionless and half asleep all day and nothing fazed me, I mean nothing.   I remember being in pretty crazy situations and everyone's panicking and I'm just like ugh, get on with it.\n\nLmao I love this effect, Zoloft also makes me pretty emotionless compared to normal too. Unfortunately they‚Äôre kinda stopping working and I‚Äôve been getting more overwhelming moods but for awhile I didn‚Äôt even feel like crying ever, it was amazing.\n\nToo bad about the sleepy part. But being stonecold sounds awesome to me. Unless you couldn't enjoy any positive emotions either?\n\nI did have positive emotions.  Just that it's such a heavy sleeping pill that you're just tired all day and nothing gets you hyped up or over excited. \n\nThat stone cold feeling I get if I drink beer really fast, but we all know how that ends up the next day.\n\nAh I see. Doesn't sound ideal indeed. Too bad there is always a catch. Definitely is the case for alcohol indeed. I love how a few beers make me feel, but that only lasts for about 2-3 hours. And after that I feel way worse than before, including terrible sleep quality.\n\nBummer.\n\nExposure is probably the only natural way. Just start doing things that get that kind of reaction out of you, eventually the reaction will stop. Exposure is really the best thing for anxiety.\n\nI kind of agree. The more exposure you get, the less your brain sees it as a threat, the less adrenaline and fight/flight you‚Äôll have\n\nNot just the only \"natural\" way, but the only way.\n\nWell, if the goal is to not feel intense anxiety, benzos 100% work *in the moment.* That being said they never actually fix anything, avoidance worsens it over time, including benzos, and the amygdala needs to get the message that the fear isn't justified.\n\nFacts\n\nAgreed, with the added fact that benzo's placebos stop working and people call it \"tolerance buildup\" the only thing we have left is:\n\n\n1. Acceptance as taught in ACT therapy or Radical acceptance as others comments have called it in here,\n\n2. Exposure but a planned exposure, cuz exposure as such never calms me down, maybe for they day but tomorrow IM the same introverted guy,\n\nSimple example is when u were a kid and parent's friend come to visit and they make u go say Hello, i did it 1000 'forcefully socializing', on the 1001st my heat would beat up again, i never turned into a social extrover,\n\n\nWhich leads to the last point:\n\n3. Propranolol for calming down the heart beats, so next time u trynna socialize ur brain goes 'oh I don't remember heart not shaking your whole body', and u socialize (mentally still forced - but physically) calmed down.\n\nI think that the best way is habit. Every situation offers a choice of how to react. The more you choose to react with an appropriate level of concern, the more you are likely to do so the next time. \n\nI was able to do this with a combination of cognitive and non-cognitive techniques. Among the cognitive techniques is the four Rs: Recognize a panic reaction, Refuse to validate it (not adding fuel to it, which differs from pretending it‚Äôs not there or saying ‚Äústop it‚Äù), Reprogram a better reaction, and React according to the new programming (could be acting as if). A non-cognitive technique was paradoxical intention, trying to make happen what I was afraid of.\n\nI would advise against trying to be a stone cold mf. It‚Äôs OK to feel the anxiety, especially as an initial reaction (otherwise, we truly would not escape the charging tiger). The key, for me, anyway, was to both feel the fear and proceed anyway. That had the effect of neutralizing anxiety‚Äôs power over time.\n\nDoes this also work with confrontational anxiety, or do you think something else would work better?\n\nI‚Äôm glad you mentioned this as I still get some confrontational anxiety. I sometimes avoid or soft pedal difficult conversations. I‚Äôve never tried either technique for this but I could imagine mindfulness and the four Rs working. I probably wouldn‚Äôt use paradoxical intention.\n\nOne idea for confrontational anxiety is preparation. I read a book called Crucial Conversations that talks about this. You may want to rehearse the confrontation with an uninvolved friend and have them do triggering behavior. It‚Äôs also important to acknowledge that you may feel anxiety during the conversation and imagine continuing anyway, sticking to your goals yet listening, going neither to silence nor attack.\n\nThank you for your question! It inspires me to try to have more productive confrontations. üôÇ\n\nI love that !!!!!APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CONCERN!!!!!!\n\nIdk I just stopped giving a fuck one day. Idk how but I did. I‚Äôve always used logic to talk myself out of things but this time I‚Äôm like desensitized now. I think all the trauma I went through the last year just did a number on me. Not depressed, empty, or anything. Just neutral, I guess? Anyway, good luck with your shit!\n\nAge helps‚Ä¶ really the only upside to getting old lol\n\nNot necessarily. I thought my anxiety disappeared or something after childhood and teenage. But suddenly one bad night of sleep and it strikes back even harder lol. I am 29 now And I felt the same shitty feeling i had when i was 12 and can‚Äôt go to school I felt terrified of going to work like i never did before??? Same work same coworkers suddenly became terrifying. It sucks to think you grew out of it and then realized nothing actually changedü•≤\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou just have to stop giving a shit about everyday trifles‚Ä¶ not worth it. Be chill &amp; chill will follow you.\n\nedit: 49 here\n\n33 here, I feel ya\n\nWhat you‚Äôre describing is close to a psychopath.\n\nYou need adrenaline. It keeps your sympathetic responses working. Yours is just overworked\n\nDrugs bruv. I‚Äôm talking legal prescription drugs. Zoloft. \n\nEither that or frontal lobe surgery. (Not realistic.) \n\nNo one feels nothing though apart from psychopaths. Action movie heroes aren‚Äôt real. Everyone fears loss. But if you can accept that you will lose **everything** eventually then that will help.\n\nBut physically, if you‚Äôre anxious then probably a good ssri and some heavy muscle work like dumbbells or cycling will calm the nervous system hugely. Good sleep and diet. And it‚Äôs better than a brain injury.\n\nElevate your anxiety to Dpdr and there you have it.\n\nWhat helps me the most is intense anger. When I'm furious and totally in rage mode, idgaf about my anxiety. **My anxiety sinply has no place in my brain when it's filled with RAGE**.\n\nSadly I need a big emotional or physical fight to get that angry... Breaking my phone or some other expensive thing also works, but thats not a realistic approach... and I dont want to break my stuff just to be able to make a phonecall lol\n\nI fukkin wish! My husband is barely afraid of anything and rarely experiences anxiety. Jealous!\n\nTake an ssri\n\nIm an emotional black hole üòÇ‚Ä¶.i feel nothing\n\nThey made me numb to life in general...\n\nThat doesn't sound good\n\nIm exxagerating a little, but my emotions are definitely all dulled out in general\n\nBut hey, its better than being an anxious wreck and not be able to function\n\nTrue\n\nI‚Äôll take not being a wreck any day of the week and twice on Sunday\n\nBenzodiazepines, pregabalin, gabapentin, and (to a lesser extent) Quetiapine or mirtazapine (also some snri/ssris)\n\nYeah if u wanna sell your soul to devil lol\n\ni already did\n\nI gladly would\n\nHonestly what seemed to work for me was fake it til you make it. I was almost completely done with anxiety for about 2 years doing that, then I had bad news and it set me back but I‚Äôm getting there again.\n\nAnxiety is normal.  Just don‚Äôt let it show.   This, however, is probably not great for long term mental health, but ‚Äúfake it til you make it‚Äù is the most realistic advice.\n\nDissociate.\n\nDoesn't that leave you losing your keys and finding them in the fridge? For me it does, I just put things down without thinking when I'm disassociated.¬†\n\nAlthough I don‚Äôt recommend it, a possible way to attain this is to expose yourself to extreme situations like a war for an extended period. Being a vet myself, my training and exposure will make me go towards a problem (fire, shooting, etc) vice run away. I can assess the situation, make rational decisions in moments of panic for the average person.\n\nThe problem is you don‚Äôt come back to normal life after this, everything is boring, your hyped senses are not needed anymore, you feel like an outcast, I got into heavy drinking. So it is a double edge sword, doesn‚Äôt lead to a balanced life\n\nI'm somewhat stone cold(god i hate using that word) i don't think it's necessary to expose yourself to such extreme situations, but regardless the exposure is what has helped me, wether it be falling off the bike several times, getting into fights, talking to strangers on the street or anywhere, doing martial arts, accidentally setting the kitchen on fire,\nSituations like this, the experience has made me not panick or shut down in the moment instead i could assess the situation in my mind and figure out what to do.\n\nOfc if i was at a warzone i would probably piss myself.\n\nAlso I guess it has something to do with my sense of duty and thought that i need to be independent, to not rely on others.\n\nEdit: were you able to get at all back to normal life?\n\nDidn‚Äôt manage to come back to a normal life, very challenging. I got a control on my drinking, I am on a lot of meds, seeing psychiatrist/psychologist, etc. I‚Äôm trying to be the best husband possible for my wife and the best dad for my young daughter.\n\nThis is why I said I don‚Äôt recommend it. A couple years ago I stopped for a huge car accident, with a car on fire and everything. The operational me kicked in, went in, assessed the situation, took control, gave a couple orders to surrounding people that were just frozen. The first responders and police were surprised I could do this. To me that was almost second nature, just felt normal. But going home and continuing to live my life is a nightmare‚Ä¶\n\nThat's also how you can get PTSD that can make you even more anxious than you already were, plus other \"fun\" things.\n\nBecome a character and it requires that for the role. And then just play the role of urself as that character\n\nYes this!!!!!!!!!!!! I did this as a DJ in the 90s!!!!! It takes balls. Then it became who you are.\n\nPersonas are powerful\n\nI wonder how actors can slip in and out of character and have the balls to go through 1000s of rejections at high level - same principals.\n\nThis attitude would most likely get you killed very quickly. Anxiety has kept the human species alive. That's why behaving like that is so rare to see, and usually, it's by someone who has survived very rough times, a catastrophe. Drugs can give you this feeling momentarialy, but will always be fake.momentarily\n\nI kinda just snap in and out of a numbness like that.\n\nTeach me master!\n\nIt's like a part of me got tired of feeling scared all the time and sometimes something gets switched off, I could be going to a dentist or this one time I was taking a bus out of the town and was dreading that before but then at the moment I didn't really feel anything I just executed a string of instruction mechanically. It's like I shut down, doing things is like , \n\n'walk here, take a basket , collect the groceries on the list, stand in line, move things on the belt and leave the basket,  say hi, collect things and arrange into backpack, Pay for the stuff, leave.'\n\nAnd I'd have a step by step- instruction in as much detail as I feel necessary, for anything. They are easyer to plan out while one feels 'good' but can be followed even when one doesn't.\n\n(not-good, as in, feeling depressed, brain fog, inability to focus, memory gaps, tired, but not as bad as to be unable to do anything. But planning everything out helps with anxiety too.)\n\nI guess I also get a bit more numb when the 'moment' has finally arrived, for instance at the dentist or doctor indeed. But I still dread the anticpation anxiety. I just want to get rid of it.\n\nI con't have a cure for that. Guess I learned to live with it to some necessary extent.\n\nXanax will do the trick\n\nNo doubt but that isn't a long term solution unfortunately.\n\nI miss who I was on alprazolam &lt;/3\n\nklonopin\n\nTake propranolol. Makes you cool as a cucumber\n\nBecome a Navy SEAL?\n\nMe, too.\n\nI would give anything to be able to turn this off permanently.\n\nYou can for a while then it manifests out in different ways if you don‚Äôt get to the core issues.\n\nMedications were the first thing to come to mind. A good amount of anti-anxiety meds most definitely have a *zombified* affect that I've heard plenty about. I've only had anti anxiety meds once and it was one dose on the one day and I *hated* it. I didn't realize how badly I needed my maladaptive daydreaming to function properly (masking)The meds took that away and I just could *not* . I felt deeply unnerved and never put that into my body again. The medication started with an S? Sertraline maybe? I don't remember. But yeah, some meds will most definitely make people give off cold &amp; calculating vibes for sure.\n\nI got so sick of hearing this, but man it works. When something is making you anxious, just stop what you're doing and take some deep breaths; inhale for ten full seconds, exhale for ten full seconds. Do at least five sets of inhales and exhales. If you heed to step away from whatever you're doing, do it. It'll help mellow you out and you'll think a little more clearly.\n\nI‚Äôll just leave this here for you\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/g7uwr4sybHU?si=dK0tFJFO1i91lC6O\n\nMan I can totally relate to this OP. I love to be just chill. Like you said stone cold. Today was a great day for me I actually enjoyed the day today, I got my Xanax refilled and although i wasn‚Äôt super anxious or panicked I just had that damn impending doom feeling which I have almost every morning like something bad is going to happen or I worry what if this and what if that. Some days are more intense than others. I get 20 .5 Xanax that have to last me almost 2 months, which is fine, I also get hydroxyzine which help but sometimes make me super tired and dried out. Sometimes it gives me a little pep, it does work for anxiety it takes the edge off but Xanax is just different, at least for me. But yes, stone cold, almost non reactive to anything would be great. Idk dare I say I like to be comfortably numb or just numb.\n\nThis is where my anxiety like to fcuk with me because I get so anxious at the smallest silliest things, phone calls , appointments, meeting people, going out , and yet in a real emergency situation, I suddenly do this thing where I become like super calm amd know what to do. \n\n\nAnxiety sucks.\n\nüò¨ idk, worked at a prison for a minute and had some pretty crazy situations where I wasn't anxious or fearful and knew that I just needed to handle the situation. Now I'm coming to develop severe panic attacks like everyday even though I haven't worked at the prison for over a year. ü§¶ I thought that something really was wrong with me because I worked at the prison and had no anxiety. I felt like there's no way it could affect me and I'd be able to control it if it was anxiety. I still feel like I could control it if I knew 100% that it was anxiety. There's just always a thought that there is something wrong and it's difficult not to succumb to these thoughts because of my overwhelming bad experiences with lazy and apathetic doctors.\n\nThat being said I've really come to understand what a lot of you guys go through and how difficult it actually is. ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ùüí™\n\nIntuniv helps\n\nYou are inspired to be a fictional character of an idolized hero. People in the real world don‚Äôt act like that. Most people who might be like that have massive amounts of training and/or trauma they are hiding.\n\nSimulacra and simulation \n&gt; current society has replaced all reality and meaning with symbols and signs, and that human experience is a simulation of reality. Moreover, these simulacra are not merely mediations of reality, nor even deceptive mediations of reality; they are not based in a reality nor do they hide a reality, they simply hide that nothing like reality is relevant to people's current understanding of their lives.\n\nMeditation, exercise, probably some benzos as well. Will make you a stonecold mothafuckaüòÜ\n\nI'm on like four meds that help, plus an emergency Xanax supply. I am now as cool as a cucumber left in a hot car in a forgotten grocery bag.\n\nwould love to know what meds you take?\n\nI was an adrenaline junkie as a teenager/early 20s. Fast cars. Fast horses. Fast quads. I can almost die and no longer get a spike of adrenaline. Put a car in a ditch dodging a bad driver and be as cool as a cucumber. I just get angry after the fact. So it‚Äôs possible. Would I recommend? Meh?\n\nYou might want to check out a condition called \"adrenal fatigue.\"\n\nUnfortunately I‚Äôm pretty much SOL. I have Cptsd because of my childhood. This is only one of the complications üòÇüòÇü§£ I‚Äôm constantly amazed that I made it to 33. Never thought I‚Äôd live this long.\n\nDeep breaths, meditation, yoga and unplugging from smart phones.\n\nCymbalta\n\nGet some propranolol üî•üî•üî•\n\nHonestly in intense moments when my blood is boiling I‚Äôm exactly like what you describe. It‚Äôs all the bullshit and thoughts prior to that pollutes my mind.\n\nMeditation!!!\n\nI used to be that way until a year and a half ago. I knew I had anxiety, and I knew i had problems that needed to be addressed, but instead I buried all my thoughts and issues, and didn‚Äôt give a single fuck. But, it comes at a cost. You destroy relationships, friendships, and get yourself into trouble or addiction like I did. I drank to cope, and it worked well until I drank too much one night and had a full blown panic attack. Since then I‚Äôve been non stop panicked, anxious, just 25 years of issues coming to the surface. Don‚Äôt be a person that doesn‚Äôt give a fuck, address your issues, fix your issues, and care for yourself and others. The world needs that shit anyways with all the disrespectful idiots now a days.\n\nHonestly, I love your post. \nIt's great to see people trying to change their life, in any way.\n\n\nMaybe the reason it seems so unattainable is because the only way you're looking at it is from afar, like it's a rather lofty goal.\n\n\nIf you can imagine yourself with just a little more confidence and work on practicing basically being a badass, you will eventually become what it is that you want to be..\nLike. You have the idea in your head of how a stone cold mother fucker would react in any situation, even if you aren't conscious of it. That means you know what you need to do. You just need to start listening to that little badass voice inside you more, and it will get louder and become easier over time.\n\nYou would probably agree to walk a quarter mile down the road with your friend, but you wouldn't be able to conceptualize what the entirety of a trek from Florida to California would entail. \nIf you break down your emotional growth journey into \"legs\" like a road trip, each detour and stop on your itinerary are the goals you've made for yourself. \nBehavior modification is all about consistency, so make sure whatever ways you find that you can express how much of a badass you are it would be a reasonable and natural adjustment in your behavior and appearance as needed as you grow in your truth. \n\nRemember, though, strong men can cry, too.\nLosing our fears of being judged for having feelings and emotions is another approach that can be taken before finding the road that leads to mood and personality disorders. \n\n\nPractice perfection, but be capable of accepting that you can always try again.\nIt gets easier the more comfortable you get with fucking up. \nThat's where I feel confidence comes from.\n\nDon't hold your self back, there's no need to. \nBe the badass you want to see in the world.\n\nThat's what a badass would do, right?\n\nI thought i had anxiety my entire life. Got an adhd diagnosis in my late 20s. Now I channel that energy for good! It‚Äôs mor dopamine than andrenaline for me. I cannot do office jobs. Throw me in the chaos of an emergency department and I THRIVE.\n\nPractice\n\nYou got fight it. I have terrible cardio phobia, so couldn‚Äôt work out as my heart rate increase would freak me out. One day I thought fuck this and went gym, powered through, I‚Äôve since been six times and it gets easier each time\n\nI absolutely hate anxiety because the minute my heart rate rises it reminds me of having a panic attack and sometimes triggers it. I hate it\n\nSame here bud. Also often have skipped heart beats (pac / pvc / sometimes runs) and that keeps me trapped in this shit. Covid definitely made it worse everytime i got it (3x so far)z\n\nYh I get them too mate- this issue is the panic about them makes them worse :( mine are mostly after eating\n\nHave you tried Ashwagandha supplements? I hear they can do something like this ü§£\n\nEdit: doctor prescribed me propranolol.  My anxiety laughed at that.\n\nLorazepam when shit gets real. \n\nAlcohol almost every day. \n\nKratom reds and greens no whites. Helps too.\n\nPlease rethink daily drinking. There‚Äôs a LOT of alcoholics who started out using it to treat anxiety.\n\nI know there is. It's sad.  Thank you for taking the time to respond... And we'll, giving a crap. It's always a day to day battle if you know what I mean. Best of luck to you.\n\nProper long term medication like an SSRI or mood stabiliser. Long term because you need to go on it and stay on it for at least 6-8 weeks to see the effect and see if it works for you before adding, switching or stopping. It‚Äôs an experiment, but the right mix of meds are life changing. Ideally along with therapy to treat the poor thinking patterns anxiety tricks you into. \n\nHowever: you CANNOT eliminate anxiety entirely because everyone feels it. Those of us with anxiety disorder just feel it even when there‚Äôs no trigger. Every person feels anxiety over something occasionally, it‚Äôs part of being a human, it just shouldn‚Äôt take over your life.\n\nJigsaw brand Adrenal Cocktail has helped our family so much in that regard and I wish we‚Äôd had this in the toolbox ages ago. It helps us tame and tone down the adrenal spike that makes us feel like we‚Äôre spiraling. We have the dna gene that makes it difficult to break down adrenaline, so Jigsaw brand adrenal cocktail powder - a small scoop in 4 oz of water or juice.  Many people take it daily, some twice a day. When I first discovered it, I took it once a day for 2-3 days and the relief was amazing. Now I take it as-needed only. For my husband, I put it in his coffee every Monday-Friday with breaks on the weekend. My teen son, I gave it to him daily for awhile, too - and now only as needed.  It‚Äôs an easy experiment to try for a very life-impacting problem. It doesn‚Äôt solve ALL anxiety necessarily because the root cause of anxiety can be many things like various deficiencies, neurotransmitter imbalances, etc - but that adrenaline takes the anxiety to a peak level and bringing that down can really be a game-changer\n\nu/schwloeb I've got low blood pressure and take atenolol, a beta blocker, when needed. Propranolol didn't agree with me, but I respond well to atenolol. When starting a new medication, I always do a little trial and error at home when I have nothing going on. So, I started with a quarter dose and gradually worked my way up to the full dose (25 mg) over the course of four different days just to make sure my body could handle it‚Äîand it did.\n\nChat with your doc about it. It might not drastically drop your resting heart rate, and could still help with blocking adrenaline.\n\nAnd for those who suggest toughing it out through anxious moments, well, for those who experience extreme physical symptoms, that might not be an option. As for me, those adrenaline rushes cause vomiting all night, regardless of how calm I can be mentally. So, atenolol has been a huge help for me.\n\nI feel you, i so often envy people without anxiety and ocd, who just seem to have life so easily, obviously they dont cuz everyone has their struggles, but anxiety makes every small step terrifying.\n\nLike my girlfriend fears hardly anything at all, its amazing. Yet I fear 100 things a day. \n\nIve always admired zen. The idea of being carefree, at peace, at one with the universe. trusting the universe etc. Ive studied it my whole life, but its no use. Ive also studied all religions and philosophies and saw things I admired in them and wished I could embody, but I cant do it. \n\nSame with anime. Ive always been inspired by characters like luffy from one piece. He is so carefree, literally nothing scared him, and he's always happy and confident.\n\nBeta Blockers is the answer\n\nRegular exercise helps a lot to have strong nervous system it increase your tolerance especially cardio\n\nPretty much all SSRIs did that to me so that's why I don't take them, they turn me into flat line robot, you don't want to feel like this trust me\n\nMaster unbotheredness.\n\nIt‚Äôs called dissociation. It‚Äôs fucking awful. You feel numb as hell and nothing feels real.\n\nIt literally would mean you becoming a psychopath.. They are stone cold, no empathy, no remorse no shame, guilty......\n\nWorking in a high adrenaline environment (fire/EMS) has affected me a lot, for better or worse. I still get a rush of adrenaline for some things‚Äîi.e highly emergent calls or fire, but the exposure over time has helped me remain calm during high stress situations. I still deal with anxieties in my personal life (and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd want those to ever completely go away), but I feel more leveled out as a whole. The feeling of, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here before and know what to do‚Äù is something that comes with exposure and time. But, stay mentally healthy and elastic while doing it because it can take a toll.\n\nHonestly, I feel more calm and at ease in tense or stressful situations because I‚Äôve spent so much time feeling anxious and normal day today stuff - to the point where I often don‚Äôt realise I should be taking these situations more seriously until later on.\n\nx\n\nWhenever my anxiety flares up (like it‚Äôs doing right now), I like to tell myself, ‚ÄúIf it happens, I‚Äôll handle it‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nSo far, so good\n\nBurn out and not giving a fuck what others think. Learning how to stand up for myself and others and practicing it.\n\nAdrenaline itself is not really the problem. The problem is your brain releasing adrenaline when it's not needed. Adrenaline in situations where it's needed can feel amazing but not so much when it's not.\n\n20 minutes of meditation twice a day for 6 months. You will be on another level.\n\nPropranolol does absolutely nothing for me. Maybe because my mind is the worst thing rather than the physical symptoms.\n\nBizarrely I cope well in the few emergency type scenarios I've been in. Maybe because I'm so used to the adrenaline, and for once it actually has a purpose. It's the rest of the time I'm terrible lol\n\nThis might sound completely crazy but it is a training that works, CO2 tolerance.\n\nDo cardio like treadmil or biking holding your breath in intervals. Go slow, 5 seconds per minute and add one second each day. Try to reach 21 seconds. That was the magic number for me, it make you less reactive to stress. \n\nThere is legit research on it if you google it. Your body learns to deal with stress of CO2 buildup and this resilience transfers to other things in life.\n\nDiazepam does this for me. I‚Äôm still aware but I don‚Äôt give a fuck about anything that would usually send me into a panic. I am the person I dream of being when I take 2mg of diazepam.\n\nYeah it is possible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. It starts with seeing your anxiety as the weakling it is and doing whatever you want regardless of your anxiety. It isn‚Äôt about getting rid of the anxiety to live. You live to get rid of the anxiety. Period\n\nI wish I knew, benzos helps me not to feel like this for a short time (few weeks) then I develop tolerance and when I taper off it all comes back 10x worse and withdrawal symptoms also lol. Benzos bad, but so good\n\nantisocial personality disorder\n\nGod yeah I get how you feel and I feel like that would be the dream sometimes. I also like to keep in mind that if there really was something wrong going on I'd be in the ER from my anxiety hah. I guess there's pros and cons to both.\n\nYou just said it! So try it. Fake it till you make it. It works when you a child when you vividly imagine the world is yours, then again as a teenager and into your early 20s - its a choice - be - decide.\n\nWe make up stories to make us terrified of the world - fuck that.\n\nI believe there is a benefit to ignorance! Re invent that ignorance and sprinkle with a little quiet wisdom and you be golden.\n\nManifestation mane! (as I type this during a panic attack)\n\nWorks for me:\nButeyko breathing\nTRE¬† exercises\nMeditation\nMicrodosing psilocybin¬†\nCold showers\nNothing is the¬†\n\nWorks for me: Buteyko breathing, TRE (trauma release) exercises, Meditation,¬† Microdosing psilocybin, Cold showers.¬† ¬† Now I still feel, but feelings don't own me. I'm a student of my suffering instead of a victim. And nothing is the end of the world anymore.\n\nWell being not afraid of a lion or tiger is easy one, or at least for me lol, whenever I go to the Zoo there's this little pre-cautious space before humans can get closer to the cage of the lion,\n\nI usually cross it (cuz i love lions), and once inside that area if i put my hand inside the cage a lion can chop it off but I'm not crazy of course I just wanna be close to them.\nOnce a Zoo keeper saw me and started yelling and warning me to not go that close and I told her \"Don't worry lion recognizes lion\", everyone around had a laughter, I out of respect of course moved out of the pre-cage area.\n\nWhy i say this story is because that day I didn't took my Propranolol (as I will, and others have suggested u already), yet I felt no fear of the lions.\n\n¬†Additionally what also happened that day I saw the lioness looking at me in a hunting position, but not in my eyes, I thought she was old, and she just sprinted ahead but blocked by the cage, and ducks started flying behind me and she looked upwards at them sadly as if \"my food flew away\", I realized she didn't wanted to eat me but those birds,\n\nPoint being: no Propranolol yet my body didn't release adrenaline, of course cage is there but most people scream in fear, still!¬†\nI was less than 1 meter away from her &amp; the big male lion looking at me suspiciously.\nI felt more at peace than around any human being.¬†\n\n...\n\nIt's the same person that gets adrenaline rush even if I have to ask the market store worker where is X product is!\nUnless I've taken propranolol I'd start choking on my own heartbeats, blushing and sweating.\n\nThe actual asking is never as scared, but Anticipation always kills me.¬†\nIt reminds me like when in school u have to introduce urself, but u sit in a way that u have to wait 20 other kids to do it first, by the time its ur turn u are soaking wet in the armpits? Yeah, exactly!\n\nI think it's all bcuz of overthinking and self-judgement:\nSo that's my 2 suggestion: taking Propranolol while also working on ur mindfulness and try to label negative thoughts as just a 'negative thought'.¬†\n\nI learned it in free YouTube search bar videos \"ACT therapy\".¬†\n\nI've tested Acceptance therapy solely, without Propranolol, results are Adrenaline still overexcites me, which just proves Propranolol isn't a placebo &amp; instead it's just a magical pill for the physical symptoms of anxiety.¬†\n\nWhile it doesn't help with the mental anxiety, you got to cope with it, learn from ACT Therapy, because I have not found a magical pill &amp; I doubt it exists.\n\n...\n\nMaaaybe use my strategy with the lions? Like, start viewing humans as someone u love, like they're part of who you are instead of \"enemies u have to prove you are better than them\"\n\nYou follow me? Like, don't love people blindly, but only to brainwash your mind to not view them as the \"evil robots masked in a human body\".¬†\n\nI know easier said than done, because humans are so complex and you're surprised by their stupidity on a daily bases VS any other animal is much simpler.\n\nYou being a human you naturally recall bad memories of humans .. but that's my only solution: keep reminding yourself that humans are most complex of the animals species &amp; don't take anything personal because they act on emotions.\n\nDon't listen nor trust their words.\n\nWill this make u stonecold? Not really, but you just keep swimming in this life and view human's stupidity as the waves thrown at you.¬†\n\nWaves never stop, human's stupidity will never stop."

I do think I got gastritis because of anxiety. I also have 3 children and grew up in and still live in addictive household because maryland and today's economy we all know it. It's hard. But people constantly think it's mental. Heart palpitation, uncomfortable tickles in my chest and stomach (I explain it like when someone gives a public speech). It's our brain constantly on fight or flight. It's not easy.\n\nMy GI said my gastritis and other GI issues are directly related to my anxiety. The gut and brain affect each other.\n\nYes I read that as well. I know especially when my anxiety acts up, so does the gastritis..and I already suffer from migraine since I was a child which I believe had to do with my anxiety.\n\nYup and imagine having a 100 symptoms over the span of a month\n\nSo true. Even out of fight or flight your body is like a cat scratching your bedroom door all night yowling even when you‚Äôre just sitting down on your couch trying to watch something. Sometimes I wish I can just go into my own brain and roll up a newspaper and just say ‚ÄúSHUT UP BE QUIET IM TRYING TO WATCH THIS SHOW AND ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS YAP YAP YAP WE DID THAT ALL DAY YESTERDAY!!‚Äù\n\nI told someone it‚Äôs like a war in your brain, sometimes there is a cease fire and you have time to be yourself, but then the constant worry starts, your job, finances etc. I am 57, I had some anxiety all my life, it really got bad when my one sister passed, I just realized I was mainly alone, I never married or had kids, my parents and all but 1 sister is gone, so little or no support network, I have a therapist and a psychiatrist, but that goes only so far, I know at night I just want to lay down and go to sleep and not wake up at times.\n\nAnxiety Disorder is mentally and physically hard and draining,unless you suffer from it, nobody really understands.\n\nBeing at work, surrounded by people who don't know you're suffering and trying not to let it show whilst in the middle of an attack or \"episode\" is so draining!\n\nThis is one of the worst parts. I was recently in the ER (due to my anxiety). I had to take a week off of work. I couldn‚Äôt even tell them the truth that I have crippling anxiety to the point where I can‚Äôt function. It‚Äôs so terrible. I‚Äôm still feeling so sick. Headaches, brain fog, extreme fatigue. Idk what‚Äôs going on. Starting lexapro this weekend. Praying for relief at this point.\n\nGive it a few weeks for your body to adjust. Medication, CBT and as many \"positive distractions\" as possible help !\n\nWhat's cbt? My anxiety at this very moment is still on. Like 12 hours at this point. I pace to help and I'm snapping awake with shocking feeling's so it makes me nervous to sleep without drinking or staying up until basically I can't anymore.¬†\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy. Or just any good trauma therapist would do a good job. Just to work through some of the issues and teach you coping skills to help lessen the impact of it. It's not a fix all but it certainly helps !\n\nI know the feeling. It's horrible. I hope you get some relief. I wouldn't wish this on anyone and no one can understand who hasn't experienced the same thing. It's very frustrating and isolating!\n\nSevere crippling anxiety here 24/7 ptsd panic disorder all that üöÆ\n\nSame! It's eating me alive.\n\nIdec anymore I just walk thru it took years to learn\n\nI'm so jealous! But I am pushing through it one step at a time. The physical symptoms are so upsetting, though.\n\nI know it‚Äôs brutal . I think I‚Äôm going to die all the time it‚Äôs a Terrible way to live glad I‚Äôm not on any pills tho anti depressants make me sick and worse off\n\nWhich medications did take and what did you feel on it\n\nI have been wanting to get back to my normal pre-anxiety self  for a very long time now. Unfortunately for me I don't know how it feels to not be anxious anymore.\n\nI can relate!\n\nIt‚Äôs wild how I‚Äôve had so much anxiety (and stress) as a kid (with very legit reasons) and that hasn‚Äôt changed only now I have bills and more traumas to be anxious about\n\nI don't know what it is like to feel \"normal\"\n\nFelt that\n\nSometimes I wonder how would life be like if I didn't have anxiety and all the opportunities that I missed out/turned down cause of it\n\nSame. So many missed opportunities for fear of making decisions, taking action, overthinking and spiraling all the time üòû\n\nMe, too.\n\nSame!\n\nAmen lol\n\nJust getting to work and doing my normal workflow seems like an accomplishment. I'm functioning, damnit!\n\nI love this community everyone seems to get everything I'm going through and I've never felt that way before.\n\nYep and I didn't realize it until I started taking medication and it completely stopped.\n\nWhich medication. Were there any side effects?\n\nEscitalopram¬†- lexapro generic. There were some like fatigue and some lower sexual desire. But some of that was also due to testosterone levels and take other things like wellbutrin for fatigue. Side note: I have had this anxiety for a long time but I've also forced myself to continue to be in uncomfortable situations and recognize negative thoughts.\n\nLexapro also makes intimacy kinda rough. But it does help. Until you are resistant or cant get it. Then the shocks and headaches are what I suffered with. ( Having a Panic right now) Sorry about the wordiness.¬†\n\nYes. I just want inner peace. But it‚Äôs never an option.\n\nI have clinical depression and anxiety. I didn‚Äôt even realize how bad my anxiety was until I started taking Cymbalta. It gets a bad rap for a number of reasons, but it was life changing for me. My anxiety has been controlled for over four years now.\n\nI just started taking that today. What‚Äôs the bad rap ?\n\nIt has a Black Box for \"withdrawals\".  You may notice if you miss one or two doses that you get \"brain zaps\" and/or feel dysphoric.  Weening off of Cymbalta is very difficult.  I have not tried, but I've heard that most people have to go as far as opening the capsule and taking grains of the drugs out.\n\nPeople have no idea how many demons we slay just to operate and seem ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I‚Äôm white knuckling through life but I‚Äôm doing what needs to be done lol.\n\nI have severe severe anxiety that is awfully bad and I‚Äôm treatment resistant, I pray for all of us.\n\nYour only options is to try your best to have a life with the least anxiety triggers.\n\nHave you tried gabapentin? It's been a lifesaver for me.\n\nI‚Äôve only tried pregablin\n\nYeah but it‚Äôs just all in your head. If I can‚Äôt see it you can‚Äôt prove it. Anxiety is a choice. \n\nThis is a joke if it wasn‚Äôt obvious. It‚Äôs just hard for people who have never dealt with it to understand how real it is. It amazes me how something so non-physical can cause such excruciating suffering\n\nAlmost blocked you üòÖ\nAnxiety is indeed a chronic disease weither we see it or not.\n\nIts so true, I constantly overthink and keeps worrying. At this point I want my old life back.\n\nYeah it‚Äôs hard. \nHow long did you have anxiety and at what age did it start?\n \nI‚Äôve had it my whole life\n\nRespected sure. Rewarded no because everyone has a diffrent experience, and people would start faking it more\n\nIt‚Äôs especially hard when it feels like everyone else be like ‚Äúeveryone has a little anxiety from time to time‚Äù which is true and the attempt at empathy is appreciated, but it‚Äôs *not. the. same.*\n\nUgh yes this is so true, obviously I'm not gonna say this out loud to anyone cause I don't want to invalidate their experiences but it's hard when they try to dismiss my feelings based on their idea of what anxiety is.\n\nAgreed except, at least in the situations I've had, it's dismissive not empathetic  üòî\n\nWell said. The amount of energy I've burned on anxiety in my lifetime...and the time lost to recovering from the resulting exhaustion....\n\nSo glad to be reminded I‚Äôm not alone\n\nMy anxiety is at the worst right now. And I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am tired to be honest.\n\nI know this may not be a popular response, but it may help to re-frame anxiety. Anxiety is primarily fear of different things. We need to train our brains that fear or feelings are not actually dangerous. The fear/feelings cause symptoms that are very real and very uncomfortable, absolutely...but most people build up the threat of the fear more than they should. \n\nWhen you think of anxiety as \"a bloody war\", your mind is absolutely going to be on edge trying to defend you from the perceived danger. It would likely help if you try to normalize the anxiety. Really work on that and see if it helps any. You need to put your mind at ease that your body is responding as it should, but the response isn't necessarily dangerous in and of itself.\n\nThanks for the response it‚Äôs good and endorse positivity.\nBut let me tell tell you a fact about really serious out of control anxiety it is a bloody war. It‚Äôs impossible to understand unless you go through it , I know that everybody goes through anxiety, but the anxiety I was talking about is the real disease of anxiety that many have to deal with their whole life unfortunately.\n\nI've been there. I've been the one running to the ER and still may again at some point for all I know. I've had more doctors visits in the past 14 months than the rest of my life combined (39M). I've never had therapy until the last year when I started going to two different therapists. \n\nSo while our paths may be different, I do understand the struggle. I found DARE somewhat recently and its all about letting the anxiety take over and normalizing it. It's been a bigger help than anything else during these past 2 years of extreme anxiety struggles. It's not easy. Some days I fail. But me \"battling\" my anxiety didn't work either so I figured what do I have to lose by letting it in.\n\nI'm not saying anyone has to take the advice - I'm just throwing it out there. Best of luck to you on your journey.\n\nHope you never go through that again. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, your advice makes sense and could be helpful.\n\nI'm still deep in anxiety honestly, but just a lot better. The constant lower level anxiety is a tricky beast that I haven't been able to find a way to get rid of. Still very much on edge most of the time.\n\nHowever, I've come from having severe panic attacks daily. Even when sitting in a remote cabin on vacation with just my wife and I...I'd be sitting there having panic attack pacing around while she hopelessly watched me (she is a fantastic support, but we just didn't know what to do). \n\nI still have a ways to go but I feel like DARE has helped me from spiraling out of control like I used to do quite often.\n\nAnd it seems impossible when someone is in the middle of it to just \"let anxiety in\". I only ever offer the advice to explore because it helped me, and as mentioned, me fighting it 24/7 wasn't helping me anyway, so I was willing to try anything. I figure the more options or resources, the better.\n\nWhat is DARE?\n\nYouTube \"DARE Anxiety\" and they have a channel. 49K subscribers. They have some overview videos and also some hour long webinars that they've done. \n\nTheir philosophy is that you need to accept the anxietyz, let it in, and normalize the anxious thoughts. Our brain equates anxious thoughts/adrenaline rushes as danger when they are really just thoughts. The \"fear of the fear\" puts us in an endless loop. From what they have teached, if you can \"normalize\" the anxiety and train your brain that it's not dangerous then that help the anxiety significantly go down because your brain isn't in fight or flight mode all the time trying to protect you from perceived danger (anxiety).\n\nThat's the 30 second overview of it. But feel free to check out their YouTube channel. Lots of videos on there where then can explain it a lot better than I can.\n\nAwesome! Thank you! I found a workbook and book on Amazon, too. I will definitely check all of that out. One of my biggest problems is that even when I don't think I'm anxious about something my body tells me I am, so I'm working on changing my thought patterns but as you mentioned my brain is still stuck in flight or fight...\n\nNo problem - I have that exact same issue. I have bodily sensations all the time so I'm trying to get better at just letting them be in hopes that they decrease over time.\n\nYes - the book is where it all started. I haven't read it but that's probably the best source. I just haven't read it so it's difficult for me to give it a proper review. They also have an app. There's a free version and a paid version. I'd honestly take in as much free stuff and the book first before paying for the app.\n\n\"Dare\" just didn't work for me, lol. Like all the cbt strategies I tried¬†\n\nI seriously wish more people understood this WITHOUT actually having it. I keep telling my wife but she has no clue.\n\nDid evolution Fail us. \n\nWe need no tiger run\n\nI have the same issue of anxiety,this is kind of war daily\n\nMan this is so true, I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôve never laughed at anyone with anxiety before I ended up getting it. I‚Äôm 24M, and have had heart anxiety for 2 1/2 months now. I hate how mentally tired I get, then at night I get less tired because I‚Äôm scared to sleep üòï\n\nSo true!\n\nSelf reward for sure.\n\nLack of elementary care is a main cause of anxiety.\n\nMy partner woke me up today screaming because I had anxiety all day yesterday and didn‚Äôt clean the house. I layed in bed all day. \nI woke up being screamed at and verbally abused and I said I‚Äôm sorry my anxiety is really bad right now. \nI got shamed and told I ‚Äúalways have anxiety‚Äù. \n\nThis post feels very affirming and it makes me cry to know there are people out there who understand me. Thank you honestly.\n\nRespectfully, fuck your partner\n\nI'm having the hardest day and this made me spurt out a laugh between tears, thank you\n\nand I fully concur\n\nI go through this alot. The \"always have anxiety\" is thrown in my face alot. I hate this, I wish I was normal.\n\nExactly how I feel!\n\nAmen!\n\nThis is the best explanation I've seen!!!\n\nI don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm gonna make it, but if someone told me they were proud of me for dealing with anxiety, I think I‚Äôd want to die even more.\n\nOne of my fav songs is Anxiety by black eyed peas\nLove the lyrics.\n\nI was managing my anxiety okay until my partner left for deployment. He was great about talking me through my thoughts and helping me relax. He‚Äôs gone and I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been totally reliant on his coping help but in the past few weeks life has ramped up a ton and I have no time for myself, I‚Äôm always going to the next thing and I‚Äôm on a treadmill I can‚Äôt stop. The physical symptoms are the worst. Not being able to eat, nearly passing out from shortness of breath or chest pain, feeling paralyzed. I want it to stop now. I wake up and immediately get an anxiety attack. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice for how to calm down when life can‚Äôt stop.\n\nSame here...\n\nI hope you can get through it okay, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre also experiencing this\n\nCheck your b vitamins and magnesium levels. A deficiency in those could make the anxiety a lot worse.\n\nI just got lab work done and my magnesium was normal, didn‚Äôt check vitamin B but don‚Äôt want to blindly go on supplements without checking. Too many vitamins or lytes is not good for you either and can have similar effects to low lytes. I hate how the anxiety is sometimes unexplainable. Even my thyroid is normal\n\nI try to explain it to people as being the emotional equivalent of being constantly, continuously flayed and rolled in salt, and when you actually have to do something or interact with someone, that's when the real torture starts, the kind that makes you long for the time when you were only having your skin peeled off with a rusty knife.\n\n\nAnd yet, we don't just simply have to deal with it, we actually have to actively and intentionally seek out that torture, dozens of times a day, with a smile on our face like nothing is wrong, just to get through everyday life.\n\nListen to the \"Anxiety RX\" podcast! It's about how anxiety is not caused by thoughts but by feelings pushed down inside us from childhood. Also this is said by a medical doctor that suffered from crippling anxiety and found a way to cure himself. \n\nYou can't out-think anxiety that's what makes it so hard. The parts of our brain that think logically turn off during fight or flight response. He goes into depth! It's very helpful."

    "body": "I‚Äôve tried every medication under the sun, and thousands of non med things, but \nNothing works like a benzo does. It‚Äôs arguably the only thing that makes me feel any sense of normal.\n\nThis is just so fucking sad. I wish I was born in the future when we have figured this thing out and can make a benzo that you can safely take everyday so people like me can actually be a functioning human in the world.\n\nI was prescribed klonopin for 5 years when I was 17-22. I was strict with using it only sparingly for the first years but my anxiety is so severe I ended up taking it more often and eventually had to withdrawl from it which was such a morbid disgusting experience.\n\nI said I‚Äôd never do them again because they literally show me such a calm beautiful side of life that I know is too good to be true. Being normal and chill is too good to be true. \n\nBut tonight, after years of not taking a benzo, I took an Ativan, I‚Äôm on it right now. I literally just feel normal. I‚Äôm not high at all, I‚Äôm not anything. I‚Äôm just sitting here and I feel like I can just exist. \n\nI‚Äôve tried all the ‚Äúbenzo alternatives‚Äù supplements and hydroxyzine and propranolol lyrica you name it, but like I said, a benzo is just different. \n",

    "all_comment_text": "I've had anxiety since I was a teen and I was denied benzos until my mid-thirties. When I finally got to try Xanax I felt normal for once. I thought about all the panic attacks that could have been prevented. All the opportunities I lost to anxiety. All the relationships anxiety ruined.\n\nI wish I could take Xanax all the time, but I know that doesn't end well. I only use them when I think I'm going to have a panic attack. It's maddening that having a normal life is just out of grasp.\n\nYes it does end well.  So long as you follow what works for you. \n\n\nBut it won't end well because doctors will never let us have them like we need them.\n\nMine does but it didn't work out for me. I developed a tolerance and started taking more and more because they didn't work the same for panic attacks like the first times. When I wanted to quit I thought I was going to die but I managed it. I still think about xanax all the time\n\nI started st 3.5mg in the beginning and 2 years later was cruising at .5mg a day and was doing great.    I personally decided to stop taking it as I was doing so good.  I made it 7 months before panic attacks came back.   Now my docotr since I was a baby was retired and I seen new ones explaining my history with panic and xanax and they all were disgusted.   And yet here I am just had one like 5 mins ago.  I have them daily.. I'm stuck in a trance again.  Klonopin from some clinic and still suffering üò™.   It just doesn't work for me   she even gave me 1mg 3x a day and still hasn't helped me much.  She's ok with giving me 3mg a day of thst but God forbid I say xanax and she loses her fucking mind on me.\n\nMany times doctors are influenced by their own personal experiences or whatever the medical 'fashion' is. After all, we're just experiments. One year the fashion is to prescribe xanax even to 13 year olds (happened to my brother), the other year xanax is the devil.\n\nI have to agree with you.  My psychiatrist prescribed them to me for 10 years and I took them 2x a day as directed.  No issues.  Never went up in dose.  I moved and my GP told me I should get off of them.  That was 5 years ago and I‚Äôve been struggling ever since.  The withdrawal was terrible.  I‚Äôm doing much better now but I could have been on them for the rest of my life and I think I would have been just fine.  They get a bad rap because people abuse them.\n\nHaving said all that, I‚Äôm glad I spent the last 3 years dealing with the anxiety with no meds.  It‚Äôs hard but I‚Äôm not depending on getting benzos and my recovery is much more durable.\n\nI have had anxiety ocd issues my entire life specifically once I moved out and I had issues with things being organized and got overwhelmed by stuff often but it never stopped me.  I'd always get through it. Never needed medicine for it.   But soon as I had my death like experience December 3rd 2020 aka I guess what was told to me being a panic attack  but it just never went away I was stuck in another state of mind and it just kept on attacking me..  I spent days and days stuck in this other world.. xanax and 2 yesrs of time I managed to Snap back.  Got off them.     But it all came back 7 months later.   I couldn't get the help i needed this time and spent months with onslaught of panic attacks and stuck in this k hole of a life.  If that makes any sense.  It probably doesn't.  It doesn't seem to resonate with anyone.  During this time every family function everyone watching me have attacks and they all are extremely worried st this point but nothings working.  Was given multiple ssris and didn't do a thing but make it worse.   I started hallucinating st work one day it got so bad i started losing memories of my wife and kids. And I ran to my supervisors office slammed the door shut and said Gary!!! I'm losing my mind I'm losing my kids.. my wife.  I fell to the floor and screamed .. this entire attack lasted 2 hours before I was taken home to go to the er.. where they just listened to this same story I had to tell to 6 people and they sent me home.  I went to a php program which I sat there in fear of everything.  I am no longer the same guy now.  My life's been stripped away from me permenantly since that happened.  I begged them all there saying this isn't worming I can't be here.  They gave me lexapro which did nothing  but then they gave me klonopin 0.5mg 2x a day and thay finally sorta helped me.   It stopped the severity of things to a degree.. just enough to stop thinking everything was killing me. But I'm still stuck here afraid of the world. I can't do a thing.   I have xanax from 2023 thst helps me every few weeks to tske a bike ride with Mt kids or something.   The NP I'm seeing now hates benzos specifically xanax but has given me up to 1mg 3x a day if klonppim and even thst doesn't help much.   And she's angry eith me now  for not trying seroqeul or other antipsycotics..  I will say though thst I habe a ton of spine.issues and I have this entire time beleive this is all related to some nerve damage or something but neurologists won't listen to my cries either.  I can read in Google how neck issues can cause panic disorder but they won't even try.\n\nThat really suck man.  The klonapin worked pretty well for me, I hope you can find something that works and get some relief.\n\nLorazepam works for me. After having Covid first then the Covid shot I have bad anxiety\n\nDownvotes for any opinion that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo whatever you need to do to get benzos.‚Äù\n\nOh no the trained professionals who spend 20 years in school are out to purposely ‚Äúget‚Äù anxious patients!! It can‚Äôt possibly be rooted in science and medical history they don‚Äôt prescribe benzos, quaaludes, and opiates anymore, must just be doctors fucking with the sick.\n\nOr afraid of liability‚Ä¶¬†\n\nThey're afraid of liability.\n\n[removed]\n\nYes.  Correct.      I lived a perfectly normal life until randomnpaniv disorder and im legit suicidal without a benzo now.  I spent weeks in hell untilr my doctor gave me xanax 3x a day and my life was perfect again..   was on them jist fine no abuse no early scripts nothing. 2.75 years and i tapered down as needed withiut problems.  I was baseline at a point with .5mg a say and then i said i don't need pills no.more.  6 months later panic disorder came back and my doctornretired and every other one called me adrig addict for seeking.  I didnt exactly knownit was bad ti seek them out.  Now i guess its worse then shooting up.a school.   6 months of suffering trying ssrisnajd other meds I was ready to kill myself.   The hallucinations the fesr the everytbing was to much i lost 80 pounds.  My kids just watcbing their fsther wither away. And then i got klonopin amd it began to help me regain my life.  Its fsr from perfect but ive had a steady scripts since march 2024.. and no abuse no early fills.  Nothing   just using as needed and surviving life  but the NP says she will only let this go on for a short while longer and im like  my lifes 70% better then it was before   so why.  Oh because their dangerous.   Ok.   Sure.\n\nI take .25 - .50 lorazepam daily, my doctor said it‚Äôs ok. That I might just be the type that needs it\n\nI have been taking .5mg of Clonazepam 2x daily for about a decade and it‚Äôs the only thing that allows me to live my life. I couldn‚Äôt leave my house before taking this. Since that time, I have gone from working low level restaurant jobs, to management positions in those restaurants, to lead field technician for a large wireless carrier. Now, I am a Tech Ops Analyst for one of the big 4 banks. I now live independently and can support myself, and live what I consider to be a pretty fulfilling life. Benzodiazepines made that possible and literally saved my life. Xanax was far too heavy, but don‚Äôt let people say ‚ÄúbEnZos are jUSt aLCoHol iN a piLL‚Äù. Shit pisses me off. When used correctly and not abused, they can be miraculous. If something works for you and you take it responsibly and as directed, don‚Äôt let anyone (especially idiots on Reddit) judge you for it.\n\nI also have a prescription to Ativan, the pharmacy's \"1 month's supply\" lasts me 3 months and I don't take it every day. I have had this prescription for over a decade and I have never taken over the recommended dose. \n\nBenzos can be addictive, they are not automatically addictive.\n\nThis right here!!!  I was on xanax 3x a day, after having panic attacks nonstop.   And during that 2 year period I kept my job,  kept working 55 hours a week,  I kicked my alcohol addiction of 20+ years coming up on 3 years October.. started a mushroom supply company in my garage/ basement.    Going on trips,  living an amazing life for once.   Then I decided I wanted to be 100% clean I was off caffeine and most sugar,  drinking food of filtered water a day.   Weined off xanax and was on about my life.   100% clean and sober.    Quit drinking October 1st 2021..  I was off xanax 100% march 2023.   October 2023 I kept getting dizzy randomly and having syncope.  It led to a panic attack that wouldn't go away again.   There I was right back in hell.   My doctor retired and I did not know xanax was frowned upon.   I went to different doctors explaining my story and they all just seen a drug addict.   I went months suffering,   being carried from my machines at work do blown panic attacks many times a week.. every family function they nearly call 911 from them.   It just does not stop.   My life is over,   my side business is gone I cannot even figure out how to keep it going feeling like this.   I finally found a place in May she said gore dangerous xanax was and have my try klonopin.   We'll it takes me from a 10 to a 7.5  I can go to work and through tears get a 8 hour day in and then head home to sit around and wait for bed time to for I don't have panic attacks.   I no longer play with my kids or go for bike rides,  no more camping trips, no more drives downtown to the river.   No more restaurants for dinner.    No more movies.   Nothing.   Whatever shit I fit going on I've been to er and php programs missed 2 months of work.. trying several medications.  Nothing seems to stop the onslaught besides benzo.   And barely at that.   I have xanax left over from Jan 2023 since I'm not a drug addict,   I take one every so often so I can do something with the kids.   No professionals listen to this   the lady giving me the klonopin even says I need to find something else that works asap.  Whether it be ssri   antipsycotics,, gabapentin.. literally anything but benzo.   I'm young to end up dead\n\nSorry for your struggle. Fortunately, I wound up with an angelic PCP who fully understood my mental illness, and who worked with me to find something that made life livable for me, no matter what stigma surrounded the class of drug it might be. I went through everything (SSRIs almost made me commit suicide those are just as evil and insidious as the hardest shit when they don‚Äôt work) and finally I settled on Clonazepam and Wellbutrin. That combo has helped me live a mostly normal life and I haven‚Äôt looked back.\n\nThats awesome.  Happy for you.  Yeah so far I have had the most extreme side effects from everything besides xanax or klonopin.  But the klonopin just isn't working well.\n\nNo one is doctor shopping and getting on black lists for seeking SSRIs. Please dial back the bs.\n\nHow about you dial back your holier than thou attitude and clear judgement of anyone who can‚Äôt manage anxiety using diet, exercise, and positive thoughts and a specific class of meds. This is my personal experience, you have no idea what I have been through. I never said benzos aren‚Äôt at all addictive, that they don‚Äôt have their serious pitfalls, but SSRIs can cause their own set of SERIOUS psychological side effects. Effects that I have experienced firsthand. SSRIs brought me to the darkest place I have ever been and almost cost me my life, you can either choose to believe that or not. Just because they may have worked for you or others you know does not mean they are right for everyone. Just because they are not addictive doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt be harmful in other ways/that people can‚Äôt react negatively to them. On that same note, just because some people slip into hardcore Benzo addiction doesn‚Äôt mean that others can‚Äôt possibly take them as prescribed and experience relief from them without becoming Lil Xan.¬†\n\nAnd you have no idea what I have been through. No one is holier than thou, if anything y‚Äôall seeking benzos are bc I didn‚Äôt sign off on your behavior. It‚Äôs just me and the vast majority of very well educated doctors that feel this way. And it took me 10 years to find my mix of meds, 25 years of therapy, 10 years of yoga, and most of my 44 years to learn to take better care of myself. But please, I‚Äôll GFM.\n\nYou‚Äôre right, I don‚Äôt have any idea what you‚Äôve been through, and I sure won‚Äôt be as presumptuous as to call anything you have been through ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù and discount your journey and experiences. I respect everyone‚Äôs journey. Everyone has their own. Calling anyone else‚Äôs journey, especially one that led to a road to recovery and success ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù and to ‚Äúdial it back‚Äù is holier than thou and arrogant.\n\nYour anecdotal experience to SSRIs doesn‚Äôt make them as addicting and dangerous as benzos. It‚Äôs bs to spread disinformation. The fact is that benzos are not safe and that is why they are not prescribed often. The fact is medical studies and evidence has shown that. More than a sample size of 1. SSRIs have been shown to be a safer and better acting long term med for anxiety, and your singular experience doesn‚Äôt change that.\n\nI am not telling people not to take SSRIs. I am not telling people to take benzos instead of SSRIs. I am not arguing SSRIs are a better, safer long term choice for many. I am not arguing that benzos are not addictive and can be an unsafe medication. I am not saying EVERY person will experience negative side effects from SSRIs. I am not arguing any of the clinical points you have made, I simply am sharing my experience. Benzos helped me for a decade, and continue to do so. SSRIs almost led me to commit suicide. Maybe the sample size of people who this is the case for is small, we are all chemically different, but that was my experience. That is all. Are you saying it‚Äôs dangerous and wrong to share my experience because it doesn‚Äôt line up with certain medical studies? Are the only valid human experiences those that line up with certain sample sizes of clinical studies? Is sharing my personal experience disinformation? Should I consult a panel of clinicians before sharing my journey with another human being? Is it possible that human beings other than myself also potentially have a similar experience?\n\nJust don‚Äôt have to say they are as ‚Äúinsidious and evil‚Äù as Benzos is all.\n\nWhere exactly did I say they were as addicting and dangerous as benzos? I simply said they can have negative effects on people, are not universally effective for everyone and can be harmful when those negative interactions can lead to some seriously fucked up psychological side effects for certain individuals. There‚Äôs a reason SSRIs have a black box warning on them. Takes more than a couple people‚Äôs anecdotal experience to net a black box warning.\n\nSure, kinda like cancer meds or any other meds. You weigh the pros and cons. There are a lot more cons to benzos than SSRIs, hence the majority of everyone complaining that their doctors won‚Äôt give them the only meds they want (with no medical training of any kind). And the rampant downvotes for any opinion that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúadvocate and shop doctors until you get exactly the benzos you want!‚Äù And the rampant upvotes that follow for sharing that opinion. At the end of the day, all the meds are band aids. The true cause is anxiety is treated through therapy.\n\nIm so sorry you feel this way. I been on Xanax for 15 years. I also take cymbalta. I will probably take these for the rest of my life but guess what? I don‚Äôt care because they allow me to have a semi normal life! Some of us are wired different and need these meds to live. Please find a good Dr. I‚Äôm about to try ketamine therapy and I can‚Äôt wait! Best of luck to you. Hugs.¬†\n\nWell all.the doctors here are anti benzos and specifically anti xanax.   Its rare to have a doctor keep someone on for as long as you, and a lot of stories I hear on the web of peiple being on it for so long and having to get new doctors  they end up losing the script and ruining their lives.   Let me know how ketamine goes.\n\nI am glad to hear someone on here unashamedly saying they are taking a benzo daily (as precribed) and not being shit on or villified for it. I take .25 mg of clonazepam once daily for 3 years now and I wouldn't be able to function without it, truly. My life is not good, I suffer a lot, but oh my god it is better than it was. My life is hard but before clonazepam it was truly unbearable. Relentless chronic pain and severe anxiety. My psychiatrist tried to prescribe me two a day but I refused. The lowest dose of clonazepam once a day is fine by me. If I took another pill it would just make me want to take a nap and sleep more so there would be no point anyway. I am only going to stick to this dosage, which is the lowest possible daily dose, and never increase it. Never during this whole time has my tolerance been an issue. Like I don't feel like after all this time I need to take more.\n\nThis. People who are so against Xanax probably had an addiction to it. It was literally made for panic and anxiety but were frowned upon. Does not make sense to me\n\nDid they make you try SSRI before this? They always force those on me even if I say they do not work.\n\nYes, for me, SSRIs were literally evil and even the thought of them and what they put me through makes me physically ill.\n\nI feel I could explain to them 1000 x until I‚Äôm blue in the face that I tried them and they would still want me to try more. I have to try though I am absolutely going through too much and I‚Äôm one more thing away from a mental meltdown disaster. Wonder if I told them all I‚Äôve went through if they would be more open to prescribing them.\n\nIf you are in that bad of a place, benzos will be your worst enemy. They aren‚Äôt to be taken if you have chronic daily anxiety. You can look at some of my other comments here about my experience which is actually the experience of many. \n\nThis is why I made the post, because benzos are simply too good to be true.\n\nAlthough I appreciate your concern when I took one that someone gave me I was myself and had not been in a very long time. I was on them for a few years and took myself off them. So it is definitely what I need. I was put on them after my mom passed. It‚Äôs not daily. It‚Äôs just becoming less manageable so it‚Äôs manifesting daily now at this point. \n\nI do not respond well to ssris. Hell looking at the fact my dad was put on them and ended his life on them should tell you genetically it‚Äôs not good. \n\nI think much of my circumstances warrant being on them for now. I lost my dad, had a baby, lost my stepmom, and now going through a break up in the span of 2 years.\n\nI agree. I‚Äôve tried 6 SSRIs and I can honestly say that all they did was take away precious time and leave me worse off with sexual issues\n\nBut like, if your doctor says no, there‚Äôs definitely a reason, Man. I‚Äôm so over this sub telling people to doctor shop until they get it (drug seeking), or get it off the street. This ISN‚ÄôT the medical community getting together and deciding to fuck you over for fun. And I‚Äôm sure the people who took quaaludes also thought that nothing would ever make them feel more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù too and were bummed when they had to take benzos.\n\nThey both affect the GABA receptors and the withdrawals are similar to each other and they can both end a life if stopped abruptly after being psychically dependent on a large dose which is kinda rare so there a lot of similarities.\n\nIt really should be one of the last things you try for anxiety after working out and eating right and tryna make a change but for sure it helps some people while others need to change the benzos when start experiencing tolerance withdrawals but there are many benzos out there and switching between them when this happens is possible and it's good thing we have them around.\n\nGoing through moderate to severe withdrawal from benzodiazepines can also be an effective way of learning to handle anxiety since it gets several times worse than any anxiety the brain is capable of producing on its own as the withdrawals are sometimes difficult to put into words but it's fucking horrible yeah\n\nWhy do doctors always want to give Xanax instead of Valium or klonopin when Xanax is so heavy and short lived???\n\nFor someone who‚Äôs never taken those anxiety pills before, how do you think they have helped you in your career exactly? Do you also take anti depressants or ADHD pills? I didn‚Äôt think anxiety pills would help someone accelerate in most careers‚Ä¶\n\nIt made me able to speak to other human beings without having a panic attack. I went from not being able to leave my house (never mind getting through a fucking job interview) to handling 500 ticket lunch services. I developed soft skills, customer service skills, and management skills. it unlocked the potential that was lying just below my crippling panic disorder, it allowed me to become the person I truly am, and rip the control of my life into my hands and away from the anxiety, which controlled every single aspect of my life prior. It removed the barrier of entry to life, which for me was an anxiety/panic disorder so bad that I could not function. How I feel on my Clonazepam regimen is how I imagine the average person feels completely clear of any substance. How I felt without it was a sick individual who could barely grocery shop. They didn‚Äôt help me in my career, they ENABLED me to actually have a career. Edit: I take Wellbutrin for depression, but anxiety was always and still is my #1 demon/issue\n\nSo interesting. Do you think something caused the panic attacks? Or just something you‚Äôre born with? And even if so, does it just happen randomly or do you think there are triggers?\n\nMy anxiety disorders have defeated every other option my psychiatrists have thrown at them over the years, so I have a 2x/d prescription for Xanax. I'm actually taking less than I did 13 or so years ago despite being on either Xanax or Ativan for most of that time. I'm not psychologically addicted (I get trusted with 60-90 pills at a time). If I don't take it, the anxiety just comes back. No extra side effects from withdrawals. \n\nDo I think a long term prescription like mine should be the first treatment tried? No. Do I think everyone gets addicted? Also no. And do I think there are alternatives out there for everyone? Well, if there were one out there for me I think we would have found it.\n\nDizziness started in mid November 2021, went to Canberra on the 10th of December and I had my first near faint experience followed by high heart beat and palpitation. \n\nDizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of December when I nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate: went to hospital. They did blood work and ecg couldn‚Äôt find a probable cause. Went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident. Upon my 3rd visit to hospital X-ray was done off my chest and nothing was found. I was bedridden for 6 weeks, everyday was a battle for life, I felt like I was in septic shock everyday. I had to get iv fluids about 10 times because of dehydration, I sweated constantly with no appetite for water or food.\n\nI believe my anxiety is chronic, it‚Äôs Been with me since a young age I just didn‚Äôt realise until it became severe. I do worry about everyday situation too much when I think about it now and believe things that aren‚Äôt even real. I got sick around November, one day I just woke up and I was dizzy and brain foggy. It was persistent and didn‚Äôt go away, over the next month it got worse until I got to a point I couldn‚Äôt breathe and got hospitalised. All tests came back negative and they sent me home. This was a on going cycle 6 times in and out of hospital, nothing was helping. So I went to my gp and she said it‚Äôs most likely anxiety. After this point I think I broke the anxiety inducing cycle. Even though my worries and trauma are past the physical and cognitive symptoms are still here or at least in my subconscious. My trauma last year was my business got burnt down by our competition and my now wife which was a fianc√© back at the same time the store burnt in which I had trust issues with. My parents had told me she‚Äôs probably using me to gain citizenship etc, so I was always worried about this and thought she might not love me. So I believe these 2 events were too great for me.\n\n\nNow medications \n\nLexapro 40mg for 6 months, no benefits. Made me really bad during the first 2 weeks and kinda of settled after that, dumbed the depressive symptoms but that‚Äôs about it. Felt much better after coming off, it definitely made my condition worse. Derealisation, fatigue, tiredness, forgetfulness. All of it.\n\nZoloft 50mg for 18 days and 100mg for 3 days, had a panic attack on day 3 I thought it was Zoloft but found it to be thc later on. Discontinued Zoloft then. No benefits during the 18 days on 50mg and made my condition way worse.\n\nPaxil 20mg for 2 months, probably one of the strongest reactions to any ssri, daily panic attacks losing my mind, as if there‚Äôs a laughter in my head but it‚Äôs my internal monologue creating it but still I was losing it. Pushed on for 2 months and it just made me worse as the days went on.\n\nAgomelatine 20mg no benefits, daily panic attacks, took it for about 36 days.\n\nPristiq, I‚Äôm on day 54 and I‚Äôve stopped taking it, my last dose was on Wednesday not sure how to stop. It‚Äôs making me worse, mood is swinging, brain fog and all other symptoms are reappearing on this medication.\n\nClonidine didn‚Äôt do much except relax my body alittle\n\nLyrica, knocked me out at 25mg and made me tired. No benefits.\n\nValium 5mg, very small relief, short benefits 3-5 hours, more of a muscle relaxant, addictive in nature.\n\nClonezapam 1mg, small amount of relief, short relief 3-5 hours. \n\nXanax 2mg, haven‚Äôt tried \n\nAtivan 1mg only have tried 0.5mg and it didn‚Äôt do much.\n\nSeroquel 25mg, good for sleep, couldn‚Äôt sleep for more then 4 hours for the last 5 years or so, now I get a solid 8 hours, it‚Äôs not a 100% good quality sleep but it gets the job done, I don‚Äôt feel tired through the day as before I got sick.\n\nEpilim haven‚Äôt tried chickenend out\n\nLamictal discontinued on day 3 after developing rash\n\nLithium 500mg, 37 days. Left like losing my mind not sure if adverse reaction to the lithium or it was some kind of discontinuation I was getting from the lexapro. \n\nProzac 4 days to bridge off lexapro \n\n\nThc/cbd oil, made me go full panic mode for 4 hours each time I tried it. Very similar to what I was feeling with the Paxil minus the laughter side effect. \n\nSymptoms \n\nDizziness \nBurning tongue\nHeadache\nNausea \nMetallic taste in mouth\nHot flushes \nMuscle pain and tension\nFatigue \nNumbness in hands\nPins and needles\nBrain fog\nStartled easily\nBlood pressure problems \nHeart feeling heavy\nFast heart beat \nFeel like I‚Äôm dying\nLosing my mind\nLosing control\nVery negative thoughts \nIntrusive thoughts \nHyper reactive \nBlurry vision \nCold palms and feet\nSweaty palms and feet\nHot flushes \nFeeling sick / flu like\nWeak limbs\nDigestion problems \nNumbness\nNightmares \n\nCurrently my biggest challenges are\n\nI think I‚Äôm developing schizophrenia all the time, and I‚Äôm going to lose my mind.\n\nI‚Äôm hyper vigilant and see things in the corners of my eye.\n\nMy physical symptoms cycle throughout the weeks and I‚Äôm never symptomsless. Physical or cognitive I always feel something.\n\nMy mind always feels like as if something is off,\n\nAs my overall condition gets worse my brain fogs becomes really bad and my hands and feet become so cold to the touch, \n\nI become very forgetful\n\nI can never stop thinking about my condition, my mind is occupied by it 24/7\n\nWhen I go into crowded areas my physical symptoms become much worse, such as brain fog heart rate and jelly legs.\n\nMy internal monologue never shuts up and it‚Äôs always active.\n\nRacing thoughts\n\nLightheaded, feel like my neck muscles are so tense that my brain isn‚Äôt getting enough blood.\n\nI‚Äôm hyper focused on all bodily functions physical or Cognitive, if I suspect something that is schizophrenic or damaging I get a mini panic attack. But panic attack do occur for no reason as well most of the times.\n\nI‚Äôm in this state constantly let‚Äôs say chronically,\n\nWhen my condition worsens and it‚Äôs at full flip, no amount of logic can override my thought process, I just believe I‚Äôm dying because the physical sensations are just toooo strong that I want to jump out of my skin. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it but it‚Äôs a weird feeling. Agitated state, dizzy, wobbly, can‚Äôt focus etc.\n\nMental illness problems are prevalent in my family,\n\nI‚Äôve done all the physical body checkups before the anxiety diagnosis. Everything check out well physically.\n\nYou cycle off of meds way too fast. It takes months to even begin to see the benefits of most SSRIs like Zoloft or Lexapro. The anxiety ramps up in the beginning, but until you‚Äôre willing to push past that discomfort you‚Äôll have no idea if the meds will work or not.\n\nI agree that you should be trying each med for at least 8 weeks and you should be communicating consistently with your psychiatrist to address any side effects rather than deciding to discontinue on your own. It really can take that long to start to feel any benefit from a psych med and starting and stopping meds should be done under close doctor supervision.\n\nAlso if you‚Äôre feeling like you are constantly in crisis (which seems like a strong possibility based on your post) you might want to talk to your doctor about trying an inpatient program or a daily outpatient program so that you can work closely with a psychiatrist on medication therapy while also doing intensive cognitive and emotional therapy.\n\nThe crisis mode comes here and there I was stuck in crisis for 30 months straight until I realised what was happening üò≠\n\nAnd increasing the dose. I think the best way to test out a med is to get on the highest tolerable dose and stay there. For example zoloft. Almost everyone is on 50 mg. Shouldn‚Äôt be going up to 100 until 50 mg has been given the proper amount of time which is 4 months. Why quit after going to 100 and getting a panic attack instead of going back down to the dose you were tolerating? 40 mg of lexapro is SO MUCH. More medicine doesn‚Äôt mean better results. Get on a tolerable dose or the average therapeutic dose and stay there and something will work.\n\nThankfully I‚Äôve been on clomipramine for 6 months now and it has helped by about 50%, I was on a benzo for 6 months as well and that helped a further 20%. But now I‚Äôm off the benzo I‚Äôm back down to 50%.\n\nYeah I mean I've been on approximately 30 psych meds despite the fact that a rare but severe side effect barred me from taking any SSRIs early on. I've been on high doses of up to 6 medications at a time, medicated to the point that they threw in Ritalin to try to get me moving again. \n\nI have no health anxiety because I'm unbothered by the possibility of dying (I have severe MDD, which in the past included psychotic symptoms). I have actually had several of the physical health conditions that worry people here, and I was unbothered enough then that doctors asked if I had already been notified. \n\nIf you take me off benzos and I don't self-medicate, I have a panic attack when I wake up and will just cycle through them until you put me back on Xanax or Ativan. Klonopin does nothing for me. This was the case when they first put me on Xanax after watching me cycle into panic attacks for 2 months. It's still the case now.\n\nFull meds atm: .5 Xanax 2x/d, trazodone at night to try to get me to sleep (and because no one wants to just prescribe scheduled Xanax), ketamine infusions every 6 weeks, not covered by insurance.\n\nDiagnosed as having childhood onset of all my disorders (approximately age 5) + autism. Am currently described as \"highly dissociative.\"\n\nDoes ketamine help buddy? I feel like I‚Äôm the same as you. High functioning and unresponsive to meds.\n\nI‚Äôve tried, clonezapam, Ativan, Valium and Clobazam. And only clonezapam helps very little. I haven‚Äôt tried Xanax yet.\n\nThe ketamine helps more than anything else has, definitely a noticeable difference to me and my therapist, but I definitely need the Xanax (and to be honest probably edibles) for about a week after an infusion. Like usually I will try to skip a benzo here or there. The week after an infusion I'm taking it exactly as prescribed. \n\nI haven't tried microdosing because I'm a public employee and stick to things I get through legal means.\n\nEdibles as in cannabis? Thc makes me lose my mind.\n\nSometimes, but sometimes just CBD. I'm lucky that I tolerate indica strains well, though.\n\nFor me i immediately ran into the issue of building tollerance when I started taking klonopin everyday. In fact tolerance even built when I was just taking it once a week. \n\nIt‚Äôs pretty baffling that you‚Äôre able to stay at the exact same dose and have it still work for all these years. When I stayed at the same dose after a while it literally felt as if I didn‚Äôt take anything, I could take it and have severe anxiety and panic attacks and all the rest.\n\nYeah I consider myself lucky. I will say that the pill initially knocked me on my ass 13 or so years ago in a way it doesn't now. But I haven't developed enough of a tolerance to need to ask for an increased dosage. Soon maybe but not yet.\n\nI don't know how much of that is because I periodically ask to switch from Xanax to an equivalent dose of Ativan. Both work, so I don't care about which I'm on. It may also be because I'm supposed to take it before I'm actively in a panic attack. I could see it needing to be stronger to stop a panic attack than it does to help prevent one from starting.\n\nKlonopin always felt like I was just taking a sugar pill. We tried it first, and it just does nothing for me.\n\nDo you wear glasses? Contacts? Wear clothes? Shoes? Those are all necessary modifications to our natural state. Same with our brain chemistry. Sometimes it needs mods.\n\nThis, 100%. \n\nAre you taking anything other than Xanax to manage the anxiety? I was on Lexapro for awhile but recently switched to Zoloft and it does a MUCH better job at managing the anxiety. \n\nAs long as you're taking the Xanax in the prescribed dosage and at the prescribed limits you should be fine. Your brain is an organ and, just like any other organ, it can get sick and need medical attention.\n\nI just started taking Zoloft too, which has taken away my anxiety. I‚Äôve been on klonopin for about ten years.  No lie, when I take klonopin now, it just puts me to sleep. It doesn‚Äôt do anything for anxiety. And it‚Äôs only 1mg. What do you think this means?\n\nDid you experience bad side effects when starting? I was prescribed 25mg but I can‚Äôt get myself to take them. I cannot imagine my anxiety getting worse.\n\nMy anxiety never got worse, it improved. However my motivation is gone and I don‚Äôt care about anything. And I‚Äôm tired all the time. I‚Äôm tapering off Zoloft now too lol\n\n&gt; klonopin\n\nI'm honestly not familiar with that medication so I really can't speak for why it's acting different. \n\nWhat I WILL say is now that you're on an SSRI I'd talk with your doctor about other medications that affect your brain. I find that if I take melatonin for an extended period I'll start having brain zaps; the same holds true for THC gummies; I took two 2.5mg gummies one night and had two days of zaps following.\n\nI wish it was that simple.\n\nI have severe anxiety every single day for many years now. \n\nWhen I take a benzo it does feel like I finally fixed my brain, but it‚Äôs like an evil tease. Dependence and withdrawl are 100% going to happen to someone like myself if I take them everyday.\n\nLike I said in my post, I had klonopin prescribed almost 6 years, and taking it once every couple weeks wasn‚Äôt doing anything for me, I NEEDED it daily. I still NEED it daily. But I CANT take it daily. I tried to make that work, but tolerance and dependence and subsequent withdrawal proved to me that things can be much much much worse. Benzo withdrawal is unlike anything, it‚Äôs morbid.\n\nTell your dr you‚Äôre afraid of dependence. He/she might suggest skipping or at least cutting your dose every now and then.\n\nXanax is the only thing that makes me feel normal but it ruined my life for a few years worse then my regular panic and anxiety by taking it as prescribed daily as my doctor said to do. \nNow that I've been off it and on Prozac I only have to take benzos once or twice a month if that and now I can say this is how benzo should be used.\n\nWhat mg amounts did you take daily?\n\nShe had me on 1mg 2 times a day extended released\n\nI take .5 and I pass out.\n\nYeah, I feel it. I had years of being mostly okay, actually progressing through life. Then they stopped prescribing xanax. \n\nMy life has been in a spiral since. I've tried so many other things, none of them work.\n\nIf the Xanax worked for you and you didn‚Äôt build tolerance why did you get off it?\n\nMy doctor retired and closed their practice and no new doctors will continue the prescription.\n\nI'm currently tapering off Valium from 20mg. Sucks.\n\nI take ativan when I'm spiraling. It's a miracle drug in terms of how it can just calm you and make all your anxiety disappear\n\nThey are an amazing drug, they are also a double edged sword as you've experienced. \n\nAnxiety is an extreme struggle. It is the most troubling and severe thing I've ever experienced and although I don't have panic attacks nearly as often anymore, I still feel the effects (affects? I forget my tenses.) from it and am limited in what I can do because of it and what is has in my opinion and experienced, ingrained on my subconscious mind and my nervous system. \n\nThere are things that can help. Letting time pass, changing the way you think, working out, eating healthy, making sure there are no underlying issues.. but at the end of the day, the battle I have not beat is feeling normal as you've described. I'm better yes, I have some moments and some days where I'm not worried, I have some days where I wake up just completely exhausted and drain for no apparent reason and overthink it, the list could go on and on. \n\nBenzos make that normality a reality. But, as you've said, it's more of a drug to use with extreme anxiety attacks and do be taken as little as possible due to how addicting it can be. I've never went through benzo withdrawal myself and have no plans to do it, props for getting through it. \n\nOP, rant aside, I feel as if I understand you as much as one can from an outsiders perspective. I wish I could give you the magical answer that will fix you and frankly, myself too. This shit is not for the faint hearted. It's not a good thing to experience. I still think I'm dying once or twice a day. I don't know if I'll ever escape it. But I try to make the best of what I can. I hope you can do the same. Use them as you need them, use them every once in a while to just feel normal. Don't cope with them. \n\nJust to throw this in too, I see people constantly arguing about benzos and usage on this sub. At the end of the day, it's your life. As long as you're aware of the dangers, do as you please. It's not some evil thing and you shouldn't be shamed for taking it. Just gotta be careful with it.\n\nMuch love to you and your family and I hope that things get better for you. For us, frankly. Including everyone else reading this.\n\nI really appreciate what you said. It truly is an extremely disabling struggle. In my case it‚Äôs just as disabling as other mental disabilities that aren‚Äôt mental health related, or even physical disability and disease. \n\nMy mind has created such a burden on me for so many years and affects me very deeply mentally and insomnia, and also is very physically disabling for me.\n\nIt hits every single mark. There really isn‚Äôt anything in my life or any part of me that‚Äôs not shaped and molded by anxiety and fear. \n\nSorry if the rant but I do appreciate you and your words, I hope things get better for you as well.\n\nDo you think it‚Äôs ‚Äúpopular‚Äù these days to have anxiety attacks? Is that what‚Äôs pushing the benzo market? Kinda like how it was (and still is) popular to have ADHD and take Adderall? I‚Äôve had several panic attacks myself, some REALLY REALLY bad, but only when I was using drugs + weed, or after drinking literally 7 cups of coffee during busy times at work.\n\nI just want to better understand how someone can have these extreme panic attacks so frequently that they swear in taking benzos daily in order to function. If I‚Äôm honest, it seems like drug seeking behavior than anything else. How are people surviving in the 3rd world that don‚Äôt have access to benzos? \n\nOnce again, I know I sound harsh, but i really just want to understand how these extreme panic attacks happen.\n\nAbsolutely not. It's something you can't quite understand until you I go through it yourself. Trust me, you haven't felt a bad panic attack if that's your thought process. Not to discredit how you feel at all, anxiety and panic attacks are horrible no matter how extreme they are. My entire body has gone numb. I've touched a 200+ BPM heart rate before just from an anxiety attack which is not something that should happen.\n\nI have been on the ground crying, begging my girlfriend to take me to the ER night after night after night after night. Not even Xanax could fully calm me down. Now, it's not that extreme for me anymore, but for a lot of people, that is. I got a lot of debt I had to pay off. You may call it stupid, but there's nothing more terrifying than your body feeling like the end is right now and your time is up. Your body dumps so much adrenaline that you can have limbs or your body go numb, you can pass out, anxiety can do crazy shit. \n\nKeep in mind, I'm not drinking alcohol or caffeine at this time because I can't even get out of bed or go to work. Even now I still don't. \n\nYou can portray it as drug seeking behavior and for some it might be. But for some, you need it to function. I was offered a daily prescription of Xanax by my psychiatrist due to my hospital visits and circumstances which I turned down. I did however get an emergency supply of 10 which I never got again and used them only when I had to and they were fucking lifesavers. \n\nMy point here: not everyone is seeking drugs. I'm sure there are plenty of people who are, but most of the people here don't really fit into that stereotype in my own opinion. \n\nMy second point; just because your experience was bearable or only occurred when using drugs or weed or caffiene, doesn't mean someone else's is. I have had panic attacks my whole life and I never had any issues until one day my panic attack dragged on for hours and hours. \n\nI wish I could tell you why or how they happen. I can tell you that it's almost always a mental issue. Some people have their anxiety exaggerated by a existing medical condition. I can 100% tell you if it gets bad enough, it can create nervous system dysfunction which causes all kinds of bodily sensations no one is comfortable feeling. \n\nI would give anything in the world to not have this experience. I wish I could go back and somehow avoid having the panic attack I did. It's been almost three years and I still struggle with things that people do every day. I give no fucks about people on the internet and showing off to my friends, I'm independent as one can be, I'm not in fucking high school, I am a grown ass man trying to live my life and not be tied down by anxiety. \n\nThat's my views for you, do with them what you will\n\nYou 100% right, but this is an enabling group not an anxiety group. The only acceptable answer in this group EVER is that Benzos are the only option. I joined this group to help me deal with anxiety, but all it is is a group that talks about how they can‚Äôt do anything in life without a benzo, and no doc will prescribe it, and other people telling them to doctor shop.\n\nPeople do experience extreme anxiety like your panic attacks, but the panic never stops or resolves. People in developing countries aren‚Äôt surviving without benzos. The countries with the highest suicide rates are all countries with mental health stigma and economic issues.\n\nThis is the same for me. You‚Äôre not alone!\n\nIs this the best place to find people to talk to , in real time,  about our shared anxiety stuff? If there is a better and more straightforward place could someone give me directions?\n\nIt‚Äôs really hard to be heard. I think Reddit is a wonderful source of information and support that is unlike anything else. Instead of googling and looking at BS articles willed with ads or academic papers, you actually get to hear people‚Äôs stories and what has and hasn‚Äôt worked for them. \n\nYes some subs or more defeatist than others, but there‚Äôs literally hundreds of thousands on this sub, and I‚Äôve seen some great info and advice\n\nNo. This group ONLY talks about how to get Xanex and how no one will prescribe it. If you offer the suggestions of mindfulness, therapy, etc, you will be downvoted and told you don‚Äôt really have anxiety.\n\nSame. Doc put me on a benzo and I finally understood how bad and debilitating my anxiety was. Honestly had no idea. Also, never understood people taking drugs recreationally until then. Boy, I get it now.\n\nFirst time I got a Benzo was in 2020 when I was 14. I had starved myself due to my anxiety constantly being at 100/10 and they just gave me it. Passed right out and slept the best sleep I‚Äôve ever had. Woke up and went back to being anxious, but they had made my hospital room comfortable and started me on Prozac while I was asleep. Used a feeding tube for both I think‚Ä¶or maybe it was an IV? Can‚Äôt remember honestly everything from then is foggy\n\nHas prozac helped?\n\nTo a degree? I‚Äôve been on it for the past 4 years and I‚Äôm definitely doing better, but still have instances of extreme panic attacks and anxiety attacks. Currently in 50mg and able to live a relatively normal life. It‚Äôs helped me be able to leave my house and take my dog on adventures away from my home in the car.\n\nXanax brought me worse panic attacks without taking a pill and got addicted.\n\nDecent sleep schedule, healthy diet, good hindration and SSRIs later Brintellix brought me peace.\n\nBenzos are dangerous.\n\nEveryone is different. SSRIs (and other antidepressants) destroyed my previously decent sleep, gave me terrible indigestion and diarrhoea despite my perfect (according to my nutritionist) diet, made me so drowsy and discoordinated that I had to give up nearly all sport, and made my anxiety so much worse that I lost much of my social life and work opportunities. I was too nauseous to travel in a car and at times had vivid and terrifying hallucinations. I missed so much work that a competent boss would surely have fired me. I was always well hydrated.\n\nLooking back at those years, what shocked me most is how much faith doctors had in the safety of these drugs. When I started a medication and my symptoms instantly became worse, they simply could not comprehend the connection and responded by increasing the dose or adding in more. They never considered that I could be experiencing side effects, despite these exact effects being listed on the packet. I was so physically ill and desperate, that in the end I decided to taper myself off everything. Even despite the crippling withdrawal effects, I instantly began recovering. All the symptoms of my 'psychotic depression' and 'bipolar disorder' disappeared in a matter of weeks. I never had a single hallucination or paranoid delusion before SSRIs and have never had one since I stopped. I still have the moderate anxiety I had before I started, and also now lasting tinnitus.\n\nThe reason I share this isn't to scare you. I'm glad you are having a good experience, and I have friends who have nothing but good things to share about the benefits that their antidepressant has brought them. But whereas doctors now realise the dangers of benzodiazepines, there is conversely a huge amount of denial about how dangerous antidepressants and antipsychotics can also be. I think it is important that people are more aware of side effects like these, so that if they start to experience them then they can take action early to avoid them getting worse.\n\nI think what you have shared is important. I‚Äôve tried my best to stay off any meds, and I honestly have been forced to find better coping methods that have helped.\n\nThis exactly. I've had miserable experiences on SSRIS and just took myself off a SNRI because I was so much worse and it was causing hallucinations and all I got was \"see, now we know you're bipolar, let's try a different one.\" I don't know how these are prescribed so carelessly but right now I'm being denied benzos after years of taking a low dose as needed that never created a withdrawal.\n\nFWIW Brintellix isn‚Äôt an SSRI, it‚Äôs a SMS. They are similar but different.\n\nI have a prescription for .5 mg Ativan and it's one of the only things that can make me feel normal. I wish it was something I could take every day and that its effects lasted more than 3-4 hours.\n\nDiazepam was saving my life until the twat took me off them because 'they're addictive' \nYes mate because they fucking work so much, I wasn't even taking more than I should\nHappily have me on pregabalin half my life and every anti depression and a good choice of anti psychotics. Try coming off and of them and tell me they aren't addictive you knob üò†\n\nPregabalin was the hardest thing I've stopped. Still not normal 5 years since stopping. I wasn't normal before tbf. But this feels worse. \n\nI've used benzos with less issues. A valium still feels potent after several days of daily use. A lyrica pill feels half as effective the next day you take it. The tolerance build up is insane.\n\nFelt this.\n\nI was just prescribed Xanax a few weeks ago and I feel the same. It‚Äôs only PRN but I think I may need to be on some kind of benzo regularly. When my heart started racing and I was grinding my teeth again I took one, and that was the most normal I‚Äôd felt in at least a year. I didn‚Äôt feel locked up like I couldn‚Äôt do anything. I actually got cleaning and laundry done and messaged some old friends.\n\nBenzos are the only thing along with a decent ssri that works .\n\nBenzos had a rebound effect and made my anxiety 10x worse when I wasn‚Äôt on one. Felt amazing while on them, but I‚Äôm afraid to touch them again.\n\nBenzos are a very slippery slope for people with chronic daily long term anxiety. Unfortunately for us we are forced to find something that doesn‚Äôt cause dependence. Once you‚Äôre dependent and no amount of it works anymore you have to withdrawl which words can‚Äôt even describe how bad it is\n\nSame, I had a psychiatric crisis recently and had to start taking them again. It just sucks how effective they are knowing how bad they're for your health. I take ashwagandha, magnesium bisglycinate, try to control my meals, relying on more natural stuff. It works, but sadly when i'm on crisis just a benzo hits, I've been trying lots of different medications and nope :/ I know it has to do with my autism and ptsd but wish my nervous system was regulated for once and for all.\n\nI can say to give you some reassurance that I‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety for about 20 years now. Diagnosed for upwards of 15 years now with generalized anxiety disorder, and I‚Äôve been using CBD dominant marijuana products and I can say with just my basic mood stabilizer and no anxiety meds until night time unless it‚Äôs a propranolol, that I‚Äôm genuinely slowly but surely improving and I highly recommend it. High thc isn‚Äôt the best for people in our position so I suggest little to none. Consumable thc seems to be a lot more calming if you must take a high thc route. But it seems you are  well seasoned anxiety sufferer as well as myself. We are at the point in our lives where all we can do is try different things. Don‚Äôt shame yourself and say that feeling normal is too good to be true. That‚Äôs unfair and simply just untrue. Don‚Äôt take the brighter side away from yourself. A medicine just helps you along the way there. Don‚Äôt over use. As I can tell you know very well it only leads to hell. You were strong and withdrew on your own. I was forced to in a prison cell. Even still I also go back to them here and there just for help. And you will not immediately become dependent on it unless you force it. Just take a benzo if you feel you must, only when you absolutely feel you must and still try alternatives. Take my words with a grain of salt because we all have opinions and personal experiences. But if you‚Äôve yet to try it, I suggest mixing some higher CBD intake into your medicinal regimen just to see what it does for you. There is hope for us. All will be well my friend don‚Äôt put yourself down so much just because something made you feel better. You‚Äôre allowed to feel that way. Just don‚Äôt tell yourself a benzo or a strong anxiety med is the only way. There‚Äôs always another route in life. You‚Äôre on your way there my dude keep your head high. You‚Äôve pushed on for this long and that speaks to the amount of strength you truly have within you.\n\nI forgot to clarify that my CBD usage in this volume is very recent over the past few weeks or so. But improvement is showing slowly but surely. I hope you may have some access to such things and can give it a try and stick with it for a few weeks or so. Give yourself the time you deserve to feel better.\n\nNo matter what you may or may not try, I hope you find the peace you deserve. Don‚Äôt tell yourself it only exists within a pill. But don‚Äôt beat yourself down when you feel that pill is all you‚Äôve got at the time. Do what you must to find your happiness. Wishing the best for you my friend.\n\nI appreciate your words. I hope things work out for me and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve find little things to help you. Cheers\n\nI‚Äôve done many trials of CBD over the years. I got supposedly the best strains from the best extracts. I‚Äôve done tinctures, gummies, joints, and most recently a few weeks ago I got a cartridge. It is an 18:1 ratio. I did it a couple times and didn‚Äôt feel much, but then tried again and had really bad anxiety, my heart rate was 150. Havent touched it since\n\nYeah just spent a fortune on medical cbd oil (full spectrum trace elements of thc) and even the smallest dose causes anxiety. Useless for me. Feels like smoking weed which I've never enjoyed.\n\nI take a benzo, and likely always will. It relieves anxiety and panic attacks. Like you, I feel pretty normal. It‚Äôs great to feel average again.\n\nThe problem was when I took it often it got to the point where it didn‚Äôt even have an effect due to tollerance. Even very high doses, the doc wasn‚Äôt willing to presence more\n\nSorry to hear that. I‚Äôve been on the same dose for four years. I‚Äôm not having an issue with tolerance, though I do feel it when I miss a dose. My body is on more high alert, so to speak. \n\nI get that the drug is strong, and people abuse it. That is a lousy reason to refuse it to treat a person whom it helps.\n\nBuilding tolerance must be frustrating, and I‚Äôm sorry you have had that experience.\n\nIf I may ask, how many mg you take a day?\n\n1\n\nNo side effects? Like addiction? Or struggling with withdrawal? Or anxiety worsening when you're not using?\n\nDid you read through the post? You should check out my other comments on this thread.\n\nYes to everything you said, that‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt ever be able to take them. I took one yesterday, but that‚Äôs it\n\nI know what you mean. For me it takes pristiq and seroquel combo to get that effect and it works so well\n\nSo on that combo you can go an socialize and be yourself? Or does it help more for other kinds of anxiety?\n\nYeah it took a minute to get the dosage correct and I‚Äôve had to up antidepressants a couple times but I cope a lot better now with those things\n\nI have taken low dose seroquel in the past for sleep but I‚Äôm curious what dose you take for anxiety.\n\nI take it to manage my ptsd symptoms which includes anxiety. 75mg at night\n\nA small group of folks in this sub (and most of them have never even tried benzos) give them a bad name. They read a few bad things about them and they act as if EVERYONE will experience the issues.\n\nThe reason they're one of the most prescribed medications for anxiety is because..... they work the best. They help millions of people with anxiety live better lives. If they didn't work so well, doctors would have stopped prescribing them long ago.\n\nIt's sad how often we see posts like this, about how benzos have changed someone's life. Because it's so much more common than this sub makes it out to be. But the \"Benzos are bad\" folks are much more vocal, despite most of them having no experience with them.\n\nEnd of the day, you don't know if they'll work for you if you don't try them. Yes, some people may experience some side effects. Of those, most are minor. But for most, these medications can be a huge help and can even be completely life changing. Please recognize that not everyone has the same experience. Some people have horrid experiences with chemo. But imagine telling someone not to treat their cancer with chemo because you read about a couple people that had bad experiences. Don't turn people off to something before they have the chance to try it themselves and form their own opinions.\n\nIt‚Äôs fake though. That‚Äôs the problem. They tease you with what it would be like to feel better. Many drugs do this. For someone in pain, an opiate makes them feel normal, but it‚Äôs a tease. \n\nBenzos were literally not worth it in my case as someone who has chronic long term daily anxiety. \n\nThe way it went for me and many others is like this. I have anxiety every single day, I never get a day off. So for me, I would need it everyday. But when I took it everyday (when I was prescribed klonopin) the same dose becomes less effective to the point where it isn‚Äôt effective AT ALL so I‚Äôm forced to go up in dose. And this keeps happening again and again. And then you realize that even if you take one or two days off you start withdrawing. \n\nSo now the drug has taken away your free will. You are dependent on it. Towards the end of when I had it I was taking 7 sometimes 8 pills a day. It gets to the point where my doctor isn‚Äôt willing to prescribe more. So inevitably I have to get off of it. \n\nNow the real torment starts. Benzo withdrawal is something words can‚Äôt even describe. The misery is unlike any other. And often times the post withdrawal symptoms will stay with people for years. \n\nNow if we are talking about people who only take them once or twice a year for a plane flight that‚Äôs absolutely fine, no issue whatsoever.\n\nBut a lot of people here are like me, they have anxiety ever single day, not just when flying on planes.\n\nAgain, you're taking a single situation, your own response, and thinking it's how everyone has it. Which isn't true. Again, there's a reason they're so much prescribed. Because they work for most everyone. It's only a small number of folks they are an issue for.\n\nVery sorry they didn't work for you. That sucks. But the true reality is that they work for most and make a massive difference, which is why they're the most frequently prescribed.\n\nAgain, sorry they weren't right for you. For most, they are.\n\nThanks for the downvote, I literally addressed that exact thing in my comment. \n\nI specifically said for people with chronic long term daily anxiety that would need them daily.\n\n\nIf you are using it once in a while for a plane flight you‚Äôre fine. Obviously there are other use cases. But for people like myself who would need them daily, it‚Äôs very dangerous\n\nAtivan has literally saved my life, and my job.\n\nYou take it everyday? If so what about tollerance\n\nMy doc did something nice lol, he prescribed me a pack of 30 pills and he told me that until the end of 2025 he won't prescribe me anymore, he told me to only take them when I'm having a panic attack, I do have GAD but it's nothing severe, the prozac im taking should cover it, but once or twice every month I get these random panic attacks, chest tightness, short of breath, etc etc, that's the only instance he told me to take them on, when Im like that \n\n\nI think if you follow your doctor's instructions you should be fine, and I really like the \"use when necessary attitude\" \n\nNow, as for docs that prescribe them for long term use, say 2 months or something, ermmm , idk about that, it's a risky slope, but I guess if everything else has been tried, including all shorts of antidepressants then it's ok too\n\nHey, I messaged you. I‚Äôve also tried all meds under the sun. Can you give me a hand.\n\nI‚Äôve tried a few benzos and non really work,\n\nAgreed. For me Ativan is the only thing that takes it away and makes me feel normal. What I don‚Äôt get is obviously there is a specific chemical or whatever that it ‚Äúturns off‚Äù so to speak. So, nobody can invent someone else that targets that chemical?  Nobody??\n\nExactly. It probably is that simple, but we aren‚Äôt advanced enough medically or technologically to do what you‚Äôre suggesting. We haven‚Äôt found a workaround for tollleracne and dependence\n\nI can‚Äôt go back üò≠\n\nI had a very similar experience the first time I took a benzo. Had never taken any anxiety meds before that because I was too scared of side effects, the anxiety was so bad I literally couldn‚Äôt take them. Ended up going to the ER because I was up for 4 days straight and started to lose my mind. They gave me an Ativan and sent me on my way with a ‚Äúplease take your SSRI.‚Äù\n\nIt was like the lights finally came on. I felt so free, so light, I couldn‚Äôt stop giggling. I realized this is what life could feel like if my brain wasn‚Äôt so screwed up and I wasn‚Äôt traumatized so bad from my abusive parents.\n\nThat was about a decade ago. I‚Äôve never felt that way again, but overall I‚Äôm on the right track I think. Still have a Klonopin prescription for panic attacks which I only use as a last resort because I do not want to get addicted and have them stop working as well.\n\nIve tried so many medications and found some that help but aren‚Äôt perfect. I‚Äôve discovered that SSRIs don‚Äôt work for me and my provider has been great at thinking outside the box and trying meds off-label which has been crucial. I also got diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, and C-PTSD in December which has been life changing. I have stopped being so self-critical which has really reduced my depression and anxiety. But the biggest thing has been realizing that I was in a toxic relationship for the past decade. Currently separated from my husband and it is an incredibly difficult time in my life, but I already feel so much‚Ä¶lighter. Therapy has also been essential, finding the right provider has changed my life.\n\nMedication is absolutely essential for some of us. I know in my bones that I will likely always be medicated, and that‚Äôs okay. It can be such a hard journey of trial and error. I also think taking a step back and looking at our lives, as uncomfortable as it is, and seeing what isn‚Äôt serving us or making our mental health worse, is so important.\n\nI‚Äôve been using 0.5mg of Clonazepam for years. Thankfully, it still works well. \n\nFor some people they have to increase the dosage or go off the meds because the meds lose their effectiveness. \n\nI‚Äôm lucky in this regard. Maybe it‚Äôs genetics, me taking the amount told, being a smaller guy, etc. IDK.\n\nLonger acting benzos are better. Xanax only works 2-3 hours. Then the effects wear off.\n\nWhen I was prescribed kpin I was one that grew tollerance, it got to the point where even 3.5 mg made me feel nothing at all, my anxiety was just the same\n\nIt just hit me that my recent decline started when my psychiatrist moved an hour away and I stopped seeing him so no longer had my lorazepam prescribed. I went from almost normal human being to afraid to be home alone or leave the house. My pcp won‚Äôt prescribe and neither will web md. I‚Äôm now on the search for a new psych.\n\nI can relate to this, but my doctors won‚Äôt even mention it as an option. Literally the only thing that really calms me down and slows me down. I‚Äôm so anxious no matter what I‚Äôm doing I‚Äôm moving 100 mph even just normal stuff like brushing my teeth or taking a shower. When I converse with people I can tell they think I‚Äôm trying to hurry and end conversation. I can‚Äôt just chill at all and it sucks\n\nHave you been tested for ADHD? Sounds a lot like it\n\nYes when I was younger, I deal a lot of paranoia and I have been diagnosed with ptsd. I never was really like this until a while after my anxiety really started taking over\n\nGod I would love to try a pill like that. I just want to know what it‚Äôs like to experience normalcy. I don‚Äôt want to experience a pit in my stomach at all times. Just once. I wish I knew someone with one that I could try without having to jump through the hoops with doctors. I have severe anxiety and just live my life faking it til I make it and it works some of the time but oh my god. I just want to feel normal at least once. And nobody even knows how much I struggle because I am so high functioning everyone thinks I‚Äôm just a normal human being. Little do they know.\n\nI know how you feel and that was exactly how I felt when I started taking them after being diagnosed with GAD and Panic. Fast forward over a decade later and it was the worst decision I ever made. They eventually stop working and your anxiety returns worse than where it was.\n\nI'm tapering right now and it is a horrific experience. Go over to /r/benzorecovery and read the horror stories. Your anxiety will be the least of your worries if you have to experience this but I wouldn't wish that on anyone. There's no magic pill for anxiety. Please stay away from benzos.\n\nHi my friend I‚Äôm sorry you going through this. Did you get daily prescription? This is awful:(\n\nBenzos don‚Äôt even work for me anymore and they‚Äôre trying to cut my prescription\n\nWeed does this for me. No shame in drugs.\n\nThis story is exactly how I was for years before addressing my gut microbiome. Working on my gut with probiotics genuinely made me feel like I was on benzos all the time in terms of my anxiety levels, without any of the drawbacks that come with them.\n\nSame here. It‚Äôs sad to know how your life could be so different if your brain wasn‚Äôt so over active. Benzos will eventually stop working for most people and lead to an increasing problem. I don‚Äôt know how people are prescribed for long periods of time without developing a tolerance to where it does nothing. That always happens to me after taking it consistently for anymore than like a month\n\nHave you tried pregabalin? It has 90% cured me.\n\nWhat ssris/snris have you tried? \n\nI feel you on this though. So many doctors look at you like an addict when you take benzos but I truly think if they experienced an anxiety disorder themselves they would look at it much differently. We‚Äôre not taking them for fun. We‚Äôre taking them to feel human which is a sad experience in itself. I‚Äôd love to wake up and go about my day like a normal person and never take a benzo again.\n\nWhat do you think triggers your anxiety and panic attacks? Have you used drugs in the past or present? I‚Äôm really curious to learn more about this.\n\nI‚Äôve been tested for anxiety, depression, and ADHD and I‚Äôve tested at some level of positivity for each, but I‚Äôve only been able to take medication for the last 2, only because I was aware of the medication names due to their popularity. I had not become aware of benzos until maybe 6 years ago. I imagine if I talked with my psychiatrist, it could be an option as well. But then I just feel like I‚Äôm pill shopping.\n\nHow do you know it‚Äôs the anxiety that bothers you the most? What symptoms do you experience? How are they different from depression or ADHD?\n\nIntrusive thoughts trigger my anxiety. Long periods of stress (6 plus months) trigger the intrusive thoughts and anxiety. Idk though GAD is a very complex condition and really becomes a problem when you‚Äôre stuck in fight or flight for no apparent reason.\n\nThis is true. Im probably on my last prescription because it was a \"temporary\" thing and Im already at the lowest dose. But the 2 weeks I took 0.6mg daily were something else.\n\nI have some .5 clonazepam, and it definitely helps. But everyone - my prescriber, my therapist, the internet, etc - make such a big deal about getting hooked on it that I really try not to take more than one or two a week. I have to admit that taking it 2 or 3 days in a row did make me feel kind of doped and I don‚Äôt love that. I can‚Äôt deny that it works, though.\n\nHave you taken Lexapro? It worked wonders for me\n\nMy prescriber gave me hydroxyzine for anxiety and I feel like it‚Äôs kind of a joke. I end up using it more for perceived allergies that I have yet to be formally diagnosed with (incessant watery eyes and stuffy/runny nose whenever I open the windows for fresh air). \n\nThen again, probably more my fault because I have not seen my prescriber in a year so I haven‚Äôt expressed how much my anxiety has exasperated. \n\nAlso wish we could find a middle ground med for anxiety. Something that works but no withdrawals if you want to stop, etc.\n\nYeah hydroxyzine is pretty bad. I‚Äôve had a bottle of it for years. I take it sometimes for sleep.\n\nIt‚Äôs nothing like a benzo at all. I still have full blown anxiety on it and I still feel very uncomfortable in social settings. It feels like taking a Benadryl\n\nWhy would you take hydroxizine which make you feel awful and it is an anticholinergic that can affect your brain instead of a benzo?\n\nPeople with real anxiety don't get \"high\" on benzos, they just get their anxiety notched down.  I just take them twice a week and am pretty okay with that.  The other days I stumble through as I'm used to it from being born this way.  I did take them every day for 5 months to see how hard it was to get off and didn't have more withdrawal than giving up coffee.  I'm thinking very few people have real anxiety, I never knew anybody with it when I was a kid so the SSRIs and CBTs that work may work if you don't have real anxiety to begin with.\n\nYeah I don‚Äôt get high from them whatsoever. I‚Äôve known people who will take .25 mg of Xanax and completely knock out for 10 hours, or they take half a Xanax and are all over the place with no inhibition whatsoever.\n\nMy tolerance is naturally high mostly due in part to my anxiety being naturally high\n\nYes it‚Äôs different.. it works very well. I take one bill / month only on panic attack. I hope that someone create something like this without addiction or side effects üò≠\n\nI take .50mg lorazepam daily for bad morning anxiety. My doctor knows\n\n.25 - .50 lorazepam almost every morning, I wake up about 3am with bad anxiety, have to get up for work at 5:30am, doctor gave me 5 months of 30 1mg lorazepam, I cut in 1/4\n\nHave you tried Saffron? ¬†I‚Äôm experiencing a slight benzo effect on it‚Ä¶ but slight ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the first couple weeks at 88mg‚Ä¶\n\nNo I haven‚Äôt. Right now I‚Äôm trying selank a peptide. So far I don‚Äôt feel much\n\nHave to check that out‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure about Saffron yet actually‚Ä¶. hard to tell as I‚Äôm taking a lots of new supps but I can tell you¬†Lavender oil worked to reduce my anxiety like nothing else‚Ä¶. Except benzos of course‚Ä¶ they did studies on it that compare it to paxil for anxiety though not Benzos ‚Ä¶¬†\nI wish there would be a benzo imitator that doesn‚Äôt cause addiction and hell later on getting off too‚Ä¶ best I have found is Lavella but it doesn‚Äôt feel like benzo.. it feels like one day you are like ¬†‚Äúhey where is that searing unbearable anxiety‚Äù.¬†\nSaffron may feel kind of benzo-ish but not sure‚Ä¶I‚Äôm testing it now\n\nit's so soul crushing not being able to exist without anxiety so severe you feeling like vomiting constantly. when i take my xanax and i finally feel that weight come off my chest, it's the best feeling in the world. finally free from the anxiety. until a couple hours later and it all comes crashing down again and the next morning you wake up in a cold sweat from the withdrawals feeling 10x worse than before you took it. it's like whether or not i take it, i will never be able to exist peacefully. it makes me feel so hopeless. there's just no winning. i don't know what else to do.\n\nMeditation and stick at it\n\nSame. Xanax makes me feel normal. Like, I function like a normal person. Fudge this shit\n\nTry good old fashioned Mary Jane. It‚Äôs less dangerous but kind of similar in how it effects you just without some of the more extreme side effects\n\nAgreed! As someone with panic disorder and OCD and Crohn‚Äôs disease, the mix of those can definitely trigger panic attacks and the panic attacks in turn makes my Crohn‚Äôs flare. All of my doctors, including my psychiatrist, REFUSE, to give me any benzos. During a particularly bad panic attack, I was given .5 mg Xanax and it absolutely saved me. It lessens the Crohns pain from being exacerbated and it makes me not feel like I‚Äôm hopeless and the world is ending. I‚Äôve had panic attacks since then, each equally as bad, but since no one will prescribe me anything, I‚Äôm forced to ride it out. I have family members who also see psychiatrists and they‚Äôre given 14 .5mg Xanax pills every 60 days to reduce the probability of abuse. If one more doctor prescribes me hydroxyzine I‚Äôll rip my hair out. I understand that Xanax can be abused and it‚Äôs a controlled substance but fuck some people ACTUALLY need it.o\n\nYep  they are literally anti anxiety medicine.\n\nActually they are for occasional panic attacks and not at all intended for long-term use.\n\nCool\n\nTotally. That‚Äôs why doctors don‚Äôt want to prescribe them as the first line treatment. Bc therapy, good diet, exercise, sleep, hydration, and THEN meds medically approved for LONG TERM usage (which is a band aid).\n\nThere is no biological free lunch‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre alcohol in pill form. \n\nIt‚Äôs like an alcoholic saying that booze makes them feel normal.\n\nIs insulin for diabetics a biological free lunch as well then? Are glasses a sensory free lunch? Are crutches for people with cerebral palsy a physical free lunch?\n\nAtivan is the brand name for lorazepam. It is a Benzodiazepine. Be careful with those pills. Chris Cornell died from an overdose, among many others.\n\nPretty sure that‚Äôs not how Chris died. Not saying benzos are safe, but don‚Äôt think they killed Chris. I could be wrong\n\nYes, I take it, and am cautious. The recommended dosage, or less.\n\nHow can you take so many of them? That's incredibly unhealthy. Besides, no prescription will solve your life, that's something everyone should be aware of. They simply treat or alleviate symptoms.\n\nHow about therapy, exercise, a good diet, mindfulness, enough sleep? Have you tried those in conjunction with non addictive meds?\n\nDoesnt work for a lot of people. This just oversimplifies a lot the root causes of anxiety.\n\nlol, thinking a benzo is the only cure for anxiety is oversimplifying the situation. That‚Äôs why doctors push a wholistic approach and don‚Äôt prescribe benzos much anymore.\n\nActually read my post and all my other comments on this thread. Benzos aren‚Äôt an option for me. I cannot take them.\n\nI agree with this. I know there's plenty of downvotes but I agree\n\nWhat else is new? This sub has a lot of people who subscribe to the idea the ONLY treatment for their particularly worse case of anxiety over everyone else is benzos. And I couldn‚Äôt possibly understand bc I don‚Äôt really have trauma or anxiety.\n\nYep. Then once you're on benzos it's bliss for about 4 weeks until you have to come off them then the rebound anxiety hits which is even worse than the anxiety you had before you went on them. Mindfulness is a great example, works well for me. I also agree with diet. We are what we eat and that's 100% true. Eat crap, feel like crap.\n\nAnd it‚Äôs very easy when anxious to not eat right, drink enough water, sleep enough, etc. But God forbid I don‚Äôt just say, ‚Äúdoctor shop until you get EXACTLY the drug you seek.‚Äù\n\nAre you always of the mind that:\n\nbehavior‚Äî-&gt;outcome \n\nOr do you ever consider that it may also be:\n\nOutcome‚Äî-&gt;behavior\n\nI‚Äôm always of the mind to take care of my basic bodily needs first and foremost to care for my anxiety.\n\nI agree with what you‚Äôre saying, but it‚Äôs multifaceted.\n\nMy anxiety feels like, and I‚Äôve had it ever since I was a child, it feels like someone has given me a poison pill. It feels like an actual disease. I have somatoform disorders and my brain and body hold anxiety and negative emotion as severe pain in my body. I can go all into it but not going to rn.\n\nI am healthy and lean and never drink and really push myself to do things that make me uncomfortable.\n\nTo put it another way, when people talk about how they feel when they go through withdrawals of hard drugs, that is kind of my daily life. Chronically."

That‚Äôs how powerful mental illness is. \n\nThrowing medical terms and medications at someone with health anxiety encourages maladaptive behavior and thinking patterns, mainly, googling symptoms and seeking reassurance from medical professionals that you aren‚Äôt sick. By throwing out terms like syncope it just reaffirms those behaviors and thought patterns for the sufferer.\n\nI have had low blood pressure before, which is why it triggered the anxiety. I passed out 6 months ago due to low potassium/low blood pressure brought on by being dehydrated while breastfeeding with a virus. I assure you when I‚Äôm nervous my blood pressure does not get low, it typically heightens. I do appreciate the comment, though.\n\nExercise. If you can run 30 minutes, chances are you won't keel over and die during cooking. It's a good gauge of overall cardiovascular health. My mantra is if I can play 2 hours of football twice a week then my dizziness is probably not my heart.giving out.\n\nLearning to be at peace with your anxiety is the best way to move past it. We all get frustrated at times, but learning how to welcome it like an old friend and not let it change how you live your day to day life, will allow it to dissipate.\n\na lot of people say that, but how they came to that point is still beyond me...\n\nTakes practice. I had enough attacks, mostly health based, that I started to just do the cliche thing of telling myself there is absolutely nothing wrong and there never has been anything wrong and if something is wrong so suddenly this time that I die well then. I die. Just like everyone does. Now my attacks are pretty infrequent and I am able to talk myself out of it much quicker. Used to last up to 3 days sometimes but now I can sleep it off or occupy my mind in a few hours if it‚Äôs midday.\n\nAlso, I‚Äôm not here to assume anyone‚Äôs substance use but quitting alcohol completely nearly removed my health anxiety completely. Maybe make peace with some things or people you may be subconsciously hanging on to. Believe me, I‚Äôve taken myself to the ER numerous times only to end up feeling like a total dork and I told myself I couldn‚Äôt do that anymore. It‚Äôs not easy but it‚Äôs worth it to let anxiety live with you rather than locking you in your room with 3 meals at the door.\n\nthanks, this helps a lot\n\nI actively fight it which helps. Basically if I feel it coming on I will tell it to fuck off and carry on with my life anyway. I still feel anxious in the background for a bit but after a couple of hours it dissipates. \n\nThis is hard though. It takes a lot of willpower and a while to get desperate enough to say I just don‚Äôt care if these physical symptoms are real, you‚Äôre not ruining my day today, bring on the breathing, heart rate, chest pains etc. Do your worst, I‚Äôm not stopping and giving in to you. Unsurprisingly when you aren‚Äôt giving in to the physical symptoms they disappear.\n\nAs others have said, it takes a dedication and practice, but you can make good progress when you're in the worst periods of it. When my brain would not let things go and I would feel that pure terror that came with some of my intrusive thoughts, I would sit down somewhere, with my phone just watching YouTube videos or something and every time my brain threw some horrible shit at me, I'd pause the video and talk out loud to my anxiety. I'd say things like \"oh that was a good one, I like it, come on, got any more for me?\". It's not about actually enjoying the feeling, it's about signalling to your brain you're not going to let it bother you and you're not going to fight with or reason with the thoughts.\n\nIt sounds impossible and it sounds utterly bizarre at points, but I've almost entirely recovered from the worst place I've ever been with my anxiety, darker than I ever knew was possible, and I did it with acceptance. I didn't take any medication, I faced it head on with acceptance, mindfulness and meditation.\n\nTherapy. CBT mostly. Journaling your automatic negative thoughts in high stress situations and challenging them. Also Lexapro.\n\nFOR REAL!! I've had this weird throat feeling from anxiety and now my brain is like \"what if\" and I'm loosing my mind. MY STUPID BRAIN DID THIS TO ITSELF AND NOW ITS GIVING ME MORE ANXIETY?? LIKE WTF\n\nThe constant what if is the worst\n\nLike a tightness or something is stuck in it? My neck has even feeling tight like my muscles are tense! Just saying I think I understand what you‚Äôre feeling and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through it too! I‚Äôve been in freak out mode over it for over a week now¬†\n\nYeah! Sometimes I feel more of a \"tightness\", but its mostly like something is stuck in my throat. Like a \"lump\" or \"hair\" or sometimes a \"soreness\" but without other symptoms. But it SUSPICIOUSLY correlates with stress, and apparently it's a thing that can happen with anxiety. Absolute BS! &gt;:(¬†\n\nYes! Do you have seasonal allergies? I‚Äôve been told that the pollen can make it happen and then anxiety issues like I have, we just manifest the problems. It‚Äôs moving past the ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô problem I have. ¬†I hate when I get like this because then I‚Äôll just feel tired all the time, eith a headache and then an off feeling like I‚Äôm woozy or just feeling off.¬†\n\nNo seasonal allergies, but I can never discount potentially developing them. But due to it correlating with anxiety I'm willing to bet thats what it is. (Maybe a cold. The horror)¬†\nBut the what ifs are horrid!! You never feel \"safe\" until you \"figure it out\". And you can't escape the sensation! Then you get stressed and get MORE SYMPTOMS! the not knowing increases anxiety, but then googling it MAKES THE ANXIETY EVEN WORSE!\nThe fatigue, both mental and physical is real. You just get so TIRED of it.¬†\n\nthats what I've had many people tell me that I could just be having some sensitivity to the pollen and its worse than usual this year. sometimes even my ear will feel like its clogged or something too. \n\nbut yes! Thats my problem as well. I focus so much on whichever problem I'm freaking out that I cause more issues to happen. it is very tiring, ad I know it frustrates people. I keep saying to stay off google, but then I catch myself \"well I'll look one more thing up.\"\n\nHonestly, it could be pollen. It's been an especially rainy year so things are blooming more than usual. Cant discount it.¬†\nYou always think \"well, maybe this one time when I google it, I'll feel better and less anxious\". Never works out that way. Then more symptoms happen! Amazing! Why does anxiety do this to us?!\n\nThis! \nMy throat is always the body part most affected with my anxiety attacks. Been to the dr no physical issues..anxiety sucks\n\nI am a four year sufferer. Constant blood pressure taking, checking heart rate, buying health supplements, and googling symptoms. Mine got so bad I had a brain MRI only to find my brain was nice and healthy. I feel better now but realized my anxiety is deeper than just health. It is our job as the sufferers to decipher our issues and try and heal. I know we can all do it but it is going to take time and effort. Something I never tried. Good luck to you\n\nAmen. I've had the lovely combo of often *actually* having really weird or uncommon problems for my demographic (confirmed and treated by a doc, not just in my head), so it's not as easy to shoot down the anxiety about something weird/serious being wrong when occasionally it's been really right.\n\n(I read this as if Rage Against the Machine was singing it)\n\nSame here. Just found out I've been recently diagnosed and resigned from my work. Can't do on-site work anymore due to symptoms and I'm forced to do part time or remote work.\n\nFUCK IT! This damn shit called health anxiety! It can go to hell! Xoxo good bye see you never\n\nYEAA, FUCK U HEALTH ANXIETY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n[deleted]\n\nelaborate. Do you mean people need to be busy with things that hold them responsible to distract them from their obsessions?\n\nUhm. That sounds hella unhealthy.\n\nNow that's the attitude!\n\nAGREED FUCK YOU HEALTH ANXIETY\n\nAgreed!!! Fuck it so much!!!\n\nHahah\n\nYes fuck you health anxiety and fuck you Dr. Google\n\nI guess I'm hoping the SSRI brings it down to a manageable level so that I can work on myself a bit. I've been getting distressed with some deep breathing in the evenings and in the morning and at lunch. Exercising daily, etc. Fingers crossed, it will take.\n\nüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè\n\nWHAT HE SAID\n\nI wouldn't wish this on anyone had it all my life and just wish it could go. ü•∫\n\nAgree. I hate it. Fuck it. Seriously. Just fuck it.\n\nReading all your comments reminds me of Mr. Beans just flipping everything and anything off, lmao.\n \nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/workingtitlefilms-bean-mr-movie-WqQhaYyeQ92zgTmRlY\n\nHope it gives you all a laugh too, cause fuck anxiety.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nLOUDER!\n\nI‚Äôve radically accepted all possible outcomes. It‚Äôs helped me a lot.\n\nbut howwwwww?  Like folks who just accept \"if I die, I die\" or whatever acceptance looks like for you.  My brain can't compute that.  If there was a way you could stop it, wouldn't you?  Hence my stupid brain's CONSTANT VIGILANCE haha\n\nIt took practice.... Meditation and practice. I don't want to trigger you or anyone else but there is further thinking that can be done to unravel any semblance of control. Not for the faint of heart for sure. And when my health is doing worse, radical acceptance isn't a cure. But it definitely helps a lot. Learning to control my breathing has helped a ton too. But most of all, diet changes.\n\nI read in a book the phrase FEAR for cognitive behavioral therapy: Face Everything And Recover. You have to let the anxiety come full force and it will be higher at first (than if you try to avoid it or use safety seeking mechanisms) but after a while it will pass on its own. The key is to do this often so your brain and body knows there is nothing to fear and the anxiety will subside on its own in time. I used to have multiple panic attacks each day and I went 9 (!!!!) times to the ER last year (altough the first 4-5 times there was a real health emergency) but now I trained myself to wait and see if my symptoms mellow down on their own. It is very hard but I tell myself that anxiety is just like a very fine tuned alarm system and it‚Äôs my overprotective body trying to keep me safe.¬†\n\ndamn right! \n\ngetting fed up with this crap, all those ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù are pissing me off, so i‚Äôm starting to replace it with ‚Äúso what?? so whaaaat‚Äù ..then it calms down a bit üòë\n\n100% AGREE. It's become debilitating for me lately, gonna go back to psychotherapy and see if that helps. Sending hugs to everyone suffering from it!\n\nGoing to the drs for a work physical so anxious to do it but def better than before. Old me would‚Äôve quit the job\n\nUgh I feel this :( been thinking I‚Äôm going to die of a brain tumor for the past couple months it‚Äôs ruining my life\n\nTHIS IS ME. It‚Äôs literally making my life miserable because I have headaches literally every single day and cannot rationalize anything except ‚ÄúI have brain tumor.‚Äù\nIt is so exhausting.\n\nYup :( the eye pain and the stabbing headaches daily has me convinced I‚Äôm going to die any day now it‚Äôs awful. Hang in there &lt;3\n\nI also have the headaches and they‚Äôre called tension headaches caused by stress and anxiety (what my neurologist told me).¬†\n\nGlad I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs hard to rationalize when we‚Äôre feeling that way, but the battle really is in the mind. We‚Äôre not going to die, we‚Äôre just overthinking and anxious. We got this ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nGet checked for reassurance for yourself if it helps, although this has stopped working for me so I just move onto the next niggling feeling I have somewhere ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but I‚Äôm pretty sure you won‚Äôt be having a brain tumour, it‚Äôs probably tension. I not only get it in my head but my ear pressure too and a dull ache the back of my eyes‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had eye tests an other test and nothing.¬†\n\nOh yeah I also have hEDS which causes tension headaches it‚Äôs just hard to separate the anxiety sometimes ü•≤\n\nTruer words have never been spoken! It‚Äôs like living in hell.\n\nYes!!! Fuck the health anxiety. Mine has been so bad lately. My grandma passed away recently due to serious health conditions and it's made my brain go into hyperactive mode. I can't stop thinking about the \"what if\"s. What If I have something she had, what if what if what if\n\nI did exactly this when my gran passed‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a hairdresser and have lots of elderly ladies who share health stories an losing people and spending time alone an now I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm going to be a lonely old woman in my house an when I die no one will find me. WHY DO WE MAKE UP THE WORST STORY POSSIBLE ü´£ why don‚Äôt I think I‚Äôm going to live in a lake house surrounded by nature growing my own vegetables and just being at peace.¬†\n\nFor real. It majorly sucks and no matter what I do my brain doesn't shut up ü´†\n\nYEAH FUCK THIS SHIT\n\nDoes anyone else get terrified to go to the dr like horrible panic attack and your vitals are really high when they check them.. I have such bad health anxiety I hate it\n\nI agree; Fuck healthy anxiety in general. I've been a bit of a hypochondriac all my life, but there have been times when it was helpful. I've had problems with my shoulder for over two years from wear and tear from working in retail hell. Diagnosed with tendinitis, was given naproxen, and endured six months of PT with no improvement. All the while, I was researching my symptoms and differential diagnoses, and every time a condition that affects 1 in 40,000 people came up. I was laughed at when I brought it up with my doctors and felt like I was crazy and started to believe my pain was psychogenic. When I mentioned it to my therapist, she disagreed and encouraged me to pursue it. So I did. By the grace of god and a lot of convincing, I got in with one of the best orthopedists in my area. And wouldn't you know, on the very first appointment, he suspected it was that rare condition and immediately ordered tests to confirm it. If I hadn't pursued this or assumed it was my hypochondria, I could've risked permanent nerve damage and throwing blood clots in my arm.\nLONG STORY SHORT, HEALTH ANXIETY CAN BE HELPFUL WHEN THE RIGHT PEOPLE LISTEN. IF YOU GENUINELY FEEL LIKE SOMETHING IS WRONG, DON'T ASSUME IT IS JUST ANXIETY AND NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. IT MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR HEALTH. (sorry for the novel.)\n\nNo you're absolutely right! We should always get checked out but it kinda sucks and breaks the bank sometimes lol! God bless you and I hope you are doing better now!\n\nI have health anxiety and decided to go to nursing school.... what a mind fuck clinicals are.¬†\n\nI've developed health anxiety during the pandemic and now I'm stuck with it. I want my old self back. :(\n\nlisten to The Anxiety Guy on YouTube his content is focused on health anxiety and how to overcome it\n\nthis is an old thread but I just want to say I'm really feeling this tonight"

    "all_comment_text": "My guess is you took too much and started getting a panic attack while high. I went through that and it was pure hell, I went on anti depresants and also with time it got better and went away. I struggled with anxiety and panic attacks 3 months after the initial high. I still struggle with it till this day. Its like it unlocked anxiety and panic attacks in my brain.\n\nIt does get better though so keep your chin up.\n\nIt also unlocked anxiety and panic attacks to me too! Are you currently on medication for anxiety?\n\nYes im on ssri's snri's beta blockers and when it's way bad I have ativan. Im stable though thanks to the meds\n\nThank you, and have you ever had any side effects? My anxiety gave me insomnia, and I would like to maybe look into medication\n\n[deleted]\n\nI‚Äôd go with Notriptyline as opposed to Amitriptyline. Amitriptyline causes nightmares.\n\nThe beta blockers and Ativan are for physical symptoms?\n\nAtivan is a mild tranquilizer: ¬†in beta blocker is for rapid heartbeat\n\nI developed panic disorder after smoking too much weed the second time - that was back in 2013 and it got a LOT worse before it got better. Lol.\n\nI feel like it‚Äôs not as uncommon as people think for some of us to have our first panic attack because of weed. And the dissociation it can cause can also linger, and when you become afraid of it (because it‚Äôs a shitty feeling, but not dangerous), it can become a cycle. It sounds like that might be what OP is experiencing, because that‚Äôs what I felt for months after that experience.\n\nIt got a lot better for me, though! It just took some time. I had to eventually realize that at some point, my personal history was leaning me towards some kind of anxiety/panic diagnosis anyway, and the weed just ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù it. \n\nOnce I made it into therapy, learned to accept that my brain is sometimes anxious and dissociated (and that weed is a no-no because it triggers that for me), those feelings became a lot easier to manage.\n\nBut it does get better, OP, just keep living your life in spite of those weird feelings and each day will feel more normal again, I promise.\n\nSo real!\n\nThis is exactly what happened to me after my first time ever trying weed.\n\nOof thats rough especially for your first experience. The first 2 times I smoked it i got high with no problems but then one day it hit, i clearly took too much at the time.\n\nI've tried to smoke again but i just feel trapped and anxious, i didn't really get an attack but it was uncomfortable\n\nHey hi! 4 months late but my situation happened only a month ago.\n\nSame thing, too high, I actually didn't panic that day a whole lot. Feels like I never got grounded.\n\nHad a panic attack close to a week after. Went to the ER. On citalopram for anxiety now (which I probably needed before).\n\nI feel *good* but I still just always feel a tinge high. It's odd. Now I think it's just the SSRI and it'll balance out.\n\nBut to OP and to you. I'm on this struggle bus!\n\nDrugs and alcohol can change the chemicals within your brain. But it sounds to me like you had an experience which terrified you which has now made you a more panicky/anxious person. This can even happen when a person experiences a scary experience sober. Anything can trigger depression/ anxiety. Keep in mind anxiety creates real physical symptoms which only enhances the anxiety which we are already feeling. Anxiety is scary but never dangerous. I would keep talking to a professional. Don‚Äôt be concerned if you don‚Äôt feel better right away, these things do take time. You are stronger than you think.\n\ncan MDMA do this? i took a bit last year when i would go out drinking, and ever since then i‚Äôve had major anxiety and health anxiety. it‚Äôs gotten particularly worse this year- despite not taking mdma again. i wonder if it permanently fuxked me up?\n\nYeah I mean any drugs can mess with the chemicals in your brain. I would say this to your doctor. Be honest with them and they will be helpful. Health anxiety is difficult because the physical symptoms make it feel so real. Exposure therapy is the best way to overcome this. There really is no point worrying about your health because it won‚Äôt stop anything from happening. And just because you feel like something bad is about to happen ‚Ä¶. ITS NOT A SIGN THAT SOMETHING IS. It‚Äôs not intuition it‚Äôs the anxiety. Intuition is completely different trust me. You might imagine a terrible situation and that does not make it more likely to happen. I struggle with it myself that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in this subreddit actually.\n\nMDMA basically uses all of the serotonin in your brain up, which is why the next day many people say they feel suicidal. MDMA is very dangerous for a lot of people, especially those on SSRI‚Äôs. \nYou‚Äôve messed up your neurotransmitters, you may have had a propensity for mental health issues prior to using. \n\nI highly recommend seeing a therapist and maybe considering taking an SSRI, even temporarily. I hope you feel better üíï\n\nI don‚Äôt think it permanently messed up anything in your brain. There are loads of famous people who did numerous amounts of drugs or hardcore drugs and were able to get back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô or at least live a decent life‚Äîlike Steve O. It‚Äôs sounds like it triggered your anxiety, which in turn morphed into health anxiety, and now you‚Äôve stuck in a cycle where your main trigger for your anxiety is your health which you keep obsessing over. Did you seek therapy for it?\n\nThis is a great answer. Hope you feel better soon OP.\n\nOP, during your investigation, was the possibility of a psychotic condition assessed? It may be interesting to seek help in this regard. If your family has someone with schizophrenia or another type of psychosis, it's worth it. Anyway, I'm sorry about the situation, it sounds like it's quite stressful and unpleasant to be in. \n\nWhat I would suggest, as a mental health professional, would be things you have already done before, such as exercise, therapy, and a healthier lifestyle.\n\nTHC is psychoactive. While we have no idea about OPs history it seems based on this post it's the THC that altered their mental state. It can cause things like long-term dissociative symptoms like derealization and depersonalization which would be my bet. I had something similar happen.\n\nTook me about a year to feel normal after hitting a wax pen. Every single day felt like a dream, and I had this weird sense of watching myself in third person it seemed like. What really helped me was doing things to bring me back, such as breathing exercises and rubbing cold water on the back of my neck and cold water to the face. Also doing things that got me out of my comfort zone helped me use my brain more and got me to get myself feel grounded.\n\nThis was me to the T after doing some bad ecstasy as a teenager. Took me about a year to re-align. I never went near psychedelics or psychotropics again.\n\nCold water on neck/face and breathing are things that calm your vagus nerve. An irritated vagus nerve was one thing that came to mind ‚Äî I think this is good advice for OP.\n\nI like to splash really cold water on my face during a massive panic attack because it tricks the nervous system into a response as if you just jumped into a cold body of water.  The vagus nerve is super interesting!\n\nI always see this term vagus nerve, but every de doesn't acknowledge it or only alternative health pros or chiropractors. Why isn't this more main stream\n\nThis was what I was wondering. De-realization and de-personalization are really scary and not really talked about a lot. But from my experience and understanding can be more likely to occur in people with anxiety especially when things like THC or other substances are introduced/taken.\n\n[deleted]\n\nTrue, my anxiety/panic is definitely exacerbated by weed so I avoid it now. I don't think op needs a new reason to panic though. Don't want to suggest he may quite literally be psychotic when 99% of the time that isn't the case\n\nExactly this.\n\nThis happened to me. It triggered psychosis, now I‚Äôm diagnosed with bi polar disorder. Haven‚Äôt been the same since.\n\nPeople don‚Äôt treat marijuana seriously, but in those with mental illness, it can really fuck with your brain. I had to quit because of anxiety, and I felt like I was slipping into psychosis.\n\nOh I totally agree with you. I live in Canada, where it‚Äôs legal. And the repercussions aren‚Äôt talked about enough! It can totally flip a switch in your brain, so scary. I‚Äôm happy for you for quittingüôÇ and hopefully you‚Äôre doing better with your mental health! I know how difficult it is to recover from that.\n\nI am shocked at how many people have had the same reaction. I also had this insane experience on weed where I was stuck in a time loop for hours and ever since then Ive had dissociation issues. Took about a year to recover. Doctors didn‚Äôt believe me. And there is like 1 research paper on this but other than that nothing confirms this\n\nI felt like I was stuck in a time loop, too! I haven't seen too many others who've had this happen. It was my first time taking an edible. Definitely hit WAY harder than I expected. My friend told me it would just chill me out a little. Understatement of the year haha.\n\nOmg same. I tried smoking weed for a few times before and thought it has no effect on me, but apparently I just don't know how to smoke properly haha. So then I tried an edible and... I was stuck in a time loop, everything was spinning, I was 100% convinced that I'll either go crazy or die (I was about to call my parents to tell them where to find my body and say my goodbies). I asked my friend to take me to the hospital, but she was high and just laughed at me... My heart was beating so so fast, I was all hot, I genuinely thought that my body was going to give in. And it lasted for HOURS. \n\nAnd the thing is, I just took a starting dose (half an edible, when a normal dose is 2 edibles). I definitely overdosed. \n\nAnyways, it kind of passed and wore out, I definitely don't struggle with such major lasting effects as OP, but I feel like it still changed me for the worse. Sometimes I'm just sitting and doing nothing, but something suddenly reminds me of that experience I had on the edible and I immediately start panicking and feel like I'm losing my mind. Everything starts kind of spinning again. It's really scary. I only had panic attack once before I tried the edible and it was much, much milder, but now I start getting them randomly all the time. I really hope they stop with time.\n\nI agree. This happened to me about 15 years ago and I have since recovered (although it took a couple years). But it‚Äôs so fascinating after all this time to learn that this is not just a ‚Äúme‚Äù thing, but rather something that a small subset of people experience. I‚Äôd love to see more research done on this.\n\nwhat helped you to recover ?\n\ni greened out HARD in january and also thought i was dying. got an ambulance too, which is hilarious looking back, but i genuinely believed i was about to drop dead.  \n\nafter sleeping it off though, i felt essentially back to normal the next day. i‚Äôd assume your experience triggered a latent panic disorder or something similar, but i‚Äôm no therapist/doctor.\n\nDude it gets BAD lmao. I learned the hard way to not take too much. Occasionally I get carried away and I just have to remind myself ‚ÄúSTOP you are not dying you‚Äôre just high üò≠‚Äù which is followed by a period of ‚Äúif I go, I go‚Äù before going to sleep because as much as I can make myself mentally PRETTY sure I‚Äôm just high I can never 100% fully get rid of the *feeling* that this is the end lmao\n\nthis comment is exactly how i would describe my current weed experience.\n\nhad a friend bring a gravity bong to my house for a party. i don‚Äôt smoke much so i was inside when my friends carried in a friend of ours. he was so high he couldn‚Äôt respond to us. he started throwing up and shaking like he was having a seizure but still couldn‚Äôt answer us he was so high. i‚Äôve never seen anyone green out like that. we called him an ambulance right after he vomited. he‚Äôs totally fine now, but that was terrifying.\n\nThis happened to me about 4-5 years ago. I got way too high off of a bong toke, when I hadn‚Äôt smoked weed in 4 years, had an insane panic attack, called an ambulance etc because I thought I was literally dying. Ever since then I‚Äôve been struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks, and catastrophic thinking. I had minor anxiety before that event, but nothing like this. \n\nI take 100mg bupropion for depression and anxiety, so far it‚Äôs helped quite a bit, minus my health anxiety, I don‚Äôt think anything will help that lol.\n\nFor health anxiety check out OCD treatments and techniques. I‚Äôve been able to make progress with acceptance and agreeing with the thoughts.¬†\n\nI went through the same thing. Took a 100 mg edible (FIRST) time trying an edible btw freaked the fuck out, called an ambulance on myself and have not felt myself since. A lot of disassociating feelings. Panic attacks etc üò© I‚Äôve had horrible anxiety and ocd all my life but this edible ‚Äúwelcomed‚Äù panic disorder into my life.\n\n100???¬†\n\n\nGoodness. 2.5mg is enough for me and even sometimes that feels like a lot. I don't know if I can comprehend 100. üò≥\n\nMy stupid ass. I didn‚Äôt read the packaging and was warned before hand it was ‚Äúa lot‚Äù. I‚Äôve smoked a couple times and felt it did not really affect me so I tried to show off. 10/10 would NEVER recommend ü´†\n\nThank you for volunteering as tribute. May the odds be ever in your favor.\n\nLOL my first green out was visiting my sister. She got us gunnies and it was a 50mg. She warned me not to eat the whole thing but I thought because I smoked all the time I was fine. Man..I was so wrong ü§£\n\nYou actually feel 2.5 mg? Maybe I just don't metabolize drugs well because I started with 5 mg and felt nothing. I can take 25 mg now and feel nothing, and I rarely smoke anymore. I buy mine from a dispensary, so I know they have the correct mg dose. I have family members that eat these 100 mg edibles like it's candy. 100 mg would send me into a crazy panic attack.\n\nIt was insane.\n\nI can't even begin to imagine. I've never taken anywhere near 100 mg and I used to smoke multiple times a day.\n\nHow was your heart rate and blood pressure during this time? Too much THC makes my heart and BP go crazy high. I would have had to go to a hospital to get medication to lower both.\n\nHas it gotten better over time? Does exercise, meditation, yoga, acupuncture, that kind of stuff help?\n\nOmg 100?! 10mg is enough for me to get a high. You must have thought you were dying.\n\nI genuinely did. And unfortunately I was out in public. I was at a movie theatre with trippy lights and went outside to get air and was going in circles.\n\nI took about 90 mg and also called an ambulance. I was TERRIFIED! Opened the door to OCD and panic attacks for me.\n\nIt‚Äôs horrifying!!!!!! Right? I hate that it opened panic disorder into our lives\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was an everyday stoner for the better part of 10 years. \n\n2 years ago a big edible session triggered my first ever panic attack (hooray!) and even though I quit weed after that, the panic attacks have continued.\n\nI had this happen after taking LSD in high school. I had done it 10-12 times but this time was different. Complete personality erasure. I felt like every second that passed, the previous second was being erased.\n\nThat got better over the course of a few months but I tried ecstasy a couple years later due to peer pressure that turned out to be bad stuff that messed me up so bad and set the whole thing off like a rocket. I started having sleep convulsions, constant panic, and had that EXACT same feeling that I was just \"different\" and was not myself. My whole life kind of unraveled. I felt like I was in an alternate universe 24/7.\n\nBUT! BUT! After a few months I decided to just give in and make peace with it, and wouldn't you know, that's when things started to get better.\n\nOver the course of about a year I got better and better.  Eventually I stopped feeling that way.\n\nWhat did you do to make peace with the dissociation and anxiety? Mindful practice accepting the feelings or anything else? Glad you're feeling better, that's awesome.\n\nSee my other reply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fl3ofz/i_took_a_couple_of_strong_edibles_8_months_ago/lqg0ccp/)\n\nYes same! I explained it to my friends like it was as if I had the memory of a goldfish. It was awful üò≠\n\nMy anxiety disorder came in full force after an edible \n\nMind you I was someone who smoked pot almost daily but in light amounts. One day during Covid lockdowns I ate an entirely too big of a dose of edible chocolate and FREAKED THE FUCK OUT. For hours. I never went to the ER because again this was during Covid with hospitals overflowing with sick and dying people.\n\nIt was the worst day of my life and if my fianc√© wasn‚Äôt there to keep me sane idk what would have happened to me. I was crying, couldn‚Äôt breathe right and genuinely thought I was going to die. Ive never been the same since. I don‚Äôt feel exactly like you do but ever since that day I‚Äôve had severe anxiety. I also never smoked weed again after that and can‚Äôt anymore without heart palpitations. \n\nIdk what happened to me that day. I‚Äôve done a lot of research and my story isn‚Äôt isolated. Found a lot of people with ‚Äúhidden‚Äù mental disorders (mine being anxiety) that is basically triggered from a ‚Äúbad trip‚Äù, the drugs that cause it being the variable. This happens a lot more often than I thought. I had minor and what I thought was very normal anxiety before that day. After that? Forget it. It all came rushing in like a tidal wave and it‚Äôs been flooding since.\n\nfriendü•π you can message me! i went through the exact same thing. i have a lot of info that will help you!!!\n\nYou should make a post about your info if you‚Äôre so inclined! A lot of people would like to see it¬†\n\nPlease put it out here for everyone to see. A lot of people need it. You are going to help a lot of people. TIA from everyone that wants this information.\n\nmessage me please i‚Äôm in the same situation!!\n\nCan you also send me info?? I think I might be going through it too\n\nI have the same problem; what kind of tips do you have?\n\nLooks like so many people want your help‚Ä¶ can u make a group chat on here? I‚Äôm down to be in it too\n\nI would love to know what info you have as well.\n\nI need this info too, please!\n\nI also would love some information if possible thank you\n\nI‚Äôd love to see what info you have too please? It happened to me as well and I went through such a scary experience..No more for me!\n\nI had a similar experience resulting in a similar situation. This is only from my experience. I was around 20. Had a bad smoke. Thought I would die. Life for some time after was rough. Feeling not like myself. Were afraid of falling asleep because I wouldn‚Äôt wake up again. Was sure I got a psychosis. I did everything wrong after hand. Partied real hard. Instead I should had got professional help. And just started to live healthy. \n\n\nI think I triggered severe anxiety. And many of the symptoms anxiety can cause is what I felt. I thought I was dying or become schizophrenic. I was wrong and could have been better faster. Today years later I‚Äôm laughing at it. I was believing the worst and was young and stupid. \n\nPro tip is to don‚Äôt use anything again. I‚Äôm not even drinking although I didn‚Äôt stop because of this situation.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that. After a daily consumption i developed OCD and anxiety. THC definitely isn't for everyone\n\nYiu said you don't feel like yourself. It COULD sound like derealization. Post Malone had it too. It can happen with weed. Be careful ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI took an edible a few months ago, freaked out and thought i had died and was in the afterlife lolü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èshortly after i had another panic attack and my anxiety kind of spiralled from there, i would have these horrible anxiety attacks that would last days on end. I got on antidepressants tho which have kind of helped, my thoughts are the experience triggers panic and sometimes it never rly goes away. Drugs can mess with your brain in ways we would never expect. I honestly feel like since going through constant panic attacks my memory is now fucked too which scares me sometimes. Your not alone but there is hope, Your brain slowly goes back to the way it used to be.\n\nHoly shit I had almost the same experience like I thought I died and went to heaven/hell?? What was yours like? Now I have like the most severe anxiety.\n\nYess i remember my friends trying to talk to me to calm me down and i kept thinking they were ghosts and i was fully convinced i had died. people don‚Äôt think edibles can make you trip that hard until it happens to them lol. But same after that i started taking random panic attacks. I thought it was only meüôÉHope your doing better now\n\nTaking too much makes me have a pretty bad time, and I‚Äôve definitely experienced that sensation of dying which is common when people have white outs. However the feeling is always temporary- lasting no more than the time it takes for me to sleep it off. I‚Äôve done this numerous times as well. I have heard weed can have even worse effects on those who experience psychosis so I suppose it could be worth looking into your family mental health history.\n\nOh and this might sound crazy but drink water. When I was a frequent user and knew I didn‚Äôt realize that weed was EXTREMELY dehydrating- more than anything else I ever dealt with in my life. This is especially the case in the days following taking too much. I once thought I was high for days when I was new to it but it turned out I was just so dehydrated it was fucking with me and making me disoriented. It didn‚Äôt make me think I was dying, but at the time I was not in a bad period of my anxiety. I can see how, if I was in a bad period of anxiety , I might feel confused and anxious about how strange I was feeling and think I was dying considering that it‚Äôs common for us all to have health scares when it‚Äôs bad. So consider spending the next day hydrating a LOT and see if your discomfort goes away.\n\nAlso it helps to use a hydration product with water to get it into your cells more efficiently ‚Äî Liquid IV or something like that.\n\nI had the same happening to me February last year; still haven't fully recovered yet but can say it got better. Some things that had helped me is a better sleep schedule and excercise. I hate the ball in throat feeling; what somewhat helped for me is not thinking about it and when i have it badly to just chew some gum.\n\nit‚Äôs so weird cause i had a really bad experience with cannabis last year in november and this year april i started to feel how i was that night but why so long after?\n\nBecause weed triggers panic attacks so if you ever get a panic attack then you are basically going through the same thing.\n\nI had panic disorder first in my life for many years before I ever partook and the first time I took too much I realized ‚Äúoh this is giving me a panic attack‚Äù lol\n\nI‚Äôve had the uncontrollable shivers when I‚Äôve had nocturnal panic attacks ‚Äî which are very intense vagus-nerve-triggered adrenal episodes I get but they call them ‚Äúpanic attacks‚Äù for lack of a better term. (My daytime panic attacks are more like regular panic attacks.) I also do not react well to edibles. \n\nJust to offer another angle of investigation to other people‚Äôs good advice:\n\nI‚Äôm wondering if the stress of this triggered a real physical condition, like an autoimmune disease: Cushing‚Äôs, Graves or Hashimoto‚Äôs. Having a lump in your throat can be a thyroid symptom or a symptom of an irritated vagus nerve. Anything affecting thyroid/adrenals can give cognitive symptoms too. If you‚Äôre male, it‚Äôs less likely to be autoimmune because women get autoimmune diseases at a much higher rate. But if they run in your family, that‚Äôs a consideration. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt assume this is all in your head and not a real physical condition, there are many conditions intertwined with anxiety. Definitely see a doctor and get your antibodies and/or inflammatory markers checked ‚Äî plus whatever else they recommend. \n\nTry some vagus nerve toning to calm your system‚Äî you can look this up online, but go slowly. Also guided meditations, if they don‚Äôt trigger you. If you‚Äôre not taking electrolytes, I‚Äôd do that too ‚Äî to support adrenals. If you‚Äôve gotten your adrenals into a stress cycle, you‚Äôll need to rest and destress to calm them. All you can do is practice acceptance about feeling ‚Äúnot yourself‚Äù and work with it a day at a time.\n\nSounds like what I went through years ago with smoking weed. I got severe depersonalization/derealization and was basically living in hell every waking hour. It lasted  a long long time and honestly to this day I really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm fully recovered from it or not.  This happened back in 2008.\n\nI had a similar experience. When I was younger I took an edible and experienced a deep depersonalization / derealization.  I felt like I was constantly observing myself from a Birds Eye view and was not in control of my body. I was seriously paranoid for 2-3 weeks. Eventually I came out of it very gradually. \n\nI did go to the hospital and they told my parents that I had drug induced psychosis. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. But coming out of it was one of the most beautiful I must say, I felt like I was being reborn and had a greater appreciation of life.\n\nSome things that helped me were CBD, doing relaxing things I like such as going for a walk, talking to a friend, drinking green tea, and staying away from THC.\n\nthis same thing happened to me 3 years ago but my experience was with LSD not cannabis. you‚Äôre not alone.\n\nI‚Äôve been there, you‚Äôre going to be fine.\n\nTHC is unbelievably potent and much more dangerous than people admit.\n\nVery similar story to me. I thought if I quit weed, all of it would go away but it‚Äôs been 5 months since the initial panic attack that set it off. It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm traumatised because I‚Äôm constantly aware of my breathing and scared to death I‚Äôll have a panic attack and die. I‚Äôm on antidepressants and have diazepam for when I feel a panic attack coming. The dissociation is so real , I feel crazy sometimes. Recommend always having diazepam just incase the panic gets too intense\n\nI am in PTSD treatment and my therapist said that a lot of people get traumatized from bad highs. i had ptsd before that, but 5 months ago i had a bad high that now triggers the same reaction as my other traumas. anything can traumatize you, what united us is the way we feel afterwards, but that is treatable. but yeah every time i smell weed somewhere, or someone mentions it, i get an insane panic attack and feel like I felt when i had the bad high. it‚Äôs horrible/\n\nWow Thank you for sharing that. I also get extremely anxious around my friends when they get high and I can smell it ( thought I was going crazy ) it‚Äôs nice to know other people have similar experience \nI wish u the best\n\nOk while I have had an edible in my life once i wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm very qualified to give advice specifically on that part but I do struggle with things not feeling right/real due to a combination of factors mostly something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome. I‚Äôve had extended periods of time a few times in my life where things didn‚Äôt look or feel right/real. What got me through it was repeatedly telling myself that it didn‚Äôt matter if ‚Äúthis‚Äù isn‚Äôt real/right it‚Äôs my reality and I‚Äôve just got to deal with it and eventually it would fade and things would start to feel normal again\n\nWow, knowing I'm not alone and MANY of us had VERY similar situations is actually quite comforting. I really thought I was going nuts. I've suffered tremendously in the past from anxiety and depression and have had it under \"control\" for the past 10ish years. Back in February, I tripped HARD and greened out...I experienced pretty much ALL of the symptoms that everyone here is mentioning. Since then, my anxiety and Depression has come back with a vengeance. I'm back in therapy, and now I'm thinking of microdosing shrooms. From the literature I've read and the number of success stories that have been shared, I'm wondering if this may be the route to go. I've done therapy in the past and have been on a number of meds, and all it seems to have done is just put a lid on everything and never truly resolve the actual underlying issues. Has anyone here had success stories with microdosing shrooms?\n\nUnfortunately this is way more common than people know. Weed can ‚Äúwake up‚Äù underlying psychiatric conditions that you may have been predisposed to but might not have ever had. This can be mood disorders, de realization, generalized anxiety, psychosis, and at the worst schizophrenia. The good thing though is that the brain is a muscle and can heal itself in big ways with medications and therapy etc in most cases.\n\nHopefully this is not what has happened to you, but it sounds like you are on the right track now with anti anxiety meds. Continue with those and be kind and gentle with yourself in the mean time. It will take some time to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again, or adjust to your new normal. Sorry to hear that OP. Definitely stay away from weed from here on out\n\nI RELATE TO ALL OF YOU‚Ä¶.You just described my whole situation! I was smoking regularly as it used to bring out the confidence in me but even before smoking I was already confident used to speak to a lot of people not be shy or anything and tbh didn‚Äôt even believe in depression or anxiety but to this day I still don‚Äôt know if it was the weed or it just randomly developed but It started when I was going through puberty age 15, a regular day I just rolled up a spliff and was smoking it with my mates all of a sudden I just become very awkward, anxiety just hit me out of nowhere it was like I was infected by some sort of parisite I thought I was going crazy tbh, weeks went by I was becoming more and more not myself, as every day went by it‚Äôs like I was changing each day becoming more depressed, depersonalized, anxiety indused the more I change the more I miss the old confident me which then fucks me up even more no joke it‚Äôs like I got nerfed by god, at this point I‚Äôve just kind of excepted that I‚Äôm dealing with this. some days it‚Äôs really bad some not so as bad but I‚Äôm 19 now and I just hope a magical scientist can come up with a cure for this shit man because I relate to all of you in these comments and I just wanna say you guys are strong for pushing through fr, first few years were bad really bad, like i was going to war in my head overall I‚Äôm just sick of battling this parisite everyday so plz lets push this and find a cure!.\n\nYep! What you‚Äôve gone through is very common almost to the letter. The issue though is that it is not openly spoken about or on a level where it becomes knowledge and a warning for people to be way more cautious and aware of the risks. \n\nBecause weed for a lot of people is fun and helps many chronic health issues/pain and depression, it is seen as a cure all natural medicine, but for some people it really is so dangerous! And when you realize that, it‚Äôs already too late and you have no choice but to power through and seek help. \n\nI actually know a handful of people who were otherwise ‚Äúfine‚Äù mentally who ended up in the psych ward because it induced psychosis or schizophrenia. One was able to recover quite well over months and anti psychotic meds, but the others are still in that state and it is so scary and sad. \n\nI hope too, that there will be some progress and research done that can help find methods that will help people get back to baseline. But as for now, all I can do is keep speaking about it to educate people that this isn‚Äôt something to play with! Weed is not tolerable for everybody\n\nThe only mistake you made was ignoring the THC to CBD ratio :(\n\n[Understanding this video](https://youtu.be/T2cAFRAX3Gs) could've prevented your experience :(\n\nSadly it feels like nobody knows about it. You can ask 100 weed addicts and maybe 1 will know about it... Spread the info, dont let others suffer too.\n\nThis is exactly the type of thing I'm talking about when mega THC pushing assholes say it's harmless and that I'm exaggerating. While it doesn't/hasn't lasted as long as yours has, I 100% have gone through the same thing. I'd say it lasted weeks. I did not feel right. The depths at which I spiraled into myself - those are moments I can never undo. Feelings I can never erase and now it feels like I've been exposed/opened in a way I did not consent to. I did it to myself but I did not want THIS. \n\nUh, now that I think about it.. some of my worst trips (which don't always happen!!! It's very random) tend to change my sense of self and almost like my entire personality evolves. I don't *change into a different person*, but a different version of myself. More painfully aware of things I don't want to be, I guess? And *those* specific feelings/changes.. well, they don't go away. Ever. I've adapted. You will, too. You're still you. You just have to take a step back and tell yourself \"I am me. I've always been me. This isn't a dream, I'm safe and I'm okay.\"\n\nThat's just me, though...\n\nHello, Sir, I have a question for you.\n\nI \\[male, 45\\] ate an edible 6 weeks ago. It was my first time with cannabis, and since then I'm fucked up. I think the dosage was way too high, I trusted my gf on that and turned to be not a very wise decision. And here, in Europe, the market is not regulated, so it is really difficult to quantify things.\n\nI had a whole greening out, including nausea, vomit, increased heart rate, dizziness, disorientation, hallucinations that lasted a few hours as a whole, but, the problem is, since then I'm constant nauseous or dizzy. I have brain fog and it it like my brain underfuction. I want to sleep constantly.\n\nFor 5 weeks I had terrible headaches and burning sensation in my brain. Fortunately, last 1,5 week, this one symptom is very improved.\n\nI had an MRI in the brain, but it was all ok.\n\nPsycologically I'm as good as I can be, far way better than all these messages I read about the topic.\n\nBut, I wonder if I'm going to have my old brain back.. 6 weeks is way too long I think.\n\nYesterday I saw a neurologist and had an encephalogram too. It was normal. But he didn‚Äôt know what is going on. He said that my system is THC free after all these weeks.\n\nI‚Äôll go to check my ears, but, i do not think that I have an issue with them, you see, I used to dance for years before this incident.\n\nI wanna ask you if you are acknowledge of another case such as mine, to be in that condition after so long. And what did they do to overcome this situation.\n\nEdibles make me feel like I'm on the verge of a physoctic break every time.¬†\n\n\nHowever smoking is like an anti depressant to me. So weird.¬†\n\nIt's funny because I'm the opposite. Smoking weed triggers panic attacks for me because it comes on so quickly. I've never had a panic attack on edibles because the come up is so slow that I don't even notice it. I wish edibles were cheaper, though.\n\nI  had the same experience, except I had been regularly using for 2 years and just one day had the worst panic attack of my life. I ended up quitting after that and the mixture of withdrawals plus panic attack left me in this void, dreamlike state where nothing felt real and I was constantly on edge and panicky. It did \"sort of\" go away after about a year, but ever since then when my body is under a lot of stress I now disassociate which it never did before, so that kind of sucks.\n\n It will get better, keep doing everything you're doing. Remember to give yourself grace. do lots of self care, and try not constantly think \"why am I not better yet\" because that can cause you to backtrack and panic more.\n\nDepersonalisation\n\nHi! At age 17 (I'm now 28) I got way too high one night and started having auditory, tactile, visual, and overall super scary hallucinations. The weeks after I was incredibly paranoid and still had some delusions, especially at night, and panic attacks during the day. Needless to say I was not feeling like myself. I've always been a worrywart, but this experience triggered an intense anxiety disorder.\n\nLong story short, it took about a year after starting therapy and medication for me to have a few good days here and there. And with time, continued mental health support and maybe a dose of maturing, the bad days lessened and I returned to a comfortable baseline of normalcy. This is also what my therapists at the time told me - a bad experience with THC is a shock to the brain, and it takes a while to process.\n\nA couple acid trips from my twenties still haunt me to this day. They‚Äôre the reason I can‚Äôt smoke in a social or public setting due to paranoia. Experiences like that change your perspective and damage your trust in your outer world on a deep level.  \n  \nThe only thing that helped me through the rough of it was an intense workout routine to move my subconscious focus from the event towards my body. I‚Äôll still get little glimpses of it now and then depending on stress. I hope you‚Äôre able to push through it.\n\nStart low, move slow. As in, start with very low THC potency to see how it affects you, and slowly increase the dosage to make sure you know what you‚Äôre getting into. \n\nI work in cannabis and I‚Äôm terribly sorry you had this experience. \n\nIdk the specifics of your situation, but I feel that a lot of people try cannabis without genuinely *wanting* to. Like maybe they‚Äôre curious and they don‚Äôt want to miss out, or worse, they‚Äôre pressured into it, and then you have this whole thing weighing you down with anxiety because you‚Äôre not entirely sure what you‚Äôre getting into nor if you even want to do it. \n\nI wish I could offer some better help; good luck.\n\ni had this happened to me a couple years ago. i was a daily user and one day it just hit me and caused me to have a panic attack, leading me to think i had a heart condition and spiraled for a couple months. every single day id think i was having a heart attack and would disassociate. then one day i realized it was all in my head. like i was constantly freaking myself out which caused the physical symptoms and me confusing that with a real health scare. it will get better, its mostly likely your anxiety causing you to be in a permanent state of dissociation, even if you dont believe it at the time. there are so many coping mechanisms to help with this. mine is finding 10 things in the room that are the same color to help me calm down when i begin to panic. you are not going crazy and you‚Äôre not broken. you will get through this, OP.\n\nSomething terrible happened to my brain about 5 years ago after smoking.  I was too high and stuck in a violent time warp vortex in a spinning room and saw nothing but static.  Pure fear and panic.  It changed my life for several months but with time it went away.  I‚Äôll never touch it again!\n\nHey! I went through something about 2.5 years ago that sounds similar.\n\nI was on vacation out of country and decided to smoke weed, I realized very quickly that I was getting way too high. I started having really bad anxiety and thought it was laced but I realize now that's not true (my boyfriend was a heavy weed smoker and he was fine). My heart rate went up to about 150bpm according to my fitbit (while I was sitting still). I was terrified and also felt like I was going to die but eventually got to sleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, the high was gone but the anxiety wasn't. My heart rate would go crazy and I felt terrified, just in a constant state of fear. I also had this weird feeling in my chest, like a sadness mixed with panic. I was in a country where weed is very illegal. I desperately wanted medical help but I had to wait it out until I got home. I also felt like I wasn't myself, something was just off.\n\nWhen I got home I called my doctor and was put on Cipralex (Lexapro) and got \"emergency anxiety medication\" (lorazepam) to take if I needed to while waiting for the Cipralex to kick in (takes a few weeks). I also started therapy and began to meditate. For a while I felt that weird sense of not being myself, like reality was altered. I've learned that that's derealization/ depersonalization and it is TEMPORARY. As scary as it is, it will pass. I did slowly get better as I learned to cope with my anxiety and as my brain recovered. The anxiety you felt while high was traumatic and your body needs time to move past this trauma. It is uncomfortable and scary but it is not permanent (even though I was convinced it was).\n\nNow 2 and a half years later, I'm doing a lot better. I still get anxiety that I never had before but I've learned to cope with it and it's a lot better. It took me months to heal from this. \n\nI also recommend reading about the DP Manual or checking out the Facebook page. That helped me too and can explain further why you feel the way you do.\n\nThis is actually what happened to me after stupid ol‚Äô me took a tincture that read ‚Äòextra strength‚Äô after thinking I could handle it. Before that, I only took edibles (10mg THC) and had no issues with those, and were from a brand I trusted. The experience was awful and it took me three months to recover. I still have some slight anxiety, but it‚Äôs manageable and I‚Äôm sure I will recover from it. Every person‚Äôs brain is different. Some of us were able to recover from anxiety-induced cannabis in several months, while for others, it might take a year or more. I don‚Äôt think this means you‚Äôve permanently ‚Äòaltered‚Äô your brain chemistry. The brain is resilient, and thanks to neuroplasty, we can train it to overcome obstacles such as anxiety. While I was struggling to overcome my anxiety, I watched a ‚ÄòTrue Life‚Äô documentary about OCD, and the participants of the show managed to overcome their obsessive tendencies at the end, so that really motivated me to stay positive. There are also really great podcasts about anxiety such as ‚ÄúDisordered‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Anxious Truth‚Äù. Anyways, know your limits people and don‚Äôt overdo it. Stay away from products with high THC potency such as vape pens and dabs. Always start off slow to test your reaction to it. Find out with brands you can trust and which strain is good for your tolerance level. Or better yet, just don‚Äôt do weed.\n\nI'm on the exact same boat as you except for me it was 2 or 3 weeks ago and I'm only 15 so it was probably harmful. Tbh I'm kinda thinking of just giving up on life but I'm trying and I hope you feel better too &lt;3\n\nHappened to me my sophomore year of high school. Took way too many edibles, thought I was dying, called an ambulance lmao. I had really really bad anxiety and panic attacks for about a year after, now it‚Äôs like it never happened. Keep your head up and push through\n\nThis happened to me and I was a regular edible user. I had a panic attack and called the ambulance. My heart rate was over 200 and when I went outside to calm down it dropped to 120. Luckily the squad didn‚Äôt have to take me to the hospital, but it really changed my life. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about my heart rate for over a year, I spiraled into health anxiety and constantly thought I was dying. It took a lot of time to start to get better I got back on anxiety medication and finally I‚Äôm back to only as needed medication. It took me over a year to get better and it was terrible. I was in a state of constant doom and it was hard to sleep every night. The thing that helped me the most besides medication was learning deep breathing. I would do that and think of 10 good things that happened that day in my head every night. About a month after that I started seeing major improvement. I don‚Äôt do edibles any more and I very rarely smoke at all anymore. It‚Äôs a scary path but keep telling yourself it will get better, because it will\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry you have been feeling like that lately, I have read the comments and your experience and I am so surprised so many have had the same experiences as I didü•≤. My boyfriend is a heavy stoner and he at times wants to help me try THC with CBD to help with my anxiety but it does not work for me. I start thinking people are talking bad about me and I become paranoid also have a feeling like I‚Äôm going to die. The first time I did edibles when I was 18 I‚Äôm 26 now. I was in a party bus when I did it and my friends said I lost consciousness for 10 seconds and was on the floor in the fetal position. When they took me out of the party bus my mind was thinking people were trying to hurt me, they were saying I was a bad person I thought I was dead üòÇ and then I thought I saw a red demon and that I was in the bird box movie üò≠üò≠üò≠. Point is as I tell my boyfriend even at 26 I can‚Äôt do THC it is not for everyone\n\nSame thing happened to me. I accidentally overdosed on edibles. Already had all the predispositions for an anxiety disorder and this is what kicked it off. I thought I was dying for 7 hours. \n\nStarted having panic and anxiety attacks 24/7 after that. Multiple trips to doctors until I figured out what it was and that I wasn‚Äôt crazy or dying. It was just my nervous system that went into overdrive and my brain trying to protect me from everything. And I mean everything. \n\nIt got so bad I was disassociating for days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the movies as the lights and sounds were triggering adrenaline and a feeling of terror. Would wake up every night around 3 am with some sort of attack. They‚Äôd last for 3 hours in the beginning. Pure adrenaline and terror. Had a lump in my throat for weeks, thought I was suffocating, multiple (around 80) heart palpitations a day (heart skipping a beat), pressure in chest, pain in left arm, stabby pain in chest, numb head, face, arms and legs, the shakes, feeling of pure terror, etc. you name it, I had it. They‚Äôd last feeling of terror is a fun one as I myself wasn‚Äôt afraid but my body was producing a feeling of terror. \n\nIt was hell but it‚Äôs treatable. I had to calm my nervous system down as it saw everything, and I mean everything as danger. I had to learn to drink coffee and alcohol again, listen to loud music, play video games, go kayaking, etc. my nervous system and brain saw everything as danger and would trigger a fight/flight response. \n\nNow a year later my anxiety is non existent. It happens sometimes when I have tummy issues but that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs like once in 3 months. It happens at 3 am but it‚Äôs something I can live with. Maybe that will go away too. \n\nSo whatever you have, it‚Äôs treatable. I treated mine with meditation, calming essential oils, calm walks in nature, yoga, etc. Pills for calming down helped. Antidepressants never did anything for me. But the main key to getting better is calming your nervous system and retraining the brain to understand what‚Äôs considered a danger and what‚Äôs safe. Like going to a cinema. The key is to sit through it and keep telling it that‚Äôs it‚Äôs safe. It‚Äôs ok to freak out if it will make it feel better but that the situation is safe and that I‚Äôd like to sit through it. That‚Äôs the hardest part, not buying into the whole ‚Äúyou are dying‚Äù narrative your body is screaming you and to not freak out when your brain is drowning you with adrenaline. \n\nGood luck üëçüèª\n\nProbably took too much lol. Best to ease your way in with edibles. Anyone who has taken edibles likely has a had a similar situation with taking too many or the edible dose is to powerful for a beginner.\n\nIt's happened to me too. Saw myself dying, saw myself in my childhood doing shitty things and having horrible things happen to me. It felt so real because little snippets of it were. The dissociation left me for 2 years just a wreck. I stopped smoking for a while then tried again and after a while had the same thing happen. Now I'll puff once 2 times a year. My biggest recommendation is socializing more and using sensations to keep yourself grounded. You aren't alone and your anxious thoughts are just anxious thoughts.\n\nYou had a panic attack and your brain is in constant flight or fight mode. It can cause real physical symptoms like the ‚Äúball in throat‚Äù sensation. You have  health anxiety bro\n\nHopefully you didn't experience an infinite time loop. Hope you feel better soon, it gets better ü´Ç\n\nSame thing happened to me, only with hours upon hours of violent vomiting and dizziness so severe my sister had to call an ambulance\n\nHow much did you take? Was it from a person or did you get it at a dispensary yourself?\n\nHappened to me a few years ago with my first (and only) edible, made brownies myself, ate way too much not really being aware of the dosages etc, and had the worst panic attack I've ever experienced, and also my first actual panic attack. No lie, I thought I was dying because I had a fully out of body experience where I was floating above myself and could see myself from behind. I also had classic panic attack symptoms that felt like a heart attack, and called an ambulance.\n\nIt completely changed my life for at least 6 months, couldn't smoke weed at all, and I kept having panic attacks and I had the WORST death anixety, I just kept thinking about the endless nothing after death which would cause me to panic, I couldn't sleep in case I died in my sleep, etc.\n\nI did get much better and what I found helped was just time, unfortunately. After a while I stopped thinking about it as much, I can smoke just fine now although I don't do as much anymore, and I no longer have that intense fear of dying. I do still get panic attacks randomly very occasionally though.\n\nOne thing that really helped me was taking CBD whenever I felt anxious, if you get a good CBD oil or gummies it's really helpful and it was often the deciding factor as to whether I could get to sleep or not.\n\nFirst time I ate one I had the worst panic attack. It felt like a really intense out of body experience‚Ä¶ I hated it.  It was nothing like I‚Äôve experienced before and took me hours to feel okay. I did sleep like a baby lol After that never again ‚ò†Ô∏è\n\nI had a similar experience, worst &amp; most profound panic attack of my life. An ambulance did come. Directly following this I experienced lots of brain fog, absolute fear of leaving my house, several more small and completely sporadic panic attacks, etc. It's been almost a year since and I am nearly back to \"normal\". I will say my outlook on taking any drugs, even prescription is probably forever changed. I have learned to read my body better and I can handle a panic attack much more efficiently. \n\nI won't likely ever forget the feelings I experienced and thus the experience itself but mentally I have mostly found my way back - I think time is the key. Allow yourself that.\n\nSounds a lot like PTSD\n\nSame thing happened to me\n\nHad the same thing once when Ismoked too much weed without being used to. It will pass. It was probably a panic attack that left you a bit traumatized. Just go on\n\nI definitely recommend not jumping to edibles if you‚Äôre new to thc, I have severe anxiety and depression as well and I just stick to my pen because same dude. Personally i recommend a pen because you can control that and the high is only ever like 30 minute, only use it to calm you down don‚Äôt rely on it for comfort. It‚Äôll be okay I promise, I had a bad high as well. You just gotta remember that‚Äôs all it was, a bad high, thc can‚Äôt change who you are! You‚Äôre still you, you‚Äôre just in a funk rn and that WILL go away.\n\nI've had similar episodes. Not because of weed, but I felt the exact same way you do. Not like myself, ball in my throat, everything feels awful and like something terrible just happened, like the feeling of having died or something. My internal dialogue wasn't normal, I couldn't relax or focus anything, just a constant stream of \"what the fuck is going on i feel terrible i feel like im dying\". Dropped out of college, didn't leave the house for a year, unable to do anything at all cause I felt insane.\n\nThe solution, in the end, was antipsychotics. I am on a mix of venlafaxine and quetiapine and it has kept the craziness at bay for a year and a half now. Oh and also therapy, obviously. Therapy is mandatory.\n\nDo you already have a psychiatrist? Explain to them that antidepressants alone ain't cutting it and you need something else. I warn you, you're gonna have to fight to explain yourself and convince them that you REALLY need more support. It was a struggle for me to get anyone to believe that it wasn't just an issue with my moods, no, something was wrong in my actual psyche. Like my whole sense of reality shifts when I go through those episodes, it's like I'm in a different realm entirely. Try putting it that way. They won't give you antipsychotics until they believe you're actually having an altered state of mind, not just disregulated moods.\n\nGood luck. This shit is hard to live with and nobody talks about it. I've never met anyone irl who could relate to how I felt. But medication support has literally changed my life, I don't have to live in constant fear or going insane again. I still have some episodes of feeling weird here and there, but nothing like before I started these specific meds I'm on.\n\nI tried to kill myself because I thought I was superman, I really thought I was superman and tried to jump out the window of a building from the 13th floor but after sleeping it off in the hospital the next day, I was relative fine.\n\nThe next time I used it, I realised the voice in my head was not real and made my way home and slept and I was relatively fine after.\n\nI haven‚Äôt touched weed since\n\nI had a similar experience. Smoked way too much way too fast. Huge panic attack and suffered from panic attacks, anxiety and derealization for like 2 years after. Still effects me to this day, however no more panic attacks. Lesson: don't ever do weed again. We can't handle it.\n\nIt gets better over time. Get meds or thug it out like me\n\nThis happened to me. I greened out once and when I went to bed I woke up feeling just as foggy. \n\nI had severe derealization for a month, feeling like I was in a dream. Everything felt foggy and I couldn‚Äôt think properly. I was convinced I wasn‚Äôt real or I had a brain tumour. \n\nEventually it went away and I didn‚Äôt have any weed for years. I occasionally have weed now when I‚Äôm in a good mood. I understand now that every time there‚Äôs a possibility it theoretically could happen to me again. I was in a very bad mindset when it happened (two grandparents died) and I think it‚Äôs what contributed to it\n\nI actually had this experience many years ago. Unfortunately it was my first time taking one and it changed me as a person for the worse. I have never been the same since, this happened in 2018 but I had a lot of bad experiences growing up so it‚Äôs almost like all of the issues I had came to the surface. I had to go on antidepressants for it, this helped massively.\n\nSounds like preexisting anxiety issues.\n\nI had a similar experience about 10 years ago when I was smoking weed regularly in college and all of a sudden I had a bad high one time and I swear it ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù my anxiety. I‚Äôve dealt with GAD ever since but it‚Äôs manageable now with medication and therapy. I wish it was more talked about how a bad experience with weed can literally cause chronic anxiety in people who didn‚Äôt have it before. I promise things will get better OP. :)\n\nTrauma therapy might help for this. Maybe look into EMDR\n\n[deleted]\n\nHi! My Derealization and depersonalization started from smoking weed &amp; sounds like what you are describing, the feeling like you‚Äôre not yourself and detached from reality sounds like Dr/Dp. Do some research on it a lot of people start having dr/dp after smoking weeds/ edibles.\n\nIt will go away. Give it time my friend. I‚Äôve smoked weed since 2003. Started getting panic attacks in 2013 when I smoked. Went on ssri, got healthy, quit drinking alcohol and still had them.I will say the best thing for me is taking Xanax when I have a panic attack.Go to therapy, talk about it with loved ones. Know that you are not alone and that you are loved. I hope you feel better soon friend.\n\nI had the bigger half of an edible 3 years ago and was never the same again. In the better period of a long derealization episode with antidepressants and a mood stabilizer. It does get better. I wish you the best\n\nFirst of all - it can and will get better. I‚Äôm sorry this is happening right now.\n\nShocking how many people seem to have had the same reaction! I had this too and it was the impetus for me to seek out therapy and care from a psychiatrist. \nMake the next appointment you can and be honest with your healthcare provider. It can and will get better.\n\nOP I had something similar happen to me. I‚Äôve always had bad anxiety, decided to take an edible for my first time trying weed. It triggered the exact same feeling. I was dissociating for a long time afterwards and it really made my mental state just feel off no matter what I did. However, it did eventually go away and didn‚Äôt come back after I decided to call it quits on weed for good. You aren‚Äôt alone in this!! I felt just like you and was miserable, but please trust me it does get better. Send me a DM if you want to.\n\nThis also happened to me with a LSD trip over 10 years ago. Since then my internal monologue is my worst enemy. It helps to meditate or find things that help make you happy. I started therapy and found hobbies to help try to get back to the norm. It makes me feel less alone reading these posts.\n\nI‚Äôve had a bad anxiety/ panic attack after using cannabis. I truly believed I was gonna die! I passed out and ¬†I just wanted to go to the hospital bc I forgot how to breathe. As crazy as that sounds. I became so paranoid it made me physically ill!\nIt may take a little time but they will ind the right meds for you. Hang in and here\n\nit could be derealization, it‚Äôs really common from weed.\n\nThis has happened to me. It took a little while, but it does eventually get better.\n\nWhoa! Weed triggered my anxiety &amp; CPTSD &amp; insomnia to the point that I had to seek help from Doctors &amp; Therapists. I almost went on 2 grippy sock vacations. It was awful. But it‚Äôs been about 8yrs &amp; I still feel really weird about weed. It also triggered a nightmare disorder that men &amp; women in war time experience. YIKES.\n\nSimilar experience. In 2010 I was with my friends and tried smoking from a bong. Did toooo many hits and felt like life was moving extremely slow, even my eyesight was moving in shutter-frames. Threw me into extreme panic, convinced myself I was dying. No one believed me. Told me weed couldn‚Äôt do that. Parents told me to get over it. Years of just accepting the fact that I was probably just insane I learned about derealization, being stuck in constantly flight mode, and everything made sense. Extreme anxiety had caused me to become agoraphobic. Finally, I found a depression medicine that‚Äôs made me feel almost completely normal. I‚Äôm probably more of an extreme case - but just know many people have gone through this. Unfortunately, when I was younger I didn‚Äôt know this.\n\nI had a part of my life that some what reminds me of your situation. This was maybe 11 years ago. I never had anxiety or any type of depression up until that occurrence. It was this thing called space, spice basically fake marijuana. After a few puffs I lost my shit. I was hallucinating like crazy. I called 911. It was the worst night of my life. Honestly I get didn‚Äôt back to my full self for years. ¬†Maybe 3 to 4. I took medication for the longest. ¬†I still have a little anxiety here and there but other than that I just learned how to stop and breathe and tell myself it‚Äôs all in my head. It‚Äôs definitely a scary event. ¬†Just learn to relax and calm your mind and body. Woooooooooo Saaaaaaaaahhhh¬†\n\nI pray for you a speedy recovery. Try to stay focused on other things but anxiety can make you feel like your life is over.¬†\n\nthis story may sound discouraging but please read through.\n\n¬†When i was 19, i was smoking a lot of weed which was slowly starting to increase my levels of social anxiety and paranoia. Me being young and dumb kept smoking as a way to try and alleviate these symptoms when clearly it was the weed that was causing them. One evening I got high with some friends and i suffered from a psychotic break. Extreme paranoia to the point where i was completely detached from reality. full bore auditory hallucinations. I thought the NHL announcer on the TV was making fun of me, I was hearing my Dads voice calling me horrible things, i thought if i left the house there would be a news team with a mob of people waiting outside to interview me about the mistakes i‚Äôve made in life.¬†¬†\n\nIt was the most horrifying experience of my life.¬†¬†\n\nI didn‚Äôt tell a soul what happened which i deeply regret. essentially after that i was a different person. completely withdrawn, extremely paranoid, and extremely socially anxious. For three or four long years I suffered severely. Often times, ending my own life seemed like the only solution.\n\nBut slowly, it got better. I slowly started to feel that wound in my mind closing up like a heavy iron door slowly swinging shut. Ironically, as i started to feel better, that‚Äôs when i sought ¬†professional help. I was then diagnosed with Manic Depression Mood disorder ( Bi Polar II ) and started treatment for that. Ten years later and I am happier and healthier than i‚Äôve ever been.¬†¬†\n\nwas my life derailed? yes.¬†\nwould my life be better if that experience didn‚Äôt happen? quite possibly.¬†\n\nBut the strength and personal growth i gained from this experience is something I wouldn‚Äôt give up for the world. It made me who i am today, and I am proud of myself for overcoming that struggle.¬†¬†\n\nYou will overcome this, you will learn ways to heal, and you will be so much stronger as a person for having been through this. I promise.¬† Just give it time, practice patience, and be kind to yourself during this process. talk to professionals, talk to family, talk to friends. they love you, they aren‚Äôt going to judge you.¬† good luck, cowboy up, and be kind.\n\nA year ago I took cbd because of back pain and ¬†had the worst trip. And after it leaving out of my system I instantly started having anxiety everyday including heart palpitations. And unfortunately I still deal with it from time to time, looking for different ways to heal this part of me. I somewhat feel paranoid and overthinking sometimes but I learn how to shift my mindset when that happens. I truly believe that it will get better!¬†\n\nSame thing happened to me after one ketamine treatment four months ago\n\nIt unlocked panic ( in bed for 4 days), derealization, obsessive thoughts\n\nIt has slowly gotten better over the past four months. Lexapro has been a big help. Therapy has helped some\n\nSweetheart,¬† I think youre just panicking. Also, get your thyroid function checked out because unbalanced thyroids can cause you to feel a lump in your throat. Can I tell you something? What the devil meant for your bad, God meant it for your good! If you had of enjoyed the gummies, who is to say that you wouldn't be addicted or wanted to try more. God blocked it, because you are chosen with a purpose! You are going to be just fine! You are heal in the name of Jesus! Don't touch anything like that again. Don't be scared okay, God got you. Speak over your mind every day.¬†This is your time to rise above. It's time for you to take action! You can only deal, feel, and heal mentally when you take control of your mind. Your body reacts on the movement of your mind because everything we do is developed from a thought, so take action, and let‚Äôs keep killing the mind games.¬† (2 Corinthians 10 3-5 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.¬† For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, amen\n\nI've smoked weed on and off for years and can tell you from experience the first time you try it it is a horrible experience for some people. The panic attacks can become serious and last for days if you keep thinking about it.¬† in reality you will be okay and that's what you need to know. If you stop smoking or eating edibles for just a month or so you will experience the same thing over again once you smoke or eat edibles again but for people who smoke more often they won't feel the panic or anxiety any longer and actually feel better. In my opinion weed is just no good for you too bad it took years for me to find this out. My problem is it damaged my lungs since I also smoked cigarettes. In due time everything will be ok üòä..¬† keep your mind busy on other things it will go away\n\nIt will lessen over time. Here‚Äôs my story if you‚Äôre anything like me. I used to smoke daily for 6-7 years and one bad session gave me severe anxiety and paranoia. That same physical feeling you explain, a ball in my throat and stomach and feeling cold even though I was sweating. I had to quit my job and start working from home because I would panic around other people, lol. My anxiety was worst outside or with people. That feeling lasted for a couple of years, slowly lessening over time.¬†\nA few years later, im not back to normal. I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm in a constant state of anxiety and occasionally have panic attacks or go into a severely paranoid state, I will probably never go back to the way I was beforehand but can live a normal life for the most part! Definitely can‚Äôt smoke or take edibles anymore though. Or any type of stimulants / upper type drug. Very very bad idea.¬†\n\nXanax helped me out A LOT but that ended up with a nasty addiction so wouldn‚Äôt recommend unless you‚Äôre having a severe panic attack. Those withdrawals and the money wasted are not worth anything.¬†\n\nI really hate that you went through this, but glad you shared your story. This happened to me on 02/24/2023. Was at a birthday party and took an edible and everything was fine at first. Felt giggly and silly. Shortly after, my brain felt all tingly and I started to sweat. Felt so dizzy and thought standing up to go outside for fresh air was the answer. WRONG? I collapsed as soon as I got to the exit door. Not sure how long I was out. Doubt it was very long at all. When I came to, dozens of people were surrounding me, trying to get me to wake up. I was so disoriented. Went to the hospital and everything. Luckily, I didn't hit my head. Emotionally and mentally? Haven't been the old me since. I remember feeling somber the next day. Was very emotional and not myself. I had trouble sleeping, then the panic attacks, depression and anxiety came. I felt claustrophobic all of time. Started seeing a therapist and got on a SSRI. Tried to come off of it in March 2024 because I felt back to me. Was sleeping better, appetite was back and all, but d&amp;a came back shortly after weaning off. After getting back on meds and still seeing my therapist, I feel great. Reduced my dosage of meds, but staying on them for a while. Healing is a journey, not a race. Don't feel bad if you need to take meds for a while or see a therapist. It's all a part of your journey. This is self-care. Don't dwell on the past: \"What if I didn't take that edible?\" \"I wish I could go back.\" etc.,. Nothing good comes from that. You've been through something pretty sh\\*tty and you're grieving the person you were prior to this experience. There are stages of grief when something like this happens. Not trying to be preachy at all. I just want to encourage you. It gets better and you're not alone.\n\nThis happened to me about 5 years ago. It eventually went away. I began taking prozac and doing therapy. but I personally think it really triggered my anxiety and caused me to become medicated.\n\nThis happened to me last year!!  I took an edible with my sister and I greened out while also having a panic attack (two things I‚Äôve never experienced before).  For me, I actually did get to calling the ambulance cause I kept thinking I was dying.  Either my heart felt too fast or too slow and I remember being unable to move for a short amount of time.  Everything felt lagged as well lol.  It was horrible and I see it as the worst day of my life.  I‚Äôve always told it to my friends as a funny story but in reality I felt very dissociated for a few months afterwards.  I developed a panic disorder because I was in constant fear that I was going to have another panic attack.  I think that my brain misinterpreted any bit of anxiety to what I felt that night, it was seriously awful.  I somehow got back into things, but now that it is around the same time again as I did last year, I‚Äôve lowkey been getting very anxious again.  You‚Äôre not alone in this though!! A lot of people go through an experience like this, I heard that there are places you can go for a very short amount of time to treat/cope with disassociation.  I know you probably feel hopeless rn because maybe life doesn‚Äôt feel real, but I promise you that you will learn to navigate these emotions eventually!!  I can definitely say I quit smoking after that experience though, but don‚Äôt let it control you!! You got this!!\n\nWas that the first time you‚Äôd ever had them? Or a stronger dose than you‚Äôd usually take? ¬†I‚Äôve only ever smoked weed twice and both times I was already drunk so couldn‚Äôt notice the weed having any effect on me (other than remembering a tingling sensation?ü§∑üèΩü§∑üèΩ) and as far as gummies, only a maybe quarter piece of one, which had zero effect on me. ¬†Anyway, I hope you‚Äôre doing well and have a handle on it. Take care.¬†\n\nThis happened to me! It will pass. Exposure therapy for the win.\n\nHad a similar encounter after getting high after smoking with friends. Had a panic attack myself which I‚Äôm assuming you did as well.\n\nI assure you that I got a lot better for a long time after a changed mindset and/or medication. I‚Äôm not sure how but I am trying to change my reaction to my bad thoughts again to get back on track\n\npussy man up\n\nGet a grip üòÇ\n\nLiterally me, and for almost half a year now I am in this persistent dissociative state. When will it end üò≠\n\nI had a bad trip few days ago and i felt like this even 2 days later after i took the edible i still felt weird but what helped me come back was taking (herbs) chlorophyll and gingko biloba on an empty stomach. Since the thc goes into your blood i figured i should take chlorophyll since chlorophyll cleans your blood and gingko biloba since gingko biloba helps blood flow to the brain. Within 2 hours it felt like i regained my consiousness. Hope you see this.\n\nHow you getting on mate. Sounds like you were petrified but instead of turning to stone you developed extreme anxiety.  It happens sometimes. I would advise not using cannabis again just incase you scare yourself into psychosis or schizophrenia.\n\nAnxiety is scary but youll be okay for sure. May take abit of time to get your brain running smoothly again but try your best to relax and stay relaxed.\n\nNobodys ever died from cannabis. You defo just had a panic attack.\n\nHow is your body symptoms? Do you feel nauseous? Do you still have dizziness or vertigo?\n\nIt‚Äôs sad because I haven‚Äôt been myself ever since I took it I‚Äôve had got diagnosed with ptsd and anxiety and panic attacks now I feel derealzation I feel like imma go I. To pycsoics¬†\n\nI know this old, but I can totally relate. Took too many Delta 9 gummies recently and had the most horrifying psychosis of my life. Mind you I was also very sleep deprived, so it was just beyond mental\n¬†It was like psychosis mixed with OCD, and they were bleeding into each other, and feeding off one another. It felt like another reality was merged with my own. There were all of these weird coincidences, and Everytime the thoughts got too intense I'd hear the neighbors being very loud. Basically almost every insecurity, and anxiety of mine looped and looped and looped, but it felt like every bad thought was 100% true. I also was convinced that I was living in a simulation (which is possible) and that I did horrible unspeakable crimes. I also had super weird brain sensations that played off of the delusions, and we're also accompanied by auditory hallucinations. Being around a fan really set them off too. This all lasted for 24 hours, and the intensity would go in and out. I'd feel fine for a couple minutes, but then I'd go back into the insane thought loops. It was whiplash hell, and my heart was beating so fast that I could barely breathe at times. I've had Delta 9 psychosis, but this was just another level. The last time I had too much I kind of went manic, but this time the depression and anxiety have been crippling. I can barely eat, or sleep anymore. I don't feel normal. Well I've never felt normal, but this is just too much to handle sometimes.¬†\n\nHey, I'm currently going through this right now. My anxiety was also greatly exacerbated as a result of the experience. While I am doing a lot better than I was 4 months ago (thank you therapist, family, friends, and co-workers), I'm no longer experiencing regular panic attacks, no longer feeling dizzy or out of body, I am still suffering severe insomnia and because I also deal with health anxiety in general, I am obsessing over it which is in turn making it worse. I'm speaking with a psychiatrist (on the 23rd of January as of writing) soon to get this figured out to try and break the cycle. The thing about anxiety is, if you don't get enough sleep, it gets worse thus feeding the cycle and it hurts. With that in mind it does get better and you have to trust the process. If anybody has any advice on insomnia I would greatly appreciate that, especially the part that involves not hyper fixating on it because that is so much easier said than done.\n\nDawg I take eddibles frequently, I had these cherry cola gummies. I accidentally ate 350-400. They were so good, I felt my heart rate speed it scared tf out of me. I thought they were laced , but then I remembered they were out the dispo.\n\n this happened after i took an edible, and it completely messed me up. i was watching yellowjackets while i was high for the first time, and for some reason, i convinced myself i was gonna start sleepwalking and doing insane stuff like one of the characters in the show. i have literally never sleepwalked in my life, but i got so freaked out that i started tying myself to my bed and sleeping with my mom (i was 17 lol). i also refused to sleep in my own room for months. on top of that, i thought i was dead or in a coma. it lasted for so long, and it was honestly the scariest thing i‚Äôve ever been through.\n\nI did an edible 3 years ago and till this day I don't feel the same it felt like I died that night and I'm in a dream but even now its like it gets worse I cant eat anything thinking ima get drugged or if someone put weed in anything or even if I drink something it scares me that fear of being in that high again and sometimes I sit stil and it makes me panic cause ill feel high and have to use hot water to relax myself..... it fucking sucks so much i just want it to go away feel normal again\n\nI did this yesterday and my good the feelings I had were horrific, i thought for sure i was going to die and I was having some insane fucked up thoughts. Still 24 hours later and I still feel high. I will say it was like I was in hell for like 4 hours it was terrible. I took some kratom today and it seems to balance everything back out,but hopefully that not justa temp fix. God that sucked hard, wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy\n\nI took two 10 mg gummies about 8 months ago too and I sat in the fetal position like a little baby. Almost crying, freaking out and panicking. I had to have my girlfriend come get behind me and run my shoulder and tell me everything's going to be okay and I just could not stop thinking the most negative awful s***. Never again.\n\nI experienced a similar adverse reaction after ingesting three edibles simultaneously, a decision I now recognize as extremely ill-advised. For the initial three to four hours, the effects were intense and seemingly positive. However, the subsequent comedown was profoundly unpleasant.\n\nI developed a sensation of chest heaviness, as if under significant pressure. This was accompanied by numbness in the chest area, resulting in a diminished sense of physical connection. I also experienced intermittent, sharp chest pains, which led me to believe I was experiencing a cardiac event.\n\nI attempted to contact emergency services, but was informed of a three-hour wait time due to NHS resource constraints. Consequently, I opted for private transportation to the hospital. Medical staff conducted radiographic and blood analyses, which revealed no physiological abnormalities. It was concluded that I had likely experienced a severe reaction to the high dose of edibles, potentially exacerbated by a panic or anxiety attack.\n\nThree days later, I continue to experience cardiovascular discomfort. Even minimal physical exertion results in tachycardia and a general sense of unease\n\ntook edibles for months.  never bothered me. i stopped. then woke mid night hyperventilating. chest felt nervous. headaches. finally i feel normal. took a good 3 weeks.  they were strong edibles cause i like taking at night getting totally messed up. i don't drink. but now i don't want anything.\n\nThis is an old post but wow same things happens to me. I smoked once and had a panic attack and months after that I kept having panic attacks at random times"

    "body": "I just started propranolol today, 10mg, and it feels like MAGIC, after years of being on SSRIs/meditation/relaxation/CBT/ACT/etc. My heart rate moderated, my intense anxiety body sensations like chills, tremors, went away. I estimate now that 90% of my severe work anxiety was caused by fear to adrenaline-triggered body sensations, and only 10% was triggered by my thoughts. \n\nI feel I finally have a fighting chance. CBT works better. Breathing works better. SSRIs keep doing their thing. I almost took benzos out of desperation‚Ä¶.maybe I don‚Äôt need them.\n\nIt is almost impossible to beat adrenaline when it‚Äôs working incorrectly and overwhelmingly. Propranolol is massively helping. It cuts the mind &gt; body &gt; mind vicious cycle, and allows me to do the mental work. \n\nIt is insulting and enraging that this beta blocker is not prescribed more to eligible patients. A lot of suffering can be avoided. ‚ÄúOnly‚Äù reducing the physical symptoms can be a massive win. I cannot understand how doctors don‚Äôt get that breaking the feedback loop between mind and body CAN allow the patient to better tackle the root cause of their anxiety.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in the fence, my advice is take the propranolol. Try it on a low dose. Consult your doctor if needed. It‚Äôs safe, and might also give you a fighting chance against the monster of chronic anxiety.\n\nEdit: thank your /r/Anxiety community because I found out about propranolol because of you.",

    "all_comment_text": "It helps.me.extremely well with anger too.\n\nI notice that too. I‚Äôm much better able to think rationally, respond well to others. \n\nWhy isn‚Äôt this prescribed to eligible patients is beyond me, and feels like professional malpractice.\n\nI used it for anxiety and panic attacks and did not find it helpful.  But I was in some pretty severe distress at that time, and wonder if I‚Äôd find it more helpful now-I am going to run it past my doctor when I see him tomorrow.\n\nI had a similar experience, and like you, I‚Äôm not in such severe distress now. The propranolol has made a huge difference. Good luck.\n\nDamn I need me some I‚Äôve been so fucking pissed off all the time since quit drinking\n\nYeah that's what I did before getting on it. Drink. Alcohol affects the same receptor as xanax etc Gaba-A.\n\nAlso look into gabapentin and NAC.  They helped me so much when I stopped drinking.\n\nHey man, congrats to you on quitting drinking. I can tell you that the anger subsides over time, your body is adjusting to the change in chemistry.\n\nIt's uncomfortable but you can get through it, and you'll be glad you did.\n\nHey thx it was just gonna be a temporary thing until my body healed but I kinda like keeping track and watching the number grow\n\nBe sure to pay attention and take note of the positive changes. Just waking up without a hangover and dread is a blessing in itself\n\nCouldn‚Äôt agree more with OP. It completely erased my situational anxiety. I can‚Äôt believe doctors kept trying to give me Ativan, which did absolutely nothing. Propranolol stops the physical symptoms which somehow makes the mental aspect better. I wonder what‚Äôs the science behind this. Maybe having our bodies react to anxiety before the mind does or independent of the mind triggers the anxious thoughts?\n\nYes I have read about the Amygdala of the brain being one of the first structures of the brain and works before other functions of the brain. So when heightened, it can react before we even have conscious thought and trigger the fight or flight response. This is why we can have the physical anxiety without the mental anxiety too.\n\n‚ÄúThe Amygdala‚Ä¶can react before we even have a conscious thought.‚Äù \n\nSuch a good point. I blamed myself often for having negative thoughts. After trying propranolol, it‚Äôs so easy to see my conscious thoughts were not truly triggering the adrenaline; they were normal, brief thoughts, positive/negative. But the adrenaline would trigger automatically, due to something deeper, ‚Äúmechanically‚Äù flood the body and magnify that conscious thought into a crisis / panic attack. All too fast for rational thought to modify.\n\nI now see mor e clearly this concept of ‚Äúthe trauma lives in the body‚Äù, or at least in more ancient structures like the amygdala, and no reasonable amount of conscious thought and mindfulness can fix those automatic chemical invasions of the body. \n\nLowering the effect of adrenaline levels the playing field.\n\nWell it's actually to lower high blood pressure it helps blood flow better.. when anxiety hits your heart pumps harder in your blood flows more because of adrenaline. As this being a blood thinner it helps the blood flow in the heart pump better and is less stress on the body therefore it only helps physically not mentally. But everything works with itself mind works with body body works with mind. If the physical side effects aren't there it's easier to deal with the mental aspect of it .. what triggered it.¬† This is what I believe after using it for a year.\n\ndo you think it helps with the mental symptoms of anxiety too? or would you say it‚Äôs mostly helping the physical\n\nIt helps the physical, but it's amazing what that does for the mental aspect. It's worth a try if you can.\n\nExactly. Both are connected, and reducing the physical aspects can have massive mental benefits too.\n\nI would say it helps a lot - my body isn‚Äôt constantly reminding me that I am anxious. It allows me to forget or to think about things more rationally, as needed.\n\nIt's not psychoactive.  Just slows the old heart down a bit.  Some people feel it does help break the negative feedback loop from feeling physically unwell to causing metal anxiety though.I'm curious if you feel it's as amazing after a few tries.\n\nIt does if your mental symptoms are triggered by bodily sensations.\n\nFor me it did nothing to bring down the anxiety of my brain it brought my heart rate down which still didn't help my anxiety because my body wasn't what was giving me anxiety it was my brain\n\nwere you able to find a different medicine that helped at all?\n\nIt doesn't directly affect mental only physical. But when you are less of an external mess it helps you internally.\n\nI tried it and for me it didn‚Äôt help mental symptoms at all.   Maybe it works if the physical symptoms cause mental symptoms?\n\nthat‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking, i need a medication that can help the mental and brain function. my thoughts are quite literally killing me.\n\nThat would be a benzo or SSRI, not a beta blocker.\n\nIt definitely helps, but not directly. To help us understand the world, our brain is a \"meaning making\" machine. It works to interpret the signals it receives.¬†\n\nSo, how does it interpret a rapid increase in heart rate, increased cortisol, sweating, blood pressure?\n\nIt looks for context. Oh, I'm about to start the big game. Brains says, \"this is amazing! All is well.\"\n\nBut if there is no obvious explanation, like when some of us get an adrenaline dump over little things, the brain says, \"Threat Alert! Anxious! Fear! Attack!\"\n\nBy lowering our physiological reaction through propranolol, our \"meaning making\" brain interprets our status as \"all is well.\"\n\nI only use it now - AS REQUIRED - it definitely helps\n\nPropranolol saved my life. I will shout from the rooftops about it to anyone who will listen. I always considered myself to have severe anxiety and panic disorder starting in early childhood (I was literally getting cardio workups in kindergarten!), but it‚Äôs amazing how easy it is to manage anxious thoughts when your body‚Äôs adrenaline response is not on overdrive. Similar to you, I was also angry when I realized just how well it worked when I had been suffering for years. \n\nFor me, I love that I can take it for work presentations etc, and feel sharp as a tack. I always hated that loopy feeling benzos would give me. Defeats the purpose if I‚Äôm trying to function at a high level\n\nWho can I ask for this? PCP or cardiologist?\n\nThank you for posting. I too have been battling trauma from a very young age. How often are you taking this and what is your dosage.¬†\n\nWhen it was first prescribed to me I was in a much worse place with my anxiety, so I was taking it every day, 3x a day. I started at 10mg and was bumped up to 20mg.\n\nThat was about six years ago. Now I take it as needed- maybe a few times a month. I take it preemptively before anxiety inducing situations (giving work talks, getting on an airplane) and occasionally if I have a panic attack. It does take ~20 min to kick in, but since I know it‚Äôs coming I can usually breathe through the 20 min. Most of the time though, just knowing I have the bottle in my bag is enough to get me through quite a bit.\n\nI have had a few flare ups in the past few years where I‚Äôve bumped back up to 3x a day every day use. But for the most part I‚Äôve been able to stay at taking as needed.\n\nI hope that helps!!\n\nMy only fear is that I have bad health anxiety and I‚Äôve read that people who have that don‚Äôt do well with propranolol because they notice their heart rate getting low in situations it should be elevated and they panic. Have you noticed that it significantly drops your heart rate or does it just keep it in normal range?\n\nHey, I had health anxiety and propranolol actually HELPED me. It quietened the noisy part of my brain which in turn helped me rationalise what was happening to me. I felt perfectly normal and healthy again, in fact I stopped thinking about my heart rate because it just faded into the background.\n\nDitto to this!\n\nSame what's your dosage\n\nFor me, it brings it back from a panicky 80-90s resting heart rate to a 60-70s range. If you‚Äôre anxious, start with a low dose, and get an Apple Watch or any heartbeat tracker. Then keep an eye. It starts working after just 15-30min. After 2-3 tries, you‚Äôll understand how it works.\n\nmy resting heart rate is 90-100 lol.\n\n:) I always felt I had a high rating heart rate with 80-90s. I have to say 70s feels great, and I feel my heart making much less work, anxiety attacks averted, and my mind and body more relaxed. No other side effects for me so far.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to jinx it talking too much about it, but seems to be working.\n\n80-90s is still normal range\n\n\"Resting heart rate\" is different than where your heart rate sit while at rest. It's more of an average. For example, my heart rate is at 80-90 BPM often, but my \"resting heart rate\" (per my monitor) is 62.\n\n80-90s is how my heart always runs I am surprised to hear someone call it panicky. Maybe high 90s can start to feel slightly and vaguely uncomfortable. Panic attack is 120+ for me.\n\nFor me, intrusive thoughts start when I feel my heart pounding at 90s. My mind ‚Äúvalidates‚Äù whatever catastrophic thought it‚Äôs thinking of because of the higher heart rate. With a lower heart rate in the 60-70s, and less adrenaline body sensations, my mind just lets go.\n\nSo relate to that description\n\nSame, my resting pulse dropped around the same amount. Feels a lot better physically throughout the day.\n\nI don't take meds but if I did, I'd start with a lower dose to try it. One option, could discuss with doctor. Some did mention this might be a very safe medication, obviously do your own research if you want.\n\nSome meds can actually be good for longevity so also consider the positives.\n\nYeah, you know I think that it is what happened with me. I tend to get panic attacks a lot. It made me feel really off. Also cold medicine like Benadryl gives me extreme physical anxiety if that has anything to do with it.\n\nThis is why I stopped taking it. The lower heart rate would send me into a panic spiral that I was dying. I definitely could feel the difference.\n\nMy anxiety is based on my HR being low to begin with, so anything that further slows it down is no bueno\n\nMy mom took a beta blocker and it worsened her asthma. I have not taken propranolol yet.\n\nI had health anxiety the first and only time I tried it. I felt a jolt to my heart about 15min after I took it. Heart instantly slowed right down. I was sweating and nervous like crazy but kept myself distracted and after I looked back and all in all it worked well. I ended up actually feeling calmer for a few hours.\n\nI still don't like that it needs to effect the heart though too lol.\n\nI had really bad health anxiety when i took it , i did worry a lot at first before taking it and i was worried about a low heart rate as well , but it was fine . I took it occasionally as needed and it helped tremendously with my heart related health anxiety as well since i started being less aware of it .\n\nHealth anxiety is my primary mental health concern, and propranolol has been a godsend\n\nI've felt a lot of anxiety is physical. Days you're good, bad thoughts don't become intrusive.\n\nThanks for sharing.\n\n100% agree with this.\n\nGiving me hope. I‚Äôve had bad anxiety 10 years and just got prescribed 10mg\n\nMe too. Im nervous but hopeful. Not sure why it took me 6+ years toget it subscribed though\n\nSame\n\nI'm glad you found it and that it's helping you so much. I had a similar positive experience with it. My skills from CBT, DBT, ACT etc have been a lot easier to implement when my adrenaline levels aren't giving me \"trapped in a burning room\" feelings. Turns out I also have some mild abnormal heart rhythm stuff which is treated with beta blockers so double win. \n\nI'm also surprised that it's not prescribed more. I have a bunch of friends with anxiety and high blood pressure and encourage them to talk to their doctors about it. The dominant anxiety treatment model has so much focus on anxiety related thoughts, everything from the neck down often gets overlooked.\n\nI‚Äôve been curious about trying it. I got scared because I looked into seeing if it would help with that air hunger feeling and I read that propranolol affects the lungs as well and can make some people feel breathless. Which I feel would cause a full blown panic attack if that happened‚Ä¶ but I guess I don‚Äôt know til I try\n\nYou might want to try a super low dose like 5mg, or 10mg, and see how it goes. Only if your blood pressure, heart rate are not too low.\n\nI started taking it specifically for constant air hunger (like it even happens while I‚Äôm sleeping) and it helps tremendously! I am sensitive to most meds so I started at 5mg but it does the trick for me. It‚Äôs definitely worth a shot!\n\nI don‚Äôt know if this is worth anything but your comment regarding blocking the body response so that the mind doesn‚Äôt loop back into anxiety is very insightful. \n\nI actually noticed this with acid blockers. \n\nThat initial twinge of fear, terror, and anxiety starts in the stomach, then immediately shoots up your vagus nerve into your brain. That‚Äôs where the loop begins. At least for me. \n\nAnd I noticed that when I had taken something like Pepcid, or omeprazole, the twinge in the stomach wasn‚Äôt happening at all. (I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a sudden excretion of acid or what). But when that was blocked, the vagus nerve thing never happened, and the brain inflammation/stimulation never happened. And I was kind of shocked. \n\nObviously you probably don‚Äôt wanna pop Acid blockers when you have an anxiety attack, but I immediately noticed what you‚Äôre talking about from another angle.\n\nVery interesting indeed. It‚Äôs so obvious once you experience it. Many doctors‚Äô inability to think just one step ahead about the mind &gt; body &gt; mind feedback loop is astounding.\n\ndamn thats exactly what happens to me it starts in the middle of my stomach. I take omeprazole does nothing my anxiety is so extreme at this point. Propranolol did however stop that feeling in the stomach\n\nI have another one to add to this thread - guanfacine aka Intuniv - it‚Äôs prescribed for adhd for some reason, but it has worked so well for my anxiety. Makes me feel calm and level headed. Of course as with everything there are potential side effects, but I haven‚Äôt had any. Ask your doctor about it!\n\nPropranolol does absolutely nothing for my anxiety. I had high hopes for it. Maybe it‚Äôs because I compare everything to Xanax‚Äôs effect and nothing seems to touch it.\n\nPropranolol is so fantastic.  Physically calms you down like a benzo without the sleepiness and risk for addiction. Plus it‚Äôs been around forever and is generally well tolerated.\n\n100% right there with you. After dealing with being agoraphobic for 7+ years unmedicated I was just put on Propranolol about a week ago. Taking it has been a fucking GODSEND. I made it to the Dr again and experienced what a full blown panic attack was like on propranolol and it's night and day. The only symptom I get now is extreme dizziness.\n Only when I'm having a panic attack.\n\nIts the dizziness that would put me off taking it. I feel like thats incapacitating.\n\nDizziness only happens during the panic attack. Dizziness happens during my panic attacks with or without the medication. Every other physical aspect of panic is destroyed. It's the exact opposite of incapacitating.\n\nOhhhh i see\n\nEveryone is using propranolol now it's great. I'm seeing more and more posts day after day how it's changing lives.\n\nIt can really be life changing. I‚Äôm surprised doctors do not even suggest it that often - and hoping that changes too.\n\nIve taken propr for about months. When i first took it my anxiety was the worst it could ever be even in my safe space. My main issues were panic attacks, heart racing and problems communication and socialising in open public. I have quiet severe anxiety and was always scared to try ssri antidepr ect. I tried propr 10mg first time i got side effects the first few days then it kicked in. My anxiey vanished like it never exsisted no more feeling scared for no reason and my panic attacks were not exsist. I also was partially scared i would not feel my heart rate but i got used to it. These tablets worked for a few months as i was not taking them daily. I can never forget how free i felt it was like a magic pill that gave me my confidence back. After months of taking it, i started to sleep more than usual during the day, i also suffered from memory loss. Nothing is free sadly but i would still take it again. The days i didnt take it i felt so depressed. And overall i was put in situations where my anxiety would shoot up even my heart rate and thats when i realised i needed to up my dose but i never did because i stopped taking them. When i stopped taking them i got heart palpitations and when i did take them and was having a panic attack i got zaps in chest. I also did take the tablet during exercise and running. i actually felt at times it helped my breathing. Overall i would still take them again just to be able to function. My advice would be dont stop them cold turkey :) all the best\n\nLiterally aside effects of prop is depression.\n\nIt made me panic even more, but my dr was confused by this so i seem to be an outlier.\n\nThis is my fear and how meds usually work with me/opposite or metabolize them inefficiently. I'm sorry\n\nReally , I couldn't stand it. So far only benzos have actually worked for me. I tend to get an adverse reaction to a lot of meds. But glad it works for you.\n\nMy internet-corrupted brain has to be occasionally reminded that CBT is most often referencing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and not that OTHER thing... Glad you've got a medication regimen that works. Good luck, TTFN and I hope my initial thought gave you a chuckle.\n\nThis shit saved my life. I'm glad it's working for you!\n\nThank you! It has been making a huge difference.\n\nDoes it help you guys driving?\n\nYes - very much so. Most, if not all, of my anxiety and panic attacks stem from my car. The highway, being in intense traffic and not being able to get off the highway, driving far away, driving for a long time, driving fast, driving somewhere in unfamiliar with, the list goes on and on.\n\nStarting take 10mg of prop as needed when I knew I‚Äôd be driving on the highway or far away, etc. and it helped tremendously. Better than I could have imagined. I‚Äôd take it about 45 minutes before getting in my car and I have an Oura ring that tracks my heart rate and it would literally say I was in ‚Äúrest and restore‚Äù mode while driving. HR used to be in the 100s while driving, now 60-80 at most.\n\nBest part too is it doesn‚Äôt make you loopy or drowsy like a benzo. I‚Äôd personally never drive on a benzo and so propranolol has been the best alternative by far. Highly recommend.\n\nI've not had a single panic attack in the 8 months I've been on Propranolol. I went from nightly attacks caused by my extreme health anxiety to realizing weeks after starting that I hadn't suffered a single one. I didn't even realize it. My anxious thoughts just kind of melted away. My super ventricular tachycardia is totally under control now, as well as my heart palpitations.\n\nThis is so encouraging. Really glad it‚Äôs helping you - hope it continuous to work.\n\nYep.  Godsend drug. I always put the caveat that it does make exercising hard.  But that‚Äôs why I only use it when I need it.\n\nThis gives me a lot of hope - I‚Äôll ask about switching. I always have told my therapist I only have physical symptoms - I‚Äôm often not remotely anxious in my head,  but if something alerts my body Into some wild fight or flight, off I go into a panic attack. I‚Äôd love to exist in my own skin\n\nI just started it last week and it is entirely hit or miss. Sometimes 10mg makes me melt into a puddle of comfort. Sometimes it just gives me heartburn.\n\nAnd it doesn't do much about stomach upset, which is my primary physical symptom (especially in the morning).\n\ni wanted to try these but i‚Äôm scared they stop my heart or make more more anxious lol! the curse of anxiety\n\nIt was a magic bullet for me when I was unemployed due to redundancy and experiencing multiple daily panic attacks.\n\nPropranolol changed my life, no joke. Of course, still deal with ruminations/anxieties/bad thoughts but, like you said, I can easily relax and breath through it. \n\nIt seriously transformed who I am and I feel I finally have a grip on my life. \n\nAbsolutely bonkers to me that this is not more widely prescribed‚Ä¶ but then again.. all hail big pharma :(\n\nAnyways- I‚Äôm happy for you and rooting for your progress!üå±üëç\n\nI was just prescribed this last week by my therapist and I took my first dose today. I went to a store, started to feel myself disassociating/derealizing (which happens a lot under florescent lights) and got that panicky feeling in my throat and heart rate skyrocketed. So I went home, took my first Propranolol, and wow, I feel like I could cry. I started to feel my body relax within 20 min. My mind is still foggy, but I can actually handle it bc my body is calm.\n\nI agree. I suffer from PTSD, Generalized anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder with¬† anxiety. Just a thought, a memory, knowing I'm going to be in a certain situation sends my body into overdrive. My heart pounds my hands shake and then I start getting racing thoughts.. propeanolol is a lifesaver for me. Once PTSD and anxiety symptoms begins and my heart rate goes up there are times that it will not go down at all for hours but when I take this it will ease in an hour and I can begin recovering mentally.\n\nI had a similar eye opener with clonidine.\n\nHas anyone tried this and guanfacine?  Not at the same time of course, but curious how they differ.  Thanks!\n\nGuanfacine (and clonidine) are alpha2 agonists. They activate the negative feedback mechanism that reduces the release of neurotransmitters like noradrenaline. \n\n  \nAdrenaline and noradrenaline are the main neurotransmitters of the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system controls the fight or flight mechanism which has a huge role in anxiety. \n\nThere are alpha receptors and beta receptors that adrenaline and noradrenaline bind to. \n\n  \nDrugs like propranolol are beta blockers and block the beta receptors so adrenaline and noradrenaline can't activate them\n\nDrugs like prazosin are alpha blockers and block the alpha receptors so adrenaline and noradrenaline can't activate them\n\nDrugs like guanfacine reduce the amount of adrenaline and noradrenaline that gets released in the first place.\n\nThis is super helpful. If Guanfacine was helpful in reducing anxiety, would be it fair to say that propranolol would help as well?  My spouse has failed pretty much every single anti depressant and anti anxiety med, Guanfacine is the only that that's worked consistently but it's not doing quite enough. The hyper vigilance is really killing him.  Thank you!\n\nIt definitely calmed my physical symptoms but apparently beta blockers destroy my already fragile ability to sleep.\n\nSorry to hear. Prozac / fluoxetine caused the sleeping issues for me, adding Propranolol hasn‚Äôt caused any extra sleeping problems. I started melatonin 3mg one hour before bed and it seems to help.\n\nOh, I have autism (was dx at 38) and have never really been able to sleep my whole life. I‚Äôve been on sleep meds that help about 75-80% of the time and pretty much everything but a benzo ruins the sleep I do get. \nI had a 4 page list of failed meds with my psychiatrist, I go back tomorrow. SSRIs are a nightmare for me, as are antipsychotics. My anxiety is largely sensory related and now that I‚Äôm perimenopausal, everything is so much worse.\n\nOmggggg this is meeeee \nI was able to manage by 30 figured out how to be okay and could be med free but at 40 I started perimenopause ( didn't know at the time) and all of a sudden all my tools were useless and I almost ended up in the hospital from not being able to eat( gut /brain connection eating seemed to be a trigger) had endless \"panic attack\" for about 6 ish weeks and lost so much weight I was going to be hospitalized. Got put on a low dose of Lexapro which made it worse but then I seemed to be \" fine\". That was 3 years ago I think. After I found out I was likely experiencing perimenopause it helped me figure things out but I still have attacks every night tuft as I am falling asleep. I'm too scared to try to figure out hormone therapy. I have never been formerly diagnosed as autistic but my oldest and and definitely my youngest have. Learning about it thru them I for sure am. I'm sorry you are going thru this. Literally it's so cruel and I don't really have any answers.\n\nSame here. I know it doesn't solve the problem, but it's mostly stopped my panic attacks from getting unmanageable.\n\nI am beyond jealous.  I asked my doctor for this last month but she refused because I was on too many medications already.  The way she put it was \"They all work on the same part of the brain so there is no need to try it cause you already are on two of them\"\n\nI am so pissed.  I really thought this might help with my physical symptoms...\n\nThat‚Äôs frustrating from your doc. I know many people take propranolol alongside SSRIs for example, did she say it would be dangerous because of the combo you are already on?\n\nNot exactly dangerous but I am taking Hydroxyzine for sleep, Gabapentin as needed and Klonopin for emergencies.  She asked me which one I would give up if I had to and I said probably Hydroxyzine.  Then she was like \"I'm not gonna do that\" lmao...it's like than why did you ask me.  I think she was just concerned that insurance company would be wondering why I am on so many medications that are trying to treat the same symptoms ( anxiety in my case ) so they would be wondering if they aren't working why am I still on them.\n\nGosh, that‚Äôs so strange - she doesn‚Äôt want you to try a different med that could potentially work? I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs so annoying! Is insurance quite strict where you are?\n\nRight?  I went in confident that I would be prescribed if I asked since it‚Äôs very safe/non habit forming.  I was visibly angry with her but kept it together lol.\n\nI‚Äôm in the US and don‚Äôt have the best health insurance but they haven‚Äôt given me too much trouble as far as what medications they have paid for.\n\nFWIW, there are 3 different classes of sympatholytics, which are drugs that inhibit the sympathetic nervous system (which is the aspect of the nervous system that causes fight or flight).\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatholytic#Anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatholytic#Anxiety)\n\n* Beta blockers like propranolol\n* Alpha2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine\n* alpha blockers like prazosin\n\nAll 3 classes of sympatholytics are used to treat things like anxiety, trauma related nightmares and PTSD.\n\nAs a caveat, all 3 of these drugs are used to lower blood pressure. So if you already have low blood pressure that could be a problem.\n\nI've been at 40mg twice a day for quite a while and it is definitely a life saver\n\nDo you get fatigued? Tried my 40mg today and noticed I was very tired all day¬†\n\nI could have written this. Life changing.\n\nI totally agree with tackling the physical symptoms to make it easier to address the mental. I use a med that specifically targets excessive sweat and it makes it possible for me to actually function in social settings without the conversation turning to whether I‚Äôm feeling okay.\n\nMy doctor prescribed this and Escitalopram (Lexapro) to me. I was to take the propranolol as needed and Lexapro regularly. I ended up discontinuing the propranolol because i didn't really use it. But after reading this and some of the comments here I'm thinking I should reconsider.\n\nduring august i had sever anxiety/panic, i went through doctors, i was sure something was extremely wrong with me, i had tachycardia almost everytime, everytime i stood up, etc etc. During august i had 5 ecgs done, they didnt find anything besides sinus tachycardia, i was put on verapamil for a month until i visited a cardiologist, the cardiologist did another ecg, ultrasound of heart, stress test, i was SURE theyre gonna find something, apart from my high heartrate and blood pressure issues( bp got to 220 during a stress test lol) they didnt find anything, after that, the doc perscribed me bisoprolol, my life changed, no more worrying about the heart, its like my hypochondria became managable, its like im getting my life back, i dont know how beta blockers managed to do that but my anxiety is soooo much better now, physical anxiety symptoms can get SEVERE!\n\nwhats a stress test?\n\nits when youre hooked to an ecg and youre doing a physical activity(for me it was riding a stationary bike) they do this to see how your heart performs under stress\n\n&gt; It's almost impossible to beat adrenaline when it's working incorrectly and overwhelmingly.\n\nThis is the homerun sentence. People telling me to calm down and relax when I'm riding out the adrenaline is near impossible, and it damn near isn't going to get better if you lecture me about it. \n\nCurrently doing a mixture of SSRI (zoloft), CBT/general therapy, breathing/lifestyle changes and I take benzos only when absolutely necessary. \n\nI've never had propranolol though. Do you think it would help with that butterfly in stomach feeling/general dizzy spells?\n\nAgree with your first paragraph fully. Yes, I would bet it would definitely help with the butterfly feeling.¬† Not sure about dizziness because I don‚Äôt have it and I don‚Äôt get it from propranolol. Propranolol complements my SSRI. I read on this subrredit it helps some people cut back significantly on benzos.\n\nPropranolol is very effective but be careful. There is a possibility of severe depression occurring after a couple weeks of use, so just be on the lookout. \n\nIt worked for me, until it didn‚Äôt and I had to come off or I was going to harm myself. It was so bizarre. Within two days off, it was gone.\n\nLexapro saved me from my anxiety/panic.\n\nI‚Äôm glad it gives you relief.  One of the first things my psychiatrist recommended was propranolol.  Obviously along with my others meds.  She made it clear that it can only help with physical symptoms and not the mind.  My psychologist also said the same thing.  I‚Äôve tried it a few times and it did absolutely nothing.  Tried increasing the dosage but still it was useless.  Maybe it works for people with less severe conditions but esp not someone with severe anxiety disorder and CPTSD.  Unfortunately , the only thing that works on spot is benzos but as we all know you can‚Äôt mess with that stuff as it‚Äôs highly addictive.  Then again, every individual reacts differently to these meds.\n\nOh yeah I do 10 mg in the morning and 10 more in the evening. Propranolol is a gift for real\n\nMy anxiety is trauma based. Turns out chilling my body chilled out my mind too finally\n\nExactly. That‚Äôs why I know suspect my anxiety is also trauma based, and stored in the body. Propranolol does exactly that: chills my body, thus chills my mind. In that order.\n\nPropranolol is great and works for my GAD when my anxiety is at like, a 1 to an 8 (out of 10). HOWEVER, when my anxiety is at an 8 to a 10, I‚Äôm super thankful for my alprazolam. I also have panic disorder and PTSD. I experience a lot of scary derealization during and after a panic attack and it seems to be the only thing that can help me calm me down completely. The propranolol alone doesn‚Äôt work very well.\n\nBenzos aren‚Äôt necessarily that horrible if they‚Äôre taken as a last resort. They can be life ruining and awful if not utilized tactfully. I have been taking them like this for years and there have been weeks or a month where I‚Äôm lucky enough not to not have to take them and I feel no negative effects or tolerance issues. I take the lowest dose possible (.25mg) and make sure not to EVER take it more than 3 days in a row and also to make sure to take at least a 3 day break between each time I take it. Usually don‚Äôt ever need it that often, though. \n\nI try all the coping mechanisms I have learned in therapy first then the propranolol, and if that doesn‚Äôt help, then the Xanax.\n\npropranolol is a lifesaver for me - first thing my doc did when i approached him about my social anixety was wack me on it for situations I need it, and oh my god its amazing. i don't shake like a leaf !! my heart doesn't think its running a 100m sprint race !! I can actually stand !! I CAN DO PUBLIC SPEAKING !!!¬†\ni only take it when I need it or know I'm going into a situation that's going to trigger the massive physical response, but its still an amazing thing!¬†\n\n\nreducing the physical symptoms can definitely help a lot, if it wasn't for propranolol I would have never passed my first year of university. the side effects are worth it, I promise !!!\n\n\nso glad it's helping you OP &lt;2\n\nAbsolutely! After a traumatic event completely changed my life, I tried all the benzos and finally asked for Xanax. I have taken it for approximately six years, while also taking medication for Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD. I, too, found out about the benefits of propranolol just a couple weeks ago from my new doctor and have been angry and confused as to why it was not recommended to me years ago. Benzos are defined as ‚Äúdepressive‚Äú drugs, so it shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise that I have never been able to get out of the ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù of depression. My morning anxiety was so bad that I would shake excessively while trying to get ready for work (in my career field &amp; a job I loved ) while feeling extreme nausea. This wasn‚Äôt just a mild event every morning‚Äîit was pure hell. The anxiety, at first, was not about my job; it was about being widowed in my 40s and a perceived lack of complete control over any aspect of my life. Eventually, I could not endure the morning anxiety attacks, and on a particularly bad day, phoned my boss and resigned. I still have morning anxiety and it takes me until noon to actually get up and attempt to be productive. That only adds to my depression. A viscous cycle. Since beginning propranolol, I don‚Äôt have the physical symptoms of anxiety‚Äîshaking, sweating and nausea. Because I‚Äôm not experiencing those, my mind isn‚Äôt triggered to begin the negative, racing thoughts telling me that I cannot handle the day. I‚Äôve been getting out of bed earlier and being more productive. I truly believe that if I had been taking propranolol rather than Xanax, I would not have experienced such horrific morning anxiety &amp; would still be thriving in my career.\n\n#\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt do crap for me and i take 30 mg\n\nIt's probably not appropriate to prescribed a heart medication to everyone. I don't have the physical symptoms of anxiety so much. Maybe the rapid heartbeat but I can breathe it to a calming place.  I have heart issues and this drug could potentially kill me causing too low of blood pressure. I also suffer from syncope(passing out) randomly so also not appropriate for me to take this drug.\n\nSorry to hear. Yes, it‚Äôs important to check you don‚Äôt have any preconditions which bar its use. \n\nFor those who can take it, I‚Äôd definitely consider propranolol as a potential tool in the treatment of anxiety.\n\nYea, I have this wack phenomenon where it feels like I'm panicking through the roof,  and my bp would be 117/ 70 and bpm of like 65.   And yet anxiety so bad I could scream murder.   But there are times out did get crazy high bp and bpms..   but weird\n\nThis is also me HORRIFIC panick attacks and no real increase at all with BP or HR. I run low with both though so sadly don't think propranolol could be an option anyhow. Feels like we're just SOL.\n\nI wanted to add that I definitely for sure know that my anxiety runs all the time in the background but am good at not latching on to it. But I'll get the hit of adrenaline and feel it physically come over me and that's when I have an attack. It is NOT the other was around where my thoughts create a panick attack.\n\nI am prescribed this but haven't taken it in a long time. I think I only taken it once or twice so I don't remember the effects. I've been off all anxiety meds for 4 years but lately I've been having severe panics attacks. Main symptoms are chest pain and high blood pressure. I was thinking of taking it but I lift weights 5 times a week, run 3 times a week and box, so I am concerned with how it will affect my workouts. Any insight is appreciated.\n\nSearch this subreddit. Other runners have reported they are absolutely fine running daily with propranolol. Just have to find the correct dose and frequency. Not sure about lifting weights - but do search, might find some pointers.\n\nEdit: just a thought, since propranolol only acts 4 hours or so, you could take it when panic attacks are more likely, and then lift when its effect runs its course?\n\nI exercise 4-5 days a week. Heavy weights and just walking for me though. No ill effects here üôÇ\n\nI‚Äôve never taken it RIGHT before a workout but I‚Äôve taken it on days/nights before a workout and have never felt impacted\n\nPropranolol, Venlafaxine and Duloxetine all in the system, ready for a productive work day woohoo!\n\nIt‚Äôs my miracle drug too! I tried all sorts of medication and therapy.. nothing worked. Somebody gave me a propranolol for a job interview and it was amazing for me. I went straight to the dr and now I can just go and get it whenever I want!! I wish I‚Äôd found it earlier too! It‚Äôs my life saver!!!\n\nTaking a beta blocker really helped me realize how much I actually need to start taking anxiety meds again. It was amazing to have my physical under control but it showed me just how much mental I have still. I wish it helped me as much as it helped you.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience on the effects of propranolol on depersonalization? I have a prescription for it but haven‚Äôt taken it yet.\n\nI just took my first dose of propranolol today so I‚Äôm definitely no expert. But I battle with derealization weekly, and battled today. The propranolol calmed down my physical symptoms enough that I could better ignore the feelings of derealization, which can help get out of it sooner. I tend to panic when I feel depersonalized, so the propranolol is helping with that today. Just my experience!\n\nI have it, and I just took some. Hopefully it‚Äôll help me calm down. For some reason, it usually doesn‚Äôt slow down my heart rate, but I‚Äôm hoping it will work this time since my anxiety has been so physical tonight.\n\nDid it work?\n\nYeah it actually did. I was so happy lol\n\nI‚Äôm mad I moved off propranolol to try an SSRI because I was MISERABLE on those. Propranolol really helps calm the shaking, heart racing, tummy turning effects of anxiety which in turn helps my brain chill out and think more rationally. \n\nOn top of that it‚Äôs a very safe medicine (as long as you don‚Äôt have low blood pressure), and side effects are basically non-existent. I just started on it again and I‚Äôm so happy\n\nIs this the beta blocker people use for public speaking?\n\nI am going to talk to my doctor about getting it prescribed for situational use.\n\nI used to take Zoloft and my anxiety is flaring up again so I will probably get back on that too.\n\nDo you take the propranolol daily or only when needed?\n\nYes!! I recently started it with venlafaxine and it's been crazy to see how much better I'm feeling even only a few weeks in. I remember two days into taking venlafaxine and using propranolol when I was getting nervous (I only take it when needed) I noticed that my mind was absolutely silent for once. My mind races all the time and since taking it I feel so much calmer because my mind isn't thinking about things all the time. So happy my doctor prescribed me both after Zoloft didn't work.\n\nIs that the beta blockers? I believe I‚Äôve also just been put on them for my hyperthyroidism. I‚Äôve not felt particularly better yet, but I‚Äôm also on my ssris so who knows\n\nGlad it worked for you because years on it did absolutely nothing for me\n\nLOVE this medicine!\n\nIt's helpful but don't overdo it, it isn't magic. I've had a script for 25 years. Very helpful\n\nThank you for the tip. Have you had to increase your dose over the years, or has it remained relatively stable and effective?\n\nI use it PRN so maybe once or twice a week so have never had to increase. I usually take 30mg\n\nOh the only side effect I get is dry mouth\n\nYes!! Exactly this üëÜüèº I saw a Dr that wasn‚Äôt my usual and she put me onto them‚Ä¶ I was like, why wasn‚Äôt this offered to me before now?! Crazy!!\n\nYes!! Propranolol changed my life. no doctor had ever suggested it and I talked to doctors for YEARS about my anxiety symptoms being debilitating. Like 20 years of trying anxiety meds. It's unreal how well they work and how much they do. And you can take them a few times per day as they're very safe. I take a maintenance dose and also take them as needed. literally life changing little orange pill!\n\nHi. I have been taking Propanolol for my tremors and tachycardia for about two years now. Helped my anxiety so good... I went to a heart doctor and they were confused why I was on it since she said it was a heart medication and recommended me to stop taking it. I understand why, I was dealing with very low blood pressure, and Propranolol lowers your BP as well. I never stopped taking it though. My blood pressure improved after getting off 30mg Abilify. I was put on Wellbutrin about 4 months ago. First 2 months were AMAZING. Last 2 months anxiety has been horrible. I take propanolol 3 times a day for anxiety and physical/neurological symptoms. Hoping to solve my anxiety issue... Only solace I get from that is an Ativan or going to the gym.\nALSO I want to specify: Propanolol got rid of the physical symptoms of my anxiety, which changed my life for the better.\n\nI was once on Propranolol for a mood disorder. But it didn't help me, im more depressive than anxious. However It has helped my brother alot and he swears by it. Not a condemnation in anyway. But make sure you don't stop taking propanolol suddenly it reduces your heart rate to help you feel more relaxed. I stopped mine suddenly because i was a bit fed up of medicine at that point because i stopped so suddenly i felt like my heart was racing and had palpitations and convinced myself i was going to have a heart attack because i also had chest pains. It went away once i calmed myself down. So don't be as stupid as i was and cut down gradually if you want to stop taking it. I wish you well on your mental health journey ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWish I could have continued taking this. I have low blood pressure though so it caused me to black out.\n\nthis sounds 1000% like me. one day my adrenaline just started doing me wrong. I have propranolol but have been apprehensive to really give a full dose a chance.\n\nI started at 5mg twice daily for frequent PVCs it really helped for a few months then all the sudden PVCs increased so I‚Äôm currently taking 20mg twice a day. I love it also for my anxiety during stressful situations.\n\nit works for me, i use it as an as needed just in case, but it makes me feel like my heart is slowing down and it isn‚Äôt beating in my ears. It‚Äôs a beta blocker though, so that‚Äôs kinda its job.. I was a little concerned about taking something that slows my heart rate down so I looked it up. (don‚Äôt quote me) but it‚Äôs pretty hard to od on them so it made me feel a little better\n\nSame initial concerns, but my heart rate, resting heart rate, and blood pressure were high enough that a small dose of propranolol seemed very manageable. It was - and changed everything.\n\ni‚Äôm so glad it was able to help you :))\n\nThank you, same for you :) This journey is best when not alone.\n\nYeah I was going to get on that but the doctor said I can't when on clonidine. I am glad its working out :) i love my clonidine too much to stop, but idk I might ask if I can still next appointment, but he said its not good?\n\nI've been looking into this a bit as someone who's been using Propranolol for fifteen years (was first prescribed for essential tremor, and it was a happy accident discovering it worked on my anxiety).\n\nI'm actually looking to try Clonidine, I think Propranolol is better for as needed use (due to Clonidine's rebound), but I suspect Clonidine is better if you are going to take something regularly (due to also reducing alpha adrenergic activity).\n\nMy issue is I think I have a form of sympathetic Dysautonomia on top of my OCD. Doctors have always dismissed the sympathetic symptoms (cold hands, orthostatic hypotension, episodic hypertension) as being somatic, but I'm really starting to believe its possible it's the other way around due to some other signs of autonomic instability.\n\nSo I wouldn't be too worried about getting on Propranolol, Clonidine is very similar efficacy. Just less well known.\n\nWhat all physical symptoms did you have? Any with the head? Did it stop the head symptoms if you had them?\n\nNo head sensations per se. Mostly sensations in arms, legs, back of neck, back. Chills, slight tremors. My heart beating hard. And often an adrenaline rush going up my chest. These sensations are so overwhelming they override any response from my mind. Taking them away helps tremendously.\n\nI see. Most of my symptoms are my head like head pressure in the forehead and temples with some dizzyness.\n\nPropranolol is prescribed for migraines, I suppose because by reducing blood pressure might help reduce that head pressure? You might want to inquire on that.\n\nI've read it causes nightmares. How long have you been taking it?\n\n2 years\n\n0 nightmares\n\nüôÇ\n\n4 days. Zero nightmares.\n\nThat's awesome...keep us updated üëç\n\nAmazing. What type of dose works for you?\n\nDo you have to be drug tested to get it? My psycharcist wont give me anything to help my anxiety because everything here requires a drug test and I have my medical card which doesn't make any sense to me. I started a new job and have been having daily panic attacks that make me use the bathroom on myself. It's awful.\n\nSad I only found propranolol after gaining 25kg on olanzapine üòî tho I still take olanzapine of propranolol doesn‚Äôt do its job\n\nMy 3 worst symptons are shortness of breath, heart flutters, and chest pain.  I heard it can make the SOB worse thats why I havent tried it.\n\nHave you had your thyroid checked?\n\nDo you take it everyday or as needed?\n\nI was prescribed Propranolol a long time ago but have a fear about taking it.\n\nIt was for 10mg but to be taken as needed (up to 80mg a day is normal for certain people)\n\nEven though I have really bad anxiety on the odd occasion I'm not in overwhelm my heart rate/blood pressure is on the low side. It's always been slightly low.\n\nI stopped Effexor months ago and now back on Lexapro (15mg) which seems less helpful but also has less side effects and longer half life.\n\nLately I'm stuck in freeze and held back with fear of doing small things. But I don't always feel my heart racing.\n\nI just feel weird about taking a heart medication and I want to try it but I feel like once I take it I might panic. That I can't undo it and I'll start getting super anxious and worried.\n\nDidn‚Äôt work as well as I was hoping. It did help ease the adrenaline feeling that I have near constantly but overall I wasn‚Äôt impressed. Best thing for anxiety for me is to work out and eat healthier and maybe a tiny puff of weed although that‚Äôs very situational because if the anxiety is starting to move towards a panic attack the weed makes it 100x worse\n\nI've been on it for about 5 years and started off on ten but then got it bumped up to twenty, it helps when I have a panic attack.\n\n\nI should warn people who are reading this and it's their first time learning about this medication, you MUST be prescribed it because it slows your heart rate down.\n\nI took 20mg and it makes my anxiety worse. I got super dizzy\n\nAbsolutely terrified to try it myself, my anxiety has flaked myself out of taking it but I‚Äôm in that paralysis of wanting to do better for myself and trying.. but also I can‚Äôt get my self to physically swallow that pill without thinking it will cause a full blown panic attack\n\nDo you have to see a cardiologist for thisv\n\nI don't feel different on 10mg 3x day. Did anyone go higher?\n\nI wanted it but was told it could increase my permanent depression. So klonopin it is...\n\nIt's a beta adrenic blocker, so it'll slow ur heart rate and lower blood pressure a little (the beta blocker part) the adrenic blocker is what helps the anger. \nI never had anger issues until I was baby betrayed by my bf and bff in a way that every time I thought about it.i wanted to break stuff. It can stop those anger/rage feelings in like 20 min tops. \nI didn't notice a lot.of mental anxiety symptoms relieved, they were a bit just because of the lower adrenaline, but if you've ever had anger like that it's a godsend.\nBtw I was 41 the first time I experienced anger like that. Never before. I had no idea what to do. I got lucky that my doc prescribed something that worked. I had already broken 2 of my cell phones. It was ridiculous and I couldn't control it.\n\nhas anyone taken slow release pronanolol instead of several tablets a day? as the 10mg lasts about 4 to 6 hours\n\nI just got this prescribed because of my fear for presentations and public speaking in college. I'm scared to take it tho, as I will need it approximately once a week for the next 3 months. Does anyone know if it is dangerous to take it irregularly like that?\n\nMy mom takes it for afib . It is very hard to come off of . It also has some very bad side effects like fluid in the feet and legs .she is prescribed multiple other drugs for the sid effcts\n\nMy experience with propranolol isn‚Äôt good. First few days it felt amazing. Slowly it caused fatigue and crazy lightheadness. It created dependency eventually and its a months long journey to get off it.\n\nPosted in another thread. But wondering if anyone had start up nausea and it went away. I am on day 4 and very low dose.\n\nMy psych gave me propanalol 10mg for my anxiety because I had to quit taking Xanax. I‚Äôve been on them for a few months and can‚Äôt really tell a difference. I have noticed that they‚Äôve stopped the tremor I‚Äôve had in my hands since I was a kid though"

I‚Äôd call this a little win but not only did you leave the house, you did things too! And ignored your heart palpitations? It‚Äôs kind of a big deal!\n\nAlso here as a friendly face that gets spooked about their health from anxiety üíï\n\nI don't know how to edit but I think I know what caused the small sharp pains. I just had a bit of acid reflux. Feeling better after :)\n\nI get the same pains. I thought it was gas or something from food but unsure myself.\n\nI think those sensations sound like expected feelings you would get if you struggled with anxiety but that‚Äôs a MAJOR progress! You even endured the cinema which is an activity that is enclosed and stimulating in some ways. Remember, your mind is powerful, you can have the control of your mind and regain the self trust. Talk nicely to yourself always, think of all the situations you have overcome and how strong you are because you are ‚ù§Ô∏èüôåüèªüîù\n\nlove when people post their wins ü•π that's huge! congrats on facing your fears!!\n\nThe best advice I ever got about health anxiety was to ditch the ‚Äústory‚Äù in your head. In the moment, I would always start to catastrophize whenever I started to feel anything off. Now, if I start to ruminate on symptoms, I say to myself ‚Äúditch the story‚Äù and focus on the fact that my predictions of what will happen are 99% not likely to happen.\n\nDitch the story, I love it. I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúNope not going there.‚Äù‚Äô\n\nWe all need wins lately. That took some bravery and toughness. There are so many natural techniques to use in a pinch, EFT tapping, breathing exercises, tightening and loosening muscles, etc, plus, of course, meds. I need to go to the theater. I haven't been since Top Gun 2. I don't leave the house much, especially lately. Congrats! Keep it up!\n\nOP for the win! Proud of you! Sometimes I just tell my anxiety go ahead and do what you need to do. I am watching movies/grocery shopping or taking care of my son. Not 100% but it works more often than not for me.\n\nI had cardiophobia with palpitations for about 14 years. I still got them for another 13, but usually not to where I was frightened except a few times a year. After 2000, they  just nagged at me. They weren‚Äôt an ongoing issue to me as they were the first 14 years. I would try holding it back and tolerating it but that was my mistake, focusing on what my body was doing and trying to hold it back as if that did anything. It just kept it alive. I finally figured it out.  I learned to put it out of mind and let it fade away on its own. It‚Äôs an impulse to want to control it or think you need to something to take on the right attitude. If you try to apply positive thinking too long, your mind will just drift into wanting to understand and define it, like it has something to solve. Letting it fade on its own only works if you stop being on guard and checking in on it. Waiting for it to fade away on its own shouldn‚Äôt be like waiting for the light to change or for it to be your turn in line. There should be no impatience or expectation. The solution is not to be constantly reassuring yourself, or calming yourself down in order to keep the symptoms under control. Being worried about it  getting out of hand IS your anxiety. Get a hold of yourself that first split second and resist getting  startled. That works wonders Dismiss it immediately and let it settle itself down without your interference. It‚Äôs the difference between cooking something on the stove and having to watch it and tend to it ‚Ä¶ and on the other hand, putting something in a slow cooker, a microwave or a air fryer walking away confident that you don‚Äôt have to do anything. It will take care of itself.  Don‚Äôt try to convince yourself there is nothing to worry about with the goal of not getting symptoms. The fact that you are trying to convince yourself  with the hope of not getting  symptom is telling your mind it‚Äôs a threat. It keeps the worry alive. Here‚Äôs some encouraging news for you: This started for me when I was 29 and I‚Äôm 67. After thousands of arrhythmias I‚Äôm still here and my heart is in perfect health. All that worry for nothing. Don‚Äôt get caught up in the struggle and obsession of seeking reassurance. Don‚Äôt get discouraged if you still get symptoms. Accept it and expect it. It‚Äôs not about effort, there is nothing for you to do. It‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt do. It‚Äôs about having the discipline to refrain from doing anything to make it go away. It‚Äôs having the  discipline not to focus on it so much. There is nothing to solve, nothing to do here. You  have nothing to worry about. Driving a car is more dangerous than self induced psychosomatic symptoms. Congratulations on being able to sit through a whole movie! It‚Äôs a great feeling!\n\nBtw I got that poking pinching feeling in the pecs and at various points from the pecs down to my wrist. Also the chest pressure, the lump in my throat and the palpitations. Don‚Äôt get caught up on who has what you have and why. You‚Äôll be totally fine. It‚Äôs not an actual medical problem. Of course do get a professional opinion. DM me any time. This is my hobby.\n\nI know I'm not the OP but thanks for writing this! It really is very encouraging to read first because it hits home and is great advice. The other reason is that I always worried if I kept this worry up it might spiral into real health/ heart issues. Knowing someone like me has had it for so many years and is doing well/ healthy is very encouraging. Thanks again for taking the time to share!\n\nThat was my worry too, that I was causing damage to my heart. Anything is possible, but the heart can take enormous variations in its rhythm and keep the right amount of blood flowing through a compensation process. That‚Äôs what the lump in your throat means. Long story. It‚Äôs your heart making up for previous heartbeat irregularities. Even people with severe heart disease survive arrhythmias. Most arrhythmias are harmless. They say stress kills, but it can result in cancer, or diabetes, or ulcers or indigestion. Or stress can distract you and make you get in an auto accident. That horrible chest pain I feared for so long finally came in the form of an airbag slamming into my chest and breaking my sternum. I‚Äôm no doctor but lots of things affect your health‚Äî-sugar, second hand smoke (I was around before smoking restrictions) . Like I said, I learned to think in terms of the likelihood of a heart attack on that particular occasion‚Äù. I‚Äôd ask myself what is my condition going to be in a little while when this wears out? What do I really and truly believe will happen?. Nothing happened to me last time or the last 100 times, so even if something could happen to me, there‚Äôs no reason to assume  it will be this time. So if I can take comfort in knowing that I‚Äôm okay for now and that my symptoms will be gone if I just drop the subject long enough, I can keep kicking the can down the road like this indefinitely. And voila! Don‚Äôt deal with it now ever. Project your suggestion for a recovery later. It took my resisting that impulse to do something to stop it for me to recover and that included resisting the temptation to keep looking for reassurance or trying too hard to take on the right attitude, or even trying to relax. You may need some of that, but ultimately that‚Äôs not what got me out of this. I know that frantic yucky feeling when you‚Äôre wanting it to go away. Sometimes you can‚Äôt help feeling that way, don‚Äôt even try, other times you can use the experience to chip away at it. It‚Äôs not easy, but you need to not be on the lookout for it so much. Learn to very quickly put it out of your mind instead of lingering noticing it and monitoring  it. Ultimately, what will pull you out of this is your overall attitude over the days weeks and months‚Ä¶your viewpoint at no particular time. It takes gradually seeing it as something that is not an issue to you any moreI learned to gradually  put it behind me. Gradually I thought less and less about it, even if I got symptoms  It just faded away over time. This is not an issue that needs your attention, quite the oppsite, you need to let it settle itself down without your interference. This is the best video I have ever seen on the topic. \nhttps://youtu.be/lREvQ0i3owU?si=QT6V91Vr51sTHvAT\n\nBrilliant video. Thank you¬†\n\nWell done\n\nAmazing, gigantic! üëèüèºüíóüòä\n\nProud of you! I remember my first cinema trip after dealing with agoraphobia for a long time, I remember the outing fondly. I‚Äôm still working through it alot and some days I can‚Äôt go anywhere but some days I can go to 1-2 places okay. Well done!!\n\nCongratulations! üôåüèª \n\nYeah the stabbing poking sensation is anxiety id say, i get it a lot, so dont worry too much so long as it calmed down. Bathe in your win!\n\ngood job. keep at it.\n\nGood job!!!! Happy for you!\n\nYou should start walking everyday make it apart of your schedule that will really help you\n\nüôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº\n\nCinema is a big sensory overload. So kudos to you for taking it as a champ.\n\nI am so proud of you. You have strength and a lot of courage. Small baby steps‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nGreat effort!\n\nSo happy for you! This is huge! Congratulations!\n\nCongratulations! slow progress is better than no progress\n\nCongrats! It will get better! I leave the house about once a week and trying to bring it up to twice a week\n\nThe Wild Robot is such an amazing film. The song when Brightbill learn to fly is amazing.\n\nGood for you! One step at a time.\n\nThat‚Äôs so great! I went to see that movie recently as well, and I loved it. Congrats on getting out again!\n\nCheers to exposure therapy! The more you do, the easier it gets.\n\nGreat!! Well done, you should be proud!\nBut: really try to find _your own_ peace of mind about your bodily sensations. Getting reassurance from others will not get you very far: tell yourself you're fine, and keep enjoying the movie. It'll make it easier next time!\n\nThat is amazing progress! Going to the movies after 9 months is a big step, and props to you for handling those palpitations so well. It is not easy to ignore those feelings, but you did it. Glad you enjoyed the film with your family. Keep it up.\n\nCongrats on taking this huge step forward!\n\n[I just realized I'm reading your older post about your vitamin D deficiency.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1e78dq0/turns_out_i_am_very_low_in_iron_and_vitamin_d/) Do you think that had anything to do with it?\n\nVery possible. I've been supplementing Vitamin D in my diet so should be improving :)\n\nCongratulations\n\nCongratulations!!! What an effort to be proud of. Happy for that and all thats to come for you\n\nCongratulations! I‚Äôm super proud of you üíï\n\nCongratulations!!!!!   I've been there before and it gets easier each time.\n\nLittle steps! Little steps are greatest! I do it too!¬†\n\ncongratulations. i am so happy for you!!!!\n\nI‚Äôm so incredibly proud of you for this. ‚ù§Ô∏è I got out a lot more recently and it felt good. Taking a shower was the hardest part for me honestly! If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what caused your initial fear of leaving/agoraphobia?\n\nI've always been really confident but had a panic attack out of nowhere in January. Due to me never having anxiety before I wad convinced it was a heart attack. I was convinced I was going to die. The thoughts I had in those hours following gave me horrible health anxiety that made me not want to leave the house. Mainly due to not wanting something to happen in unfamiliar surroundings. \n\nSlowly working on it now though. My aim to to get back to how I was before all this.\n\nI completely understand this‚Ä¶ I had a panic attack out of nowhere back in august and it sent me to the local fire department. I didn‚Äôt usually have episodes with heart palpitations/increased HR and it scared me to no end‚Ä¶ it will get better, but it can be tough as we never know when it‚Äôll hit us. Mine was so random. I just started feeling dizzy and then the walls felt like they were caving in. But when they checked my vitals I was considered normal. So they thought it was a panic attack. They really are scary.üòï\n\nWell done! I hope this helps - a trigger point in your pec muscle is easy to confuse for a cardiac symptom. Us anxious folks often tense up our pecs when nervous! If you experience that again, try poking around and feeling for any tense spots you could massage out on your own.¬†\n\nBrilliant...well done...keep doing what you're doing üëè"

    "all_comment_text": "Magnesium glycinate too\n\nI have just started taking a Magnesium supplement and wow! I felt an immediate relaxation within the first 30 minutes of taking it and have been sleeping so well. I've heard it can take months to feel the full benefits. Magnesium deficiency can also make Vitamin D ineffective which is another big Anxiety contributor.\n\nWhat time of day do you take it? And what dosage?\n\nCouple of hours before I go to sleep.\n\n400mg.\n\nHave you had any stomach upset from it? And is the relaxation from magnesium supplementation strong or subtle? Like would you be comfortable taking magnesium in the middle of the day as opposed to toward the end?\n\nIt is subtle and mellow for me. \n\nYes I would be comfortable taking it during the day but I my anxiety is always worse at night. I haven't had stomach upset but I know some people do get that.\n\nI‚Äôve heard that glycinate is easiest on the stomach, so I‚Äôm going with that form first.\n\nThank you!¬†\n\nWhen i started taking magnesium i had a very emotional week. Its like my brain was finally able to take a deep breath if that makes sense. I finally got a glimpse of feeling normal or clear\n\nDo you take magnesium at the end of the day or do you take it earlier?\n\nIve messed around with it. Best time for me is 7-9 pm for me. I find it wake up with more energy. When i was taking it early in the day after fasting around 12 pm i didn‚Äôt feel any effects. I also just bought magnesium oil spray. Will update effects, im 2 days in spraying my feet after a shower and before going to bed.\n\nI don't even know what this is but will Google it lol. Thanks!!!\n\nTake it before you sleep you‚Äôll feel amazing. Maybe some 5thp too\n\nAnd got to take it with fatty food for best absorption!\n\nwhat is low in blood? mine is in the middle. do you think its low? how many mg shoud I take?\n\nSo I take 420 mg daily. That‚Äôs one dose(2pills). I take one in the morning and one at night. Keeps me in line that way.\n\nLo malo del magnesio es que puede causar diarrea :/\n\nStop taking magnesium carbonate take a more soluble kind\n\nTienes que tomar glycinate magnesio , ese no causa agua de culis\n\nIt can do, but you can lower the dose.\n\nVitamin D as well!\n\nI'm not usually one to promote supplements, but I think vitamins are really underappreciated. People assume that you're getting everything you need from a healthy diet and exercise but somehow we're not getting what we should be getting nutritionally.\n\nencouraging everyone to take vitamin D supplements as well - my doctor has measured it in my bloodwork for years, since she first noticed my levels were particularly low. when I consciously take vitamin D (even on days when I can‚Äôt get outside for a walk or a tiny bit of sun), I feel more energy &amp; balance overall\n\nI‚Äôm starting to think Vitamin D deficiency was the source of half of my problems. Vitamin D, low level antidepressants and therapy have done wonders for my anxiety and life in general\n\n[deleted]\n\nI get the Kirkland D3 soft gels from Costco, and I usually take 2 gel pills every day \n\nbased on the packaging, 1 gel pill has 50mcg = 2,000 IU of vitamin D , which equals 250% of the daily recommended value\n\nfrom my own experience, taking more than the recommended amount has been beneficial (for me)\n\nHow long does it take for vitamin d to level out? I've been having bad anxiety for almost a year and I've been on vitamins for a month and haven't noticed a change in my anxiety. I take 1000u of vitamin d and multivitamin.\n\nThis is huge! I notice such a difference when I actually go outside or even sit in front of a window versus staying in a dim-lit room.\n\nVitamin D can just come from adding sunlight into your day\n\nYesss! Vitamin D plays a huge role in your mood. I noticed when I go a week without taking them, I tend to be in a more depressing mood. Vitamin D is usually not tested during the usual lab work so you‚Äôd never know unless you ask.\n\nYesssss!!!! Vit D as well! My vitamins overall are really low and I can tell because the panic attacks start üò©\n\nHi! I also have a vitamin d and multivitamin deficiency and I've been getting really severe anxiety and heart palpitations. I've been on vitamins for 1 month now and I still feel the anxiety. Is this normal? How long does it take for vitamins to become at a regular rate again? Also I take 1000u of vitamin d!\n\nYou might need to up the vit d for awhile to at least 5000iu a day. Also depending on your age and or gender it can be hormone related.¬†¬†\n\nVitamin D and Magnesium. I take it everyday. I noticed Magnesium relaxes me when I take it in the evening.\n\nThere is some stuff called \"Calm\" that is like a powdered drink mix that gives you a good dose of Magnesium. It makes me feel the same way Kratom and maybe a very lose THC dose does. Just kind of relaxed all over. They sell it on Amazon and it doesn't have any side-effects that I've noticed. Just be careful about combining it was Magnesium supplements or you might get too much Magnesium for the day.\n\nHmmmm let me check my magnesium levels. Didn't know that could cause anxiety feelings.\n\nLow magnesium causes a lot more than you think\n\nhttps://completewellbeing.com/article/magnesium-anxiety/\n\nOut of curiosity, how many MCGs do you take per day?\n\nMe. \nLow Vitamin D symptoms were absolutely everything for me. Stomach aches, lousy sleep, brain fog, and uncontrollable anxiety. \n\nTook several weeks to build up my stores, but I couldn‚Äôt believe the difference a VITAMIN made in my well being. I have never gone without it since.\n\nYesssss! Same here. Although right now I'm deficient in everything which I'm supplementing but my anxiety is through the roof!\n\nThyroid issues do as well\n\nAgreed!\n\nI think anyone with anxiety should make sure all vitamins and bodily issues are good to be honest. A lot of the times our anxiety is worse when our bodies are not right.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the best way to do this\n\nI‚Äôve been deficient in a lot of stuff and then supplemented and fixed it. But never noticed a difference unfortunately.\n\nNot every anxiety is due to deficiencies. Sometimes our brains are just wired for it. But having your deficiencies under control absolutely helps, otherwise, you'd feel worse. Rooting for you ‚ù£Ô∏è\n\nThank you!! And yes I agree it helps in so many other areas, even if it doesn‚Äôt fix a persons anxiety. I‚Äôm glad you are finding relief friend! Sending you good vibes!\n\nI've been taking like 5 or 6 different vitamins and multi vitamins for years and it has never changed anything except my bloodwork :(\n\nI‚Äôve been looking up this very topic because I‚Äôve been SUPER tired and super anxious to the point where I‚Äôm shaking and freezing. I also have buzzing extremities which is linked to low B vitamins. I gotta buy some asap!\n\nDefinitely sounds like low iron or ferritin as well as b12 deficiencies. I would ask the doctor to run those tests so that you can know how bad it is, if any. Otherwise, you'd be supplementing blindly and with iron you can overdose at high volumes.\n\nThat‚Äôs a good idea. I‚Äôve always been anemic when they test me but I forget to take my pills\n\nIt's fairly intuitive, and the only people who reject outright the idea that vitamin imbalances can cause anxiety are either pushing an agenda or they haven't read a lick of science. Obviously, with how many vitamins and minerals in our bodies interact with the CNS, imbalances can cause problems.\n\nA few weeks ago I started a B complex as well as a Ashwagandha+ L-Theanine supplement.  \nMy unbiased 7 year old told me this weekend that I've been much more fun lately.  I'd say it's working.\n\nI feel like my reason is because I'm low on iron. I get dizzy so easily now and its annoying and causes me to panic. My family usually has iron pills because we all struggle with it but of course now we are out. I remember taking an iron pill out of curiosity and felt so much better but it was the last one. I gotta get more and see if it helps again.\n\nVitamin deficiencies can cause all sorts of horrors: neurological damage, depression, chronic fatigue, rapid weight loss, and even full blown psychosis. Ironically, SSRIs and other meds are thrown at people without even checking their vitamin levels. Even worse, many meds cause or exacerbate vitamin absorption issues, as well. It's a messed-up system. \n\nIf your B-12 and Fe stores are too low, injections and infusions might be necessary, if you aren't getting those treated already.\n\nI just had my first iron infusion last week with another one coming up.\n\nBut thats so true!!! My doctor didn't even check my levels prior to giving me sertraline and now that I think about it, that's really messed up. I don't know why they don't check when in cases like mine, that's probably what was causing my extreme anxiety that didn't go away.\n\nI'm so sorry that happened to you too. I hope your anxiety resolves once your levels increase. Glad to hear you are getting treated! Are you getting B-12 treatment too? Even if you still have anxiety and decide you still need medication after, it's okay.\n\nThank you, I hope you feel better as well if you're anxious. Is not a good feeling to have.\n\nI'm going to check my b12 levels tomorrow since I had to pay out of pocket to see what my levels are. These doctors don't check anything!\n\nThe refusal of western medicine to acknowledge the importance of vitamins and minerals is terrifying and infuriating.\n\nIt is! My doctor doesn't even check vitamin b12 as part of their routine checkup. I had to pay for it out of pocket üôÑ\n\nNot sure about that.\n\nIME any routine blood test you get done checks your essential vitamins and mineral levels and Doctors 100% look at this upfront to see if you're difficient in anything and it needs to be addressed.\n\nIt's a VERY common blood test.\n\nThat's actually awesome that you've had that experience but I'm afraid it's a rare one, most doctors will not test for or even acknowledge vitamin and mineral levels.\n\nIt's definitely NOT rare IME. At least where I'm based. \n\nLiterally ANY Doctor I've ever seen, private or public, regardless of what I went to see them about, does routine blood tests first and foremost which checks your vital organs, looks at blood sugar levels, thyroid check and your vitamin and mineral levels.\n\nIt's literally the first thing most of them do before ordering further tests.\n\nthis is absolutely not true. first of all, there are wayyy more potential deficiencies or imbalances that can cause anxiety than you will see on a standard blood panel. second of all, many tests that are part of a standard blood panel cannot adequately capture the meaningful levels of the micronutrient in question. for example, serum magnesium is not very helpful as an indicator of deficiency, since serum magnesium levels are very tightly controlled by the body, while most Mg is actually stored in other tissues. most people who are not getting enough Mg for their brain to function at it's best will not show a deficiency on a blood test.\n\nI've had plenty of blood tests over the years and they ALWAYS checked my ESSENTIAL vitamins and mineral levels as standard.\n\nSince you ignored the important parts of my comment I‚Äôll make them as clear as I conceivably can:\n\n- there are an almost uncountable number of micronutrients that can impact anxiety, it‚Äôs implausible to test for them all at once, and goes way beyond ‚ÄúESSENTIAL‚Äù \n\n- **more importantly, as already stated above, blood tests cannot detect many deficiencies because serum isn‚Äôt a good marker for body stores**\n\nWhat testing do you suggest for body stores?\n\nFor many of these problems, you largely can't, at least -- your doctor very likely won't order the test even if you ask for it. For example, with Magnesium, there's lots of scammy tests out there, like hair tests, which have *no* scientific backing and are wildly inaccurate, and there are RBC tests, but those still are looking at what's in your blood stream. You'd basically need to actually biopsy a piece of muscle and test for Mg content.\n\nDo you have supplement recommendations for those of us with anxiety? What‚Äôs your stack? Thanks!\n\nThat's awesome that you were even able to get off the SSRI! So happy for you. I've been tapering mine, but reluctant to take the final plunge and stop altogether. Hoping supplements and other alternative healthy lifestyle changes will bridge the gap. It's a work in progress. \n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nOMG, I got an iron iv over 2 weeks ago and slowly am feeling better. My anxiety is just gone where 3 weeks ago I would be at the ER because I kept thinking I was dying‚Ä¶ it also helps that my heart is not pounding like it used to before because of the iron. I tried looking it up online but I couldn‚Äôt find any correlation between anxiety and deficiencies, so if anyone has any articles or something to back up my unexplained getting better from full blown panic attacks, please send them to me! It‚Äôs insane how I feel so much better mentally.\n\nThats great!!! Glad you're feeling better üòä \n\nYou can go to the Anemic forum here on Reddit as they have tons of information on the correlation between low iron and anxiety. Seems thats one of the symptoms.\n\n[removed]\n\nReally?\n\nHow are you checking your levels?\n\nI paid out of pocket at a blood lab. My doctor didn't want to do any more testing aside from the routine tests which don't tell me much.\n\nGet a new doctor\n\nWhat lab did you go to get tested? I live in a rural area so I would have to do any testing online.¬†\n\nI did it via Quest Diagnostics. Not sure if they have them around your area.\n\nAlso low magnesium can cause cortisol to spiral\n\nNot sure if it was the vitamin supplements I started taking, as I tried a bunch of things all at once, but I've been better since so support this thread\n\nAlso get you thyroid tested.\n\nWhen I take magnesium g, I sleep great but my head feels strange the next day and I am confused\n\nWhat is the best way to test for these deficiencies on a consistent basis?\n\nI'd say paying out of pocket every 6 months at a laboratory. Doctors already have a hard time ordering it during routine blood work and I don't see them ordering it too many times during the year. It doesn't hurt to ask your doctor every 6 months either.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôve always thought it should be mandatory to take a blood test to check your hormones, vitamin deficiencies, etc before just labeling someone with having Anxiety or Depression and giving them Rx. A lot of times it‚Äôs simply a symptom of a deficiency or imbalance.\n\nI know zero about vitamins or minerals but my anxiety is so bad I don‚Äôt even leave the house anymore. If anyone can point me in the direction of getting better it would be much appreciated üôèüèª\n\nGet tested !!! You can purchase the lab on quest website or go to your doctor\n\nDoctors....magnesium and vitamin play a big part in your adrenaline glands.\n\nWhen you know this but still afraid to take vitamins or eat most healthy foods üò£\n\nIts not that common to have B12 and folate deficiency without underlying reasons. Do you have metabolic disorders or diet restrictions? Are you anemic? Alcohol intake?\n\nLow vitamin d will make you depressed also\n\nüòî I'm treating mine as well. It was way low when the minimum is 25. I remember one time it was 6 and the doctor didn't really mention it much smh.\n\nThat‚Äôs horrible! Maybe it‚Äôs time for a new Dr\n\nHow are you tracking your levels\n\nBe careful with cheap B12 if you drink more than 2 cups of coffee a day. It will make you extremely anxious\n\nI wanted to put this out there in case it helps anyone. I had a full blood panel done a few mo the ago since I‚Äôve had crippling anxiety since I can remember. My magnesium and vitamin D was too low. My homocysteine levels were way too high which means low B9/B12. Since then I‚Äôve been taking supplements and have slowly started to become less and less anxious on top of being on anti anxiety meds which I‚Äôve always been on. So vitamin deficiencies can 100% cause anxiety but also there could be a reason why you‚Äôre vitamin deficient like having h pylori for example or a bad diet or some other problem causing you not to be able to absorb certain nutrients. I also had a genetic test done and I have the mthfr mutation which makes me not be able to absorb folic acid/b12 well and I have to take a specific kind for my body to be able to use it. I also have another mutation where my body dosent naturally produce enough serotonin on its own so I‚Äôll probably be on meds for the rest of my life but if you‚Äôre financially able I would get a full blood panel done and get a genetic test done\n\nWhat form did you end up taking?\n\nWhere did you hear that about iron? I know some can cause it but never thought iron could\n\nI went to get an iron infusion and the doctor explained all of this to me. The heart palpitations increase heart rate and the anxiety kicks in.\n\nNow that my iron is under control, so is my anxiety. I thought I had depression too but it turns out it was the brain fog also caused by low iron.\n\nYeah it's weird but I've seen some refs and def have less anxiety when my iron is in better shape.\n\nI‚Äôve always taken fish oil to support brain function.\n\nCan you recommend vitamins to take?\n\nIt depends because if you're too low on iron or vitamins, you'd need to supplement with really high doses for the first month. \n\nI currently take Centrum gummy multivitamins and SlowFe for iron since they're gentler on the stomach.\n\nWhere did you get tested and what did you get tested for\n\nMain ones were: Iron panel and Vitamin panel\n\nI did it via Quest Laboratories which is in the US.\n\nAbsolutely true\n\n[deleted]\n\nI would research that online as I‚Äôm pretty sure I read somewhere that protein is important for the nervous system which can cause anxiety¬†\n\nI am having anxiety and panic attacks recently since two months. I just got checked and my vitamin d is a 4.7. Can it be linked ? I don‚Äôt want to take anti depressants or SSRIs and was wondering if it can be due to vitamin D deficiency? My b12 is 260 and b9 is 5.12\n\nMy vitamin D is at 34 and i feel shitty lol so yes it can def go hand in hand . ¬†\n\nYour B12 is low too that might be the bigger reason for your attacks too.\n\nNot just anxiety. Depression too, and other issues that can bring a lot of pain to your life. Most people have deficiencies of this type and don't even know it, often doctors don't request that specific test or they say that everything is normal.¬†\n\nI am pretty sure this has been happening to me the last few months. My son is 23 months and I know it can take a while for the body to go back to normal since having a baby. \nI've always been a worrier but the last few months Ive been having random anxiety attacks, low moods, loss of appetite  where I was eating small amounts and feeling nauseous when I ate, and like bad breath and just feeling awful.\n I've recently come off my birth control to see if that helps. \nI also requested a blood test to see if I was lacking anything and it came back saying my folate was low so I have been prescribed 5mg of Folic acid to take for 3 months. \nI really hope this makes me feel better as I hate feeling like this. I want to feel normal again about going out and about. \nHow long did it take to feel better?\n\nThats how i know my anxiety is vitamin driven because even with meds i still have some anxiety¬†\n\nVitamin D is the most important vitamin for your body. Real exercise can help tremendously also\n\nI will put this out there every chance I get because I feel so strongly about it:\n\nThis is 100% true about vitamin deficiencies, and fun fact, birth control affects your body‚Äôs ability to absorb vitamins/minerals (particularly magnesium, zinc, and B vitamins among others) so if you‚Äôre on birth control your anxiety/depression may be because, or worsened if, you have a vitamin deficiency! \n\nI went months feeling sick, worse than I‚Äôd ever felt, and every doctor just told me to ‚Äúnot stress‚Äù and ‚Äútake it easy.‚Äù They all just suggested therapy and meditation. I did my own research and found out about the birth control and vitamin deficiency correlation, so I tried some supplements, and wouldn‚Äôt you know it! Within a week or so I was feeling myself again. It‚Äôs very frustrating that doctors won‚Äôt tell you this and try to write off our concerns as stress.\n\nObviously if you have concerns it is best to see a doctor, but if you‚Äôre not getting answers this is hopefully something to consider.\n\nthis is very interesting !!\n\nI‚Äôm also on BC and suffer from bad anxiety which leads to insane stomach problems.\n\nI was wondering if you could share your vitamins you took + how you got around the absorption problem??? are you still taking BC now?\n\nHi! Sorry, I just saw this, but I‚Äôm happy to share! I take a vitamin B complex (includes all of the B vitamins), a magnesium + calcium + zinc + vitamin D3 supplement (that specific combo is supposed to help with absorption) and then an Omega-3 fish oil supplement as well just for good measure, it‚Äôs supposed to have a potential to help with anxiety and depression and overall health as well. I‚Äôm still on the same BC but haven‚Äôt had any issues since I started taking the supplements!\n\nthank you!!!\n\n&gt;thank you!!!\n\nYou're welcome!"

People seem to enjoy doing that and I would love to try it out one day\n\nHoney, is that you?\n\ni was thinking the same thingüò≠üò≠üò≠\n\nNothing because my IBS would use that as an opportunity to flare up.\n\nOmg so real. Although my IBS is apparently bc of my anxiety lol.\n\nSame. They both definitely influence each other and are working to destroy me.\n\nRight üò≠üò≠ ugh I hate it, when I use to do school test I‚Äôd be like having ‚Äúearthquaking‚Äù is what I call it and it‚Äôs embarrassing bc I feel the need to crap but I can‚Äôt üò≠üôèüèª\n\nI'm lucky to not have had IBS or anxiety during my school years. It started in my mid-30s a few years ago. I'm sorry for you and I hope you're able to get some real answers!\n\nThank u so much! But idk I haven‚Äôt had anything that helps my IBS But it only ‚Äúflares‚Äù up when I‚Äôm taking important tests or things similar to that. But quiet yet crowded places\n\nAsk your doctor for a capsules pill prescription  called spasmodil. ( Alverine Citrate)  I had IBS since I was 36. It's only been the last 10 years that I take them when I have a flare-up, and it's an anti spasmodic,  I promise you it will change your life. Please don't suffer. Must be awful to have it so young.\n\nOmg thank you so much!\n\nGood luck. üëç   üòÉ\n\nYou‚Äôre lucky it‚Äôs just IBS. I have IBD and it sucks. All stress related 100 percent.\n\nMy dad and grandfather both had IBD (Crohn's) so knowing my luck it's only a matter of time.\n\nMaking all my phone calls I need to make ü•≤\n\nThat was my first thought along with being myself when socializing\n\nI guess I made another username and commented 7hr ago and just don't remember it because *this* is me\n\nJumping on a flight to somewhere beautiful! Singing karaoke! Trying new foods!\n\nI'm coming with you üòä\n\nGo on a date and be fun instead of bottling in my urge to puke lol\n\nJob interview no doubts\n\nOmg! I would literally do all the things I‚Äôd love to do but invasive thoughts ruin them! \n\n- read a book \n- take a walk \n- lay and listen to music \n- eat a good, big meal\n\nFocus on work.\n\nYes, my focus on anything (other than anxiety and symptoms) has gone right out the window!\n\nOooooh‚Ä¶ Disneyland!\n\nthis is the one thing that calms me down. i literally became a annual pass holder because how much it soothes my anxiety (not all the people i do have to take small breaks lol) . BUTTT I hope your anxiety calms and you get to go soon. ü´∂üèΩüíô\n\nWhat part soothes you? Maybe because you feel like a kid again?\n\nactually i never got to go to disney as a kid! my girl and her friends took me @ the age of 22 only 2 years ago and i just couldn‚Äôt believe how happy it made me. I think it might fill the void of not going as a kid.\n\nNiiiice!\n\nüò≠üò≠ROLLERCOASTERS DEF!\n\nTake my daughter wherever she wants to go, Get drunk, tell the guy I like that I like him, watch scary movies, swim in the ocean, go see my friend who lives states away.\n\nGoing on a flight and traveling to a new country\n\nBut not long because ya gotta get back home before the 24 hours runs up. I said the same thing I‚Äôd travel but have to be back home before the time limit.\n\nso many options, i‚Äôd probably try to go on a small trip somewhere\n\nLiterally everything. Taking a road trip because I‚Äôd be able to drive on the highway. Id enjoy life more because I wouldn‚Äôt be so worried I‚Äôm constantly ‚ò†Ô∏è ing\n\nMaking brand new friends lol\n\nmaking all the phone calls and appointments I‚Äôve been putting off sorting for like the past 5 years\n\nFucking living my life normally for once‚Ä¶\n\nFly to Australia (I live in NYC)\n\nSeeing my friends again. All of them. At once lol\n\nGoing to look for a job\n\nProbabaly stare at a wall and write down every clear headed thought i realize.  Then get anxiety about if it was all true or not after 24 hours\n\ngetting paranoid about not feeling like i normally do.\n\nthere's a certain re-assurance in whatever your own personal \"normal\" is. \n\nThere have been days when I have felt, kinda weird, concerningly weird. And then Ive realised, Oh, I'm not anxious today...\n\nYeh, I don't like it :D\n\nRight, it's kinda suspicious of me to not be anxious lol\n\nWill be spending time with my kids and my wife genuinely\n\nThis, not dragging everyone else into my spiral\n\nYeah exactly. Feels awful that I can‚Äôt be with them, and spend time genuinely when I‚Äôm going through it. Glad to know I‚Äôm not alone! Stick it out we got this!\n\nWe got this !\n\nSleeping\n\nGoing to a mall and walking around browsing everything.  Standing in line.  No rush.  No escape plan.  Just shopping.\n\nread all the books and watch all the shows/movies i take too long to go through because i'm too busy worrying about something else üòÖ\n\nId travel somewhere! Go to a very cool restaurant, go on a long hike, all stuff I avoid right now\n\nApply to all the jobs I have been procrastinating on.\n\nspend every minute with my wife.  she deserves the best of me everyday, i just can't give it.  But for 24 hours, i would never leave her side so she could see whos really there.\n\nDoctor , applying for new jobs , phone calls , cleaning my room , exercising, going out to a club\n\nAirplane and dentist\n\nTaking a flight to a different country\n\nFilling out forms.\n\nDriving\n\nFace the people I've avoided due to fear of inconveniencing them with my feelings\n\nBooking a doctor and dentist appointment üòÇ\n\nI'm doing a Ted talk\n\nSleeping. I would kill to sleep through a night.\n\nI can't even imagine that much time without anxiety.\n\nCall my Mom for the first time in two years\n\nI used to be in the RAF (as a Reservist through university, not as a Regular) and we got to learn how to fly a two-seater prop plane, but I never went solo (flying on your own without the instructor or anyone else in the aircraft with you) because I was petrified that I would panic in the air and then crash when I was trying to land - which, fair enough, was a legitimate risk, but I'm still kicking myself years later that I never pushed myself to do it! So, if I could be back there for a day, with no anxiety, I'd fly solo for the first time üòÅ\n\nGoing for a walk !\n\nSkydiving ü™Ç\n\nDrive on the freeway\n\nAll of my chores + errands. Spending time with friends &amp; family\n\nTripping absolute balls\n\nMaking and accepting phone calls, seeing friends, booking and actually attending appointments, applying for a job, starting the seemingly impossible task of cleaning up my home office‚Ä¶\n\nYour comment really hit home...With Agoraphobia/Panic....even some of my most beloved Family...when I know that they're coming, its like I lock up - like I'm not going to be able to have an \"actual conversation\"...I have NEVER been able to sit and just make casual small talk...I too have issues that when I have actually went about making an Appointment with a Doctor....it doesn't matter what kind...though as the day and time approaches, its like I'm seized with even more fear...  \n  \nI wish you the best of luck, Coffee.\n\nFighting my doctor who mocks me and ignores me\n\nEating Xanax like candy.\n\nWhy not use that for when you DO have anxiety lol\n\nbzs...\n\nSleeping\n\nRelaxing. Just... Truly relaxing and not worrying about all the things that I'm not doing\n\nProbably going out and meeting new people\n\nSleeping\n\nGo skydiving haha\n\nI'd reply to about 4000 unread text messages.\n\nMost likely write anything i want to but anxiety keeps me from doing. Usually when i am anxiety free i tend to be extremely creative, to the point i write drafts of books, poems, develop theories of my own etc.\n\nDefinitely a day to buy a new wardrobe and try a new food spot. (I‚Äôm hoping overstimulation is also off the table here)\n\nTaking a long plane ride\n\nFlying across the world! üåé\n\nOh man. I'd go to the dentist, the doctor. I'd go out on a date and reconnect with old friends. I'd go out to a fancy ass restaurant or just out to eat in general.\n\nI'd take a long ass drive and go to a farmer's market. It's these small things that I miss out on because of anxiety and it just fucking **sucks**.\n\nFinally learning how to drive. I just can't do it. It's like my mind shuts off and I forget everything.\n\nLiving in peace\n\nWALMART\n\nExercise until my legs give out and then eat at a new restaurant.\n\nFlying to New York! I want to go so bad but I live on the west coast.\n\nDrive 12 hours one way on the highway and then turn around and drive back\n\nrun around and do as much excercise without worrying about exhaustion\n\nGo out and do something a little reckless - go to a club, get a little too drunk but not wasted, makeout with a stranger, maybe invite them to my place if it‚Äôs going well, have a one night stand if it feels right\n\nPerforming stand up comedy. Always wanted to try it, never had the balls\n\nEat all my favorite food without having acid reflux.\n\nDo everything I used to do. Go be social and outgoing again. Drive at night. Workout and run. Get drunk. Enjoy life in the moment.\n\nSleeping.\n\nCry!! In a good way. The feeling relief would feel so overwhelming\n\nget out of bed and look for a job\n\nSleeping!!!\n\nHaving every tough conversation with my partner that I need to\n\nCleaning my whole living space! I've been paralyzed with anxiety (and depression) for so long, that my place looks like a neckbeardnest now and just compounds my already existing anxiety and depression. But if I could clean my space and throw a bunch of things out and do laundry etc, then, I think it would be a little bit better once that 24 hours is over!\n\nHow I wish this were true! \n\n‚Ä¢Schedule all my doctor's appointments\n‚Ä¢Visit friends\n‚Ä¢Go on a date \n‚Ä¢Have sex \n‚Ä¢Enjoy not having the urge to use the restroom so often\n\nMoving Out of state to start a completely new life .\n\nMaking phone calls, going outside and in general being a functioning person opposed to the scribbled mess I currently am\n\nNot being on this forum because people without anxiety don't hang out on anxiety forums that perpetuate their own anxiety\n\nWorry about what happens after 24 hours\n\nLay in bed and stare at the ceiling in silence and enjoy the peace and quiet for once. Would love that.\n\nReplying to all the friends I've been ghosting\n\nSo I can finally relax? I‚Äôd do exactly that, relax all day\n\nFirst hour: I make a list of every damn thing that has caused me to regret not conquering health-physical-and mental wise due to my fear. Second hour: Conquer the damn world.\n\nHave difficult conversations with people.

It's been maybe 2 yrs since I have\n\nSpending time with my family and my best friend\n\nProbably go to a rave or smth\n\njust living lols and enjoying my worry free day, maybe drink a lot of caffeine since i used to a lot\n\nprolly dance all night with friends and stop worrying about everything\n\nhaving a fun day with no worries of anything so probably with family and friends\n\nGABAtrol makes me feel like that for some hours üôè\n\nSwimming or taking a flight\n\nGood nights sleep then an MRI\n\nSleeping without waking up worried that I‚Äôm gonna get fired for absolutely no reason\n\nTalking to my coworkers!!! And applying for jobs that I think I I‚Äôm inadequate for!!

    "all_comment_text": "1a. Anxiety-induced nausea\n1b. Not being able to eat\n1c. The urge to shit out everything I‚Äôve ever eaten ever\n\nomg, i get the nausea and then i can‚Äôt eat and then i feel hungry so i feel more nauseous but i can‚Äôt eat so i get more hungry‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. ugh\n\nthis right here üòµ‚Äçüí´ such a vicious cycle!! Also my anxiety gets triggered even more by the nausea, so I get stuck in a never-ending feedback loop. üò≠\n\nYep! Every time I go for a job interview I have to make sure I go very early, and maybe bring some Poo-Pourri as well, and pray to God that my interviewers don't come into the bathroom while I'm there (or for a while afterward LMAO)!\n\nOr have the interview in the bathroom üòÇ\n\nThis reminded me that I have so much trouble using public bathrooms period. It's probably related to my anxiety disorder and general neurodivergence, but I become hyper aware of the fact that others can hear me so I have to wait for everyone else to leave. Even then, most of the time I still can't get myself to calm down because I'm not always entirely convinced the other people left or I hear noises that make me worry about more people coming in. It can be really tough so I mostly just hold it or use single person bathrooms. I think might be my answer to OP's question to be honest\n\n1d. The lack of food and nausea making the muscle tension worse ‚ú®\n\nHoly shit, I thought I was the only one who experienced this. When my anxiety was WAYY worse in the beginning, it was so bad. My stomach was hurting and I had to force myself to eat, only for it to come back up.\nThat‚Äôs the worst symptom\n\nI‚Äôm also like this and have to take Imodium before anything that will make me anxious.\n\nIkr like the anxiety is not enough, the body has got to revolt as well. Trying to seem normal takes so much effort as it is. ü•≤\n\nI would be okay with the racing mind and intrusive thoughts as long as it didn‚Äôt manifest itself physiologically. At my absolute worst, I was constantly in a state of fight/fight/freeze/fawn.\n\nI get this too and spoke to my therapist about it. Apparently it's been around a very long time, your body is trying to empty itself so you can get away from danger quicker.\n\nYesss !!\n\nRuminating about every possible wrong thing that could happen to me whenever I‚Äôm about to go somewhere\n\nIt sucks because I can never be excited about anything\n\nhate this. my mind ruminates about finding the exit in every place i go to so that i can be sure i will be able to leave fast if i need to\n\nMe too, prior to going anywhere I look it up on Google maps and read about it so I can see where the parking is and what the area looks like.\n\nI cant stand not having a good idea of where i‚Äôll be going\n\nEveryone doesn‚Äôt do this??\n\nNope haha. Believe it or not, some people are just carefree üòÖ\n\nNot me üòÄ\n\nYep. At any crowded public event I am planning and positioning. It‚Äôs hard for me to be present because I‚Äôm just scanning the crowd.\n\nSame here. in new or unfamiliar places/situations im very quiet and observant. \n\nAt the beginning of my relationship with my girlfriend she was convinced I was staring at other women, thank God she finally understood I was literally just watching everybody and what they were doing üòÇ\n\nAnxiety is really difficult to explain to people that don‚Äôt have it\n\ni used to do this, but with (TW) suicide-exits i could take quickly in any given situation if id completely humiliated myself &amp; the urge to die was unbearable... now i just don't leave the house\n\nThis or avoidance of things\n\nSame here. I was a paramedic for 13 years so I suffer with hyper vigilance. I‚Äôve seen too much. I know too much. Can‚Äôt do crowds at all.\n\nIntrusive thoughts and tense muscles.\n\nFeeling like I‚Äôm gonna pass out\n\nYes this, feels like the ground is opening up and falling in.\n\nYeah I hate that shitty feeling. Feels exactly like that\n\nExcept I actually pass out\n\nor actually passing out\n\nCan‚Äôt imagine. üò¢ sorry\n\nDo you feel like you will loose control? I feel I will pass out or loose control over myself and it is horrible\n\nI‚Äôve lost control once from what the doctor said was a panic attack‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt speak, couldn‚Äôt think and my body went numb, everything was blurry and felt like I was shutting down. But that only happened once and since then I‚Äôve been fearing it. It‚Äôs a loop. I‚Äôve never actually passed out before but each time it feels like I definitely will.\n\nThis!\n\nDevastating\n\nüíØ Never have. But how can we get over this?\n\nI do pass out and it really sucks :(\n\nThat‚Äôs my biggest fear. I‚Äôm so sorry\n\nYes. So hard to catch my breath when I‚Äôm panicked. Anxiety makes my breathing patterns so wonky. Only really happens in public too, of course. So there‚Äôs extra anxiety about how I look while I‚Äôm silently freaking out in my head, just hoping I don‚Äôt spiral and actually end up passing out because then I‚Äôd really have all eyes on me. Since I‚Äôve been practicing deep, diaphragmatic breathing, it‚Äôs gotten so much better.\n\noh my gosh i thought i was the only one\n\nThis is mine as well. Hate it so much! üò©\n\nI‚Äôve had this since I was in 8th grade and it‚Äôs AWFUL. I‚Äôve only ever actually passed out once and it was while a tattoo artist was putting the stencil on me. I got anxious bc I had to stand up and be still. üôÉ Mortifying.\n\nGoing nonverbal\n\nHow do you deal with it? Especially if you have to work. I‚Äôm asking because my brain blocks - my brain CAN‚ÄôT block when I‚Äôm working and I have no idea what to do about it. Besides all the physical symptoms, going nonverbal/blocked brain are such debilitating symptoms.\n\nWhen you figure it out, please let me know.\n\nHonestly, I still struggle very much with it. I often go nonverbal at school but it is a little easier for me since I do not have any friends that I have to associate with in the first place (by choice). I also go nonverbal in restaurants too. If I can I like to put in a wireless headphone in one of my ears and listen to music, which is not aloud at school but I do it anyways.\n\nThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs cool about wireless earphones. They‚Äôre way subtler than the freakin wire giving it all away. I wish I had those in hs it would‚Äôve been way more enjoyable lol\n\nI've had it happen a few times. The worst was when I was trying to open up to my mom about how bad my mental health had been and I got so anxious I completely clammed up and couldn't say anything. I ended up pulling out my notes app to talk to her\n\nNot eating, overthinking, intrusive thoughts, staying in bed more than I should. But really the overthinking is horrible. I absolutely hate it as I think of the worse scenarios possible and keep thinking on it.\n\nThis is what I do and when my anxiety is really bad, this carries on for days and I get to the point I don‚Äôt even feel like myself. Everything feels weird and I over analyze every single thought, feeling, and emotion.\n\nMe too it‚Äôs horrible\n\nWeak legs, disassociation, dizziness, inability to breathe, IMPENDING DOOM. Can‚Äôt pick just one. The feeling that you may die. I‚Äôve had my heartbeat go to almost 200\n\n200 üò≥ wooow!! So glad you are still here to share your experiences! Your heart had to feel like it was going to erupt\n\ncrowd boast wine dinner juggle muddle light rob nine test\n\nAbsolutely debilitating when it's at it's worst. I had about a week of feeling completely detached from reality, my body, and my mind. I had a few dental appointments back to back and I think the anesthesia and laughing gas screwed me up quite a bit. Plus, I just under a lot of stress at the time. And I was recovering from an injury and dissociating from pain. I couldn't go to school. I couldn't do anything.\n\nThis is one of the most horrible feelings anyone could experience. You literally feel like you're crazy and need help asap\n\nDerealization\n\nYup. Feels like I‚Äôm in the sunken place watching myself carry out everything.\n\nCould you please explain a little further?\n\nFeels like a detachment from reality, like you are in a dream. It causes dizziness, lightheadedness, blunted emotions, etc\n\nI went through a really bad time in Jan/Feb and I've had derealization ever since üò£ hoping it goes away soon. I know it doesn't last forever but these past 5ish months have been so tough\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through that. Last time I had it, it also took months for me to feel better.. it will get better soon! Hang in there &lt;3\n\nThank you! It's so hard. And I'm impatient so I keep thinking \"how much longer is it going to take??\" Knowing that that attitude only prolongs it lol. I'm glad it went away for you!!\n\nPff I feel that‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think about a pink elephant‚Äù thing.. unfortunately brains like to hyperfocus on whatever it is they can‚Äôt control. In the end I just accepted it and accepted the fact that it is not dangerous, just unnerving. Eventually it passed. I hope that happens for you soon also!\n\nsameüò©\n\nThe WORST üò£\n\nShaking. Like extreme shaking.\n\nSame, mine is like seizures\n\nOh man. That‚Äôs rough ü´Ç\n\nMine straight up makes holding anything impossible. I once tried to hold a pint glass and my hand was just violently and uncontrollably shaking.\n\nSo happy i'm not alone ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π\n\nHonestly, me too. \n\nWe‚Äôll get through this. I promise\n\nActually I had this all my life, im 30 now, but I made it til 30, why would I even think to give up for the next 3 decades?\n\nThat‚Äôs an awesome way to think of it. My life has been significantly shorter than yours (only 17) however I have struggled. But honestly, I dunno if you care but you have sorta given me a bit more of a reason to not let it get to me. I wanna be sorta like you. Still living despite my problems ü´Ç\n\nSame here!\n\nMakes working difficult and embarrassing for me. If I‚Äôm around certain people I‚Äôm okay but others I‚Äôm not as comfortable around it can get really bad, especially if I‚Äôm being watched. I work in facility maintenance so I have to use my hands a lot and the shaking makes it tough sometimes.\n\nHeart palpitations and nausea\n\nUneasy feeling in chest\n\nlike ya hearts gonna just stop soon\n\nThey all suck, but probably either dizziness or nausea. \n\nNausea always hits worse when I'm in work meetings (or in places that I feel trapped) so that's bad.\n\nDizziness hits whenever, and kind of stops me in my tracks from whatever I'm doing, it also may either last 30 seconds or the entire day with no telling. So dizziness might be worse.\n\nOverproduction of gas for some reason??? Extreme nausea \nTremor\n\nThe gas thing also happens to me... its such a specific silly thing, but can cause sooo much pain üò≠\n\nYesss I like go somewhere get anxious and can‚Äôt stop burping lol it‚Äôs so weird\n\nMight be a digestive issue which commonly leads to anxiety, adrenaline dumps, panic attacks, and a slew of issues people with anxiety experience. A lot of people with gerd or other digestive issues have anxiety due to the vagus nerve being aggravated by the stomach. Anxiety is always a symptom of a deeper issue whether it be digestive, stress, dehydration, poor sleep habits, psychological, and  neurological just to name a few things.\n\nHad a friend who was almost kicked out of an exam for excessive flatulence from exam anxiety üòÇ\n\nMuscular pain between my ribs during a panic attack.\n\nMan, I‚Äôve only had this on a few of my very worst panic attacks, it excruciating pain that makes my insides feel like they are on fire\n\nYup, that's what I have, too. Except mine is more like acid.\n\nPhysically, I feel a pit feeling in my stomach, which usually leads to me breaking down and crying. Though on the bright side, I'm able to tell someone I'm about to have an anxiety attack because of it.  \nMentally, overthinking because it never stops and makes me feel like ill never have peace.\n\nThis!!!\n\nEvery physical symptom ever... Then my Health anxiety spikes and everything gets worse\n\nThis is me, too! Health related anxiety is really just awful and nothing seems to help it.\n\nShortness of breath. I always feel like I need to take a deep breath and most of the time it isn‚Äôt satisfying :(\n\nlike you can't a full breath, no matter how deep you inhale. it's the worst.\n\nYUP\n\nI‚Äôve found practicing different breathing techniques helps me! Boteyko breathing, mindfulness of the breath, etc‚Ä¶\n\nIbs.\n\nIntrusive thought. Everyone‚Äôs thinking the worst possible thing about me. Can‚Äôt even say the things I want to say because I‚Äôm overthink the whole situation .\n\nInsomnia, then severe anxiety before going to work.\n\nPhysically debilitating: heart palpitations and nausea that can come with it.  \nEmotionally debilitating: having multiple thoughts going at once to the point you become detached and feel paralyzed\n\nI hate that‚Ä¶ random thoughts bouncing back and forth or multiple happening at once\n\nWhen you feel isolated from people\n\n Middle chest/sternum pain, heart palpitations, irregular pulse , GERD symptoms\n\nthe tiredness and waste of energy when my body stresses. even if I manage to get through an anxiety provoking situation, I'll have no energy to do anything else afterwards\n\nWhen my heart rate spikes and my hands start shaking ‚Äî sends me into a spiral lol\n\nDefinitely the muscle tightness and chest tightness. I feel like I'm suffocating.\n\nProbably the really tight throat and trouble swallowing with a really tense upper body. \nJust ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù in bed with the posture of a shrimp. ü¶ê\n\nDerealization/depersonalization\n\nBecoming house locked. I‚Äôm generally fine once I‚Äôm out in the world but leaving the house is the absolute hardest part\n\nFeeling like I can‚Äôt breathe. That really terrifies me.\n\nFor me it would be the dpdr, intrusive thoughts, and physical symptoms that make me feel like I‚Äôm immediately about to meet Jesus.\n\nSometimes I read posts like this and legit cry, because having anxiety is so crippling sometimes. It feels great to know that I‚Äôm not alone.\n\nSame here &lt;3 it‚Äôs reassuring to know that you‚Äôre not going crazy and the symptoms we feel are unfortunately common\n\nFreeze mode.\n\nThe flight or flight (I have no fight!).\n\nSame, team flight üò¢\n\nChronic back pain and rage panic attacks\n\nderealization\n\nintrusive thoughts all the time\n\nhot flashes and sweating\n\nSame. Makes me panic even more knowing others can see it.\n\nHuge trigger &amp; spirals out of control.  I couldn‚Äôt stay in class in high school &amp; college, because of it!!  Was humiliating‚Ä¶..  &amp; traumatic.  Everyone DOES look at one weird!\n\nyes! and then the smell + felling damp and sticky‚Ä¶ that makes me panic even more.\n\nDepersonalisation and or feeling of about to faint\n\nExtreme fatigue. I just want to sleep all day\n\nBasically in a nutshell summed up: life... Anxiety just destroys life and precious time... And it's taken away decades of my life what could have been possibly good years, fruitful years, years of growth and exploration, years of just well-being...\nBut I'm 51 now, and I'm tired every day. I know I don't have much time left. \nAnxiety, it robs you of life. Any decent life.\n\nLashing-out üò≠ I get it from my dad üôÉ\n‚ÄúI get mean when I‚Äôm nervous like a bad dog‚Äù type of shit. I think this symptom is more associated with men so as a woman people aren‚Äôt always used to it üò¨\n\nI have a better grip on that symptom luckily. I think the most debilitating symptom is shutting down. I can‚Äôt think or speak properly, which makes me more anxious and it spirals.\n\nFucking nausea and brain fog\n\n Like a weight on my chest, the inability to think about anything else, and the utter hopelessness that comes along with it.\n\nShortness of breath, nail biting and increased sensory sensitivity. At some point before an acute crisis, I start to become extremely sensitive and self-conscious about parts of my body, even the touch of my own hair or the feel of my skin/mouth bothers me.\n\nPhysically I guess it's the racing heart that makes me feel like I'm going to die. And the fact I always need the bathroom, ahem.\n\nMentally it's the fact I can never shut my brain off. I'm always thinking and always worrying. A 24hr day feels like a month because I can't distract myself enough from my thoughts to enjoy myself.\n\nThe fact I‚Äôm tired 24/7.\n\nshortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, shaking, and nausea.\n\nHeart palpitations and shortness of breath, leading me to think that I am having a heart attack, which causes more anxiety, which causes more heart palpitations and worse shortness of breath, leading me to really think that I'm having a heart attack, and the cycle continues downward. üòï\n\nLiterally spending hours in an agonizing ruminating loop and the inability to stop constantly feeling incredibly anxious about the smallest things like an interaction or someones perceived opinion of me. The inability to make a decision without external validation due to extreme fear of making the wrong one and the literal pain it causes my brain to try to do so on my own without it.\n\nfeeling of doom. i can be so content with life and be happy but then that feeling of i‚Äôm going to die one day and it all goes away just rushes in\n\nBreathing... Air hunger, involuntary holding my breath, tightening my jaw and throat muscles. Feels like I'm getting strangled all the time\n\nhonestly, when my hands start tingling it freaks me out because i know i‚Äôm about to have a panic attack, and that i have to act in the next 30 seconds to prevent it from being a horrible experience. basically when my extremities start tingling it‚Äôs the worst symptom because i know shit is about to go down.\n\n1. Nausea\n2. Feeling like I can‚Äôt breathe\n3. Random pain (Neck, Pelvic Floor, Chest, Head)\n\nNausea when also having Emetophobia causing more Anxiety and more Nausea. Never ending.\n\nThe overwhelming sense of doom. That this is it, I am done. I am either goimg to die or something absolutely horrible will happen.\n\nTurns me into a hysterical mess, that is very hard to reason with. Its ruined both my proffessional and personal relationships\n\nthe dizziness constant dizziness‚Ä¶ i can‚Äôt leave my house without being dizzy all of the time although i‚Äôve learned to ignore it a bit. can‚Äôt walk in big open spaces without swaying or without using a buggy in stores. it‚Äôs very annoying and makes me become agoraphobic and not leave my house. i just want to go out in public like a normal person without any symptoms or feeling off balance\n\nTask paralysis\n\nThis too. It makes me procrastinate and seek mindless comfort: Endlessly scrolling through reddit, playing songs on repeat, sorting files on my computer, instead of doing things in life that I'd actually find interesting. I can't even bring myself to play a video game and instead just mindlessly scroll. It's kind of crazy.\n\nIt‚Äôs honestly such a relief seeing so many people list symptoms that I‚Äôve been having too. I often think, surely anxiety can‚Äôt cause something THIS bad. Guess it can, and I‚Äôm not the only one\n\nParalysis - inability to think or do anything.\n\nthe feeling that I can‚Äôt put my finger on what horrible thing is going to happen to me at this EXACT moment‚Ä¶and the feeling lasts all day\n\nBruxism. Aka grinding my teeth and clenching my jaw non stop. Also OBSESSIVE OBSESSIVE worrying about things out of my control to the point of dread. Also my frequent absolutely fucked up and terrifying  nightmares. Even in rest I can‚Äôt escape my anxiety.\n\nIt'd have to be a tie between being too stomach sick to eat or feeling like I'm going to pass out\n\nCognitive issues (stress/anxiety negatively affects memory and creativity), inflammation, paralysis/incapable of taking action, the sense of dread that often causes agony and distress.\n\nLiterally just cannot think or speak\n\nWhen im in my bad days the worst are feeling dizzy, thinking im gonna pass out  diarrhea and my heart rate going feom 0 to 100 in less than a second\n\nOverthinking, feeling hypersensitive to heart, palpitations, chest pains, and muscle tensions\n\nHeadaches and nausea. They stop me in my tracks.\n\nHang freaking xiety (anxiety after drinking or even during)\n\nIBS-D. My life outside of home is dictated by the perceived availability of nearby bathrooms, and time needed to travel between them.\n\nNausea :(\n\nI have the inability to sit still, causing me to become more and more exhausted every day.\n\ni become so erratic and my chest feels so tight to the point i can‚Äôt eat, sleep or breathe.\n\nAir hunger and jelly legs\n\nfeeling nauseous all the time and hypervigilant, literally spiking anxiety from morning till bed lmao\n\nInsomnia... Devastating insomnia...\n\nBeing terrified in a public place and faces morph. The heart racing terror in a place I can‚Äôt leave on demand.\n\nKnots in stomach and a dread of everything.\n\nIt's the sleep disturbances for me. I am so exhausted all the time.\n\nStuttering w/ an existing speech impediment &amp; not being able to breathe because i reflexively hold my breath\n\nI‚Äôm not even sure how to explain it, but I get this form of dissociation (DPDR) where I feel super hallow and disconnected from my body. It‚Äôs like a bubble is in between me and my body\n\nThe freeze response. When I can‚Äôt do anything\n\nHow ill I feel 60% of the time\n\nThe buzzy static-y feeling in my chest (and all over at times). The looming disaster feeling... that feeling of emptiness and dread that makes me hunch my shoulders and glues me to my seat. My hummingbird heartbeat that feels like pounding all over my body and is wayyyyy too loud!\n\nThe way suddenly my tinnitus is 10x louder, and I feel like surely everyone hears it.\n\nThey all are tied for the worst, I guess.\n\nAll of them together is a real fun time.\n\nProbably similar to what you‚Äôre describing. Tight chest, feeling like there‚Äôs a weight on my chest, feeling like I can‚Äôt breathe right/chest heaviness. It can easily put me into panic mode. And it‚Äôs uncomfortable af.\n\na sense of dread that is so intense that it physically feels like evil black electricity washing over me, wave after wave. i can feel the panic coursing through my veins like poison. a yawning void opens all around me, obstructing my vision and my reason as i begin to sink beneath the surface.\n\nthis sensation comes out of nowhere and has no identifiable trigger. but once its started, a feeling of utter desolation colors everything and no amount of positive thinking or \"self love\" will resolve it.\n\nthat is my anxiety.\n\nShaking all over, not being able to relax, bored but can't hold my attention, overthinking very badly along with the intrusive thoughts, high heart rate, and feeling like something really bad is going to happen if I do certain things.\n\nLocking up during a regular social interaction, like with check out person when buying something.\n\n Chronic pain from muscle tension and intrusive thoughts.\n\nBlanking out and feeling helpless, unsure of what to do.\n\nIBS-D\n\nSometimes it gets so bad this icy feeling will happen suddenly. It's from the inside. Like ice water in my tissues. I catch myself and tell myself to breathe because I think it might be a warning that I'm going to pass out.\n\nedited for spelling\n\nAll of it. At this point, I honestly can't just pick one symptom whether it's physical or mental. They all are debilitating.\n\nDefinitely the overthinking because it triggers many more symptoms during and after ü•≤\n\nOverthinking. This causes all the symptoms for me. This causes anxiety over the trigger\n\nThat pit in my stomach feeling of impending doom that makes me want to jump off a bridge (I‚Äôm being a bit dramatic, but it really is debilitating for me).\n\npicking up on little details and overthinking all different scenarios in my head it's draining af\n\nSometimes rashes/hives depending on the severityü•≤.... while I was in college, it was almost every day, and I was just so so itchy. It was embarrassing. It wouldn't let me focus because I was itching, and it would create more anxiety because I felt gross... I couldn't sleep well because the itchiness wouldn't stop. Thankfully, this particular symptom disappeared after college! But it was the worst symptom to me.\n\nOther than that: intrusive thoughts, not as in what if I jump a bridge? But instead, what if I get fired today? And on a Saturday evening when I'm off and nothing work related is happening. I swear the self-hate voice is very active.\n\nOverthinking to the point of pure self hatred\n\nShortness of breath. I have to take a deep breath all the time, and most of the time im not able to. Also dealing with tightness in the chest, sore shoulders, neck, back and ribs because im not able to breath properly. Wish i knew how to deal with this since its been like this for over 10 years.\n\nIntrusive thoughts... going crazy and thinking that i will never be able to come back from this\n\nThe paralyzing fear/realization that i cant escape my own body\n\nTension headache that originates at the back of my skull/nape of my neck. I can feel it start as soon as a conversation I‚Äôm having goes south or if I have nothing else to contribute or talk about. I get progressively more nervous as I realize I don‚Äôt know what else to say and the headache compounds it. I hate it so much.\n\nIntrusive thoughts\n\nshaky hands... unable to hold things straight\n\nNausea and Diarrhea and most importantly, worrying about both!\n\nWhen it hides.\n\n\"Nah, I don't want to go out tonight.\"\n\nThe gut feeling. The non stop stomach churning butterflies. The thoughts I can handle. The gut feeling‚Ä¶ I want to die\n\nParalysis - inability to do anything, not like physical paralysis. \n\nActually starting to do things helps a lot\n\nknowing it‚Äôs just in my head but not being able to stop it\n\n1. Diarrhea. Gone into social isolation for a year because of this.\n\n2. Anything heart related: racing heart, heart palpitations.\n\nI have histamine intolerance, meaning I can get these very symptoms just from a small amount of stress (if I‚Äôm unlucky and my histamine bucket keeps getting filled). I just can‚Äôt deal with either of it, it‚Äôs horrifying to me.\n\nDiarrhea üò©\n\nI also get the crushing chest along with chest and arm pains, dizziness and palpitations. Racing thoughts and impending doom. It's absolutely crippling when it happens. Worst thing is to check symptoms on Google during an attack."

    "all_comment_text": "Didn't even know this had a name but yeah...definitely. anxiety medication has cut down on my thought looping significantly though.¬†\n\nwhat are you scared of?\n\nEverything honestly, every little ailment I freak out wondering if it's cancer. My most recent was when I got some eczema and convinced myself it was leukemia.¬†\n\nSo hypochondria?\n\nYup. It sucks.¬†\n\nI guess I was wondering what you meant by ‚Äúeverything‚Äù, as in, everything health based specifically? Or if it was something closer to generalized anxiety, which I have , and is also very frustrating. Health is one thing I actually don‚Äôt worry about, or I do but don‚Äôt take action. It takes effort to put my own self preservation first, and maintaining a regime is something I struggle with. \n\nI‚Äôm trying by this thing where if I have a thought I shouldn‚Äôt shut it down. Or over explain myself. \n\n\nWork in progress ;) and I‚Äôm workin on the progress! \n\nThanks for sharing and shedding some light, I really wish you the best\n\nI've had cancer related health anxiety for about 3 years now and my therapist thinks its also creating somatic symptoms.\n  \nAnyways heres a list of cancers/weird shit I've done:  \n\n- Leg hurts, spend days touching it prodding it measuring it for a sarcoma.  \n- Eye pupils seemed slightly different size in a photo - Write a python program where I inputted every photo of me I had and measured the eye size ratio and graphed it out.  \n- Finger up my ass to check my prostate  \n- felt a small cyst on a ball, rubbed and checked it to the point the nut swelled up (hearby solidifying my death)  \n- Hyper analyse every single poo for consistency and colour changes.  \n- Breathlessness is always lung cancer, started plotting my peak flows on graphs when I'm breathless.  \n- My rabbits got weirdly nervous around me once and convinced myself rabbits could sense cancer  \n- finger nails, grey hair, random pains, smelly farts, tired, headache etc etc any number of tiny differences or changes in my body is cancer.  \n- my spine, thought my spine was a tumor  \n- I have a weak pelvic floor from being so tense, naa doctor is an idiot, obviously cancer  \n- If someone I hear about or on the news dies of cancer, I research that cancer, the likelihood and whether I match the symptoms...\n\n  \nTherapy and meds helped massively, I still have the cancer fear but its wayyyy more manageable without over checking and analysing.\n  \nI'm not even scared if dying, I'm just scared of losing control and it being out if my hands.\n\n[deleted]\n\ndo you mind sharing which med has been most effective for you?\n\nSo I was on sertraline.  It took months of tweaking of dosage to be happy.\n  \nI did however have to come off it as I reduced my health anxiety about diseases but it made me insanely hot.  So I started to get anxious about that.\n  \nSince coming off it my anxiety is still not cured but at a more manageable level.\n\nThis is literally my life to a T\n\nI‚Äôve never seen a more relatable comment.\n\nThis has been my trending illness to fear the past few months\n\nwhat illness you fear?\n\nCancer, Als , and heart attacks are the 3 i cycle back and fourth from\n\nMine are cancer or any neurological disease.\n\nMS and Graves‚Äô for me. Cancer and tumors too.\n\nOmg ALS is my #1. Been experiencing chest numbness three days now a lot of people in the anxiety community say is a symptom of bad anxiety but it still freaks me out!¬†\n\nMine started at like 13 years old my neighbor got it and would drive his power chair around the neighborhood looking smaller everyday. He left behind a bunch of young kids it was horrific. It started my health anxiety journey 20 years earlier.\n\nwhat type of (c)\n\nSkin cancer and brain cancer are very scary to me atm\n\nI haven‚Äôt added heart attacks to the rotation.\n\nEvery ache, pain, rash, bump, lump, crump, and tickle on my body has, at one time or another, been attributed to cancer by Dr. Brain. He has a 0% success rate, but you never know.\n\nOmg!! Same!! It‚Äôs so bad!!\n\ns a m e\n\nYes totally. My dad was diagnosed in January. He refused all treatment and died last week. I‚Äôve had some pain under my right breast. It feels like an infection and it‚Äôs not really *in * the breast.  I had a mammogram Saturday. They‚Äôd like me back for a repeat and an ultrasound in two weeks. So, I‚Äôm in full panic attack mode and am also still grieving. This week has been stressful and everything I read in the news seems to be about cancer rates rising.\n\n Im sorry. Fuck that man. I have a lump in my boob. I discovered it at 30. I was so certain i was gona die. Turned out to be a cyst that i have 30 years later. \n\nA lady at my work had 3 jars of fluid removed from her breast / armpit area. \n\nAll kinds of stuff can be wrong without it being cancer so hang tight\n\nWas this your first mammogram?  I wish someone had told me that ultrasounds were absolutely normal in your first mammograms because they don't yet have a map of your breast tissue.   The week between my initial mammogram and the ultrasound were torture for me .. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep.  I was physically quivering and nearly passed out waiting for the doc to come back with the ultrasound results.  It was a benign cyst.  \nLuckily, knowing the distress the waiting gave me.  They now just schedule me with an ultrasound the same day.  Still nerve wracking but just for an hour.\n\nYes, absolutely. Thank you for saying that, I‚Äôve been having panic attacks in between grieving ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I‚Äôm pretty sure I have costochondritis, but I‚Äôm worried there might be *something else*, you know?\n\nI‚Äôd also like to tag on my own experience here; I had 2 bumps on my chest and I have had literally crippling non stop hypochondria for about half a decade or longer now, and cancer has been the biggest fear of mine for my entire life. In my mind I was already one foot in the grave, so there wasn‚Äôt even any point in confirming, but I finally actually went to the doctors for the first time ever and got referred to go to a hospital only a couple of weeks ago, and literally, he took one look at it and said it was nothing. I had legitimately 2 lumps, in my mind that is just doom, but it was nothing. Apparently like 8/10 bumps found aren‚Äôt cancer. I get that isn‚Äôt exactly your situation, but my point is, there are *tons* of other explanations. Both the bumps were from entirely different things, one was a cyst and one was a keloid scar. Getting called back makes it seem extremely serious and scary but it is not uncommon.\n\nPlease, I won‚Äôt tell you to relax because I‚Äôve been there and I know it‚Äôs impossible but, I went through this exact same scare and it was a cyst!! It is so common and many things cause breast cysts!  Even though I know this, I still dread the next mammogram for this exact reason.  I literally want a double mastectomy now to be honest, just get them off of me.  I really hope your results also turn out to be nothing.  These call backs are very common. I wish the breast centers were more vocal about how common it is.  So many of us get put through a stage 11 panic wringer over it.\n\nSorry to hear that. My dad passed from cancer in 2020. My mom had breast cancer a year later and now is fine. I had cancer cells in my cervix and am now fine. But my cat died from cancer a week ago and that was what finally broke me. Felt like I got through all of that just for the thing that has been here through all of that departed in the same way. The anxiety is unbearable.\n\nI completely relate to that. I lost my mom and it was so so hard. But then, a couple years later I lost my elderly cat, and I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. It absolutely crushed me. She was a senior, and I just hadn‚Äôt appreciated it. We‚Äôd had another cat until he was 20, so when my girl hit 14 I didn‚Äôt think much of it.  I didn‚Äôt know about super seniors and I just thought we had another five or so years with her.     \nI totally broke down for a couple months. It was my midlife crisis, basically. It broke me. I don‚Äôt have kids and I doted on her, damn it.  I can‚Äôt think of another death that‚Äôs affected me so so much as that, as weird as it seems. My friends bought me flowers, it was so bad.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. Please remember there are other things it could be (cysts, infections, etc) so don't assume the worst, but also most of the time cancer is very treatable.\n\nLook after yourself x\n\nIt is a treacherous disease, that is the most terrible thing. But I have a cousin who had surgery because of a cyst (uterine area) and she recovered; my aunt had to remove a tumor that was already quite large and this after she lived with hip pain. She had medical follow-up for a while. Her case was assessed as benign and the surgery was enough.¬†\n\nDo your best to feel at ease as much as possible. You're going through so much! Stress is a killer in itself. üíê\n\nGathering your baseline means going back for an ultrasound most of the time. I had to do it every 6 months for 2 years after that because of the density in my breasts. It's totally standard because mammos can't pick up everything. Let us know how it goes.\n\nThat‚Äôs really good to know. I‚Äôm not dense at all, the mammogram wasn‚Äôt *that* uncomfortable. I‚Äôm going to take a couple Tylenol, possibly a quarter gravol, and hope for the best.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. Sending you lots of calm, positive thoughts for your upcoming tests. ü§ç\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry for your loss! My condolences to you! GOD BLESS!!!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nI'm sorry about that. The worst thing for an anxious person is an avalanche of things going on at once, too many things to handle. The companion just becomes that chill down your spine or stomach where you feel like you're on a roller coaster going around. And what we put in our minds is not always compatible with reality and then you suffer in anticipation, even before it happens.¬†\n\nMy moms entire family has had all types of cancer, im going to get cancer no matter what i do. \n\n\nMy grandpa died of colon cancer.\nLast year i got extreme pains in my stomach. It felt like my intestines had ruptured or something. I was pooping blood. At that point i thought, well, there's the cancer. \nI was hospitalized for a few days, i told them about my family (cancer) history.\nThey tried to wait for me to be able to give them a fecal sample, but i was all out already, and it hurt my stomach to eat. So it took 5 days before i had a sample again. I got fluids because of all the bloodloss and they gave me several scans and bloodtests in the mean time. \n\n\nTurned out it was just bad luck, bacteria i randomly picked up while going out probably. It took about 3 weeks at home to get back to normal. It was a nasty bacteria man.\n\n\nIm glad they took my family history seriously and they actually asked me if i was worried about getting cancer.\n\nMan I get some tummy rumbles and a minor stomach ache and my brain starts pumping the intrusive thoughts. I would have absolutely been losing my shit if I were in your place.\n\nDo u recall the name of the bacteria out of curiosity\n\nFrom the description I would guess e coli. It's a nasty one and can give you bloody diarrhea. If you're worried about catching it yourself just make sure you wash your fruit and vegetables and practice good food safety and you should be fine.\n\nI have anxiety over having cancer and just death from an aliment!!!! It‚Äôs never ending and started to get really bad after my sister passed away in 22‚Äô\n\nI‚Äôve had this, but when my mom passed away in 2021.\n\nDid anything help?\n\nNope not yet, trying to process the grief first then I don‚Äôt know what else is next! It‚Äôs just a day to day thing to be honest.\n\nThat‚Äôs exactly where I‚Äôm at!!!! I‚Äôm so ready for the anxiety symptoms to stop cause it‚Äôs draining especially being a momma to 4 kids who I want to be around for\n\nI don‚Äôt have kids but I just feel that this health anxiety is eating me alive every fuckin day. I never get a reprieve from it.\n\nMan, I had this phobia for the longest time, I‚Äôd almost pass out from the panic attacks. Then last year I was diagnosed with non Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma by some sick joke of the universe haha. Good news is I survived and cancer treatment has come so incredibly far (chemo still beats your ass though). I absolutely still have health anxiety, but I think it helped me understand that life is nothing if just a chain of uncertainties. Once you actually find yourself in your own personal nightmare, you just end up taking it as it comes. The initial panic wears off eventually. Now I will say that I am incredibly lucky in that what I was diagnosed with has a 90% survival rate. I can‚Äôt speak for those with terminal cancer.\n\nCongrats on your recovery!\n\nAlways a fear of a brain tumour\n\nMe. I have emetophobia or fear of throwing up so if I get cancer I'm not doing chemo or radiation.\n\nI think I am becoming a hypochondriac but I'm definitely worried about cancer specifically as well. A big trigger of my anxiety has been death in my family. I had an aunt pass of cancer and then a year ago, my grandmother passed after some kind of cancer as well. Even though I have gotten bloodwork done and gone to the doctor recently, I get migraines a lot (because I hold tension in my neck) and a brain tumor is always in the back of my mind. It's so annoying :(\n\nI've been in a similar spot, I like to remind myself of what my doctor told me during a visit for a week-long tension headache: the brain doesn't have pain receptors, so head pain isn't necessarily a sign of something in the brain.\n\n‚Ä¶. My mind is blown. I‚Äôm going to write this down as another reminder. Thank you üò≠üò≠\n\nMy Uncle passed from Pancreatic Cancer in 2021 and it‚Äôs been a downward spiral ever since. Only thing that has helped ease my mind is speaking with doctors.\n\nThe best thing you can do is talk to your family doctor. They can put your fears to rest.\n\nYeah, typically, but not for people with health anxiety. These fears will rest for a few days, weeks or months, but unfortunately, never for long.\n\nI‚Äôve dealt with health anxiety all my life and the only tried and true resolution involves speaking to a doctor.\n\ni have this for sure. grandfather had pancreatic and mother had skin. i live my entire life based on reducing chances of cancer. literally. exercise for more than an hour every day. eat whole grains and 3 + servings of vegetables. dont eat meat. don‚Äôt smoke. don‚Äôt tan. drink socially. it‚Äôs not a horrible way to live. i have a lot of exercise related goals. i feel better and my anxiety has improved significantly since i made all of these changes. i started getting check ups more frequently. i have well over 100 freckles and moles on my body, not easy when skin cancer is in the family. i haven‚Äôt eliminated my anxiety, i probably never will, but it‚Äôs more manageable. i have fears of other random illnesses but i only fear ‚Äúsevere‚Äù illnesses. tumors, cancer, blood clots, stroke, poisoning of some sort, etc. someone once said to me that my fears are unrealistic if i only fear illnesses that will kill me. obviously they were much nicer about it and that‚Äôs a paraphrase. but it changed my perspective a lot. it‚Äôs not likely that something life threatening will randomly hit me. it‚Äôs likely i‚Äôll get lots of colds in my life, maybe a few stomach bugs,  maybe i will break a bone. things will happen to me regardless but all of my chances are surviving are much higher than what i give myself credit for. the human body is capable of a lot.\n\nIt sounds like you are having obsessive thoughts around cancer and getting it. \n\nYou‚Äôre looking for reassurance on this sub which will only exasperate the suffering.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou should look into exposure response and prevention therapy\n\nI found a lump on my thigh earlier this year and it freaked me out so hard that I was a wreck waiting for an appointment.  It was so high on my thigh that the appointment was not a comfortable one. Evidently I stretched too hard and popped a lymphnode.\n\nHey how are you now\n\nCompletely fine.  It was just my Anxiety amping me up.  The bump disappeared in days.\n\nYep. I am constantly afraid I have breast cancer.  I have larger breasts and a dimple on the underside of one and I've asked during breast exams and they say it's normal and just how the tissue in my breast is.  I have PCOS and have flare ups of hidradenitis suppurativa and I convince myself it's breast cancer all the time.  \n\nI sometimes think I'm having a stroke where I'll stand up lift my arms above my head and smile in the mirror to convince myself I'm not.  I get a lot of headaches and I think that they're brain aneurysms because that's how my aunt died.\n\nFear is a real feeling that helps humans survive. Sometimes the fear can be kicked into overdrive and can only be leveled out by looking at it from a different angle. Is there a particular type of cancer you are worried about? Neck asymmetry can be related to scoliosis which isn‚Äôt cancer at all. The best you can do with fear is talk to a medical doctor. Talk with a doctor about a possible xray of your neck to rule out bone or muscle related issues.\n\n**Apologies in advance for the long reply**\n\nI personally don‚Äôt fear cancer anymore‚Ä¶maybe I‚Äôve just become more passively suicidal but it‚Äôs SO hard to avoid most cancers‚Ä¶.especially if it runs in your family. \n\nI diagnosed myself with every cancer possible‚Ä¶well like, cancers more directed towards those with a cis female body lol (i.e. breast cancer) \n\n‚Ä¶.but more recently (well like 2021) I diagnosed myself with colon cancer. That year was HELL for me. Had all the symptoms. Was too scared and unfocused to work (would have full blown panic attacks while at my job and even cried in front of a customer‚Ä¶I worked in retail) so I made some savings and my tax return STRETCH for awhile. \n\nWent back and forth to the emergency room because I thought I was about to have a heart attack due from reoccurring chest pain‚Ä¶.that would, of course, just go away once I reached the damn hospital‚Ä¶..so I looked crazy as hell. \n\nAnd doctors were so over me, they kept telling me to go to my primary care doctor first‚Ä¶.but my dumbass was like‚Ä¶.maybe I just should look for a GI specialist‚Ä¶.since I‚Äôm just gonna get sent to one eventually (yall, that was a waste of time) no one took my damn insurance (even though they‚Äôd be listed on my insurance‚Äôs website???) finally came across one and he wasted TF outta my time. I was 24 at the time, he flat out told me ‚Äúwell since you‚Äôre so young, I‚Äôm not going to take this that seriously‚Äù WHAT? \n\nMy depression was at an ALL TIME HIGH. He just kept telling me to two cap fills of Miralax (powder and water mixture ) and come back to him in like 1 -2 MONTHS. \n\nThat did NOT work, as you would expect‚Ä¶ so I finally gained some sense a reached out to my primary care doctor‚Ä¶..this was October‚Ä¶.they didn‚Äôt have any more openings til December. Bruh. But I took that slot but remembered a doctor way closer to me but I didn‚Äôt know if they took my insurance‚Ä¶.they did (yay) and luckily they were able to get me in like‚Ä¶.within a week. That doctor took my concerns very seriously and quickly recommended a specialist. \n\nI had to get a colonoscopy (for the colon cancer symptoms) and a EGD (for the horrid chest pain) üôÉ\n\n\n‚Ä¶.I was TERRIFIED but y‚Äôall it turned out to just be GERD. Specialist said my colon was fine‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶then I stopped having the symptoms (well like the colon cancer symptoms) still had the chest pain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶was prescribed some medicine and I was back to just my regular everyday pain :)‚Ä¶..like my knee and migraines. I still get chest pain‚Ä¶.but no where as often‚Ä¶..and it usually goes away quicker. \n\nI was afraid of that one label on random items; that proposition 65 ‚Äúsignificant exposures to chemicals that cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm‚Äù if I saw that label I usually would return to product but then I bought a shredder that really like (I still use it) that had that label and I didn‚Äôt notice til I took it out the box‚Ä¶. I was hesitant to use it initially \n\n\nBut then I was like ‚Äúif I get cancer from a damn shredder, I was just meant to have it üòë‚Äù\n\ni‚Äôm having the same colon cancer fear\n\nI have one. It's a \"fun 50/50\" chance cuz of how many both my mother and father sides are but most of them are third degree. My dad had Naso and grandpa have Colon. Whenever I felt any tiny thing on my breast I just expect Cancer caught up to me. It doesn't help that my husband's mother and grandma have cancer too so we are hesitant to have kids.\n\nI‚Äôm currently trying to convince myself even if I do have skin cancer right now I‚Äôm seeing my dr in a week and she‚Äôll look at it then and we will go from there; not much else I can do.\n\nI mean yeah but then it turned out I DID have stomach cancer (curable). Everything makes me paranoid now.\n\n\nYes, I have had a debilitating time .\n\nI‚Äôm 26 years old male, former kickboxer competitive and recently have been having a wide array of issues and it‚Äôs freaking me out. They found a few lesions on my liver but I have not had any major issues with that, or even would‚Äôve noticed it had I not been on a car wreck.\n\nBut now I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm riddled with cancer and I‚Äôm scared to death. A few months ago I was healthy as can be, now I‚Äôm under so much anxiety and stress I just feel like I‚Äôm lost anymore\n\nman, I relate to this comment so hard. I really hope things get better for you. this is such a painful way to live, recently I feel like I spend more time worrying about cancer than enjoying my life.\n\nYou too! It seems finding people in common always help relax me just to know I‚Äôm not alone but most days it hits ya pretty good, like down to everything as far as seeing old\nPhotos and just looking in the mirror and feeling like half the human I was. I‚Äôm ready to start enjoying life again.  \n\nI think there‚Äôs something to it though because before I was miserable and didn‚Äôt realize I was happy with what I had, now I‚Äôve been feeling like a shell of my self and I realized that what I‚Äôve had is what makes\nMe happy and now I just need to get better to physically be there and enjoy the time.\n\nFor some reason I feel like I‚Äôve been so lost for so long I have to go though this patch to figure out I wasn‚Äôt that far\nOff the path I just wasn‚Äôt enjoying the walk.\n\nWhat kind of liver lesions did they find? Many many people have cysts in their livers, it's extremely common and not harmful in any way, could it have been simple cysts?\n\nUnknown yet\n\nHow you doing with everything?\n\ndoing alright, my anxiety definitely comes in waves or episodes, and when I made that comment I was definitely going through the worst of one of them lol. \n\nthe past week has been pretty peaceful, but my anxiety will spike up during the night and I'll pretty much have to sleep it off. I think it's starting to get better though. \n\nhow about you?\n\nNot terrible either got a shit ton of anxiety still but definitely getting better looking to work out once I get over this cold and that‚Äôs seems to improve mood\n\nnice! good to hear things are getting better for you too. I've been thinking of getting back into working out too but just haven't committed yet, still a little worried with my asthma and the poor air quality from the fires lately lol. gonna get a physical exam and then hopefully get back into it, for now just focusing on eating better and getting good sleep.\n\nHow you doing?\n\nI had cancer and I‚Äôm completely fine. The absolute #1 thing you need to stop doing is googling your symptoms. It‚Äôs doing absolutely nothing but feeding your anxiety. Stay strong!\n\nCancer doesn't bother me considering we're probably all going to get it due to our plastic and chemical usage.        Bone cancer though.. that shit is terrifying to think of.\n\nI've suffered with that since I was a kid. Mostly because I started smoking when I was 10 and was a 2 pack a day smoker by the time I was 13. I also chewed Copenhagen constantly and drank like a fish.\n\nI was convinced I would end up with either lung, esophageal, oral, stomach, liver, or bladder cancer at any time even after I managed to quit tobacco and alcohol completely by the time I was 44.\n\nNow I actually actually have cancer but not in any of the areas I always thought I would get it and according to my oncologist it is in no way related to any of my past vices.\n\nThe funny thing is now that I have cancer I'm not afraid of it anymore. I'll either get rid of it or I will die, the only thing that bothers me now is the fear of how much it might hurt if the cancer progresses to the point where it kills me.\n\nThe US is too stingy with pain meds because of a addiction worries which to my mind is stupid. If you're terminal any possible addiction from pain meds won't last for long...\n\nYes! This is a fairly new one for me as I recently found an abnormally shaped mole that I was convinced was skin cancer. In the lead up to the doctor appointment I was convinced it would be bad news and I started looking at treatments etc. Turns out the mole was fine, but my brain now keeps focusing on other types of cancer. My main fear is the treatments as I have a major phobia of throwing up and a low pain threshold.\n\nOh me for sure. But I literally just let the fear live inside a small part of my brain and mostly ignore it.  I want to enjoy my time here. (I also actually have tumors on my thyroid but rn they are small and my levels are normal so I just live.)\n\nFor me it's a fear of getting diagnosed w diabetes and the complications that go along w it :( I don't wanna lose fingers or go blind. It's scary because both sides of my family are prone to having it and I KNOW that at some point I will get it.\n\nYes. Most of the people I love and care about most have either got cancer, had it or have died from it. Every time I hear about someone with cancer I want to cry\n\nMy weakness is hearing news and stories about c*ncer \nit makes me anxious\n\nHa ha I have the same story, only in the front of my neck, just last year! Apparently your \"fat deposits\" aren't always symmetrical and sometimes they look like nodes. The doctor was kind enough to not make me feel like a hypochondriac, and he relayed a story about a male patient who just sorta started growing a breast on one side. Our brains like symmetry but the rest of our bodies could care less.\n\nGrowing up I was definitely more of a carcinophobe and would freak out over every bump, bruise, or tired feeling. I would devour every bit of media I could find where someone got cancer (even the terrible \"Love Story\" and its Christian reboot \"A Walk to Remember\"). Turns out leukemia is often treatable, but those stories don't sell as well.\n\nI did have a full-on cancer scare several years ago, a cyst started growing on my neck and wouldn't stop. It was benign but I was starting to resign myself to the possibility. The funny thing is, it didn't really scare me as much as stress me out, I think because Google told me that the cancer I probably had was curable. Also because my brother-in-law had just gotten actual cancer in the same exact spot and I kinda felt like my body was mocking him.\n\nglad i ain't alone lol. actually I've noticed my lump 2 weeks ago and it never grow. it only gets tender if i press it continuously but it gets smaller depends on my head movements lol. i just stressed out because it feels different than the other side lmao\n\nIs it small and round like a lymph node, where you can move the skin, or is it more like a swelling mass? I can't help but wonder if anxiety is putting knots in your muscles lol\n\nMom died of breast cancer and dad just completed colon cancer treatment so yeah...\n\nYes but only because I lost my stepmom and grandpa to cancer. Currently freaking the fuck out cause my dad found a lump in a strange spot and he‚Äôs going to get it checked out. He told me about it and although neither of us said it could be cancer, we both thought it\n\nYep, lost my dad to cancer just over a year ago, im petrified now\n\nGoogle isn‚Äôt your friend, I know I‚Äôve freaked myself out many times over searching symptoms.\n\nThis, but I'm worried about my loved ones having cancer.\n\nDidn‚Äôt know this was the name for it but I am struggling with this so bad right now. Back in November I had a thyroid ultrasound and nodule was found. I then had a biopsy that came back inconclusive and so I had a follow up biopsy done 6 months later and I tried my best not to think about it. Thankfully the second biopsy came back benign and that gave me relief but the thought that something can be growing inside you that can be deadly has truly traumatized me. I lost my grandmother and a family friend a week or two apart both from cancer back in 2018. Just seeing how cancer can affect someone has truly made me terrified and I just don‚Äôt know what to do about it. I certainly need therapy but I don‚Äôt think anything can truly get rid of my fear.\n\nMy dads entire side of the family has gotten cancer or died from it. Any little ache and pain I freak out.\n\nAnxiety runs in my family, and has history with a few different kinds of cancer. I've been guilty of researching my symptoms, and the internet makes you think you have the worst possible kinds of things going on with you. Now I make an appointment if I'm really concerned, and it's always negative for the worst of the worst that your mind tricks you into thinking you might have. Anxiety really likes to mess with me. Skin cancer runs in my family, and lost my mom to melanoma almost three years ago this September, but she chose to wait to get surgery to remove it and decided not to tell me until my wedding night, and I sometimes wonder if she would still be here if she had surgery and chemo right away, and for a long time blamed myself for her choices. So, that specific kind is on my mind a lot, and often think I'll eventually get it since so many have had some form of it. I used to get my skin checked every year, but after having painful procedures and a panic attack at a hospital last year for an unrelated surgery I've let anxiety win a lot. I get extremely anxious before and during medical appointments and procedures, so I often put things off, but I've made it my goal to finally get my skin checked again. I know of two other family members that push back or cancel appointments, and hearing about them doing that is something that's encouraged me to try to get an appointment over with. I do take an anxiety medication, but it only takes a tiny bit of the nervousness away, and am now seeing a therapist. Something that helps me a little is I've made what I call a little joy bowl with blind boxes I can open after I do something I was scared of doing, or if I'm having a bad day, and after I do something scary I sometimes go somewhere I enjoy going to distract myself from what just took place.\n\nCancer and cardiac arrest. üòí\n\nI had no idea this was a thing. I absolutely have this fear.\n\nI do sometimes, but that's also because I already had cancer. We found it through a routine women's health check, I had it removed, had preventative surgery, but no chemo. I was lucky. I have to monitored every six months for the next TWENTY YEARS in case of recurrance. As much as it sucks, I'm glad I just keep on top of my regular check ups every year because it saved my life from being far worse.\n\nYeh, google says im dead üòÅü§£\n\nDONT google symptoms - see a medical professional!\n\nOmg I‚Äôm crying irl. I been afraid of cancer for some years now. Didn‚Äôt even know it had a word. Kinda relieved.\n\nyep. \n\nmy paternal grandmother passed from after completing her first round of chemo, and around late 2021-early 2022 thought I had c****r for like four months before i got bloodwork done. my results never returned.\n\nYes, I went in for a follow-up mammogram on Friday and was just terrified. Luckily they said I look ok and just need to come back from regular follow-ups.\n\nME ME ME!\nI am currently convinced I have cancer lurking somewhere in my body.\nI constantly check myself for lumps.\n\nsame lmao\n\nI literally came here to see if others had the same problem and this was the first thing that came up. I'm so tired of it, I constantly feel like I'm at the brink of finding out I have some fucked up stage 4 cancer and it's really hurting my mental health.\n\nI relate to your asymmetrical neck. there's a muscle on the left side of my chest which is just bigger than the same one on my right. last year I was absolutely convinced it was a tumor, those days leading up to the doctors appointment were agonizing, just for her to tell me\"haha, I think you're just a bit crooked.\" it satiated my fears for a few months, but now here I am. I completely understand and relate to you, and I hope we can both find some peace.\n\nI‚Äôve had a lump on the back of my neck since I was like 10, and my doctors say it‚Äôs benign or maybe a swollen lymph node but I wouldn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be okay for a lymph node to be swollen for like 14 years??? Idk maybe I‚Äôm freaking out but I just got to thinking about it again üòï\n\nMy mom was BRCA gene positive, and my aunt and both grandmothers also had cancer. I'm nearing 40 which is when my mom was diagnosed, and it was too late resulting in her going through hell for years and then dying in front of me at 44. Now my best friend also breast cancer. I'm scared as fuck, it's something I feel anxious about every day. I had to see a therapist for months to even have my *wisdom teeth* removed a few years ago and it was one of the scariest thing I've ever done üò≠. I can't even fathom dealing with anything more serious, anything like what my mom went through or even what I see my friend currently going through even though it's minimal and she's going to be okay. On top of knowing I'm factually so likely to get it, *and* the gene causes a higher risk for melanoma, and being incredibly pale I've had probably 50+ terrible sunburns mostly prior to my teen years...\n\nNo idea how to cope with any of it üòû\n\nsometimes, my grandpa and mom were diagnosed with thyroid cancer early on, mom always checks my throat because sometimes it does get swollen snd start to pop out more and is very noticeable ,\n\nnot much of a fear but i do get worried since ive shown signs + my mom got it very young im more aware of my throat \n\n(havent got tested yet but im going to soon)\n\nI have obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorder that centers around my health. My psychiatrist has been telling me for years that I‚Äôm her most anxious patient LOL love that for me. Anyway, I think about cancer 24/7 and all the different variations of cancer that I have. Currently I have a spot on my leg I‚Äôm convinced is melanoma. I also think I have a cancerous brain tumor. Along with cancer, I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm going to have an aneurysm or a stroke at any given time and wake up with the inability to talk or move (locked in syndrome). Anyway, not trying to put more anxiety inducing thoughts into anyone‚Äôs minds. I just wanted to say that there are in fact other people suffering from this. You‚Äôre not alone. Hugs ü©∑\n\nI didn't know there is a word for this, so thanks for teaching me. \n\nThroat pain for three days?\n\nHas to be cancer. \n\nAn American Bully throwing itself on my body and rolling around on it (all in good humor, he's part of the extend family and very friendly) causes a feeling of pressure in my chest?\n\nYeah, that's probably cancer. \n\nBeing tired, literally always (while refusing to tackle untreated apnoe)? \n\nGuess what!\n\nIt's better ever since I'm on Escitalopram but it doesn't seem to fully go away. Probably for the better, considering there's quite a bit of cancer history in my genetic family.\n\nI hear myself in so many of these stories. If my dog sniffs me too much I think she smells cancer.\n\nI was terrified of cancer. Worried about it constantly. Then, I actually had cancer. While it was certainly no cakewalk, It wasn‚Äôt worth all the years of worrying. What‚Äôs going to happen is going to happen. Try to stop worrying and enjoy your life.\n\nI have this. I‚Äôve always feared cancer but it became really bad when my Dad died ten days after being diagnosed with a rare cancer and when I became a Mom. Lexapro keeps me in check and allows me not to suffer panic and to control actions such as googling and excessive body checking. But it‚Äôs still hard as you can escape cancer stories, commercials, posts on social media, etc. When it gets bad I listen to Ken Goodman‚Äôs anxiety program.\n\nMy ex/bf, poor dude‚Ä¶interesting there‚Äôs a term for this particular health anxiety ü§î\n\nI‚Äôm pretty sure that according to webMD, we are all officially dead. Stop googling.\n\nYou likely have asymmetric \"spinus processes\" like I do.\n\nBasically the little.. flanges? the spurs/growths that come off of your vertebrae are - in many or even most people - not 100% symettrical.\n\nIf you have no neck/back problems, it's EXTREMELY likely that it's just these little bastards. Mine are really out of whack, but it's just the little thingies not your spine!\n\nYou can always go see a doctor!\n\nOverall btw, the best way to not worry about cancer is to do the things that are so ridiculously potent that medications are just barely trying to reproduce them for the general population\n\n1) A moderate but very diverse diet! - Not too much, not too little, and get all sorts of different things in there! Ideally eat frickin bits of all sorts of stuff, but it's fine to include a multi-vite (I have about... 1/6 of one per day, maybe less, they come with truckloads), perhaps an omega 3-6-9 supplement (especially if you don't eat fish, flax, hemp, etc), and **exercise**.\n\nSeriously... even the smallest bit of exercise per day is incomparably more healthy than none, and if you just took a million people who did \"modest exercise most days of the week, and a diverse diet in moderate caloric intake\" and a million who did \"no exercise and a limited diet of far too many/few calories\" it would be like you showed smokers and non smokers.\n\nSo heres the key : you do the things that are within your power, and then you gift yourself the liberty to live your life knowing that since you already did the reasonable things, then spending any time stressing about the rest is purely bad - neither helping you by motivating you to choose better actions, nor helping you feel good - so you just tell it to frickin frick off!\n\nTotally. Less now than before. In spring 2022 I went through a bout of that when I had stomach issues. I had a recent bout of anxiety at the end of April this year. For some reason, spring is a strange/difficult period of anxiety.\n\nAnyway, the point of being afraid of having the C word is that you think you will die, so really, the fear is of dying. I dread the idea of death. I'm getting better at thinking about it, though. I just say to myself - \"well, I didn't know life in the billions of years when I didn't exist - when I'm gone it will be the same thing.\" There's nothing for fear. Also, it's motivation to do everything you can today and leave nothing for tomorrow that you care about, since it's never guaranteed.\n\nI feel you, I'm crying everyday because of the thoughts of having it. I'm having blood in the stool and in the tissue for a month now. I've seen GI but then he seems not bothered as my blood work and stool test came back clear. I still have the blood in my bottom whenever I go to the toilet, this makes my anxiety even more worse as I don't know why there's blood. All I can do for now is to try my best to do everything, maybe get a second opinion as soon as possible. I hope you'll get the answer soon for your condition and try our best not to worry.\n\nme ever since i tested positive for ana i‚Äôve been obsessing over cancer. for a few months ive had joint pain, hearing and vision problems, headaches, nausea, nerve pain, basically every symptom imaginable. everyone says it‚Äôs anxiety but im not convinced so now im seeing every possible specialist.\n\nHow are you doing now?\n\nI found a benign tumor in my breast last year. Turned out to be a fibroadenoma but I am petrified of what could happen when I am older after I have kids. Breast cancer scares me, same with bone cancer and colon cancer but to actually have had a possible brush with breast cancer at the age of 27 was so fucking scary. And I didn‚Äôt get the fibroadenoma removed because it‚Äôs benign and too expensive to remove.\n\nI thought I was the only one suffering from this\n\nYes, I'm always worried about lumps and bumps and any random symptoms. They say 1 in 2 people get cancer so i don't think its that much of an irrational fear. \n\nI was rushed into hospital when i was a teenager because my groin glands swelled up. They tested for cancer. It wasn't, thank goodness. But they never worked out what it was. That was the start of my health anxiety.\n\nYeah that‚Äôs always been a main driver for me\n\ni had no idea this had a name oh my god. i might not have cancer but a sure as hell have carcinophobia\n\n*waves* \nIt doesn't help that there is a family history\n\nI get panic attacks from every single thing thinking cancer ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nControl the things that you can, dont smoke, dont drink alcohol in excess, eat a balanced diet, stay active, dont be overweight. The rest is out of your control.\n\nAbsolutely. It feels inevitable and it makes me fixate on the ‚Äúwhen‚Äù instead of seeing it like an ‚Äúif‚Äù.\n\nYESS omg I didn‚Äôt know this had a name! \n\nDad passed away from lymphoma that spread to his spleen and hip bone a few years back. This pretty much scarred me for life. When he was still alive I‚Äôd call him up and ask him if certain symptoms that I had were cancer.\n\nMy biggest fears are lymphoma, brain tumors and leukemia. But tbh this has spread to pretty much every existing cancer. Kidney cancer, stomach cancer, cancer in my liver, pancreas,..\n\nIt‚Äôs so so so annoying. Especially the abdominal cancers that I‚Äôm hyperfocused on right now because it‚Äôs really easy to get a stomach pain and immediately overanalyze that pain. I wish a normal stomach ache could just be that for me; a normal stomach ache that‚Äôll pass after one day. But no, I hyperfocus and boom that pain stays for weeks (psychosomatic lol).\n\nI don‚Äôt allow myself to touch my breast, my lymph nodes, my stomach, my back. Scared to feel a lump. But going to the doctors? I‚Äôm too scared for that too, because what if I get bad news? Ignorance is bliss i think lol. But that keeps me in that repetitive cycle.\n\nNot cancer specifically, but that‚Äôs been a fear I have had. Along with that‚Ä¶ Multiple Sclerosis and Meniere‚Äôs Disease have been the 2 that I am just absolutely petrified of.\n\nNot only that ‚Äî I actually have had anxiety that either of those 2 diseases exist in the world at all. Awful, awful things happen to people‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fortunate enough not to have any absolutely disabling disease and then I feel guilty and anxious about that. It‚Äôs tough, ngl.\n\nI‚Äôm kind of a hypochondriac in general (meaning I worry plenty about other possible health conditions, too, not just cancer) but lately cancer has been my specific area of hyperfocus. \n\nAnytime I have a headache that won‚Äôt go away (even though I can usually easily trace it back to simple causes like poor sleep schedule or caffeine withdrawals), I wonder if maybe it‚Äôs a brain tumor. \n\nIf I notice bruises and can‚Äôt remember where they came from, my mind immediately goes to leukemia. \n\nA few months ago, I had digestive issues, including stomach pain and steatorrhea, and I was absolutely CONVINCED that I either had pancreatic cancer or a serious liver disease, and couldn‚Äôt get the thought out of my head until I went and got lab tests (urine/blood/stool) and an ultrasound. I spent like $500 on a problem that turned out to be primarily related to diet and stress. When the tests found nothing wrong, I finally just focused on getting more rest and cutting back on the fast food, and my problem resolved itself within a week. \n\nCurrently my concern is with skin cancer. I‚Äôve been obsessively checking my body and freaking out whenever I notice a new blemish (which is pretty time consuming, since I have some pretty bad acne issues and a lot of moles).\n\nWith all that said, I‚Äôd like to share some information that helps my cancer anxiety, in case they might also help someone else:\n\nFirst of all, do you know why cancer seems so common nowadays? It‚Äôs not what you might think. The reason so many people get cancer at some point in their lifetime is because it‚Äôs primarily older people that get it, and nowadays most people live long enough to get old. As the average life expectancy increases, it becomes more likely that you will live long enough to get develop cancer at some point. Counterintuitive as it may seem, the number of people that get cancer is actually evidence of the world improving. People have access to antibiotics and vaccinations, people understand the importance of washing their hands before they eat, and people know better than to drink water contaminated with sewage. There‚Äôs less chance of dying prematurely from acute illness or infection. More people than ever before in history have access to nutritional food and enough of it, so they aren‚Äôt dying as often of starvation and malnutrition. This means that more people are living long enough to die of chronic conditions that usually show up later in life, like cancer and heart disease.\n\nSecondly, a lot of people seem to think cancer is an automatic death sentence. That isn‚Äôt true at all. More often than not, people who get cancer don‚Äôt actually die from it. Most types of cancer are curable, or at least very treatable. More often than not, people who get cancer go through treatment, recover, and go on to live the rest of their lives. And the percentage of people who survive cancer is steadily going up. It was something like 49% back in the 1970s, now it‚Äôs around 68%. And that‚Äôs just on average‚Äîdepending on the type of cancer your chances of survival are much higher than that, like breast cancer which has a 91.2% survival rate, testicular cancer which has a 96%-99% survival rate, or basal skin cancer which basically has a 100% survival rate. When I‚Äôm old enough to actually realistically start worrying about cancer (I‚Äôm currently 26), I expect that survival rate to be even higher.\n\nAnd finally‚Äîduring my spiral last night as I lay in bed crying and frantically googling cancer symptoms and statistics, I came upon a graph showing the most common causes of death. When I looked at the statistics for my age group, it gave me pause. The leading causes of death for people in their late twenties are: accidents, homicide, and suicide. And when I saw that last one, I realized that my anxiety itself was statistically more likely to kill me than the disease it was fixated on. There I was worried about getting sick, not even realizing that I already was. I have an illness that, as of right now, is statistically more likely to kill me than cancer is. And even if it doesn‚Äôt kill me, it‚Äôs already ruining my quality of life. I swing hard between wishing I was dead, and freaking out over all the things that could kill me, and if that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm going to live then cancer might as well put an end to it. That was something of a wakeup call, and I decided that I‚Äôm going to get help. I‚Äôm going to face my fear of doctors (which in the past I‚Äôve usually avoided because I‚Äôm scared they‚Äôll diagnose me with something terminal) and I‚Äôm going to start getting regular health checkups. If that still isn‚Äôt enough to soothe my anxiety, then it‚Äôll be time to find a therapist I guess. I‚Äôm going to focus on controlling what I can, and try not to worry about what I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm going to do my best to trust the professionals and get on with my life.\n\nI've had chronic GERD for about six or seven months now and at least three times a day I go into a full blown panic that my endoscopy is going to show I've got incurable or aggressive esophageal cancer. The reality is it takes years of acid reflux and I would have a LOT of other symptoms probably but still, I am freaking out.\n\nWhile I have a constant fear of any cardiovascular disease, cancer leaves me strangely unfazed, even though is about as likely to kill me and I know more people personally who have died of cancer.\n\nNot oncophobia?\n\nI'm convinced that I'm going to get cancer, but for some reason I'm not worried about it. Like I have too many people in my family that have gotten cancer for me to think that I won't get it.\n\nyes i‚Äôm terrified that i‚Äôm at an advanced stage and that i‚Äôll d*e suddenly. i‚Äôm scared of getting bloodwork done for an elective procedure\n\nRaises  paw.\n\nAfter being told three years ago I had an autoimmune disease, which I've been receiving treatment for, one of my new doctors just raised the possibility of my having a type of cancer.  They want to do a biopsy of my lymph node-- an invasive procedure.  I am terrified of the procedure and what they'll find out.  I've hardly slept the past few days and am having a lot pf heart palpitations.\n\nWishing you all the best!\n\nI had a breast and lymph node biopsy and while it‚Äôs not fun, just breathe and try to center your focus. If you have a super sweet doc and tech like I did, cuss as much as you want or need. Wishing you all the best!\n\nThank you so much for your advice and well wishes.  I'm going to ask my doctor to prescribe Valium for me.  It helped a lot when I had to spend almost 2 hours in an MRI tunnel.  \n\nI wish you all the best, too. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYes! Nothing wrong with asking for help. My onco immediately put me on Xanax. Till this day every evening I need to take my melatonin, Xanies, and edibles to ease my mind. Thanks! üíú\n\nHere‚Äôs a fun fact that might ease your anxiety a bit, most cancers are so bad at being cancer that you would die before they‚Äôd have any noticeable effect. If you want a link as to where I found that, I‚Äôd be happy to send it.\n\nAlso, I‚Äôm in no way trying to invalidate your fears as this is a pretty normal one to have as it is a real danger to some people. Keep pushing through and looking after yourself and you‚Äôll be fine. Sending love!\n\nWhenever I have a physical symptom I (half and only half jokingly) my cancer is acting up\n\nI have this pretty much constant ache in my upper left abdomen.  My anxiety keeps telling me it's pancreatic cancer.. my doctor has done multiple tests that point to gastritis.. especially since I keep stressing myself out so much.\n\nI have a personal rule: I try to not allow myself to worry about medical things until I can get whatever it is checked out and know for sure. Easier said than done, though, so if I can't help but worry, I try to redirect that energy into setting up an appointment to get checked sooner.\n\nAnd for anxiety about getting tested, it helps me to think \"Whatever is true (of me currently, medically) is already true. Not knowing won't make a problem go away, but if there is one, best to find and treat it ASAP, and wondering if there is a problem when there is not one can create huge anxiety over literally nothing, so whether there is a problem or not, it's better to know for sure\".\n\nEven if you end up going in a lot of times where it turns out to be nothing, don't beat yourself up! That can still help you to see it can be less likely than you think for there to be a problem, and help reduce that kind of anxiety over time :)\n\nI hope this can be helpful. &lt;3\n\nI had cancer and I'm afraid it will come back as distant mets and kill me, so I understand. What really, truly helps me? Easier said than done, but I try not to worry about what I cannot control and focus on what I can control.\n\nI can control going to all medical appointments, taking my medication, eating lots of vegetables, not smoking, getting good sleep, exercising.\n\nMy whole life. Even when I was in 6th grade I had a twitch in my thumb. Cancer.\n\nA bit off topic, but are you having chiropractic work done for the neck?\n\nYup! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è All of my life until I was actually diagnosed with breast cancer before 40 in 2022. Going through it made me face my fears dead on.\n\nAs a current survivor, I can say just live your life day by day. I know it sounds cliche but try to enjoy the good moments in life. I know shitty things happen to all of us, but life is truly a gift. Reframing what‚Äôs happening in the ‚Äúnow‚Äù is what is helping go on each passing day. \n\nHope this was helpful!\n\nMe ü•≤ health anxiety sucks ass. The thing that‚Äôs helped me is that every time I go to the doctor and the tests come back negative, I remind myself ‚Äúwe‚Äôve been through all of those health scares. We can get through this one too.‚Äù\n\nNo but I certainly do have epileptophobia. Anything I get that I can't explain is some kind of seizure in my eyes. Thankfully celexa has gradually started to kick in and this stupid voice is a bit quite now.\n\nI guess I am! I have had so much testing done cause I have a lot of cancer in my family and so far I‚Äôve been lucky but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever be convinced otherwise.\n\nOh, always. It started when I was 9 after losing 2 grandparents and a classmate to cancer. Every headache, every bump, every sensation, was cancer. My poor mother taking me to all those physically pointless pediatric appointments just so I could hear it from the doctor that I was okay.\nI still worry on occasion‚Ä¶ I just remember that anxiety is making you go through something that doesn‚Äôt exist.\n\nExactly me. But also anxious to visit the doctor to find out what I might have. Maybe I should really go see a doctor‚Ä¶\n\nI don‚Äôt know a single person in this world who is not afraid of cancer. If there is one logical fear, it‚Äôs cancer.\n\nME. All of my grandparents + some aunts and uncles died of some form of cancer throughout my life. I am petrified that every ache, pain and bump is cancer. I‚Äôm 23 years old and my life is literally consumed by the fear. Morning and night. \nSertraline helped a bit but it doesn‚Äôt completely take away the thoughts and I still experience them daily although I no longer have panic attacks. \nI‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one, but I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this too\n\nBtw my dad has a huge lipoma at the back of his neck. It‚Äôs a big lump but completely benign so don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs way more likely for it not to be cancer\n\nIt‚Äôs an existential threat, but fearing death and mental illness are greater signs of sanity than insanity.\n\nFind your balance, and do your best!!\nYou got this. \n\nü´µüò§üëå‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI am, I hate cancer.\n\nYES.  The back of my neck is also asymmetrical btw.\n\nThis may not make you feel better. I have a history of cancer in my family. Including very recently with my mother. The likelihood for me is high. \n\nThink it‚Äôs just I have so much anxiety around life in general that I‚Äôm not consumed by this fact. \n\nI find for anxiety that self talks and meditation helps. Also, don‚Äôt google the answer.\n\n[*raises hand*] Both bio-parents died of multiple types of cancer.....so yeah.....\n\nMy biggest fear for me and everyone I love on a daily basis\n\nCurrently in bed. I can't sleep cause one of my groin lymph nodes is swollen. I have inflammatory issues which would make a lot of sense but I can't shake of the thought of it being worse and I'm just down playing it\n\nLol yes. \n\nA constant one that I was/ always have been worried about is colon cancer. TikTok doesn‚Äôt help with all the videos of the 25-30 year olds with stage 4 advanced colon cancer all because Drs kept dismissing them. \n\nEsophageal cancer is another one. I‚Äôve always hated having sore throats and strep throat so anything to do with the throat freaks me out. I‚Äôll psych myself out into thinking I can‚Äôt swallow sometimes. \n\nANY kind of cancer that causes swollen lymph nodes. I‚Äôm constantly feeling my neck and will convince myself I have a swollen node even if just don‚Äôt. \n\nRight now my flavor of choice is inflammatory breast cancer. Yes, the rarest kind of breast cancer. I wore a sports bra that was too tight while working out and fell asleep in it, and got sweat / heat rash. I feel fine now, but sometimes my brain will play tricks on me and tell me it‚Äôs inflammatory breast cancer on both breasts even though there is like a 3% chance of having it on one breast , let alone both. \n\nIt‚Äôs not fun but we gotta just keep pushing through. Just remember- sleep on it. You won‚Äôt be scared tomorrow. This is just a today fear.\n\nI'm freaking out and cried last night about a bump/pimple thing on my face I've had for a couple weeks because what if it's skin cancer?\n\nOmg I thought it was just me! But so much of what‚Äôs listed here\n\nyes, i'm finding myself obsessing over this at least once a week now (i flip-flop between cancer, heart attack / disease, stroke, rabies, etc). it's so hard not to obsess over it, but i can't help it.\n\nTumors in my lungs bc my chronic back pain and felt weird breathing.\nThis is ongoing and am working through it\n\n[deleted]\n\nto me yes\n\nYeah I do. I made a Reddit post on how I vape and am trying to quit and eat not good and people clearly saying I‚Äôm the one to blame which I agree but it should be more so how I get over vaping and the overall health fear\n\nSo a sub category of hypochondria? Because that‚Äôs what I have always called it\n\nIt's kind of a weird thing to call a phobia. A phobia means it's an irrational fear. I think being afraid of cancer is pretty rational.\n\nPeople with anxiety should stay off of Google for medical symptoms. Pot calling the kettle black. LOL\n\nI also had cancer and was just wondering how others move on with life after it is removed.\n\nI know this all to well, it's gotten to the point where it's actually affecting my health, headaches, lightheadedness, anxiety stings, are all things I've been having over the past few months, while i'm also experiencing IBS and this has convinced me multiple times that I've had the dissease in my intestines\n\nIt's the cancer \"treatment\" I'm scared of and not the disease itself. It feels like such a scam that they basically poison you to supposedly cure tyour disease. Yes it may get cured but at what cost? There is no dignity for a patient. My grandfather recently passed away due to cancer and he could have been better of without chemo in his last three months. They tried a new medication when his chemo stopped working and that deteriorated his condition so much that it would have been better if they had not tried it at all. What's the point of early detection if the patient has to go through shit just because a scan found a particular abnormality which isn't even distressing right now? I don't trust medical systems. Yes it might be irrational but it is what I feel. I might even be having wrong opinions scientifically but it is what i feel.\n\nI'm really struggling with this now. I can't stop  looking up surgerys and feeding tubes. And radiation and chemo. It's hell. I don't want treatments. I've read so many people's experiences that I just want to opt out\n\nI have hypochondria, especially fear of cancer since i was 14, im now 21F\nI remember the first time i thought about it was when i watched the falling of our stars(?) the kids who had cancer. Also my grandpa had leukemia and i used to watch him deteriorate over the years as a child, probably this is on my subconscious \nMy first severe health related panic attack was when i was about 10-11, in my village sleeping with my mom, and suddenly i couldnt breath. We went upstairs (int he same house fifferent room) and i slept just fine(???)\nThen 15 my second severe worse traumatic panic attack. I was chilling while feeling my lymph nodes as usual back then, and i felt a lump‚Ä¶. Oh god the chills i got i can never forget. I thought immediately cancer thats it, im done. And i went to my mom crying and being completely paranoid, saying thats it ill die. She and me went to a pharmacy, then to a doctor next couple of days and it was mono (lmao)\nThen back in 2022 i had a cough that wouldnt go and i had ‚Äúacoustics‚Äù on my lungs, idk how its called (i was a smoker) and it was bronchitis, took meds never had an issue again \nAlso. One of my good friends cousin passed away when she was 15 from bone cancer‚Ä¶..on 2020, so that was a pretty traumatic shit for me too\nAnyway‚Ä¶ my point is.. ive been throughs hit. Ive tried to end it a couple times, been through different psychologists and psychiatrists since 14yrold\nBut im still finding myself battling with this shit. Like the past week i have an ingrown huge pimple infected, obv hormonal and Ii though ‚Äúsiin cancer‚Äù, googled it and panicked. Then i popped in the shower while i was washing itüòÇ so basically.. its all in our heads at the end of the day. Everythings gonna be okay, have a loved one around, keep talking to them.. love is the only answer \nIm here if anyone wants to talk:)\n\nI had string of bad paps and im gonna sign off though that carrys risk as im living in misery. I barely gained any weight as I think the food will kill me and I'm not active. Im skin and bones over this fear. I know not advised bur id rather not know.¬† I am trying to gain muscle but the stress makes that tough. I got the bad news when I personally had extra body fat so I maintain a leaner shape but life is still hell. Today I noticed something wrong with chest and now wonder have the cells spread. I've a bmi just above 15 but it's gonna be the case word that kills me off...\n\n Boar Hab auch so scheiss Angst davor.. dann wurde in meiner Brust ein fibroadenom gefunden und die √Ñrzte haben ne Biopsie gemacht. Alles gutartig und dann las ich in SELTENEN F√ÑLLEN kann es umschlagen und entarten. Seitdem nur Panik. Mein Hals zieht. Denke da w√§chst was. Meine Rippen, Nacken ziehen, denke da w√§chst was. Ich huste, denke es sind Metastasen aus der Brust oder sonst was. Ich hab so Panik.. ich denke immer ich sterbe bald und keiner sieht was. \nLymphknoten auch.. hab einen sehr tastbaren bzw mehrere in der Leiste.. wiege aber auch maximal 55 kg bei 172 und bin sehr d√ºnn..\n\nThe thing that scares me the most it will eventually happen to most of us. I get my blood checked or ultra sound check and it turns out i m fine. But i know that one day doctor will tell me \"sir you have cancer\". This is inevitable.  I am only 24 but I am 99% sure it will happen yo me sooner or later.  Nothing scares me like cancer.\n\nI‚Äôve convinced myself I‚Äôve had almost every cancer at some point. Currently throat cancer. Ive had many different therapies and treatments from hypnosis, counselling to spiritual healing. Ive found that there are coping mechanisms but in the moment they are difficult to apply, its fight or flight, life or death. I‚Äôm currently on sertraline and although some may say it‚Äôs covering the cracks, it‚Äôs been unbelievably helpful and certainly taken the edge off, stops me going down a rabbit hole! 18 months ago I literally had a breakdown I was a crumbling mess, all because I was referred for a scan and believed my life was going to be cut short, it was probably the most traumatic time of my life. I wish anyone well who‚Äôs battling this it‚Äôs horrendous and can be soooo consuming, at times I‚Äôm literally a zombie, I‚Äôm not present."

    "body": "The past 7 weeks I have been taking vitamin D supplements because I‚Äôm pregnant, the major side effect of that is anxiety is GONE. For as long as I remember no matter how well my life was going, I woke up every morning feeling dread or a pit in my stomach. I exercised , went to therapy did everything but test my bloods for deficiencies apparently. Then recently I realized despite having a rocky start to my pregnancy ( I got a bad tooth infection and had to have the tooth pulled and was in agony for weeks) I felt ‚Äònormal‚Äô. Like I would feel bad but nothing lingered . The dreadful pit in my stomach was gone. I‚Äôm reacting what I consider is normal to both good and bad news. I never ever thought I would get to feel like this and the best part is I had completely no idea this would happen. It happened and then I had to check and see what it is that had changed in my life to cause such a drastic shift and vitamin D was the only thing I could point to. Additionally I‚Äòm black and grew up in cold and rainy Ireland then moved to Spain 2 years ago and already I had such a difference in my anxiety since I moved here , it wasn‚Äôt as bad as when I lived in Ireland and Germany but I still had it. Melanin blocks the sun so dark skin people need a lot more sun to get healthy vitamin D anyway so I saw an improvement from getting some sun vs none but I needed the supplements I guess to drive it home.\n\nI‚Äôm so happy and grateful. If you are reading this, have dark skin or at risk of low vitamin D please go get checked. I can‚Äôt believe I suffered for so long.",

    "all_comment_text": "I'm wondering if being pregnant is the reason your anxiety went away.\n\nMore than likely the biggest contribution to the lessening anxiety\n\nDo you know why? Look for the cure for anxiety.\n\nThe last comment on this post is the best explanation of why. It‚Äôs the change in hormones. It‚Äôs funny I‚Äôve seen people even on birth control say that it made them worse and or made them feel better too. Being on birth control helps my mental health a lot when I am on it! I notice a big difference. Huge connection between the two.\n\nYep. Hormones. Being on birth control made me worse (but I was on a progesterone only pill). I learned that taking certain vitamins around pms (like calcium) also significantly reduced my anxiety.\n\nThere is no cure\n\nAfter thinking about it, you can't eliminate anxiety because it's part of our biology. I guess it would have been better to say:\"A solution to reduce it to a normal level where you're functional.\"\n\nYep.\n\nonly management ..thank.you\n.and its a daily issue\n\n\"Get pregnant - anxiety hates this one simple trick!\"\n\nbut the second you give birth to that baby there‚Äôs a chance it‚Äôs going to get WAY worse than it was before, so. have fun with that.\n\nI wish someone would have prepared me for that.\n\nI was thinking the same thing- the hormone changes make a HUGE difference to my anxiety!\n\nI agree. The ‚Äòbest‚Äô my anxiety has ever been oddly enough was when I was pregnant. Had the odd worry here or there but it wasn‚Äôt all consuming like it was. Postpartum anxiety hit me HARD. Try to develop some solid coping skills now, have support in place, and get some set-care time (I know I know, so much easier said than done especially with a new baby) for when your baby comes. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask/seek help. You got this! üí™üèª\n\nI felt great when pregnant\n\nMy anxiety pretty much completely diminished because of pregnancy. I had already been taking supplements, but I have read that some women don't experience anxiety while pregnant. So in addition to the vitamin d, pregnancy might also be good for you! ENJOY YOUR MENTAL FREEDOM &lt;3\n\nThis. I had ZERO anxiety during pregnancy. Came back hard (along with PPD) postpartum though, so be aware of how you‚Äôre feeling after you give birth, OP\n\nI probably will already have a plan in place. The joke in my house is, \"What if I have anxiety.\" To which my husband responds, \"You already have anxiety!\" I get in my head that I can't handle it, but I've been managing it all my life and I do just fine (even in the really bad seasons).\n\nI'm so hoping this will be the case for me!! Because my anxiety has been going crazy at the idea of getting pregnant and so it would make perfect sense for me to then be cured when I actually do get pregnant lol.\n\nI think one of the things that I noticed happened to me is I became less concerned with myself and more concerned with the baby. Also, it's like my purpose suddenly changed. Before I got pregnant, I was sooo worried about what if I miss my old life, or what if I can't travel, or what if I have to pause my career - all that stuff doesn't matter to me anymore. It's like I just care less about everything else in general and have less time for bullsh\\*t. I don't know if that's how people who don't struggle with anxiety normally feel, but it is a very nice change of pace lol\n\nThis all makes sense and I've heard similar things from parent friends of mine. I'm also betting this is how it will go for me. It's just so strange you spend a long time so worried about things like career etc. and then it just doesn't matter anymore. Idk how I feel about that yet. But like you say it probably won't matter. \n\nBut anyway thank you so much! This is really helpful to hear.\n\nOf course :)\n\nThere's a lot of weird shit that goes on with pregnancy hormone changes hell the baby's stem cells could have actually went into your brain and fixed something that was wrong there's no telling.\n\nI‚Äôve read baby cells can heal parts of your body!\n\nSame. I hated being pregnant but the anxiety being gone was a nice vacation for my brain.\n\nBeing pregnant complicates your assessment about the value of Vitamin D supplementation and anxiety relief. During this time Progesterone, Estrogen, Oxytocin, and Cortisol will see significant increases and these hormones can have effects on GABA receptors and Serotonin levels in the brain. This means the anxiety relief you are experiencing could be temporary and anxiety might return after your pregnancy.\n\nIts def the pregnancy, pregnancy changes your entire brain chemistry. Rewires it. Sometimes thats for the worse, sometimes better. Hope the well being sticks around mama\n\nI had anxiety my whole life and it completely went away when I was pregnant, however, it all came rushing back 10x worse once I had my baby. The postpartum hormone change has been brutal. My anxiety got so bad to the point I was throwing up every morning and thought there was something physically wrong with me. I found out that I have a vitamin d deficiency and so I have been taking vitamin d along with buspar to help rid the physical side effects of anxiety. My sleep is still pretty messed up, but so far, with the buspar, I don‚Äôt throw up in the mornings anymore. I just want to say that pregnancy hormones can be wonderful, but do watch out for postpartum hormones and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help!! Postpartum Anxiety and Depression are very real and they aren‚Äôt talked about enough. I honestly thought my PP experience was going to be fine because my anxiety was never crippling before I got pregnant and while I was pregnant, emotionally I felt GREAT, but it really did come crashing down after I had my baby. I am currently 3 months PP and just recently am feeling a bit better from taking Vitamin D and Buspar.\n\nThank you for sharing, I‚Äôm going to try this! Wishing you a happy, healthy pregnancy ü´∂üèº\n\nBest of luck and thank you üòä\n\nI‚Äôm pregnant too! When are you due?\n\nI need to take my pre natals but they‚Äôve got iron and upset my stomach. I‚Äôm a melanoma survivor so my vit D is chronically low and I have endometriosis so my iron is also chronically low. I feel pretty yucky! Hoping the doctor gives me an infusion.\n\nCongratulations, I‚Äôve worked with hundreds of people who have come out the other side of suffering their anxiety and it truly is like seeing the world through whole set of new glasses!\n\nYou‚Äôre likely on something and, you have a massive shift in hormone production and balance happening in your body and in particular in your brain (these are also neurotransmitters of sorts). So no doubt thisis also playing part.\n\nHowever, don‚Äôt presume that if I‚Äôm correct things will change once you‚Äôre no longer pregnant. They don‚Äôt need to. \n\nYou know what it‚Äôs like And how wonderful it feels not to suffer the symptoms of anxiety. This is actually a learning experience that carves new  neuropathways in your brain.\n\nReally focus on understanding your new perspective and how it feels. This will help embed these new pathways.\n\nThinking, like life, is a perpetual learning experience.\n\nThis!! I was tested and low in Vitamin D.  After taking supplements my mood lifted and anxiousness lessened.\n\nAround 2 months ago i start to feel anxious for no reason and restless too.¬†\n\n\nIt later ended up exhibiting physical symptoms.¬†\n\n\n1. Stiff muscles on left side of body\n2. Muscle spasms¬†\n3. Involuntary movements in lower left muscle.¬†\n4. Shortness of breath.¬†\n5. Dizziness¬†\n6. Spasms in face .\n\n\nI got concerned and went to the ER 4 days ago.¬†\n\n\nRespiratory check was done, ecg was checked, a¬† ct scan of the brain was done an etg on all jerking muscles was done too during a period of 3 days. Neurologist said my etg was good nothing unusual detected. He said that the movements i was making wasnt neurological but i made it myself its entirely voluntary. No sign of stroke no nerve damage.¬† Blood work was all good. Vitamin deficiencies was all good too.\n\n\nHe gave me 1x1 mg pill of Ativan . Everything immediately stopped. I felt at ease, breathing was normal, stiffness disappeared too.¬†\n\n\nHe said it could be linked to anxiety. He asked me if i had stress i told him that i dont have stress that im aware of.\n\n\nCan anxiety do this ? Can it just be actived while even being at ease.¬†\n\n\nHe said i should go speak to mental health Doctor next week.¬†\n\n\nWhat can i expect?\n\n\nWhat type of medicine will help with this problem? . And how long will i maybe be on this medicine. The benzo he gave me was just to check how I reacted to it. And it really worked.¬† I remember after taking it all was ok.¬†\n\n\nAbout myself.¬† I am a none drinker, fair healthy di√´t, exercise 3 times per week. My hobbies are normally reading books, playing video games. I do smoke cigarettes but maybe just 2 per day . I work a stress free job. Just a normal administration work from home job for my Uncle Company.¬†\n\n\nSome guidance will help guys please.¬†\n\nAnxiety can do this and more. Your mind starts to spiral as you go into fight or flight, leading to more symptoms as you fixate on somatic sensations (in your body). You need to systematically check the following things: candida (take a short term dose of diflucan for example-harder for women given their vag balances but I'm realizing my 2 years of sleep issues and anxiety may be related to that) and vit D).\n\nHow much caffeine do you drink? Tea? Pop?\n\nI dont drink coffee only tea . 2 cups per day. I drink 2 liter of sprite weekly.¬†\n\nLook at the ingredients see if caffeine is listed.\n\nI ended up in ER and never thought a second it is anxiety. What anxiety: I am competent in my job, my family life is good, I run miles every week. Pretty health lifestyle as it seem. Yet, the CBT session revealed that I was a perfectionist, I tried too hard for things and not giving myself grace. Shocking, I realized I was very testy for a few years. and little signs had popped up but I ignored them (not knowing it is stress)\n\nNo magic pills for me, I just take one day at a time during the most difficult time. start building more and more healthy routines to battle anxiety. anxiety still came back but it has become more manageable and less intense. One big mistake I made was I stopped doing meditation, exercises, mindfulness routines thinking I was cured. It will come back with vengeance. so keep doing those things that worked, don't stopped. They are not anxiety sacrifices but things making you a better you.\n\nHave you had Covid recently?\n\nThis is a good question...in the flip side, I think a lot of us get it, don't know it and have all kinds of weird symptoms.\n\nNo covid. I am vaccinated but never had covid.¬†\n\nDid you ever get your vit d levels tested though?\n\nYou did it! And congratulations with your pregnancyüòä\n\nI always say I'm going to start taking vit D and never do!! Congrats on feeling better, after so many years you must feel so relieved! Hope everything goes well with your pregnancy &lt;3\n\ncongrats. i feel like someone could have recommended vitamin d supplements earlier.\n\nIt‚Äôs probably the pregnancy!! My anxiety went away almost completely when I was pregnant, and is still gone at 1.5 years PP.\n\nCongrats! Echoing what others have said, I think it‚Äôs the pregnancy. Ive had bad depression and anxiety since I was about 18, to the point where I had to be on medication for it. A few years ago I was able to work through things and get off meds but still had pretty bad anxiety, just learned how to cope better.\nThen, same as you, when I got pregnant, mentally I felt to great. It was so amazing and liberating, I miss it! \nFor me it didn‚Äôt stick afterwards, I have PPD and PPA, and at times I feel back to how I did at 18/19, which sucks, but I‚Äôm working through it. \nCan‚Äôt wait to be pregnant again lol.\n\nget checked first and  take Vit D with caution, I believe is the best to take it with vit K\n\nAlso pregnant and have felt the most normal and stable I‚Äôve ever been in my life! Can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a change in hormones or vitamins, but I hope that after delivery I‚Äôll still feel the same way. It‚Äôs been very freeing to not worry about panic attacks or have intrusive thoughts.\n\nThat‚Äôs amazing!!! And congrats on your pregnancy! Wishing all the best for you and your little one. :)\n\nI live in a notoriously cloudy place, so I‚Äôm gonna get checked once I have a GP again.\n\nIt seems so simple when you look back at it, a vitamin deficiency, years in the making but only detected because it is monitored during pregnancy.  There are several posts of people having their symptoms resolved because an underlying vitamin deficiency was corrected.\n\nI had a severe deficiency in B12, which can lead to pernicious anemia and death.  Only discovered because I mentioned my hands were tingling to my doctor and he added a B12 test to the normal blood work.  Turns out a lot of men over 40 become B12 deficient because we absorb miniscule amounts of it and it primarily comes from red meat, which we are reducing in our diets.  Simple correction is a daily sublingual B12 vitamin, which you can pick up without a prescription from any pharmacy or Costco.  \n\nOthers here have mention Magnesium deficiency, once again correctable by a daily Magnesium Glycinate tablet.\n\nThis is consistent with what the Dr. pushing RightSleep would say. Vit D cures many things she has seen as a neurologist, including migraines, headaches, etc. The connection would be that vit D between 60-80 as measured by a more accurate blood test called LCMS not the normal assay doctors order because those aren't accurate over 30, vit D and a healthy biome create 90% of the seratonin, which creates melatonin and allows the sleep switches to turn off correctly. How do you get a healthy biome. She believes you need to take 50mcg of B50 complex, esp B5 in that mix. In 90 days your microbiome can heal because the B vitamins feed the right combination of things to create the good bugs. When taking heavy amts of Vit D, she believes the B complex is important. K2, not as much unless you have osteoporisis signs. Very interesting. Google Rightsleep Dr. Sasha G something\n\nI am so happy for you! stay blessed :) wishing you a happy life ahead\n\nwhich brand are you taking?\n\nHaha leaving Ireland is certainly good for vitamin D and general anxiety. Glad for you.\n\nwhat is with all these vitamins cure anxiety posts?\n\nTry it out. You need it.\n\nMy anxiety and depression alleviated in all my pregnancies but quickly returned in the following 12 weeks after delivery.\n\nTo all the people hating on the idea that the vitamin d is causing the anxiety to lessen... have you actually tried vitamin d? If you can tolerate supplementation the benefits of it are insane. I remember starting on it and feeling like I had woken up from a sleep I'd been in for years. It absolutely helps.\n\nI'm not pregnant nor have I ever been pregnant but when my anxiety first started, I found out my vitamin D was dangerously low. After taking my vitamin d supplements and taking probiotics, my anxiety almost completely went away. There have been links to vitamin d deficiency and anxiety. I wish I knew what it could do to you. Health in general has a lot to do with it. Hormonal issues and vitamin d seem to be HUGE. I'm so glad this happened for you!\n\nThanks everyone. It‚Äôs true that it‚Äôs likely that because I‚Äôm pregnant and the lifestyle factors that come with that (giving up alcohol, giving up caffeine etc except birth control, I have never been on birth control)  may have had a big factor and not just Vitamin D alone, so that was probably misguided. However, I am someone who manages my hormone levels a lot- I used to have the worst PMS symptoms to the point of fainting with the pain and Almost breaking up with my husband every month. I fixed that with syncing my diet to my cycle and basically eating food that gave more of whatever hormonal support I needed in whatever part of the cycle for example tapering my mood swings in luteal phase with bananas , sweet potatoes and strawberries for serotonin etc. for 3 years now my PMS is almost none existent , I barely ever need ibuprofen. The only thing I could never get rid of was the pit in my stomach and dread , no matter what I did. When I moved to a sunnier place it helped massively, I haven‚Äôt had a single panic attack since I came here two years ago vs one every two weeks before. Then when I started the vitmanin D supplements the pit and dread was gone so because this is something i had never considered properly, that‚Äôs how I came to the conclusion. My therapist now finally tells me that Vitamin D can indeed help alleviate anxiety and that she recommends it to most of her patients. She never recommended it to me because she thought the symptoms were because of my intense childhood trauma‚Ä¶yeah right haha. Anyway I‚Äôm just happy to feel normal for however long it lasts, I have Scheduled for my bloods to be taken next week to see where I‚Äôm at.\n\nYep sorry to say it‚Äôs most probably the pregnancy hormones. I felt the best in my life during both of my pregnancies and breast feeding. As soon as I stopped breastfeeding anxiety came back.\n\nJust wanted to add my 2cents: probably pregnancy have a much bigger effect than vit D. Be prepared for some relapse during the newborn phase. Best of luck\n\nI hate to break it to you but my anxiety was gone with all 3 of my pregnancies and came back pretty much immediately after birth each time.\n\nYou are not breaking anything to me :) I got my my bloods done and it was confirmed my vitamin D levels were very low for someone who has been on supplements, doc made the suggestion I must have been at the very bottom before I started. He increased my dosage and put me on Magnesium too. Here is to a continuous healthier mental health. I hope you find something for your anxiety ¬†\n\nI think the high progesterone from the pregnancy is making this happen...and the vitamin d supplements too. \n\nExplains why anxiety is worse during the luteal phase and a little better during follicular phase .. congratulations on your pregnancy and the riddance from anxiety.\n\nHow much vitamin d are you taking? And congrats on your pregnancy and being less anxious!!!\n\nI also want to know!! I tried vitamin D before but nothing\n\nI too had the dreadful pit EVERY morning. I think it was anxiety from having to go to work. I would cough a lot too but was never sick. Anxious cough I guess. Vitamin D is so essential which is why its in a lot of multivitamins. I tried everything and while Vitamin D did nudge me in the right direction. I still feel bursts of panic. Ive been trying a lot of supplement but this post gave me hope that maybe I have overlooked a specific ingredient that will do the trick, something as common as vitmain D. Thanks for that, I take a lot of supplements with blends that help a lot but I think its time i hone into one ingredient.\n\nWhat blends? Maybe you need to pick one ingredient from the blends that are working\n\n[removed]\n\nHmmmmm have you tried making your own?\n\nThanks for sharing üôè Do you think I could replace it with Normotim?\n\nNo I heard Normotim is reaaaaaaaaaaaally bad for you\n\nReally? \n\nWhy?\n\nU dont get palpitations on vit d?"

Because I always wake up in the morning in a pit of dread as soon as my brain is aware I'm conscious. Goes straight from sleepy comfort to \"oh god we're awake, here's all the shit you have to be anxious about RIGHT NOW\". Meds help but they don't kick in for an hour or so so I *have* to get straight to work or else I will have a panic attack first thing in the morning every morning.\n\nAnyone else wake up super anxious every day and how do you handle it? I know it gets better after an hour or so but it also makes me afraid to go to bed at night knowing how bad the morning will be which is contributing to my chronic sleep issues.",

    "all_comment_text": "Human cortisol levels are naturally higher in the morning in order to help you get up and start the day. For most (including myself) more cortisol can mean an increase in anxiety, but I think that once you know that it's just brain chemistry, you can deal with it a bit better. \nAlso, once you're up and about, set aside some time to meditate in the morning, just to allow yourself to reconnect and ground a bit. This usually helps me a lot.\n\nThis. As soon as I started telling myself ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing to be worried about, it‚Äôs just your cortisol levels‚Äù my morning anxiety decreased drastically.\n\nOnce you realize it‚Äôs your brain misfiring and sending signals that you are in danger, you can focus on how you react when the symptoms start coming up. Remove the fear from the equation as much as you can, I know it‚Äôs exhausting and extremely difficult. But anxiety is only fear, if you take the fear of it happening away and just give in to it, let it pass without resistance, while telling yourself that while this is not fun and inconvenient, it can‚Äôt hurt you and nothing will really happen. Consciously let it run its course because when you get extra stressed or upset trying to avoid the feeling it makes it 10x worse. \n\nAs far as not getting enough proper sleep- this really has a huge effect on anxiety and mood. You not getting sleep causes panic in the morning and that‚Äôs probably the cycle that is making it worse for you. So I would really recommend some sort of bed time routine and heading to bed earlier and at the same time everyday if you can.  Look into magnesium supplements and melatonin those are both natural ‚Äúde stressors‚Äù and really help alot of people to get a full night of sleep. I understand insomnia and anxiety preventing good sleep, when this happens to me it‚Äôs so shitty. I go to bed early and play a guided sleep meditation that actually really helps me fall asleep/distracts from anxiety. \n\nBest of luck to you ü§ç Anxiety is a bitch.\n\nAwesome answer. I'm dealing and knowing more about anxiety and you brought amazing points for the whole thing and the OP situation\n\nThank you I appreciate that. It‚Äôs so tough to deal with so I‚Äôm always looking for more ways to manage and live a better quality of life.\n\nThis is so true! I tell my husband I need my twenty minutes before I start my day. I have to get in to the right frame of mind and prepare myself mentally to wake up and get in to my routine.\n\nThank you for this. Knowing the science behind a lot of why we‚Äôre anxious makes me feel a lot better.\n\nThis is probably why I am affected more in the mornings. I will have a higher heart rate and feel panicked. I do most mornings the same routine. Once I have my water and vitamins I feel better. I do work from home but I try to get everything done before starting work because I find it so draining. On my break I usually take the dog on a walk.\n\nI wonder then why I'm always so calm and relaxed in the morning and MAXIMUM ANXIETY before going to bed??\n\nThat could be more of a cognitive problem. A good therapist could help you find out what's happening before bed. Some people experience thoughts like: \"the day is over and I didn't do anything productive\" or \"tomorrow will be another shitty day at work \" (anticipatory anxiety).\n\nlol this is me except i wake up 15 minutes before 9, make an appearance on the messaging app we use (it has an \"online\" status), scroll on my phone until 9:30 and get to checking work messages on my computer, then make breakfast\n\na possible solution (for both of us lol) would probably be to sleep and wake up earlier so we have the time to worry and plan for what we need to do vs. feeling rushed to jump into work right after we wake up\n\nMan we‚Äôre all going back to the office aren‚Äôt we?\n\nthank goodness my company doesn't have a physical office üòÆ‚Äçüí®\n\nI do the same in the office or at home\n\nBeen self employed and worked from home for 13 years now.\n\nI was up at 530.  Watch sports desk for 30 minutes to clear my head and enjoy a coffee. \n\nThen straight to a 1 to 1.5 hour exercise session.  Then clean up and I'm ready to start my day.  \n\nFree of anxiety, clear mind, wide awake with a fee goals and I try my best to get the best out of myself.\n\nI've also created a work routine to try and keep me on task.\n\nChin up, full steam ahead!\n\nthis is such a productive way to wake up... like you've had a full day before it even started haha\n\nhow did you start doing this routine?\n\nI started well before I ran my own company.  I honestly have never been much a sleeper.\n\nBut I love life, look at every obstacle as an opportunity and dare you to bet against me.\n\nIt all boils down to will power.  Drive and motivation come and go.  \n\nHow bad do you want it?  Dare to be great my friend!\n\n‚ÄúBut I love life, look at every obstacle as an opportunity and dare you to bet against me.‚Äù \n\nJeez that was bitter sweet to read.. I wish I could have this mentality. \n\nI feel so on the outside of life, so dissociated. \nI‚Äôve never had motivation, I‚Äôve never had goals, I never keep plans. \n\nI don‚Äôt think these things will ever change but I love to see people like you really out there living life for all of us out there in that observer space.\n\nI know, I‚Äôm so happy for others but darn I need this guy as my life coach\n\nTell yourself aa I do ...\n\nI can, I am, my will.  And my will, will outdue your will 8 days a weeküëåüôå\n\nA man, a can, a plan. Nicely said friend\n\n*I honestly have never been much a sleeper.*\n\n\n*It all boils down to will power.  Drive and motivation come and go.*\n\nWith all due respect, you‚Äôre in an anxiety subreddit. These sound like Instagram memes. Not helpful at all.\n\nIf you read ... I'm answering a question.  Thanks for your opinion though.\n\nAs someone who likes to workout in the morning but sometimes can't due to work/college, i kinda envy you lol, what do you do for living?\n\nI run a promotional and apparel company.\n\nIt's hard to do 100% of the time.  Just aim for 99% and see what happens!\n\nI need to try it this way .. I do sports center but exercise\n\nHow did u get self employed\n\nI git tired of the rat race, being surrounded by why me victims and bet on myself.\n\nAlways been a battle and uphill climb.  \n\nBut for me ... saying yes sir ... see you in the morning sir ... sorry sir really wore thin on me personally.\n\nIt's not all cakes and roses on this end but I never miss my kids sports, I wake up with my kids every day and to me that's priceless!\n\nJust so all you ppl that down voted me here know.  I've came from heil and bk to build myself up.\n\nI'm an amputee, spent my whole childhood in the hospital with a rare disease.  Lost my arm as a teenager.  Destroyed my teenage years with drugs and alcohol.  Ppl staring, judging and constant jokes destroyed every part of me.\n\nI decided I wanted more out of myself and life as a whole.  The point of this is you can too.\n\nAlthough I see you're down voting me and judging me because you see someone doing something positive and sharing with others.  Which obviously bothers you, and that's a personal obstacle you need to overcome.\n\nHappy to help, although sad you see someone's success as a negative bc that's all you hear/ read/ see of this world you've created for yourself.\n\nI challenge you to be the best version of you.  You'll amaze yourself!\n\nTry setting your alarm an hour early to take your medicine and then go back to sleep? IDK - I wake up with existential dread and anxiety every morning too and work from home. Been trying to wake up a little earlier to drink coffee on my patio and ground myself before logging in. It‚Äôs working a little bit\n\nThis works haha legit!\n\nI stopped giving a shit about work and decided to turn into a bit of wanker and not responding to people and taking it handy. \n\nAfter a week or two I realised that‚Äôs how all my work colleagues are doing it and here‚Äôs me previously at 200% capacity trying to please everyone.\n\nNow I just see work as something that I have to do to maintain my lifestyle and doss off as much as I can.\n\nI‚Äôm in Ireland and basically it‚Äôs impossible to get fired without three written warnings and going on a six month improvement plan and it‚Äôs still hard for companies to fire you without been sued.\n\nI just realize it‚Äôs not worth the stress getting anxious over it. I used to wake up with unbearable anxiety over work, now I don‚Äôt give a fuck.\n\nLegend\n\nCortisol levels are higher when we wake up in the mornings, so it makes sense that you feel heightened anxiety as soon as you wake up! Dang evolution. \n\nMy therapist had me do some exercises to figure out why I felt the most anxious in the morning, and it ended up being tied to some trauma I had. We were then able to work through that trauma, and I typically feel okay waking up now! \n\nDo you have access to a therapist? If not, is there anything you think may be contributing to your anxiety? Are you stressed about having to start your work day? Do you feel this way waking up on the weekends? Do you live with someone you don‚Äôt have a good relationship with and waking up to see them causes anxiety?\n\nHappy cake day!\n\nHappy cake day!\n\nI am in a similar situation. It‚Äôs not a perfect science, but I found that with some discipline, over time, I feel some relief when 1) drinking a tall cold glass of water the moment I wake up. 2) exercising (preferably outside) 3) avoiding my phone/social media at all costs for the first hour of wakefulness. I must reiterate that this will feel uncomfortable and not be a perfect fix. But you will find relief.\n\nI know what you're feeling and it's awful. The person who commented about cortisol levels is on point.\n\nBuilding on their comment, here's what I've done to help ease into mornings:\n\n* Zoloft at night, not in the morning.\n* Ashwagandha, B-Complex and omega 3 pills before bed.\n* Sleep the night away.\n* First thing in the morning, when I hit the snooze button and the thoughts swirl and my gut knots up, I tell myself that this is my cortisol triggering my anxiety and the dread I feel over the day ahead is not commensurate with reality or my ability to handle it all.\n* Behavioural activation: Mood follows action. Get up right away, put a b12 pill under my tongue and get in the shower.\n* Drink my smoothie. Among other things, it has fresh kale and spinach, which boosts cortisol.\n* The snacks I eat throughout the day help cortisol levels: almonds, dark chocolate.\n* Get at least 30 minutes a day on the elliptical as many days a week as I can. Lift weights after dinner.\n\nYou've got this!\n\nEdit: I developed my anxiety disorder while working from home. The mornings set the tone for the day ahead and for far too long I never stabilized. Rolling out of bed every day and picking up my work phone first thing was the worst thing I could have done to contribute to my anxiety.\n\nI'm at the office most days now, and I couldn't be happier. You \\*NEED\\* time between waking up and starting your work day.\n\n&gt;I'm at the office most days now, and I couldn't be happier.\n\nThat's interesting. I do wonder if somehow working from home makes me feel more anxious and depressed. But I also hate going into the office and get super anxious there.\n\nIt seems it‚Äôs different for everyone. My wife prefers to work from home, but she doesn‚Äôt deal with the same level of anxiety I do. (I not-so-secretly really do think she‚Äôd benefit from going in more often, but I digress.)\n\nAlso, for me, isolation was just brutal. My cognitive distortions went on a rampage while communicating mostly via email and having a hard time discerning a person‚Äôs tone. \n\nAt the office, I can interface with colleagues, use the gym, and separate my workday and my life away from work.\n\nI‚Äôm more of a social animal than I ever realized. That‚Äôs huge.\n\nMeditating in the morning helps me with this! I do just five minutes and the difference is amazing.\n\nDoesnt get better all day if I dont consume cannabis. Fck life\n\nIm on zoloft and also a daily smoker but recently had anxiety/ panic from cannabis use. Im switching to cbd in the morning with a low thc cannabis in the afternoon/ evenings‚Ä¶\n\nMate please watch and understand [this video right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2cAFRAX3Gs), your anxiety/panic is easily explained with it. My fav video on Youtube, this topic is insanely underrated/unknown in the casual daily cannabis user community. But in this video, the effects are so obvious and well presented, you will see ;)\n\nI hate it. I wish I could just sleep all day and all night. ü•∫\n\nI also work from home and used to have the same routine. I know its a little cliche... but incorporating meditation into my routine has been super helpful. I have a hard time focusing so I'll meditate for like 5-10 minutes before I start working and it really helps chill me out.\n\nI always get up earlier than my work day, regardless of if I‚Äôm at home or not. I have badddd anxiety, and I make sure I have 30-60 minutes to just.. vibe. Watch whatever show I‚Äôm binging at the time, have my breakfast and coffee. \nSome people workout, others meditate. Find the thing that helps lower the early morning cortisol!\n\nthis!! just some chill time makes my whole morning a lot better. no meditating, gratitude journaling, HIIT workouts, just chilling (not that those are bad just NOT for me or my anxiety!)\n\nThe moment I wake up I have a panic attack. Every single damn day. It feels like im exhausted all day from the moment I wake up\n\nGod I used to get this so bad. I would wake up and if I didn't get up straight away, I would have borderline panic attacks. It got so fucked that the within 10 minutes, I would get up and go straight to the gym. I got so used to that and now do it by default. I either walk the dogs or go gym straight away. I've had a couple times recently when I've just stayed in bed and the anxiety is still there but way better than it used to be.\n\nI wake up super anxious too. Before bed I‚Äôm pretty calm and normal. But when I wake up it‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh look it‚Äôs another day. Your anxiety could ruin it‚Äù\n\nI try to listen to something positive, like music or a mediation video . Think about things im grateful for. And get my body moving . Cortisol , the stress hormone , is highest in the AM. It‚Äôs used to wake us up and get us moving for the day; but for some it triggers anxiety. \n\nI would avoid coffee during this time. As caffeine can exacerbate it . \n\nMake sure you‚Äôre getting water, and a good breakfast.\n\nUgh yes this is me with most jobs to the point having a job is so hard and I feel so pathetic.\n\nI used to wake up every morning and immediately have panic attacks to the point where I'd throw up, but ever since I started taking Lexapro 2yrs ago (and also got out of an unhealthy relationship) my morning panic attacks went down drastically and I thankfully no longer dry heave in the morning.\n\nFor me, waking up early made all the difference in the world. I would set my alarm for at least one if not two hours before I would need to get ready. That way when I woke up I wasnt instantly thinking about what I had to do, instead I was excited to be doing what I wanted to do. I would sit with coffee and play a mindless game on my phone or watch a tv show or meditate. I had the Sunday scaries every single day of the week until I started doing this. There is something to be said about waking up slowly and spending time on yourself.\n\nExactly what I‚Äôm going through in the morning. As soon as I‚Äôm awake I feel the anxiety starting up. I usually just start cleaning what I can right away and some light exercise. Breathing exercises as well. I feel the same way going to bed at night also.\n\nI have more problems with evenings myself. Work is done, friends are asleep and I come back home with no one to talk to except my anxiety\n\nI did this for many years working from home, but now I like to get up about an hour early and just chill on the back porch or watch relaxing walking tour videos and scroll the internet until it's time to work. Also nice having that extra hour of sleep still available if I really need it from time to time.\n\nMy anxiety is reverse. I wake up feeling almost semi normal with little to no anxiety but as the day progresses it gets worse and worse. Sometimes I try to tell myself ‚Äúyou‚Äôll feel better in the morning‚Äù just to help me when it‚Äôs bad at night.\n\nDo you exercise at all in the morning or throughout the day? And I don‚Äôt mean a light 20 min walk, i mean really getting that sweat going and getting that heart rate up.  \n\nHave you ever tried ashwagandha?\n\nAlso, waking up 5 mins before work is absolutely horrible. Done that in the past, was awful and stressful. Now i wake up an hour or at least half an hour before my work day starts. That by itself has improved my anxiety. Wake up, lay in bed for a few minutes then i drink some water and afterwards i poop/shower/brush my teeth. I then get dressed. I wait until 9:30 for my first coffee (and it‚Äôs just a regular espresso here in europe, not the big jug i see in the us). \n\nAt lunch i take a walk (about 30 mins) and eat. \n\nAfter work i go to the gym and then i have dinner.\n\nHaving a routine has really helped. I have a routine for everything and anything. Something about having a little checklist helps me with the existential dread of life. I‚Äôve required my brain to think about tasks immediately as I wake up. In fact, I start at night and I make a short list of what needs to be done when I wake up (this helps occupy me instead of pre-sleep anxiety). I dose off thinking about my list. I wake up and immediately start working on it. It could be the dumbest shit like ‚Äòturn washing machine on‚Äô but it helps keep me distracted. Essentially I try to minimize ‚Äòthinking time‚Äô during anxiety peak times like mornings and nights.\n\nI usually wake up at 3 for work at 5.  I take the dog for a short walk and then we play on the floor for awhile.  It's my early morning therapy.  \n\nThose two hours before work are me time and its glorious.  No cell phones ringing or dinging for a text, just me, the dog, and some music while I post on here and check out other things.\n\nI eat breakfast, get my lunch together, and head to work.\n\nI‚Äôm WFH and have horrible anxiety in the morning. Same as what you describe- wake and  immediately feel like I can‚Äôt breathe and my stomach is churning. \n\nI used to roll out of bed and go right to my desk but that wasn‚Äôt working for me. And I love sleep. I hate waking up early. BUT I slightly trick myself to get up earlier so I can ‚Äúdo things for myself.‚Äù\n\nA quick shower, a small bite to eat, stretching, listening to a podcast or music, hell even throwing in some laundry, or just stand outside for some air. Anything that makes the morning feel more like my time helps. \n\nDoesn‚Äôt have to be a lot of time, an extra 5-10 minutes before logging in helps me feel like I‚Äôm not just a body doing a job every day.\n\nI walk my dog for 30 minutes every morning. Helps me to get some exercise and she also is my rock so spending more time with her interruption free helps a lot. Can you plan to wake up even 30 mins earlier and take a quick walk? I stopped exercising for a while recently and realized it was killing me. Helps to give you a goal, help with the chemicals and is a nice way to clear your mind!!\n\nI used to feel so sick with dread in the mornings that I would literally be gagging from nausea. This is since childhood.\n\nI'm 45 and it never went away or improved. I just stopped eating breakfast, didn't go to half my university classes, only worked part time, and then stopped working completely. Now mornings don't exist for me as I sleep for most of the day.\n\nWhat a sad existence.\n\nI might get some shit for this butttt I've recently started microdosing thc and cbd oil when I wake up. I have high quality drops of both in mct oil and it really really helps. In fact nothing I've tried has come close.\n\nTakes me about 2 hours from the minute I wake up, to the time I get out of bed for the Monaco Grand Prix to stop in my head. I can‚Äôt take anti-anxiety meds after 15 years on them. It‚Äôs torture.\n\nI absolutely cannot stand waking up in the morning because of my anxiety. And I have to leave the house to go to work. I am so nauseous and exhausted when I wake up that I can barely function but I have to remind myself that I have bills to pay and I push myself. I am a zombie all day due to the fact that I barely get any sleep at night due to my insomnia from anxiety, my brain just won‚Äôt shut of and the only medication that works are benzos and these terrible doctors won‚Äôt prescribe it. So yeah morning anxiety is brutal. BTW you said you work from home, do you mind sharing with what company? I would LOVE to be able to work from home.\n\nYes everyday I get that dread, at night I don‚Äôt want to fall asleep bc I‚Äôm actually calm and I know the dread is coming. I take my meds then get ready for work which distracts me enough but I still hate it\n\nI wake up like that, more often than not. I get up early, and take my meds immediately. I need to get focused before I jump into work.\n\nRoutine‚Äôs the thing. It might be tough, but try to develop a stable routine involving some aforementioned light exercise/stretching/meditation. I also work from home so I know what you‚Äôre dealing with, especially with the new development of my own anxiety. \n\nControl only what you can control. Those things in the morning? They‚Äôre still gonna be there and you get to them when you get to them. As an old HR manager once told me ‚Äúcalm/slow down - we‚Äôre not saving babies here.‚Äù Make a mistake? Correct it, learn from it and keep going. You got this!\n\nYes I used to and still do. It used to be worse. I used work as an escape from anxiety so I don‚Äôt need to think and could just focus on work. \nI did meds and therapy. For a while. (I have a friend who only did meds without therapy and she did not have the same success as me). I think it was the consistency to therapy that helped me. I did CBT. My therapist gave me goals/homework and I made sure to do them. One big thing: you need to find the source of anxiety so you can fix that area in your life so it can lessen. So for example, if you‚Äôre in a toxic relationship and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing you anxiety, then you need to \n1. Be aware of what‚Äôs causing anxiety \n2. Keep reminding yourself of the anxiety it causes and that you‚Äôre aware of what‚Äôs causing it. You don‚Äôt want to forget why you‚Äôre anxious. Remind yourself of the calm, peaceful life you want. You deserve that. \n3. It‚Äôs gradual, it‚Äôs not big changes, it‚Äôs slow and it‚Äôs from constantly and consistently reminding yourself that the source of anxiety isn‚Äôt within you, but something affecting you. Which means you can change that. So now you‚Äôll notice the anxiety building while it‚Äôs happening and not just after the fact. \n4. Eventually, you‚Äôll have the strength to make small changes, like finding your own hobbies or distancing from the toxic partner. Distancing from the source of anxiety by introducing yourself to healthy alternatives. \n5. Set backs. Allow setbacks. Allow yourself to fall into your bad habit because if you‚Äôre human, it will likely happen. And that‚Äôs okay. Cuz you‚Äôve been there and now you‚Äôll be aware and stronger mentally to pull yourself out. \n\nI saw this video on Instagram where the lady shows how growth works. It‚Äôs a full pitcher of random items (the bad, the insecurity, the anxiety) and as you fill it up with water (therapy, self help books, exercise, self reflection) the items float to the top and you start thinking ‚Äúwhy are are these bad things coming to for me. I‚Äôm working so hard and all I have is the bad stuff that I shoved away and I‚Äôm working so hard on good things but only the bad things are coming to the surface‚Äù. That‚Äôs exactly what it‚Äôs like to grow. It hurts. And ppl give up and go back to their bad habits and stay there. But you‚Äôll build your strength to be able to focus on the end goal, get through the fact that all these bad things that you‚Äôve shoved down for years is coming up. You‚Äôll work on it as it comes up. And you‚Äôll have good flowing through. \n\nAll this said, unfortunately anxiety doesn‚Äôt have a cure. There are meds, there are things that help. But don‚Äôt be scared when #5 happens , when you feel anxious again, when you fall back, when you feel like ‚Äúwhy won‚Äôt it go away‚Äù. \nBut you can have a normal life! And with your docs approval, you can get off meds! \n\nIf you have more questions or want to talk more specifics, let me know :) \n\nTbh I don‚Äôt really remember your original question , I kinda went on a tangent, but this was basically the way I got off my meds, and starting seeing change in my life. \n\n(FYI when I say good and bad. I don‚Äôt mean that your anxiety is bad , it‚Äôs not bad , it‚Äôs a coping mechanism. You body believes you‚Äôre in danger. When I say good, I don‚Äôt mean that there‚Äôs a certain good thing out there- it‚Äôs whatever is good for you)\n\nThis is great.  Thank you\n\nI‚Äôm barely functional in the mornings.\n\nYou need to wake up an hour before work to enjoy some time to eat and get ready maybe even go for a quick 20 min walk around the block. Straight out of bed into work is fuel for anxiety it‚Äôs doing you no favours at all. Having a bit of time to ease into the day will solve a lot of stress for you.\n\nI wake up earlier so my brain has time to calm down before I leave for work\n\nWaking up five minutes before you have to be at your desk?  Consider some self care and wake up a little earlier/ go to bed a little earlier?  The adrenaline rush alone, of rushing to be at your desk is probably contributing to your anxiety‚Ä¶,\n\nI don‚Äôt üò≠ If I need to though, lots of coffee and something to eat before I start my day always helps.\n\nKeep waking up too early before the time my air con shuts itself off or phone alarm then I would just go through YouTube , Reddit, twitter,etc. usually would stay on bed till I feel like I‚Äôm ready to shower and eat breakfast\n\nI started working from home when Covid started and have been ever since. I would roll out of bed at 8:55 to start work by 9 and I usually felt pretty anxious. I started getting up around 8:15 and doing yoga before work. I also started a skincare routine and force myself to do it before I start working. I find these things really helpful at pushing those racing thoughts away.\n\nEveryday. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not working right now. Was a truck driver and saved up some money. I couldn‚Äôt ever go back to an office job w a ll the politics and being trapped in a cage all day.\n\nMy bladder, work alarm or chilli are the only things that can get me out of bed.\n\nRoutine. \n\nEven though I work from home, I get myself dressed and do my hair. Then I walk my dog.\n\nI wake up and take my meds. I feel like I feel better after I take a shower (meds maybe kick in? Cause Ik its not the shower haha). \n\nGod, it feels awful to wake up and want to go back to sleep because you feel like the day ahead will be tough, super long, tiring, idk. I hate mornings.\n\nI wfh too but have a kid so I have to get up early to get her to school. I wake up an hour before I have to and take my meds. Then I usually go back to sleep for an hour. If I‚Äôm too awake and already freaking out I put on an audible book and clean until it‚Äôs time to get her up for school. Then I‚Äôm dead tired in the middle of work lol but it‚Äôs better than panic attacks\n\ni‚Äôm a college student so not the exact same but similar enough: i used to wake up 10 mins before i had to leave and i always felt like a flustered mess once i actually got in class, like i didn‚Äôt have the chance to even think before i had to be there. but this semester i started waking up at 7:15 for my 8:30 classes and it has been wonderful! i don‚Äôt have a complicated morning routine or anything, just the normal brush teeth make bed etc. but having that hour to myself in the morning really helps bring me down to earth and level out from the alarm clock scaries. i‚Äôm also super high anxiety in the morning but i‚Äôm learning to channel it into energy to get me going instead. the good thing about being so anxious is that once that alarm goes off i‚Äôm UP haha. i think meditation, working out etc in the morning is awesome but just having a bit of time to myself is enough for me and i think that‚Äôs a good place to start before you jump to those 5 am morning routines. i do follow the same exact routine every morning but it‚Äôs very bare minimum. i‚Äôve never been a morning person but i had to work with 8:30 am classes and having a nice hour makes it a whole lot easier. not being in a rush makes a world of a difference for my anxiety personally. good luck!\n\nI listen to claire weeks audio books often.  Really helps  me.  \n\nThis will\nSound cheesy, but take a video\nOf your self when you feel better in a couple\nOf hours and then watch it the next morning. It's proof from yourself that it doesn't stay as bad as you feel first thing all day.\n\nI put medicine and water beside my bed. I took medicine one hour before I got up.\n\nself employed here. I wake up almost every morning feeling like I'm standing on the edge of a building ready to jump off and as soon as I recognize this anxiousness i meditate. for me i hold a lot of tension in my neck, belly and hips, it's like my body naturally braces for impact every morning so I meditate to walk myself off that ledge. It was very difficult at first But now i feel like if i focus on breathing only through my nose into my belly(diaphragm) i relax immediately giving me access to be an observer of my body/life instead of feeling like an impending hit and run victim lol. Once I'm at this stage i just create a loose plan for my day and this is the magical part of planning. Through your day you can reference back to the \"observer you\" as a guide . Ive had days lately where I'll get back home at the end of a super long day literally excited to start the next day already because the observer and I are ready to attack. Also i have to recommend you get up at least half hour earlier, you don't even have to get out of bed. But just like a car you have to warm up the engine before speeding off, you don't want maintenance fees and mechanic visits when you can completely avoid them. Cheers for seeking help, today you have brought yourself present imagine where you can be tomorrow.\n\nI can relate to this\n\nI book myself an hour of ‚Äúfocus time‚Äù every morning to get in gear. That way I don‚Äôt have to dread a human interaction first thing but get a chance to ease into the day and get my mind right. Highly recommend. But seriously ask yourself why you‚Äôre anxious. Challenging my own anxiety has been a huge help at work. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it go away but I‚Äôm able to use the anxiety more productively rather than just have it be looming dread. Like you I‚Äôve got 10000 things to do and I just try to be realistic about what is and isn‚Äôt within my control and that turns the volume down a bit‚Ä¶\n\nWeed.\n\nI get up early. I have time to meditate and enjoy a cup of tea. If that‚Äôs not enough I take a hydroxyzine.\n\nRide my bicycle to one of my meditation spots and go into the silence ü§´. This is after a cup of coffee of course. I try to go 4 or 5 times a week and it cleans the cobwebs\n\nHey there! I also work from home. First thing I do when I wake up is I make my bed, feed the dogs, &amp; go on a quick walk. Keeping myself busy keeps the dread away ü´∂üèª\n\nI wake up, come to consciousness a few ticks later and then scream. \n\nNo joke, everyday. \n\nI scream so life knows I'm pissed\n\n&gt;I work from home, and I take advantage of that by waking up about 5 minutes before work\n\nThere‚Äôs your problem. I would suggest (based on my own experience, your mileage may vary!) that because you give yourself no time between waking and working (to avoid a panic attack), you‚Äôve got yourself into a spiral of avoidance, which is making everything worse.\n\nWhat I‚Äôve found helpful for me is:\n- Wake up at least 1.5 -2 hours before your work starts\n- you can still leap straight into something to keep yourself focused, but instead of work, make it a shower, a morning coffee, a little light exercise (even a walk around the house will do)\n- take your meds as soon as you wake up, and make it part of a simple routine\n- give yourself ample time to get ready so you‚Äôre not hustling. Surprise yourself with how much time you have left before you have to start working. You might even start feeling bored, because you have to wait for work to start, rather than rolling straight out of bed into action\n\nI‚Äôve been where you are, and this is what helped for me. You might think because of all the excess time you‚Äôre giving yourself, that‚Äôs a perfect opportunity for your mind to wander and for you to freak out. But at least for me, I found that it really helped. And if you‚Äôre going to have a panic attack, best get it out of the way early, when you have a lot of time to kill anyway. Give your emotions space to breath and hopefully you‚Äôll find that your brain isn‚Äôt actually the pressure cooker you might feel like it is.\n\nGood luck!\n\nOP, this advice could work for you. However, if your anxiety is tied to CPTSD it may not work and there are gentler ways to go about things that don‚Äôt include less sleep.¬†\n\nNo offence at all to you, commenter, I think this is good advice for a lot of people but I wanted to gently flag that for certain neuroplasticity situations it may not.¬†\n\nNone taken :) everybody is different - I‚Äôve tried many different approaches before I found something that worked for me, so I 100% appreciate the clarification!\n\nI should say that - along with waking up earlier - I also go to bed earlier so I‚Äôm not losing sleep.\n\nü´Ç¬†\n\nI have a set routine and I keep it 7 days a week. Wake up Between 5 and 5:30 am. Play a video game, normally baseball or golf , Until 6 then I meditate for 1/2 hour. Jump in the shower and go to work or start my day if on the weekend\n\nRoutines are so important to reduce stress, even if you don't work. I've been disabled for almost 15 years, and I've not worked at all during that time. I still follow routines, getting up early, not staying up all night the night before etc. \n\nI go to physical therapy three times a week, that breaks up the week a little, and so I'm not lazing around all the time.\n\nCbd works wonders as a natural calming agent!\n\nDoes anyone else feel anxiety symptoms first thing in the morning related to your stomach being empty? When I‚Äôm hungry and haven‚Äôt eaten I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe. Like shallow breathing almost or tightness. My doctor said it could be related to GERD but idk if maybe it‚Äôs anxiety-related. Once I eat it improves.\n\nI know it‚Äôs hard but try to prioritize eating some protein in the morning after you wake up..nothing with sugar! I do an egg and some string cheese if I‚Äôm in a hurry and it really has helped me feel better throughout the day\n\nI've always worked fully in-person but recently switched to hybrid. On my in-office days, I use to commute to meditate and prepare for the day ahead. On my at-home days, I find it so hard to wake up earlier than necessary, but I find that whenever I give myself 30-40 minutes to slowly wake up, eat &amp; make coffee, get ready, and meditate, I'm a fair amount calmer going in. I hate it because I'd much rather sleep in as long as possible but I mess myself up whenever I do.\n\nSetting aside some time before you have to work really helps, even if you have to get up earlier. I also do a 10 minute meditation when I first wake up (I just use the Calm app) which helps align my thoughts and keep me from feeling overwhelmed before I even get up.\n\nI sometimes wake up before I have to go to school and cry because of how much I‚Äôm stressed at school. It usually gets better in an hour. I‚Äôve found that getting more sleep often helps\n\nI don‚Äôt do meds for a few different reasons but I cured my panic disorder completely on my own which is a lingering story but mornings were tough, I use to wake up nauseous and on the verge of panic every day lol. Sitting in the sun trying to practice mindfulness. Magnesium and avoiding sugar (only do natural sugar) helped a ton. Also exercise, I choose walking, I do it everyday even if it‚Äôs just a half hr rain or shine and it helps me SO much, it also helps sleep quality too. It does get better with hard work, anxiety is something to be healed.\n\nI found that not working/being up early helped. I now work later in the day.\n\nMy advice based on my own lifelong battle with anxiety and other mental ailments: wake up earlier, get to the gym or do a light workout/walk in nature - anything you can to take your mind off stress and focus on health.\nSince about 2020 when I had a mental break, I‚Äôve been on every cocktail of medication that I can reasonably expect in the country where I live l. Nothing has come as close to the efficacy of a personal trainer, a slow but consistent improvement in diet, and admittedly a late diagnosis of ADHD and the medication from that. Before those, every day was a nightmare and it was only getting worse. Now, I still ‚Äòshoot out of bed‚Äô occasionally first thing with jolts of anxiety, even have the odd night-terror still, but it is infinitely more manageable now compared to a few years ago.\n\nFirst thing honestly I try not to and immediately goto wash my face and pray but I end up hitting the vape reading some news some markets lmfso then I get sucked into memes and if I‚Äôm working from home I‚Äôm on reddit and looking at memes.\n\nDays I make it to rise and pray I am way more focused and don‚Äôt get distracted. It‚Äôs a sort of meditation for me my religion requires followers to pray 5x I just do the first one with rise of dawn\n\nI wish I worked from home. I go from sleeping to waking up at 6:30 in the morning to anxious thoughts about my long commute to work and sitting at my desk job for hours, having to talk to people, then the long commute back home üò≠\n\nSun in the eyes, and try to stay off your phone for a bit if possible. Usually I‚Äôll check mine once then keep it away while I cook breakfast. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt full proof, like it‚Äôs not some magic fix, there isn‚Äôt one. It‚Äôs about starting off in a way where you have to slow down and sit with those thoughts. Sometimes it‚Äôs overwhelming, especially with the time anxiety you‚Äôre experiencing (I struggle with the same thing, you‚Äôre not alone).\n\nYou should try yoga (i do yoga with adriene on youtube) or even some stretching. I have to stretch every morning otherwise im pretty anxious. Maybe a hot bath before bed to help relax you and help you sleep. Im sorry you are going through this!\n\nI was (and still am sometimes) overly caring about so much in life - not just work related - but about ‚Äúbeing there for others‚Äù, being helpful, reliable, constantly going the extra mile at work &amp; for everyone else. It drove me crazy and to the point of exhaustion and alienation. I know that much of this was fueled by anxiety and being a ‚Äúgiver‚Äù.\n\nI had to start setting boundaries to protect myself. I was constantly pouring my whole self into everything and everyone else, then being left with nothing for me and frankly hurt about giving so much without any reciprocation. Being compassionate with myself about what I can and can‚Äôt do and accepting what I can‚Äôt control is crucial. Some tasks honestly can‚Äôt get done and that‚Äôs ok. Some folks will just not like you or will gladly take advantage of you. Not every message needs to be responded to immediately. Everyone else‚Äôs wants and problems don‚Äôt need to be answered or solved nor do I have to be the one who listens.\n\nOff topic comment but these things helped my overall anxiety.\n\nAcceptance and self-compassion are key. \n\nAs for mornings, I‚Äôve never been a morning person and then becoming handicapped made it even harder. I WFH and now wake up at least 1-2hrs before I need to be logged in. First thing I do after waking up is hydrate with water. During this time before work I do my ‚Äúmorning duties‚Äù (bathroom and all that). I‚Äôll also try to get a good stationary bike ride in for 30mins - I get a good sweat going and it helps stretch out my stiff morning muscles &amp; joints, gets blood pumping and helps with overall anxiety and mental state. I‚Äôll then shower because it also helps me feel ready for the day (and I‚Äôll need to after exercising). I make sure to get dressed and put on my leg braces even though I work from home - the leg braces enable me to walk safely without needing a walker and help me feel less handicapped and is safer.\n\nI used to wake up five minutes before going right to work and it would not only add to my existing anxiety but it would throw the whole day off and I‚Äôd be playing catch up and then disappointed that a morning had been wasted and that I was doing it to myself.\n\nYou need to get up earlier, do some breathing exercises and ease yourself into the day. Even just waking up half an hour before you start so you can lie there for five minutes, do an audio breathing exercise, make a coffee or tea mindfully and just relax before work begins\n\nI still struggle with this al the time. So far my advice is... it takes tons of deliberate effort day after day! I've noticed that once I'm up and about, participating in society the dread goes away. \n\nFor me it starts the night before. If I make it a point to have a good bedtime routine, then I can get up earlier, and join society before work starts.\n\nOne thing that may not be the most economical but definitely helps is to get coffee before work. It's a chance for me to thaw out, talk to some strangers, and join society. Another thing that helped me is going for a quick 15minute jog in the morning.  \n\nOf course none of this is possible if I'm parylizsd by fear and stuck in bed. But it's more possible if I start the night before with bedtime routine.\n\nLastly, I'm experimenting with other things doctors recommend to fight depression and anxiety. I'm noticing more daily exercise (even a casual walk at lunch for 20 minutes) and changing what I eat seems to make a big difference.\n\nI absolutely do and also work from home. I‚Äôm just trying to wean off a variety of substances like adderall and kpins for win the anxiety wins but every day as soon as I know I should be up I start dreading it. Like what‚Äôs gonna stress me the hell out today? Thinking of starting ketamine therapy to repair or help reset my gabba receptors and rid myself of some of this anxiety but money and everything also is a concern so I‚Äôm just doing the best I can. It helps to have a good friend you can always talk to throughout the day. A support system is crucial for people like us.\n\nI don't. It's the worst feeling in the world waking up.\n\nFor me, I do not dwell on my anxious feelings in the morning. I acknowledge I'm anxious and that's okay and just get on with my routine as normal, breakfast, shower, picking outfit etc. This both gives me a sense of control and makes anxiety dissipate quicker.\n\nThis is a day old now, but I struggle with this, too. I work in a timezone that is three hours later than most of my colleagues, so I often have a meeting to attend or run before 9am my time. I'll naturally fall asleep around 2am, so I of course find it very difficult to wake up several hours before my first meeting...usually, I'm out of bed about 15 minutes before my 8am call. Not great.\n\nWhat helps a little is making sure my to-do list/agendas are solid before I log off the day before. By the end of the day, I'm often pretty burnt out, but if I don't take the extra 20 minutes to get my tasks in order, the anxiety is much, much worse. It's worth that extra push.\n\nDefinitely not by giving myself only 5 minutes to get ready for the day. Maybe don't wake up 5 minutes before work forcing yourself to mentally prepare each morning in only 5 minutes. Make coffee, take a shower, have breakfast, catch up on the news. Sounds like anyone doing that to themselves would need meds, so hey maybe you don't need them after all and just need a healthy morning routine.\n\nOh gosh, I'm the same. I used to be able to just stay in bed and chill for a bit and now I get so nervous and anxious in the mornings. I hate it so much. This feeling is just hell.¬†\n\nSkip or ffwd"

I genuinely enjoy watching and napping to it\n\nThis show is one of those shows where when you're sick, at home, in the rain, cuddling with a pet - it's perfect.\n\nI was about to say this thinking no one else would, but this is absolutely my default.\n\nThe sewing one is good for this too!!

One of us!\n\nParks and Recreation and The Nanny\n\nFor a while when I'd have a panic attack I'd get into the shower and try to remember the lyrics to The Nanny's theme song.

I love the living room and view of that apartment!\n\nI have shows and movies. ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nThe Office,\nNCIS (probably only ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù if you‚Äôve seen it before and know what‚Äôs coming haha),\nBridgerton (specifically season 3 haha),\nGilmore Girls,\n13 Going on 30,\nPrincess Diaries 1 and 2,\nLegally Blonde 1 and 2,\nPitch Perfect (mostly the first one but sometimes 2 and 3 haha)\n\nIf I think of more I‚Äôll come back because I know the importance of having something that will calm you!!\n\nETA: wow the format turned out horrible.

I loved that show haha\n\nKing of the hill atm\n\nFriends, Gilmore Girls, The Middle, and I actually like rewatching childhood shows like Arthur\n\nArrested Development\n\nBluey ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nI don‚Äôt know if this is true or not but I heard that dogs like Bluey because their eyes process the color blue better and that‚Äôs just the most precious thing ever\n\nThe creators specifically made the colours and contrast with dog‚Äôs vision in mind.  My elderly dog loves watching Bluey, it‚Äôs our evening routine for his bedtime.  We don‚Äôt have any children but every evening we watch Bluey as a family.  The moment he hears the opening music he‚Äôll toddle off to his spot on the couch and he‚Äôll whimper until we sit down with him for a cuddle while we watch.  We got him Bluey stuffed toys too and he absolutely recognizes them, he takes his Bluey doll with him to watch the show.  It‚Äôs adorable because the doll is easily twice his size but he‚Äôs determined to get it up on the couch to be his tv watching buddy.\n\nThat's adorable.\n\nI love this so much!\n\nSeinfeld\n\nCommunity\n\nCame here to see this. I‚Äôm rewatching with the commentaries right now.\n\nThe X-Files üëΩ\n\nI'm almost embarrassed to admit this, but for me, it's The Love Boat.\n\nOh I should watch it!\n\nModern Family!\n\nsitcoms! parks and rec, the office, brooklyn 99, and occasionally veep or arrested development\n\nBroad City\n\nWhat a fucking gem of a show.

I know it‚Äôs really old and in black and white (mostly) and way before my time, but the easiness and slow pace of the show really calms me down. I‚Äôve probably watched the entire show about ten or so times.\n\nAvatar the last airbender, I‚Äôve seen it 5 times.\n\nYes!

Even if I‚Äôve already seen the same thing over and over I just love it. Joe Gatto is coming to my city in a couple months and I bought tickets to his show and to meet him after!\n\nlol okay this sounds horrible saying it out loud, but my 600lb life is my comfort show. Let me explain: I have health anxiety and in my little anxiety brain, seeing these people survive and occasionally even thrive after what they‚Äôve put their bodies through just makes me feel like maybe I‚Äôm okay and death isn‚Äôt as imminent as I thought.\n\nThat actually makes a lot of sense, I‚Äôm glad you can find comfort like that! I also have a lot of health anxiety :)\n\nI‚Äôm glad someone understands. I feel like a monster because it probably sounds like I‚Äôm making fun of them when I‚Äôm not! It just makes me feel better ü§£\n\nThe office\n\nParks and rec\n\nNo reservations\n\nMash\n\nScrubs\n\nSuperstore\n\nThe Simpsons s1-14\n\nFuturama\n\nKing of the hill\n\nEverybody loves Raymond\n\nThe Orville\n\nSteven Universe\n\nIt's bluey for me, so fuckin good and is curing my childhood trauma\n\nGrace &amp; Frankie on Netflix!\n\nAdventure Time!!!!\n\nJJK and The daily life of the immortal king are both anime that are extremely well made and easy for me to get lost watching\n\nGilmore Girls, Seinfeld and weirdly, lately: mind Hunter.\n\nmostly b99 and pokemon indigo league\n\nStar Trek, Star Wars, Parks and Recreation Seinfeld.\n\nBob‚Äôs Burgers / Modern Family\n\nthe office and bob‚Äôs burgers :)\n\nI love that I am not the only one that needs a show like a safety blanket thanks for this. \n\nMine is \n\nSmallville \nThe lighting of the show feels happy and safe \n\nCharmed \nNostalgia and maybe I like the idea of a magic that can fix me\n\nHow I met your mother \nall day show  it‚Äôs always running\n\nModern Family is my number one go to for anxiety, New Girl, Brooklyn 99, The Good Place, Life in Pieces, Schitt‚Äôs Creek\n\nAnything relatively sitcom-y that I can tune in and out of and not miss too much/still be entertained by\n\nI hope these shows give you some comfort &lt;3\n\nThe Big Bang Theory and Forensic Files\n\nI like Eureka, an older SyFy show. But I never really used it for anxiety. It's just something that I can put on to be in the background and it feels comfortable.\n\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Forensic Files, Dateline, Twin Peaks, Berserk...wow, I'm a mess hahahaha.\n\nAdventure time is my current, it‚Äôs on HBO. I watch that and play happy color and it makes me fall asleep\n\nThe Office, Schitt‚Äôs Creek, Parks and Rec, Friends, New Girl, Seinfeld, Ted Lasso\n\nMy gf loves Bob's Burgers\n\nImpractical Jokers.

First time I came home from the hospital after a really bad panic attack still not fully calm I binged that show for hours late into the morning to finally feel okay\n\nBroad City, Gossip Girl, any trash TV (no thinking) TV like jersey shore, real housewives etc. \nmisfits and skin gen 2 takes me backkk too \n\nAnd if I go way back That‚Äôs so Raven is the shieett üíú\n\nbear with me here but i watch nostalgic kids shows to help soothe me. they are very positive and relaxing so it gives me that completely stress free watching experience and since it‚Äôs geared towards small kids it‚Äôs pretty simple and quick so i don‚Äôt need to be focused on it so much. \n\nYou can usually find episodes free on youtube. Some of the ones i watch are Bear in the big blue house, Bob the builder, Max and Ruby, Charlie and Lola\n\nFYI, if you want to watch shows for free, flixhq.bz is a great site. It has a huge variety of shows to watch. There are a few popups but you can just click out of them.\n\nSince you mentioned MLP, I will name cartoon leaning shows that I still watch as an adult. Many can be found on Youtube as full episodes, decent quality too!\n\n1. Winx Club\n2. Franklin\n3. Berenstain Bears\n4. Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends\n5.

I tend to pick one show and focus on it to the point of burning myself out.\n\nIn the past, it's been Lord of the Rings trilogy, HP movies, Sherlock Holmes (RDJ version) movies, Superstore, Brooklyn 99, Buzzfeed Unsolved on YT, a bunch of YouTubers honestly: Jacob Geller, Folding Ideas, Super Eyepatch Wolf, Danny Gonzalez, Drew Gooden."

Like, that doesn't make me feel better, I want my thought processes to be challenged, I want to be wrong about the world falling apart and have evidence that I'm wrong and that Im just an idiot whose mind is paranoid over spilled milk; I don't want my darkest fears to be validated",

    "all_comment_text": "I've been a volunteer, and I should say that many volunteers share your frustration. We want to roll up our sleeves a bit more, and when it feels right, to challenge. \n\nThe problem, that I do understand, is that for a formal organisation they have a liability issue. Pushing back may engage 10% more people to actually climb out of their pit. But if it makes 1% feel alienated _at the last call for help_ then you are arguably liable for that 1% checking out. \n\nIt's my personal attitude that this underestimates the corrosive effect of being risk averse. I think many people get alienated by feeling like they are talking to a wall. But I think we should give the profesionals some credit for taking the least worst option. \n\nIt's one reason why I think this place is so useful. We are obviously still responsible for our conduct. But we can be a bit more challenging without provoking a legal storm or media furore.\n\nThere's also the issue that most people don't want you to solve their problems; they just want to vent about them and feel heard. You start offering solutions, and a lot of people get offended as if you think they're incompetent.\n\nThere should be a hotline with a \"press 1 for pushback/problem solving, press 2 for active listening and validation\" option.\n\nlol yes that would be good\n\nI called one time and they said i wasn‚Äôt close enough to the edge to utilize their services. Next time i‚Äôll know not to even bother reaching out lol\n\nMy god\n\nThe VA one thankfully doesn't do this\n\nI called one once and was told they didn‚Äôt have any available counselors so I would need to wait about 30 minutes.\n\nWho exactly answered the phone?? üò≠ What a crock. I've never called a hotline. Only because I could foresee the ingenuity of it all.¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's almost like... the suicide hotlines are so ridiculous that in that moment you realized life was also ridiculous and not that serious üòå\n\nThese suicide hotlines are no different than how they hire the garbage of society to work at fast food restaurants. Years ago, they had well mannered, polite, professional people working these jobs, than something happened, and those people were replaced by mostly snot nose brat teens with attitudes, or adults that don't have any good sense, or know how to be professional and have etiquette on the job. Its sad that nobody takes suicide seriously anymore. üòí\n\nHow is that even related? Man... I work in customer service and can really tell you that the people that I help really REALLY make me want to end everything the same day. They go around not even saying 'hello' expecting people to do as they please. It sucks big time.\n\nCan't count how many times I've started my shift smiling and always greeting customers but then there's always somebody who comes and treats you unfairly out of the blue. Why? They must be also hurting (Can't think of any other reason to treat a human being like that) \n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not trying to cover the absurdity of the people on those holiness just trying to make a point about customer service. Have you ever worked at customer service yourself?\n\ni feel like becoming your own therapist partly helps a lot.\n\nso seeking help to self help. then you have someone available to help 24/7\n\nI‚Äôm becoming a psychotherapist because I‚Äôm equally exhausted by shitty service\n\nHonestly, this in addition to the risk of non consensual intervention is a big part of why I avoid hotlines besides trans lifeline (who operate different from standard hotlines in my experience). \n\nTherapy can also be such a pain to navigate getting set up with the right person. You can end up with a therapist who isn‚Äôt competent or just isn‚Äôt a good fit for you, and end up having to be the one to turn that down and search until finding one that is a good fit. I wish it weren‚Äôt such a struggle. It‚Äôs very worth it when you do find the right one with the approach you‚Äôre looking for, but ughhh the search\n\n[removed]\n\nI feel that, there is absolutely an issue that the overlap between ‚Äúresearch questions with funding‚Äù and ‚Äúresearch questions that address issues arguably having the most impact on people‚Äù do not always overlap. I made it through grad school myself, and honestly found it gross how much they understand/argue for the value of evidence based practice, yet often systemic issues and flaws of our current mental health system tied to its connections with policing, flaws in the healthcare system, and capitalism are swept under the rug. \n\nI think some therapists absolutely are blind to those systemic issues, such as the types you mention in your second para. And again, it makes sense- training when it comes to the risk of therapy harm as well as training regarding taking into account people‚Äôs systemic/ larger social contexts can be lacking if not entirely overlooked. \n\n*HOWEVER* me pointing out these important criticisms does not mean I think people shouldn‚Äôt bother with therapy either, and I want to be very clear about that. Therapeutic practices and modalities absolutely can be and have evidence to back them being helpful, and accessing those (if possible) can still be worth navigating the barriers, if a person is able. ‚ÄúBecoming your own therapist‚Äù sounds nice, but to assume that is so simple/doable as a replacement, I do not know of evidence to support this. Personally, I find the most value in criticizing the specific flaws the mental healthcare system has, and increasing awareness of therapy harm risks to clients and potential clients to help make a useful form of care that *should* be accessible to all just a little more accessible.\n\nI think you might have had bad experiences in therapy. My therapist does challenge my way of thinking and does help me change my way of thinking.\n\nSame here. Therapy plus medication, if needed, is the best treatment for mental health. This is proven by research.\n\nHonestly, try to find someone (friend/family) who works with a good, professional therapist, and see if they can schedule a session with you. If not, there are usually other excellent therapists at the same practice who may be of the same quality.\n\nI truly lucked out with my therapist who I have been with now for two years. I have referred her to one of my friends and another therapist at that practice to another friend.\n\nYes, I had to try 3-4 people out first before finding my current therapist. 1 was a student therapist and couldn't help me enough, 1 retired, 1 \"graduated\" me early after 6 months because of office admin bs, and 1 I just didn't like.\n\n Finally I found someone reasonable whose focus is anxiety and uses CBT plus other methods. Found her on Paychology Today! Filtered for my insurance, mental condition and other preferences.\n\nYeah this. Finding a good therapist can be a struggle but there's a world of difference between good therapy and bad therapy. My first therapist made me lose faith in the whole practice and it took years of getting worse to finally try it again. I'm so glad I did because it changed my life. It can feel hopeless while you try to find a good fit but the moment you do it will all feel worth it.\n\nYour darkest fears will probably never be validated is the thing. I can tell you everything I‚Äôve ever feared has pretty much always turned out to be the opposite. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been right once. And I consider myself to be pretty intelligent. As I believe most people are with mental issues. Arguably the more intelligent the more prone you are to depression and anxiety. But we just don‚Äôt like to be rational when we spiral. Homework is a good thing as well. But I can understand wanting a way out right when you start spiraling. Something that keeps it at bay or at the very least helps you keep from overanalyzing everything. My best way that I picked up and liked is if it starts with a what if, it‚Äôs an intrusive thought and you need to learn to cut it there and go down more productive thought patterns. Like the evidence doesn‚Äôt support your theory. And you shouldn‚Äôt bend data to match theories, you should bend your theories to match the data. Anyway hope this helps in any capacity whatsoever. Life can be ass at times. But it‚Äôs got some pretty amazing parts to it too. The mind moves towards its most dominate thoughts and feelings. Much love. Hope you find your way and if you ever need to talk reach out. I always got time for people. You‚Äôre not alone in this, which is usually exactly how I feel when I‚Äôm going through the thick of it. But you‚Äôre not.\n\nYeah anxiety isn‚Äôt really rational to begin with so it‚Äôs hard to be convinced otherwise or to have it challenged. You can‚Äôt ration someone out of a belief that they didn‚Äôt ration themselves into. \n\nI know that flying is the safest form of travel, especially in major western airlines, that crashes are super rare, most are survivable, and that I have like a 0.000006% chance of dying in a plane crash. None of that stops me from having a panic attack when I fly lol\n\nI also know that there‚Äôs no poisonous spiders where I live, that I‚Äôm way bigger than a spider and can easily smush it, and that they are beneficial because they eat other bugs. I still can‚Äôt deal with seeing one.\n\nI know that I perform well at work because all evidence points to that and I‚Äôve never gotten in trouble or been written up or anything. That doesn‚Äôt stop me from panicking and assuming I‚Äôm getting fired everytime my boss texts me ‚ÄúI need to talk to you‚Äù\n\nBahahahaha I feel this so much. Flying is the worst! In fact it‚Äôs such a crazy statistic that it helps me feel a little better. So apparently the odds dying in a commercial airplane crash are so vast the average person would have to fly once every day for 55,000 years. And even when something goes wrong you still have around a 91% chancing of surviving that. I hate it. But traveling is a great part about life and I don‚Äôt let fears rule me like that. I will still go on a plane to enjoy vacations and what not. Also good thing I try live my life by is never make decisions out of anger or fear.\n\nIf everything you‚Äôve ever feared has turned out to be the opposite consider yourself lucky. The thing is you don‚Äôt know what someone‚Äôs darkest fears are or how rational or realistic they actually are so you really shouldn‚Äôt tell someone they ‚Äúprobably won‚Äôt‚Äù come true. There‚Äôs usually good reasons for fear. \n\nFor example a couple years ago my darkest fears were that my disease would progress, and it turns out not only do I have something known to be progressive but that is exactly what has happened.\n\nI speak from my experiences. Thats why I said my fears. Let‚Äôs be honest most of our fears are unfounded though. Specially those who manage to over analyze everything, constantly. And in most cases what really fucked me in life are the things that i didn‚Äôt see coming. The ones outta left field. Im pretty sure I conveyed that with a good amount of clarity. That sucks for you, really all I can say. there‚Äôs nothing more I would like to sit and listen to the shit parts of that, if you found any great parts and what you‚Äôve come to learn from it. I mean if some of that‚Äôs not passed on what‚Äôs the point. Or at the very least provide some hope or comfort for you in the moments where those things are a luxury. I‚Äôve been through hell in my own ways. Years and years of it, to were at one point it seemed endless. Most of it self created. This to shall end as we are in a constant state of impermanence. I had to slowly pull myself out, day by day and it‚Äôs been a 14 year work in progress. No one can get through life without going through struggle and loss and pain and fear. You can decide how it‚Äôs going to shape you though. You have a say in that. And in the face of spiraling I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs not favorable to lean into it and feed your fears. The situation will still be the same, you still have to go through it and rise to the occasion or fall to it. And idk I would hope to show that most of the time even in nightmares you can still have some form of control. That you‚Äôll find silver linings and some sort of experiences or things you appreciate that makes the pain and the fear worth it. Fear ruled my world and from time to time still does but I don‚Äôt let it change the way I‚Äôm gonna make decisions or live my life. It seems to work for me. So I‚Äôm gonna set it out there for anyone who thinks that might possibly be a way for them. A candle in the window so to speak.\n\nMy worst anxiety issue is that it's not irrational.¬† The fears are about things that 100% are true and will happen,¬† likely in the next 10 years.¬† ¬†And there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.¬† ¬†Same with depression; it's not a chemical imbalance or a temporary sadness,¬† it's because I'm so severely disabled I don't have a real life and it's progressive so the situation gets worse over time.\n\n\nLike, I feel like these services and doctors are all based on helping people whose anxiety is due to something irrational.¬† Or something like intrusive thoughts that won't stop even though you know they're not true.¬†¬†\n\n\nThey're trained to help people stop obsessing or find ways to see how the source of the anxiety or depression isn't the end of the world,¬† that it's not so bad, it's just that your brain is caught in a panic loop.\n\n\nAnd when I try to get help they have no idea what to say because \"well yes,¬† you're in hell and it will always keep getting worse, but you should try to meditate until it passes\" or something equally moronic.¬†¬†\n\nI called one time when my mother was actively threatening suicide. I begged for help. I called 911. Nobody helped at all! They just kept telling me to call someone else. All of them. Eventually she actually attempted the suicide, (for like the 25th time in her life) and was admitted to a hospital. I realized then that she did it for attention and sympathy, and she told me that being in the hospital was like a vacation for her. I haven't spoken to her since then, it's been almost 20 years. I lost my faith in those hotlines and \"help\" services a long ass time ago. Every time I've ever called 911, they've never come. I have horrible anxiety and CPTSD but honestly feel like there's no help for me anywhere.\n\nWhat you have to do is accept things for what there are and stop holding on to your attachment of what you want them to be. You have expectations of how things should be and when they aren‚Äôt met then it throws you down the rabbit hole of why aren‚Äôt things better and why is the world so fucked. On a grand scale that shit matters yes but in our individual live there is little to nothing we can do to change the world. We can only change our little part of it. Let go of the things you can‚Äôt control and work on the things you can control, both internally and externally.\n\nThere's a behavioral approach called \"radical acceptance\" that deals with exactly this.\n\nThis may be considered reassurance seeking, which can provide temporary relief but ultimately tends to make the anxiety worse over time. \nIf the service isn't helping you though then it isn't the right service for you (stating the obvious!), and I definitely think there is a bit of a view that people who don't want to engage with a mental health service don't want to help themselves - which clearly isn't the case. It's female and talking dominated, for some groups that just isn't suitable. The listening and validating formula clearly isn't appropriate and suitable in all scenarios either.\n\n&gt;I want my thought processes to be challenged, I want to be wrong about the world falling apart and have evidence that I'm wrong and that Im just an idiot whose mind is paranoid over spilled milk; I don't want my darkest fears to be validated\n\nHere's the problem: your world may very well be falling apart, and your darkest fears might be reality. They don't know you.\n\nMany of the people calling these services have sh\\*t life syndrome - dying family, chronic/terminal illness, abuse, and more. They may be calling a hotline because they don't even have money or time to see a therapist. Their perception is just fine, their life just sucks. Telling them their life doesn't suck and that it isn't a big deal would be gaslighting, and gaslighting someone who's legitimately going through hell will just push them over the edge (so to speak).\n\nAs for you, you're not an idiot, and your feelings aren't wrong. They might be distorted and misdirected after years of bad situations, but they came from somewhere and there's a root cause. It's gonna take time to find the right therapist and uncover that root cause. Invalidating your fears won't make them go away, because somewhere in there is something very real you need to address.\n\n&gt;As for you, you're not an idiot, and your feelings aren't wrong.

It's gonna take time to find the right therapist and uncover that root cause. Invalidating your fears won't make them go away, because somewhere in there is something very real you need to address.\n\nWell if I'm right then I shouldn't stay alive, I should have one last happy day while there's still some good in the world and then go to eternal sleep before the world goes down the shithole\n\ni have not found therapy to be helpful at all and it‚Äôs been super depressing for me. i want to vent about things but it still doesn‚Äôt improve my anxiety at all\n\nThis has also been the case for me. I have a great therapist and getting my feelings out DOES make me feel good. But it doesn‚Äôt solve my social anxiety.\n\nMe too. It‚Äôs all bullshit. I know what causes my problems. It‚Äôs one specific thing, but there‚Äôs nothing I, or anyone else, can do about it.\n\nMy anxiety and depression largely stemmed from similar issues. I was constantly being made aware of every terrible thing happening in the world and I felt functionally powerless and unable to do anything about it. I think a big part of getting to a healthier place with my anxiety was coming to accept the fact that ultimately yeah, I can't really fix the entire world. But I can work to make the parts of the world that I directly interface with slightly better, and sometimes slightly better is good enough. \n\nMy therapist encouraged me to drop social media and stop reading the news. It felt insane at first. If I was just another uninformed citizen then how on earth would I be able to make the world any better? Don't I have to be aware of problems so I can help fix them? \n\nThe reality is even if you're aware of these issues there's largely nothing you can do about them. Working yourself into a doomscrolling spiral isn't helping anything or enabling you to make the world a better place. It's draining you of your most valuable resources: time and energy. You can't help ANYONE if your anxiety is constantly focusing on every single unfixable issue in the world. \n\nThings are getting worse, that's true. But things are also getting better. We solved the ozone layer. We have fought and won against so many devastating diseases. We have ousted dictators and rebuilt countries torn apart by conflict. The world is far from perfect and things seem to be heading in a scary direction, but that doesn't mean all hope is lost. Try and remember that news outlets want to scare you by design. It is okay to tune them out completely and focus on things you CAN have a positive impact on. Volunteer in your local community. Give a bigger than normal tip to your waiter. Find a friend who's struggling and spend a day making them feel better. Contribute to mutual aid efforts in your city/town. Try to focus on the things you can change and less on the things you can't. Awareness is not activism, don't let your anxiety or anybody else convince you that you need to be miserable and anxious and depressed all the time to be a good person. You don't need to be happy about the fact that the world is run by shitheads who want to make things worse, but you don't need to let them ruin the time you have on this planet entirely. The best way we can fight against tyranny and greed is by helping as many people as possible, including ourselves, to thrive under our conditions.\n\nThe US is a lot more tolerant than when I was a kid thanks to many people's activism and hard fought battles.\n\nTHIS. You get it! My last therapist said that my anxious thoughts were so common that every woman would qualify for anxiety meds. It didn't help me at the time, but eventually I became able to distinguish anxious thoughts that were blown out of proportion and actual worries. Actual worries about the state of the world can't be medicated away. This is the only scenario where I feel like \"other people have it worse\" is a helpful thought, because if they can go through worse and still have hope, I can too. All we can do is our best and find joy wherever we can.\n\nThere‚Äôs only so much someone can do for you over the phone\n\nThe ladies on the other end of the 1-900 numbers say otherwise.\n\nOkay\n\nI got into an argument with one of the hotline volunteers üòµ‚Äçüí´ They‚Äôre are absolute joke and rude AF. I‚Äôve been through 16+ therapists throughout my entire life and not one of them could do basic CBT. They were all unprofessional, incompetent, rude, inept and just plain psycho. I have stories for days.\n\nI had better luck with peer support and support groups. Therapy just made me feel like shit. I genuinely despise therapists. I‚Äôm so sick of the buzz phrases ‚Äúgo to therapy‚Äù, ‚Äúfind a therapist‚Äù, ‚Äúseek help‚Äù. Like stfu!!! \n\nMost people who say this don‚Äôt realize how shit the mental health care system is and the *insane* waiting lists.\n\nNot to mention when you do get into a clinic you‚Äôre lucky if you get to speak to a therapist every two weeks for an hour. There were times I had to wait two months.\n\nAnd then if they‚Äôre not a good fit you have to start the entire process over again. It‚Äôs even worse for people who don‚Äôt have insurance. I want no parts of that shit show.\n\nSame. The ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù a lot of times cause more harm than good.¬†\n\ncouldn't agree more\n\nI called one a long time ago and this woman was like ‚Äúdid you forget your meds????‚Äù and was so rude and condescending I never called another one.\n\nMaybe they are trying to give you the tools to dismantle your thought processes yourself.\n\nHave you ever been that frank with a therapist the way you are to us? And how did they respond to that?\n\nthe only time I ever got someone to even answer they hung up on me\n\nCalled 888 once on a phenomenally bad day and it was just so meh. The guy on the other end only started to engage when I actively started breaking down and dissociating. He did his job, so I‚Äôll credit him for that but I can imagine many scenarios where his efforts wouldn‚Äôt have been enough.\n\nI dont get why in such a crucial time people are encouraged to speak to just anybody. I think in time of crisis its when its the most important to someone who knows you and your mental health issues best and the best method tailored for you. \n\nI personally would never call one of those hotlines because even if I have absolutley no one to talk to, Im not going to have someone asshole stranger (because thats how itll come across, they dont know me or the fact that how theyre trying to help is actually doing more harm) dismiss me and be flippant when I need someone to care the most and not in the way that I need someone to care about me, in the way I need someone to conform to exactly what I need and know and care about me enough that they are not only able to do that but want to do that. Anything short of that makes it worse.\n\nYou‚Äôre spot on with this!\n\n\"in the way I need someone to conform\"\n\n\nHelp me understand this part. I have anxiety too but I also know we can't control others' behavior.\n\nI would recommend increasing the number of weekly standard therapy sessions you have. I do 3 per week and that works a lot better for me than 1 per week.\n\nMe too! I just got so irritated that I hung up and ended up talking to a family member but shouldn‚Äôt of. Oh well!\n\nI hate mental health services I believe all family doctors should know enough\n\ni almost called 988 when i was having a rough night, before i did so though, i did research on if 988 calls the police. they do, and sometimes right away. of course, calling the police when someone is about to end their lives, makes sense. i just wanted someone to talk though and the suicide hotline made me too afraid to call.\n\nmaybe all of us with depression should help each other out and vent what we need to say privately. maybe like a group chat or something i too am struggling with depression.\n\nAOL chat rooms probably had those.\n\nI just called my schools mental health crisis number for the first time yesterday cause I had been building to a panic attack for the last hour. The woman who answered kept asking what was wrong and if someone was trying to hurt me, I tried to explain that I just have severe anxiety and that it was all in my head I just needed help calming down cause I was feeling helpless, but she kept asking me who was trying to hurt me. My therapist had told me to call them if I was panicking but it really felt like she was more so trained to respond to self harm and suicide cause she kept saying she didn't know how to help me. I'd probably call again though just cause it was nice to not feel entirely alone while I was losing it\n\nFeeling better is never the objective. The objective is to change your reaction to what you feel. Changing your thoughts isn't the objective either. Changing your reaction to your thoughts is. We don't control either our thoughts or our feelings, but we do control our reactions.\n\nI stopped using those so-called helplines. Very few of them have done anything for me either.\n\nWhat you're describing sounds like CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy). You could even get a book or watch videos to try to apply the techniques yourself without a therapist if that would work better for you....it's all about recognizing your thought patterns, and challenging them. Exactly like you said...\n\nYes, they suck. What I suggest, and what has helped me immensely, is a group chat somewhere like discord if there‚Äôs a group. I don‚Äôt know of a one for anxiety but I have others for other subjects and we honestly talk about anything and everything. Not sure how to search for them, so I am sorry on that part. I did find a discord group through one of my other subreddits info page though. Wishing you the best of luck, friend.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure if it will help you, but I found this book ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt believe everything you think‚Äù helpful. \n\nI found the first half of the book more helpful than the last, but your experience might be different. It‚Äôs 126 pages.\n\nomg i feel this. when i first started therapy i told my therapist i feel like im dying and she said ‚Äúyeah i can understand why you feel that way‚Äù like please tell me im not dying. obviously im not but in the moment i was scared for my own life\n\nUnfortunately reassurance like that seems like it helps but only makes the anxiety worse. It reinforces the cycle. So therapists generally will not sit there and reassure you which  can feel brutal at times\n\nI don‚Äôt feel suicidal or have a plan so why is it constantly on my mind I‚Äôve been thinking of talking to a local head doctor but the thought of taking to another person face to face makes me feel like hiding under my bed\n\n.\n\nOne time I called about an anxiety attack and they called the cops on me lol after the attack was over and I was recovering I started getting multiple calls from an unknown number I finally answered it and it was a cop.. Guess what .. had another anxiety attack because of that it scared me so much.. another time a psychiatrist was upset that I cussed her out and she made some stuff up and sent the cops after me for a welfare check after I begged her not to because I have PTSD directly from cops almost killing me on multiple occasions as a teen .. she promised me she wouldn't and then still did thankfully the cops didn't even actually care lol they just asked me if I was ok and I was like yeah and told them how she wasn't even supposed to call and then I made a report and then they refused treatment so I had to go somewhere else .. I've had so many bad experiences with crappy psychiatrists .. nobody that works there actually cares about us they just want tons of money for as little work as possible and completely separate their empathy for clients to be able to do their jobs easier like robots not too mention all those years I was forced as a child to go to mental health specialists that somehow didn't seem to diagnose me with anything I had (autism spectrum disorder and anxiety disorder) they just told me I was depressed and forced me to take pills legally by a court order .. all the pills made me worse .. I wasn't depressed ..I had an actual reason to be sad ..they ended locking me up for truancy (school anxiety caused) but they never focused on my anxiety once .. when I turned 18 I had to tell a general physician i had anxiety and she was like oh yeah i guess u do and just gave me meds that finally actually worked but she took me off abruptly the same month she retired after a surprise pee test .. I tried to tell her so many times Xanax can not be taken everyday but she wouldn't listen that it needs to be as needed but she thought she knew more than me so I was forced to not take it as directed ..I was also refused treatment because THC was in my system one time  on a prerequisite pee test after she told me multiple times it wouldn't be a problem ... Can't stand the way I've been treated by these people ... They ended up being one of the main reasons for my anxiety when they were supposed to be helping it... I could go on for days about these non empathetic , sometimes even vindictive women at these mental health centers\n\nJust like most other healthcare these days, it's all about the money. It really sucks trying to get care and the doctors are either clueless or greedy or both. It's not about patients any longer.¬†\n\nThey don‚Äôt help. They exist for everyone else to feel that they‚Äôre meeting the quota of handling suicidal people. It‚Äôs all sterile and cold and no way to effectively help someone in a crisis.\n\nHave you looked into magick and alchemy?\n\nPeople here obviously don't understand inner work. That's fine. But don't downvote unless you educate yourself first.\n\nI‚Äôve called the crisis hotline twice in my area to help with a family member in crisis. It was the absolute most unhelpful experience, both times! One gave seriously bad advice. The other time I was told to call the primary doctor‚Ä¶ on a Friday‚Ä¶ at 8PM. Um, great, if they are still alive by Monday when they get around to calling me back, that‚Äôll work out great. Complete waste of time and actually caused me more stress both times than I was already facing. Feel free to call us back if you still need assistance.. right. Definitely won‚Äôt, thanks.\n\nTherapy did FA for me anytime I was forced to take it.  I find talking to God works better and I'm not particularly religious.\n\n&gt; I was forced to take it.\n\nThat's why it won't work.\n\n&gt; I find talking to God works better and I'm not particularly religious.\n\nYou're not (necessarily) talking to God, but you are talking to someone/somewhere. Talking, venting, thinking... getting off your chest.\n\nTherapy sessions are supposed to work exactly like that: you get off your chest but to a therapist to help you find (the) answer/yourself/healing.\n\nThe therapist is not going to give you an answer or solution, they would be underestimating your mind's intelligence and complexity if they did that."

Which is also a good thing.\n\nThis is also an excellent way of lowering your heart rate without focusing on it, which often defeats the purpose.\n\nI've found that, when my heart is spiking to 150 or higher due to anxiety, doing breathing exercises doesn't work because I'm focussing on my heart rate too much.\n\nBut if, instead, I just do something like wash the dishes, but do it slowly as possible, I find my heart slows down all by itself.\n\nThis is very helpful to know.

I am constantly reminding myself to SLOOOW DOWN during the day- and it truly helps. It‚Äôs definitely a process to make it a habit\n\nThat's a great tip! I‚Äôll try it next time I feel anxious.\n\nthis is great advice. i usually forget to do it but when i do i feel so much less exhausted. it's ridiculous how much i drive myself to go as fast as possible at dumb little chores that are easy thus making them hard and making me not want to do them\n\nI'm going to try this tip.\n\nGot to be worth a go.\n\nüíõ It's a really good reminder. I noticed how rushing I was making the dinner today and when I remmwbreed to just slow down it felt a million times better. Like doing everything properly and care. Hope things feel a little brighter for you soon üíõ\n\nhow good! I sometimes look with envy at the Japanese artisans with that calmness and I wish that this world was not so competitive, not only us but we must slow down collectively\n\nI love this!! I‚Äôm going to try it today!! Thank you so much!!\n\nHonestly, going to try this at work today.\n\nNot silly at all! Being intentional and not just ‚Äústressing‚Äù about rushing to do everything is so helpful. Probably why I allot myself 2-3 hours to get ready/arrive at my destination. Lately it‚Äôs been maybe 1 hour because I just want to stay in bed. But I‚Äôd rather be tired and not feel panic, than sleep more and be stressed before I even arrive at my destination. üòÆ‚Äçüí®\n\ngo slow and mindfully do it and focus on it. Zen walking meditation is the best example of it\n\nNot silly at all! But an amazing art I would love to harness. My issue with anxiety is when I‚Äôm anxious and I do ANYTHING my mind and body is just screaming to HURRY!HURRY! and get it done! The sense of urgency is all to powerful. Slooooow dooooowwn\n\nYou said it well hurry hurry to get it done.... instead of enjoying the process of what ever we may be doing, I do this all the time. Why can't we just work at a moderate pace and enjoy what we are doing?\n\nThis makes total sense to me. I will give this a try.\n\nIn general, focus on your physical body. When your attention is turned away from your mind and towards your body, your physical symptoms ease up.\n\nNo. Not silly. This is 100% what I do. Along with medication and ‚Äúcalm‚Äù flowers, my anxiety is just about gone. It works.\n\nWhat's calm fowers?\n\nWeed.\n\nLove this idea! I feel like it‚Äôs an awesome way to think about mindfulness. Mindfulness can be an overused word that it loses its meaning but rewording it as moving slower I think is a great way of looking at it. Thanks for sharing:)\n\nThis is so funny to pop up for me now. I have GAD and panic disorder, and was diagnosed with ADHD 4 months ago. I just started the medication last Friday, and I feel like for the first time I don't have a constant humming making jump from one thing to the other. Idk if it's a placebo affect or something, but I feel like everything is just a little bit easier the last couple of days.\n\nI was in denial about this diagnosis, and I hated the idea of going on another medication on top of zoloft and a beta blocker. But actually feel like I'm finally getting the right kind of treatment\n\nThis also works for me, my Anxiety just exploded end of September, haven‚Äôt recovered fully but it‚Äôs hella difficult, this helps.\n\nCould be something‚Ä¶..\n\nI recently upped my Vitamin D3 dose from 1000 Iu to 5000 and wow it made a huge difference in my anxiety and depression. Make sure to eat with some fat though so it‚Äôs absorbed properly. I like those PB crackers.\n\nI beat myself up for everything i do or say around others.  i feel like i‚Äôve given them ammunition to use against me or judge me because i‚Äôve shared to much info.   i have Postit stickers all around my desk reminding me to be quiet at work but i think my oversharing comes from me not having a social circle.   my mom is a narcissist and i feel socially awkward  and self defeating when people male and female show me some interest.  I always push them away.\n\nThe hardest part of loving someone is letting them love you. Regardless of what you feel about yourself, ask yourself. \n\nDo they really think about me the way I do?\nIf I am a bad person or feel inadequate why do they still want to approach me? \n\nBecause it‚Äôs always been in your head, it‚Äôs hard to actually realize this because it‚Äôs just you. You can‚Äôt possibly think the way they do about you. \n\nYou will always be critical of yourself more than others are of you, why? Because you want to succeed as much as you feel like you don‚Äôt. You want to, but your thoughts are a major driving force for your mentality which is why you struggle with feeling apart or like every step is mistake.\n\nThat's all the meds did that the doctor gave me. I'm lost in time now though.\n\nThis helped immediately\n\nYes! This honestly helps me immensely when I do it. It‚Äôs such a simple thing but when I purposely move slower, my anxiety pretty much disappears. I literally just did this at the grocery store alone this past weekend. I couldn‚Äôt want to tell my husband when I came home!\n\nI love this ~ thank you üíì\n\nLovely tip thanks ü©∑\n\nDid this at work did not go well. But definitely recommend it in daily life\n\nThis is great!

Thank you\n\nThank you so much . People have always been telling me to slow down but I never thought that it was making my anxiety worse . It really does help¬†\n\nWhat I appreciate about this post is that you're going through a period of darkness, but you're still trying to bring some light to others who are also going through, well, not a great time. So thank you internet person, I appreciate you and I wish you light, peace, and lots of self love.\n\nHey, thank you so much for your kind words, really appreciate them!\n\nFr guys, it helps a lot, especially while trying to speak in front of someone u don't feel very confident.  \nAnd not only that, moveing slowly makes u look more confident and like in \"control\"."

    "all_comment_text": "Quit smoking weed, weed turned on me like this and it never got better.\n\nso once you had that first negative reaction were you never able to get that feel good effect back?  Im hoping what I have isnt the start of psychosis. I will be having to quit I think.\n\nLong term weed use can lead to psychosis, for sure - I'm bipolar and chronic weed use definitely triggered my first psychotic episode requiring hospitalization.\n\nThat said, it doesn't trigger psychosis in most people - just those predisposed.  What you're describing is more paranoia, which is far more common - and doom is associated with paranoia moreso than psychosis.  Psychosis is often accompanied by delusions of grandur, like you feel like you're a messiah or that you've got all the worlds problems sorted out.\n\nah thats not good weed triggered psychosis for you.  I was worried that feeling of impending doom might be me starting psychosis but maybe its just as you say the anxiety/paranoia.  Yeah I don't seem to have any delusions of grandeur or anything.\n\nI sort of had a depersonalization or something. Like I hit this major depression that nothing in life matteres. I had totally lost the will to live. Became a nihilist. \n\nI used to be so full of hope and dreams\n\nIt's definitely just anxiety.  Let me guess, early to mid 20s?  Happens to a lot of people\n\nSounds like anxiety/panic attack stuff personally? You should take a break from weed, and if you try again then go into it really mindfully and slowly.\n\nI‚Äôve had this feeling of doom after smoking weed. Not pleasant at all. But one thing I noticed and learned is that sometimes as cliche as it sounds, you got to kind of embrace it. Might be the weed revealing something to you. Everytime I kinda noticed it happening I would try to fight the feeling and it made it way worse. I then started to just allow myself to feel like that, listen to my body and ride it out. Sometimes it was something important. Let‚Äôs say I got into a fight with my friend. Then I decided to smoke. Next thing you know that doom feeling would settle in. So I would just apologize to my friend and the high would suddenly get better. It‚Äôs like a great teacher. But yes that feeling does suck. Hope it works out for you üôèüèª\n\nYou didn‚Äôt feel like a messiah? Dude before I went to the army I smoked weed every single day I loved it it was my fav thing I‚Äôd buy like half pounds at a time‚Ä¶ and after after and that long time of not smoking if I take one hit now I‚Äôm drooling in the corner or thinking I‚Äôm gonna die or thinking of all the bad shit I‚Äôve done in my life. I wish I could smoke like everyone else.\n\n&gt; is often accompanied by delusions of grandur\n\nNot for everyone. Delusions of grandeur are only one kind of delusion. There's also persecutory and paranoid delusions, more along the lines of \"the FBI is putting microchips in my breakfast cereal\" or \"my workplace is scheming to put me in jail and murder everyone I love\"\n\nI know this because one of those delusions happened to me. I'll let you guess which one. It was at least partially triggered by weed, I've had other minor delusions without being high, though\n\nYup, this happened to me when I was 18. I was fine smoking weed, proper chill and then one night it was like a switch flicked and I was really anxious/self conscious and paranoid. Continued smoking heavily and months onwards started developing psychosis symptoms. Everything was a ‚Äúsign‚Äù - I assigned meanings to meaningless things e.g. even something as simple as a chocolate wrapper littered on the street, I thought was a sign for me. I thought I had this greater knowledge, like I *really* understood the truth about how the world works. I believed all song lyrics were written for me to hear, to guide me towards my true purpose and fulfil my potential as the ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù. When the radio was on, I thought the presenters were talking to me. I had delusional and disturbing thoughts and my perception of reality started to become distorted, and my paranoia caused me to attack others who I thought were out to get me (but really weren‚Äôt). A constant feeling of impending doom. I was hearing voices/noises in my head, felt like everyone was *in* on something I didn‚Äôt know about. There‚Äôs a bunch of other stuff that was going on and it wasn‚Äôt a great time in my life. I didn‚Äôt get any help with my mental health because I didn‚Äôt know I had psychosis. I stopped smoking weed completely and it disappeared. I‚Äôve smoked a handful of times since (over a period of 12 years) and each time the feelings of impending doom, paranoia etc hit me like a truck - even after only a few drags.\nThe only diagnosis I ever got was ADHD and ASD a long time after I stopped smoking and picked up by a doctor in relation to a completely different health matter. No diagnosis of schizophrenia or Bipolar (I do get worried about this sometimes as I still struggle with my mental health) - but I‚Äôm much better than I was.\nIf anyone has anxiety, paranoia or any of the above when smoking weed - STOP!!! It does not lead you to a good place and it can have a long-lasting impact on you, and you can become a danger to yourself and others. Stop smoking weed and get help because it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôve got some underlying health conditions / disposition.\nSorry for the essay but I wanted to share my experience as it might help someone.\n\nCorrect. It never came back, don‚Äôt worry about psychosis, but don‚Äôt push your luck. r/leaves can help a lot\n\nSame for me. First bad reaction in my 30s and the magic was gone..has never returned.\n\nAlso, once you get paranoia from weed, it does not go away.  Most people as they get older start getting paranoid from it, and it stays that way.\n\nAh I see.  Im 38 male and 39 middle of next year so maybe older age is now causing me to react with more paranoia im not sure !!\n\nI‚Äôm about your age. I also can‚Äôt smoke like I used to. Took a break for a few years, now I smoke very occasionally, at like concerts and such. Or if I‚Äôm in an exceptional mood. Some strains high in limonene are said to be good for anxiety, like blue dream\n\nThat's about the age the paranoia got bad for me, and my friends who are older (I'm 55) have all quit weed due to the paranoia.\n\nSome said that weed that was 50/50 CBD/THC wasn't as bad paranoia-wise, but I didn't find it made the paranoia any less - and while CBD helps with sleep, I didn't get the same high off CBD/THC so it just wasn't worth it.\n\nI quit many years ago, and frankly, feel better for having quit.  I have normal REM sleep now and feel a lot more rested in general.\n\nI did ketamine therapy and it got rid of the bipolar depression - so I feel so good sober now, I don't do anything recreational anymore even though most stuff is legal here (like plant-based psychedelics and recreational weed (CO)).\n\nI'm doing KAT in a month. Would you say it was worth it? Did it take away cravings?\n\n\n I really want to quit weed because it's been giving me anxiety lately, but I've been smoking it for over 15 years now, and when I don't smoke, I crave it so much. I also deal with mental health issues, so hopefully, it helps with that, too. I'm very nervous about the trip, fingers crossed.\n\nMan im going threw horrible withdraws on the smoke shop thc a vapes. Dont mess with those things guys stick to the real stuff. Anxiety,shakes,cant sleep,messed up stomach this isint fun.\n\nThis gonna be the dumbest answer and I might get downvoted but I been smokin weed for years as well and I get weird vibes kinda like that sometimes but I feel like it‚Äôs in my head some people get str8 psychosis and mental conditions get unlocked that they are predisposed to bc of weed but not everybody sometimes it‚Äôs just the effects of the thc on ur mind\n\nSome people def do get panic attacks off weed that‚Äôs diff the whole feeling of doom thing tho I feel like it‚Äôs kinda like shit is a cartoon or not real but I don‚Äôt really feel that way\n\nyeah weird vibes is also another way to describe the negative feelings it is now causing.  It's also a feeling of edginess like I can't really relax properly but when I first started smoking it made me chilled for the whole evening\n\nThe only time I was ever able to smoke and actually enjoy it once it turned on me was with a good dose of benzos. Actually had a few really good nights just smoking, popping valium and playing video games but it is not worth it. Don't mess with benzos, I could tell you personal horror stories. I'm still dealing with the repercussions.\n\nI personally love it, only happens when you get super high though. Micro dose\n\nI would look into therapy because thats just making anxiety u might not even know u have in ur daily life because ur so used to it. It does that for me\n\nToday weed is way too strong. If you want to quit you can try to taper down to smoking only CBD or high CBD strains. Or quite cold turkey. \n\nI quit cold turkey not by choice. I lost my job and couldn't afford to buy weed anymore. The withdrawal was brutal after being a daily smoker. \n\nBut CBD could help\n\nSame. It‚Äôs been almost 10 years and I can never go back to the relaxed happy high.\n\nHave you given HHC edibles a shot,? Pair with CBD and CBG\n\nI‚Äôve never tried that. But Its been ages since I quit and I‚Äôm happy now. Only reminisce the rare moments when I miss being high and enjoyed it. I‚Äôve come to terms with it. The additional benefit of quitting was that my sleep improved greatly. And I never want to trade that back for anything.\n\nFacts! Same for me. I can't even enjoy a J socially these days and I was a pot head for years. \nThen when I'm alone I feel I'm going to have a panic attack and just want the high to pass. I gave all my weed away.\n\nSame.\n\nUsed to smoke and 8th a day with about 6-8 joints or just 3-5 personal swishers. This was every single day until like 2017, the $10 grams were still at the height of their popularity..\n\nOut of nowhere I started getting WAY too many thoughts, overthinking literally everything, feeling of DOOM, like shit was all gonna just crash inwards on me. Even off of one or two hits.\n\nIt has to be something in the weed.. Growers are going for the highest THC possible since the longest but now it's govmt weed as well.... I miss the days I'd look forward to a blunt after anything - feeling the lovely hazy slow motion feeling with dry eyes/mouth BUT with no thoughts at all except damn I feel high..\n\nEver since it started, I'd think - wtf did I do wrong 2 years ago, what did I do wrong with this relationship, wtf could I have done differently, will my business fail, just all doom-fail-cycle thoughts.. which is why I haven't smoked in years which sucks cuz weed made everything better\n\nOmg me too\n\nSame here\n\nsame happened to me just didnt hit like it used to  destroyed my mental health even more and made me feel very small had to quit after 5 years of daily use.\n\nHappened to me years ago. Intense anxiety, mild paranoia. It just stopped being fun so I quit. Every once in a while I test the waters, bad idea major six hour anxiety attack.\n\n... This maybe might sound a little crazy but I have a weird theory... Was that around the time they legalized it? Because when I started smoking dispo weed it turned on me too and it's not like I was smoking ditch weed, I was smoking top quality home grown. One of the guys I knew actually started selling legally later on down the line with huge success! The dispo weed just felt.. different. And it's funny because literally everyone I know are stoners and they all agree it's different now but they can't figure out what it is. For me, my anxiety ramped up 10 fold. I tried to stick it out but it got to be too much. Maybe that just happens over time and the timing was coincidental but still\n\nEdit; yea I thought I sounded crazy, my bad guys\n\nIt's bc of the higher THC concentration. Dispo weed is specifically bred for certain usages and percentages of cannibanoids. Thats incredibly difficult to control for most people who are just growing their own stuff and selling to friends. Our cannibanoid receptors also can only handle so much input, so the higher levels of THC frequently are more likely to do damage faster than weed 15-20 years ago.\n\nThis. I have horrible anxiety reactions to the top level shit because it's just too fucking potent. I smoked for 10 years because it helped with my panic attacks. Started getting more \"dro\" as I started working and having more money, and it started turning on me. I quit for a long time. After watching a documentary stating that the good ole dirt/Brick weed/Reggie was much higher in CBD and had a lower THC concentration, I decided to try again with Reggie. It's been amazing for anxiety and Insomnia.\n\nDid it to me, too. I can't tolerate THC at all anymore. My advice is to stop.\n\nSame and besides it‚Äôs terrible for my lungs since I‚Äôve dealt with Covid twice. One lady told me I could take beta blocker and smoke I said what üíÄ? Yeah I ain‚Äôt doing that. My friends smoke but personally I cannot be around it anymore one I have a hard time breathing and two it‚Äôs just not something I want to be around anymore\n\nThis is one of the reasons why I stopped smoking.\n\n100% weed made my anxiety and OCD wayyyy worse. I was addicted to it for a long time and now I have no idea how I used to go 24/7 stoned. I can‚Äôt even be near it now\n\nNot psychosis but it can devolve into such a state if you don't remain acutely aware of the experience as it's happening.\n\nI was in the same boat, smoked for like two years straight, and was pretty \"addicted\" to it lol. My and my ex I was living with at the time would basically prioritize being able to afford weed over anything else.\n\nThen, out of seemingly nowhere, like a switch got flipped, the experience started changing. I was no longer able to just zone out and chill, it was like I was paranoid of something. At first I just put up with it not really realizing a change was occurring. I used to be able to smoke then go to sleep, but one night I just stayed up for like an hour while my girlfriend slept next to me, every sound terrifying me.\n\nI then slowly stopped smoking with my girl and began to spiral into major depression. I went through multiple jobs and just couldn't function for some reason. I started becoming distant from her, and this weird anger started coming out of nowhere. I would have weird dreams consistently, primarily nightmares where I was being chased/killed. I unknowingly took my anger out on her unfortunately.\n\nI subconsciously started withdrawing from her, and found I was okay when I was with other people, like my co-workers who I started hanging out with. This is when the voices started.\n\nI would be hanging out with people while high, acting \"normal\", and then when I would go into the bathroom, it's like a flood of thoughts would come into my brain, like I was able to suppress them when with another human but \"let go\" when alone. This happened distinctly once when I was with my girlfriend, trying to just have a good time.\n\nWe were laying on the ground, high, and she turned around to nap, and the second she did I heard a voice in my head go \"finally\".\n\nThis was an incredibly frightening experience, I literally assumed I was schizophrenic. However, I continued trying to be \"normal\" do what I had been doing. I had an edible for the first time, and I told my girlfriend that I thought I was having a heart attack. It literally felt like I was dying (panic attack). Managed to sleep it off, but I basically avoided weed mostly afterwards.\n\nHowever, I did reflect on these experiences and dabble in weed afterwards as an experiment to figure out what was going on with my mind.\n\nLong story short, I realized that I had a ton of suppressed trauma that was coming to the surface thanks to the love and safety of my girlfriend, allowing me to be vulnerable for the first time in my life. I also realized I was playing a facade, an ego, with everyone I had ever come across, putting on a personality, a role. So basically, I had an ego death from weed. The \"voices\" was the real me, by subconscious, not the artificial thoughts \"I\" (ego me) create for the sake of functioning with the people around me (traced back to putting on an ego/role/act for an abusive father).\n\nSo, why does weed make me super paranoid, on the verge of literally being frightened to smoke? Because my inner child, my soul, my subconscious, the opposite of my ego, has been hidden for so long and is not used to experiencing reality. Actually, the fear can also be confused for excitement, as physiologically, there is no difference in the physical reaction between fear and excitement. There is fear/excitement from the subconscious rising to the surface that I'm FINALLY about to feel things that have been buried deep inside me for so long. That paranoia is the fact that there's something hiding under the surface, needing to come out, that I am unaware of.\n\nAnyway, this experience was years ago, and I haven't smoked in a long time since. I've avoided that confrontation of my subconscious, of letting out all that trauma, of letting go of the ego. Even now I still maintain this facade of personality with everyone, but behind closed doors, I've learned to slowly become myself more and more. It's not enough though, I have to take the time to let a lot of that trauma out, which I could do even without weed but have put off/avoided because... well, because no one likes pain. That's just my experience anyway.\n\nwow, never read somebody's else words that resonate so strongly with my own experience. that's exactly what it felt like for me. nowadays i don't touch the stuff, and once a week in therapy i let out all that trauma for an hour, and spend the rest of the week soothing. \n\nsome weeks i just keep up the \"facade\" because i know i can't recover from letting it out. those therapy sessions usually go nowhere. \n\nthanks for typing all that out\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat door analogy is very apt because it's exactly how I pictured the experience as it was happening, a door that was waiting for me to walk through that I was too frightened to do so. During this time, I started having something like entering a lucid dream from a waking state, but was too frightened to go through with it. I would be falling asleep, completely conscious, my body would freeze, a loud ringing would begin, my consciousness began to transform into what I assume is trying to \"pop\" into a dream state, but I would also force myself out of it in fear.\n\nEven now, though the experience is much less common, I still can't bring myself to do it. Idk, same with weed and the paranoia it brings, I believe it's one of those things that you have to push through the fear and will find something beautiful. But before you can, you have to face the dragon. Something like that lol.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIn my experience, when that happened it always meant there was something really bothering me and being high brought it to the surface.\n\nThis! And I ain‚Äôt ready to face them demons yet so bye bye bud\n\nFunny. I use weed to hide from my problems\n\nEvery time I get sober now it‚Äôs like I think of all the things I need to do or should do and just panic attack like non stop\n\nI felt that way too but sometimes nothing is genuinely bothering me/stressing me out so idk why I panic when I smoke!!\n\nIt can induce paranoia whether you have anxiety or don‚Äôt. An inhaler has helped me out in that situation before.\n\nI get that way if I spoke to much.\nI find a quater of what I used to have gives me a happy feeling but not the feeling I'm going to die.\n\nHowever I have it on rare occasion not everyday.\n\nTry just using less you may find you are just having too much.\n\nyeah could maybe try cutting down a bit before deciding to quit altogether.\n\nim all out if i have them in the house im liable to reuse and i want to cut it out.\n\nStop. FULL STOP.\n\n‚ÄúGuys, this thing I‚Äôm doing is causing bad reactions, what should I do?!‚Äù\n\nMore.\n\nThis happens to me just take a break\n\nIf you don't want to quit, do you pay attention to what type of weed you're smoking? I tend to have this happen when I smoke one type of weed for too long. Like if I smoke sativa for a month straight this will happen, but if I switch to indica for a while I'll be good and vice versa. I've also found that certain strains can increase anxiety. Like for some reason sour diesel tweaks me out no matter how many times I try it. Idk, it definitely doesn't work for anyone but if you're not ready to give it up completely it might be good to be more intentional abt what you're consuming!\n\nYes, I am finally going to start paying attention to the type I am smoking and how it makes me feel. \n\n&gt;I've also found that certain strains can increase anxiety.\n\nI think anxiety is basically pent-up energy, so that makes sense that sativa could enhance that effect, I never thought about it that way before!\n\nSo stop smoking.\n\nQuit weed. It will ruin you from the inside out. \nThinking it works for anxiety is just kicking the can down the road. \nJust my opinion based on my own experience\n\nalcohol is the same\n\nYeah, but usually more cans to kick down said road with that one\n\nIf you are a daily smoker, stop. It's one thing to smoke occasionally and another being addicted to it. When I was addicted it also made me paranoid. If you need help quitting tell someone close what's going on and that you need support. If you still can't quit go to rehab. It sounds like a big deal but it really isn't. You'll get every help you need and probably meet some cool people who have it worse than you.\n\nNo, this isn't how psychosis starts, or continues. It's not that.\n\nAs soon as I and my friends started smoking weed, some of us would talk about the paranoia and vague doom-ish feeling it sometimes caused. We just figured that was how it was sometimes. But then weed became a problem in my relationships and despite feeling like I had no reason to stop, I started feeling guilty when I was high and suddenly, like overnight, every time I smoked I nearly went into full panic mode. Just that little bit of extra pressure from outside and suddenly it wasn't fun any more.\n\nThat kept happening until I kind of stopped because I just didn't enjoy it. Then my life situation changed and there was no pressure to stop smoking, and gradually I started up again. But now, with that anti-pot vibe out of my lfie, I found it enjoyable again.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that if you've got some kind of pressure or anxiety in your life already, weed can easily turn on you and make things worse.\n\nThe only sensible thing to do is take a break, a decent one of a couple months at least, and use the time to sort out whatever in your life might be causing anxiety. Maybe later you'll find weed less unpleasant, or maybe you don't need it any more.\n\nEither way, you should take a break.\n\nThere are a few ways this could go but to help you find an answer can you please (your choice) answer these questions:\n\nAre you on a prescription or getting it from a dispensary?\n\nDo you know what strain you're getting? \n\nIs it a sativa or indica? Street weed is typically a 60/40 blend. But that may not always be the case. \n\nHow much do you typically smoke?\n\nWhat's your method of smoking?\n\nHave you increased, decreased or remained neutral in your consumption?\n\nFinally, have you stopped or began any other medication/s?\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI think weed needs to really be treated with care and we all need to have an honest discussion about its potential to exacerbate mental illness. \n\nI had my weed phase back in high school but during this phase I noticed that I was deeply depressed. Over time, any time that I smoked weed led to both anxiety and paranoia. Cutting it out of my life has helped me reduce these symptoms significantly in my day to day. \n\nMy recommendation: try to find other coping mechanisms for your anxiety and depression that aren‚Äôt substance-related. \n\nExercise, time in nature, socializing with people you love, petting dope dogs and cats, breathing, meditating, eating healthy, sleeping well, adequate exposure to sunlight etc.\n\nI had to quit smoking weed because i was also vaping at the time and my lungs were not doing okay. I quit everything cold turkey. Then i tried to smoke weed again a few months ago, psychosis and the worst feeling ever that wouldnt leave. Weed was helpful for a while but sometimes it gives up on you and you need to find a different crutch, as annoying as it is.\n\nThe issue is weed isn‚Äôt actually a tranquilizer or something like that that can calm you down. Marijuana is techically a hallucinogenic, an incredibly mild hallucinogenic but still one. Hallucinogenics affect the brain in a much more erratic way than other types of medications and drugs. It‚Äôs why people talk about hallucinogenics sometimes causing bad trips. Sometimes the brain just reacts weirdly to them. I don‚Äôt think this is the beginning of psychosis or anything, but its possible your brain is changing how it reacts to weed or that weed in particular had a negative impact on you.\n\nIm 38 and male so wasnt sure is maybe getting older a factor in me now reacting negatively to weed but yeah I thought the feeling of impending doom might be psychosis starting\n\nAge definitely can be a factor. I‚Äôd recommend reaching out to a doctor or psychiatrist for your anxiety and sleep troubles. They can prescribe you something that should have a much more stable reaction with your body and cause a consistent effect every nightüëç\n\nyeah sounds like a good idea. !!!\n\nSmoked weed for the first time at 16. Was smoking weed for occasionally and enjoyed it. Then at around 20 I was smoking more than usual. Never had paranoia or an anxiety attack but I could feel like it was coming. The first signs of weed having a bad effect on me was instead of sleeping like a baby, I couldn't sleep at all. My mind was racing 100 mph but was going nowhere. That's where I stopped completely, never looked back. The first was month kinda weird but after that I completely lost all \"apetite\" for it. \nSo if you're worried about going insane, just stop completely. Plus, nothing gets done when you're high, you don't need it. Same goes with alcohol, which is even worse....\n\nI started getting intense anxiety whenever I smoked weed about 6 months in. I greened out once and then it never really went away. Atp i smoke very rarely, usually in very small quantities when I'm already drinking as well. A lot of anxiety brains just don't do well with it, unfortunately. Some people say it can help with your anxiety, but its never worked that way for me.\n\nOnce I hit 30 weed turned on me. I smoked weed off and on from my teens to 27, then regularly from 28-29, then I hit 30 and bam, I can‚Äôt touch any sort of THC without getting hit with extreme anxiety and doom. But also life has changed drastically since my teen years, so that may have something to do with it.\n\nTake a break for a while. Get into a better headspace, and then come back to it if you want, with a high CBD strain. I took like, 2 years off, now I'm smoking a couple times a week just fine.\n\nWeed is fun but not being anxious is way better. So if you have to stop, then stop.\n\nWeed will absolutely make you over think, especially with either negative things going on in your life, or things that happened 20 years ago that just pop up in your mind, sometimes they involve guilt, There is not much you can do about it , understand its normal though, I don't one person who doesn't get this side effect\n\nWell said, Certain strains mess with me but I tell myself it's just the weed and it will pass, I then enjoy my high.\n\nI have read that you can chew on a few pepper corns before getting high, and it dampens down the overthinking, I have tried this, it helps abit, but not a lot, could be a placebo effect\n\nI've read that as well. When I started smoking herb again, I had a CBD vape that I would hit if I got way too baked. It really helped to tone it down.\n\nYeah, Herb vapes hit differently, alot cleaner of a high (not as good imo), but much healthier\n\nWeed has been like that for me since day 1. Welcome to the party!\n\nContrary to common belief weed is a stimulant and can exacerbate anxiety, especially depending on strain and terpenes. If you can, I‚Äôd cut back or stop since it seems to be doing the opposite of what you want üòÖ\n\nSame thing happened to me. Quit cold turkey in feb 2018. Best decision\n\nI have bipolar disorder and smoking weed makes me feel terrible. It didn‚Äôt always. I use to enjoy it when I was younger. Idk what changed but any time I get high my depression and anxiety are totally intensified. I start having intrusive thoughts and feel guilty about‚Ä¶ everything. It‚Äôs like all the things I try to compartmentalize, store away, and ignore start coming out when I‚Äôm high. I don‚Äôt like that at all and I don‚Äôt want to feel those things.\n\nIt definitely feel like that but also I still do it pretty often regardless. It‚Äôs amazing all the horrible things my brain can make me feel\n\nMe too if I smoke to much. The weed these days is strong af. I can only take one good hit or two small ones and I'm good for a while.\n\nHappened to me , I tried 2-3 times of getting back into it for months at a time during the attempts and it ultimately all ended the same w me tweakin or going thru another anxiety / panic attack loop. In fact it scared me so bad that I just stopped and had no desire to go back after being a pothead since I was 18 (I‚Äôm 24now going on 25) I don‚Äôt believe what you‚Äôre experiencing is psychosis, but just kick starting your anxiety if you‚Äôre genetically prone to it and probably some derealization also which is super common w the situation ^ . Best bet is to lay off of the green for a while and let your brain recalibrate / heal itself and try dabbling back into it in small small doses if you must. If it ends like my stint did w it I‚Äôd recommend quitting. It helps w the overall anxiety and managing it. I‚Äôd rather deal w it head on sober minded vs being completely zapped you know?\n\nSame happened to me, flipped overnight and I stopped. Happy to not look back.\n\nHad the same thing happen. I smoked like a lot. Then one day I smoked and got super anxious. That just gradually got worse and even smoked less potent strains. I just quit and tbh my life is substantially better lol\n\nI developed CHS (cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome), after a few years of being a daily wake and baker. I‚Äôd began to go to sleep and wake up with the most gut wrenching ‚Äúfeeling of impending doom‚Äù- which is often associated with this syndrome. this lasted for several weeks before i‚Äôd figured it out. Whenever i would smoke again consistently, it would return. It was also accompanied by stomach pain and issues that landed me in the hospital, but the main thing i experienced was paranoia and anxiety that literally prevented me from functioning normally and ruined my life. I stopped smoking for quite a while after that. Unfortunately i smoke weed again, but now when i smoke, i moderate myself and take tolerance breaks often. But long story short, yes, it  can definitely do that to you, and i would look into CHS.\n\nQuit smoking bro. This happened to me and it‚Äôs fixed itself now but I had to stop smoking for years\n\nSame over here! Weed just made me get Generalized Anxiety disorder for the second time, yes I‚Äôm stupid I didn‚Äôt know the first time got me it was because of weed but now it just happened after I did it so if it happens to you go to a psychiatrist whiteout any doubt! Please!\n\nYea I have done weed maybe ten times in my life and only really had a good time twice. Once I had a seriously horrible reaction where it felt like I was on the Truman show and groundhog day at the same time for a whole year. I've tried \"different strains, mannnnn\" but none of them are different. Thc doesn't work for me and I'm OK with that finally.\n\nI learned a long time ago so details are fuzzy something about this being related to overstimulation of the amygdala. It will most likely happen every time you consume thc in any form once it starts happening. ¬†\n\nMaybe do therapy or something. I quit weed bc of this. If I took care of my life in the real sense of managing stressors, it would get a little better. But I can't shake it unless I smoke while doing something distracting like walking around outside or going to the movies . I think it's activating the amygdala and triggering fight or flight kinda vibes.\n\nI been a week off of it now it was making me more paranoid and scared anxious feeling was on it for 4 years I feel more clear headed with energy I quit straight up don‚Äôt even miss it anymore\n\nI smoked weed for years but thinking back.. it always made me a little anxious even in the beginning. It eventually turned into this deep panic every time I smoked where all I could think about was death (or felt like I was dying). It took me a while to learn my lesson but sadly once it goes bad I don't think you can turn it around, better off learning to live without it.\n\nIt‚Äôs not psychosis, it‚Äôs giving you panic  attacks.\n\nCurrently going through the same thing.\n\nMakes my heart beat so hard too¬†\n\nAfter the army weed just started affecting me\ndifferently, it made me start thinking about bad thinks I‚Äôve done, people I‚Äôve fucked over all that. No one wants to think about that shit. But I smoked every single day In highschool literally I was high at school. I loved weed. But something switched and if I take one hit right now I‚Äôll be either A) thinking I‚Äôm going to die B)actively dying C) thinking of what other drugs I have to counteract the shit feeling then blast big scarr D) think of bad things I‚Äôve done in my life E) think about when i was mean to someone. No one wants to think about that shit so I do other shit rather smoke but I wish I could still pine like the rest :(\n\nIt brings back all childhood depression or sadness feelings for me and then makes me think im dying or what if others die and how i live daily without freaking out. Its anxiety because w a few xanax and i love the stuff but never edibles. They are always too, toooo much\n\nIt‚Äôs not psychosis, although I would recommend quit smoking weed cuz it‚Äôs not gonna improve. Although weed isn‚Äôt dangerous physically it can be dangerous for people with mood disorders like anxiety and depression, it might bring you temporary relief but it will make it worse in the long run, quit using substances and focus on recovery even through that‚Äôs hard. Please stop smoking..really, I promise after a week you‚Äôll notice a difference in your anxiety\n\nWhat strains, dosage and blends have you been using and how have you been using them? For me, I have to be very selective about the hybrids I choose and I must know the grower. I also stay within a certain amount of mg, like 5 mg is wonderful and definitely no more than 30 in a day or something if we are on vacation. I typically make my own edibles, though I have had some luck buying a decent hybrid gummy that is mostly indica and cbd. The dispensary people are usually pretty knowledgeable about the best strains for self medicating. It's good to have a safety plan with a list of good coping strategies in place beforehand, like making the environment safe, a few good ways of mitigating the inevitable increase in metabolism that often makes people feel like they are panicking, etc.\n\nIsn‚Äôt it the best?\n\nI've read a study in the past that claimed thc anxiety/psychosis indicates a zinc/copper imbalance.\n\nSame situation, 1 week clean off weed.\n\nJeez, sometimes I feel like the comment section of this subreddit is a DARE class. Obviously if it's hurting you stop doing it, but I'm just shocked that nobody here enjoys it lol it helps me sleep and relax\n\nThis happened to me and had to quit what I loved most for a few years. I started carnivore diet 2 months ago and 90% of my anxiety disappeared. I can drink coffee again with no issues and smoke weed with no anxiety or anything.\n\nAlso suffering from anxiety and depression ive found that sometimes weed can make me feel worse mentally and then I take a break for a month or two and go back to smoking again. Marijuana can actually cause mental breaks for those already suffering from mental health issues. So try not to do it so often and take breaks.\n\nMaybe you smoking weed for Head high remember there's so many different kinds of weed for relaxation head high mellow high different kinds of THC nowadays so there's something to get you paranoid too so watch what you're smoking\n\nSame exact thing. You just gotta quit.\n\nMore common than you think, I know a lot of people that can‚Äôt smoke anymore for this reason. Not the beginning of psychosis though friend, it might just not be for you anymore.\n\nThis happened to me as well. One day leaves just stopped being enjoyable and no longer served me. If you decide to stop just know you will now have a lot of free time in your hands that you‚Äôll need to fill. Also you‚Äôll probably start having some very vivid dreams for a little while.\n\nI used to smoke every night for 4 years just to relax and have a good quiet time to myself after an anxious and depressing day. A few months ago, I started to become sad as hell and overthinking, going through paranoia after smoking so I stopped.\n\nIt used to be so enjoyable and now I never want to smoke ever again. I stopped for 3 months then smoked again with a friend thinking we were going to have a night full of laughter only for me to curl in the sofa all sad.\n\nI quit smoking weed. Was making the anxiety worse and just was not what my body needed at all. zero benefits and only more negatives by continuing to smoke\n\nStop\n\nQuit now, it‚Äôs so worth it. I had a major panic attack and I think weed contributed. Ever since I‚Äôve had really bad anxiety, physical symptoms all the time. I don‚Äôt think weed alone caused this but once I quit, I enjoyed life so much more. I found I was getting those ‚Äúhighs‚Äù from walking in nature, playing video games and hanging out with loved ones. My career also took off too as I‚Äôd been so unmotivated when smoking. It‚Äôs hard to stop, but you‚Äôll be over it in 2 weeks. I don‚Äôt think you have psychosis, it sounds more like induced paranoia and anxiety but you don‚Äôt wanna keep going as if you do it could lead to worse\n\nquit, you'll feel better. I know from experience. Life itself feels better\n\nThen maybe you should stop smoking weed‚Ä¶\n\nJust quit. Easy fix.¬†\n\nBeen a borderline daily smoker for the past 3 years and yes I'm experiencing this right now. Trying to quit weed altogether because when I took a break for a couple months earlier this year I felt better than I have in these past 3 years.\n\nProblem is weed might be a tougher addiction to kick for me than anything else.\n\nImma be honest here, I love weed, I fully support potheads and I hate adding to this stereotype of the paranoid stoner, BUT weed was simply not for me in the long run. I was a HUGE pothead for years when I was young. I know everything about the stuff because of how much I loved it... But around the time I started dating my husband I took a big step back. I figured once I get to know him, I'll go back to my shenanigans, but suddenly it was like a huge burden lifted off my shoulders! I think, in part, I smoked to JUSTIFY my anxiety. \"Oh I'm just anxious because I'm stoned\" because facing the actual facts that what I was feeling even when sober wasn't normal or \"if I smoke enough, I won't feel this way and will be able to relax like everyone else.\" My husband smokes and occasionally under VERY specific conditions, I will take a hit off of his pen and watch him play videogames or something but never will I go back to the way I was. Funny part is, I've taken psychedelics and have gotten less anxious! \n\nNothing has ever gotten me as high out of my mind as weed has, and that's not the case for everyone but it is for me. But no, you are not alone üíú and it doesn't sound like psychosis, maybe just time to step back and reevaluate üíú\n\nThe same thing happened to me a few years ago. At one point, I became so paranoid that something would happen to a loved one I was inconsolable. I tried a few other times since then and it only got worse.\n\nI've had very similar experiences with weed. When people say it calms them down so much I get kind of jealous because it does the exact opposite for me.\n\nI still occasionally smoke but I go *very* easy, like one or two mini hits and I tap out. \n\nI've found CBD to be beneficial for the physical effects of anxiety/general aches and pains but it's hard to find high quality products that are reasonably priced. I'm thinking of adding some CBD gummies to my Christmas wish list. üòÜ\n\nMe too and I used to get high all the time. Idk what happened\n\nSince you're having this reaction, I'd stop smoking entirely if I were you. From what I've seen once it starts to make you paranoid it doesn't get better. Weed (specifically medicinal cannabis) caused my psychotic episode a few years ago. Ever since medicinal cannabis has been legalised in Australia the rate of drug-induced psychosis has risen significantly. It doesn't sound like you're experiencing psychosis, but be cautious, since it can happen to anyone. I have no family history of psychosis or psychotic disorders and it still happened to me. Be safe.\n\nWhen I was young it didn‚Äôt make me too paranoid but through my 20s it got progressively worse so Ive stopped for the most part. Occasionally I‚Äôll microdose and push it to test but nope, never gotten any better. \n\nIf I‚Äôm already drinking alcohol, adding a small edible is fine but that‚Äôs rare nowadays too. Substances don‚Äôt mix well with anxiety for me.\n\nWow. Same. To be young again.\n\nI stopped smoking for years because I was sometimes getting anxious, but even when I didn't, I wasn't getting the fun part of it anymore.\n\nRecently, I decided to try it while I was on the phone with a friend. I was french inhaling and ended up very high, and to my amazement, it felt like it did when I first started smoking. I was having weird random thoughts, and everything my friend said was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing at times.\n\nIt renewed my interest in it, but I will use it very moderately and during times when I'm less pre-disposed to anxiety.\n\nI used to smoke every day and then hit that 3 year mark and my anxiety was through the roof. I was nervous going outside even on a nice day. Hard quit and life has significantly improved. Everything is clear again and my mental health has never been better! It's been around 5 years now and I miss it now and then and try a little and regret it every time when I'm stuck in a corner not wanting anyone near me lol\n\nWeed is awful for anxiety, cbd oil might be an ok alternative\n\nthis has happened to me and i‚Äôve made it better by 1) taking a break 2) having less at a time 3) mixing with cbd 4) addressing my stress and anxiety\n\nThat happened to me. \n\nI LOVED smoking and one day, my whole perspective shifted and I had a massive panic attack. Thought that was weird and the next time it happened to me again. And then again. And again. \n\nVery very few times have I since smoked that I didn‚Äôt think I was dying. \n\nActually! I went to Denver a few years ago and told the smoke shop cashier I was looking for something that didnt make me count my heartbeats and wait for death and he was like ‚ÄúI got you, babe‚Äù and he DID. Hardcore couch lock and sleepy munchies. I was stoned for almost 4 days. Ugh. It was great. \n\nBut outside of that, I just can‚Äôt smoke anymore. It‚Äôs just not for me anymore. Which is sad but it is what it is.\n\nTry a different strain, go low on the thc %, I had a similar experience, I was smoking the highest possible thc % and would get almost panic symptoms, dropped down the % and went with a higher cbd and seems ok now. If it works for you, stick with it or just quit. Not trying to push anything, just my experience.\n\nI took a t-break and it got better. It also depends on the theme of doom. I took steps to make my life a little better but some of the doom I just had to come to terms with and accept. I got diagnosed with ptsd, depression, and an anxiety disorder but no medication is going to make me feel better than smoking weed does. I tried them. I felt worse when I couldn‚Äôt get my prescription filled‚Äîtoo many hoops. Weed man down the street. But quitting is still probably in your best interest.\n\nHonestly if you have anxiety, chances are you're going to either have to learn to better deal with the panic attacks from occasionally getting a bit too high or not smoke at all. I have panic attacks pretty frequently when high but I love weed when it doesn't trigger my asshole brains fight or flight response. Also I'd recommend trying hash, it's usually a much more mellow high due to the increased levels of CBN. You can still get panicky if you overdo it though, learning to dose properly is equally important, and try taking smaller hits, throat irritation definitely triggers anxiety for some.\n\nThis happened to me too after years of smoking pretty regularly. I can‚Äôt smoke anymore because of it and I frankly don‚Äôt miss it. You are not the first person I‚Äôve heard this happen to. There is nothing wrong with you, things justchange sometimes.\n\nThat‚Äôs all folks! That‚Äôs the end of that.. happened to me 20 years ago and I had to quit..\n\nTHC increases anxiety and weed isn‚Äôt a panacea. I have bad anxiety and I smoke weed for other health issues. I can‚Äôt do edibles because of digestive health. I dug into terps and other herbs and how they would make me feel. I also smoke CBD and CBG flower. Mixing herbs helps my anxiety but mostly making sure I have the right strain. \n\n\nI‚Äôve also know others who don‚Äôt react well to it. It intestines pain and anxiety no matter the strain or amount. \n\n\nYou can also develop cannabis hyperemesis syndrome from too much usage. \n\n\nI‚Äôd take a good long break and if you‚Äôre better not smoking it then I wouldn‚Äôt.\n\nIt's your diet, sleep and mental health that causes that, fix your gut health.\n\nSo I‚Äôm almost 40 and have been able to smoke some of that time. Most I could not due to anxiety. However I don‚Äôt have that issue now that I‚Äôm medicated.\n\nweed can induce psychosis. \nhttps://youtu.be/qBRaI0ZeAf8?si=y0TIkLoA7y23CTca\n\nTrust it. Tend to what it is telling you to tend to.\n\nThe feeling of doom might be depersonalization/derealization. It's quite a common transient adverse effect of weed. If this is the case, you should consider your smoking habit. A full-blow persistent depersonalization/derealization is hell and you don't want that to happen to you and it's often is triggered by weed when one is susceptible.\n\nYou need some type 2 trust me I was the same way holy city farms has some good stuff.\n\nI'm a very anxious person and weed has always made me paranoid one way or another.\nEven shrooms rarely affect me that way. (I rarely take them. Maybe once in 2 months, low dose)\n\nFor some people it just starts causing paranoia at some moment. You probably should make a long pause in using it.\n\nWhat balance of thc to cbd are you smoke? i would suggest higher CBD than THC ratio. If you don't know this is more than likely your problem. Know what your buying and buy from a legit dealer.\n\nI would quit for a while man, weed turned on me just like this for me too. Helped with my anxiety and depression for years then, what felt like in a single day, it flipped and would make my anxiety and depression worse every time I smoked. Made me sad, but I gave it up because it wasn't helping me anymore. But somewhat recently I've been able to get high here and there in moderation and successfully have a great high. So everyone is different, u may be able to come back to it after a while, but I would quit for now man. Keep the mindset of \"this isn't forever, my brain just needs a break\". Until u know if it actually is forever or not, keep that mindset, cause it helps with quitting. Best of luck to you!\n\nThat means it break time. Minimum of 2 weeks. When you feel better you can decide if you still want to smoke. It can take longer depending how long your been smoking and your tolerance.\n\nHas happened to ton of my friends and seems like it doesn‚Äôt really go away to fast I would recommend trying cbd or cbg hemp flower\n\nIt depends on what kind of mind set I am in and what is currently going on in my life. If I‚Äôm in a good place I‚Äôm okay, but if I‚Äôm not, then it‚Äôs bad bad.\n\nI loved weed when I was in high school, and somewhere during college I realized that I didn't enjoy the feeling anymore. It'd get me in my head, paranoid social feelings, etc., so I just shed it at some point.\n\n20 years later and I still don't like it, so I just don't use it.\n\nI used to smoke granted only for about 2 years but yea after the first 6-8 months it really was a gamble on wether it was gonna give me a fun chill night or was gonna fuck me up in the head one night it really made me feel like shit and I quit cause I realized it‚Äôs not worth the risk I still drink cause it never really gave me any issues plus it‚Äôs easier to keep track of how much I‚Äôm doing compared to weed but some people also get anxious from drinking I do miss smoking but it‚Äôs just weed I can live without it easily\n\nSmoking weed led me to a mental breakdown developing hppd and ruined my life. Worst decision I ever made was trying it again\n\nOP, this happened to me and I was able to reverse it! \n\nSmoking weed was a really big part of who I am as a person and socially, I really enjoy weed. Granted I can‚Äôt smoke as much as I used to, but I can smoke a whole bowl comfortably before bed and I‚Äôm okay. \n\nI got super sick (long story, it was months that I was housebound) and it was during that time that smoking made me feel horribly anxious - heart palpitations and everything. \n\nI went back to smoking a one hitter and I tried different strains. I found a strain that didn‚Äôt make me feel as terrible and I continued smoking one hit a day and then worked my way back up. This was over a 2 year period of *lightly* smoking.\n\nI‚Äôm finally back to smoking my bong and although I don‚Äôt smoke socially like I used to, it‚Äôs still really nice to be able to comfortably smoke again.\n\nObviously this might not be the case for everyone, but it worked for me :)\n\nI asked my Dr to switch to CBD after THC made my anxiety worse. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go back I like my certain peace over possible fun.\n\nIt‚Äôs a pretty common thing, bout a year or two ago (when I was 22) I got my first panic attack from weed. Since then it only got worse, I took a few months off of smoking, then recently this year I started smoking again. Hasn‚Äôt happened since thankfully.\n\nStop smoking weed then. Not worth your peace of mind.\n\nMe and my partner work in mental health and drug n alcohol. Clinical and community setting. \nWe both personally believe this is the beginning of psychosis if you keep using. Just based on all the times this exact scenario has played out. Once psychosis actually starts you can‚Äôt go back. Stop smoking weed now. \nI also experianced this first hand. I‚Äôve had to stop. I fully believe I was losing it.\n\nOr maybe you are starting to get panic attacks. The 5th time i smoked i took to much and had my first ever panic attack. It sucked because being high and getting a panic attack is pretty rough\n\nPlease stop smoking if you want to stop the feeling the after math causes more anxiety making you want to smoke again and again because it‚Äôll be a recycling type deal of emotions . One time last year I smoked a strain I believe London Pound Cake from the dispo I worked at, at the time, and I tested the waters and attempted to smoke the blunt by myself. Well that didn‚Äôt end like I wanted it to. I was high for 6 hours, my roomate and her friends had plans to go somewhere so I was paranoid in the house by myself, went outside drank water ate more then two times and I was still high. Called people on the phone to feel better and the paranoia just kept hitting I was relieved when the high went away but I did smoke some times after that but I cut it off I believe in January I was over the fact of chasing a high that just made me feel worse and if anyone offers me any I decline because for me I‚Äôm not about to take the risk of anxiety because of one puff. Sometimes I miss the feeling of being high but I just liked the thrill of shopping for more which I‚Äôm not doing so yea\n\nYes, it‚Äôs not abnormal. It‚Äôs because the drug quit you.\n\nSame, it's just not worth it. I'm much happier without it anyways. Everyone experiences drugs differently and for some people weed will always cause anxiety. Though there's a chance that if you live with high stress or anxiety and you work through that, it may be enjoyable again. But I'd recommend against using it when you're in a bad headspace, it can be counterproductive at best.\n\nStop. Same thing happened to me and the feeling never got better. Even if weed feels like a big part of your life, as it was mine, there are other ways to live your life.\n\nMe too man. Me freaking too. And I am a proclaimed pot head, getting high every day for almost two years. Tbh my life is kinda shitty rn so when I‚Äôm high i hyperfixate on everything going wrong. Thus, I stopped smoking and will pick it back up once I‚Äôm in a better place mentally.\n\nI totally get u, i have been a daily user for about 4-5 years and i use to worship weed,\nBut its been a month that its been giving me very bad paranoia and a feeling that i might die, feeling of impending doom.\nI am still struggling to cut down, but i have decided forsure that i wont really be a stoner for long. Its like the stoner skin is fading away.\nAnd its for the best\nLive life for what it is , vibrant mornings and a present mind.\nBest of luck and my advice would br that u completely stop smoking, it's literally useless at this point if ut wont make u feel good.\nIts just our addiction that forces us but u gotta beat it , and the fear if  paranoia might even be helpfull for stop smoking\n\nThis happened to me and i was smoking for 10 years! I had to stop because one day I swear I could feel my heart pumping and it felt like i was having palpitations which increased my anxiety. It is kinda weird tho because my bf who never smoked until he was well into adulthood has no issues and even smokes moon rocks. ü§î\n\nAre you having any abnormal issues in your life atm?\n\nYes, weed can cause psychosis, schizophrenia, and also can make axiety so much worse. Stop smoking weed.\n\nsome of my friends have gone though this, weed isn‚Äôt for everyone\n\nI was one of the biggest stoners you met for 5+ years. I was known for my bong rips. One day I got anxiety as fuck smoking and it has been a dance for me ever since. I have spent huge spans of time not consuming weed of any kind, only eating edibles, only smoking flower, only taking dabs, only using topicals, only using cbd/cbn, etc‚Ä¶ but soon enough whatever works for me makes me anxious after like the 5th ish time. I love what weed does for me when it‚Äôs good but fuck it can make my anxiety bad. \n\nUnfortunately I‚Äôve never found a way fully around it. I just use weed very sparingly now and make sure I‚Äôm n a good place before consuming any type of weed. I‚Äôve had good luck but I‚Äôm doing it like 4 -6 times a month now.\n\nJoin r/leaves\n\nweed my shit worse, just quit if u can\n\nI smoked weed regularly for 10 years, very heavily for those last 5 years. In 2020 &amp; 2021, I was smoking almost 3 ounces of flower weekly (disgusting, I know). After catching covid in late 2022, I started having the exact same reaction. I was seriously addicted, and kept giving myself panic attacks, so after a month of this, I transitioned into vaping nicotine. \n\nIt‚Äôs been 2 years, and I still have the same reaction to weed. Since I have really bad insomnia, I sometimes hit my weed pen once or twice right before bed, as long as I know I‚Äôm falling asleep soon and I won‚Äôt have to speak to anyone or leave my bed, and my mind is clear enough. I‚Äôm usually okay as long as I don‚Äôt hit my pen more than 3 times or so max, and I time it properly. I‚Äôve been on the same 1g cartridge for 8 months, whereas I used to finish the same cartridge size every other day, and it‚Äôs just now finishing up, so that should tell you how little I hit it.\n\nYep same happens to me. For me, it depends what type I smoke, the strength of it, and how much I smoke. Sativa = bad Indica = good. Now this doesn‚Äôt go for everyone I want to be *very clear* this is in my experience. I can smoke maybe 1 or 2 joints and that‚Äôs pushing it a bit.\n\nbeen there, 4 years of daily smoking then more and more anxiety was kicking in. had to stop for a while (it's been 1,5 months for me rn) will continue as long as I feel OK again.. reccomend even though the start is tough\n\nThis is how it was for me. I was heavy smoker for the longest time, blunts, joints, bowls, and dabs you name it. I took a break for about 6 months and when I started smoking again it just gave me panic attacks really bad and made me paranoid af.\n\nI have the feeling of doom without smoking or consuming anything special\n\nI almost fainted once after smoking for some years. After that, it has never felt the same. Instead of smoking everyday I cut back to 2-3x per week and kept feeling a heavy chest, as well as a fast heart beat. It began happening everytime I smoked despite cutting back A LOT. Even after just a couple puffs it would start immediately. I stopped smoking flower, and now only do disposables or carts. Even then I Can‚Äôt chief like I used too because I‚Äôd get the same feeling, just not as intense. 1-2 puffs get me stoned. Wonder why all of a sudden I became sensitive to THC\n\nSave your brain cells and your lungs.\n\nMany many many such cases. I had a lot of stoner friends in uni and it happened to all of them sooner or later including me\n\nThe same thing happened to me so I quit.\nThe high wasn't a high any more. It was a terrible feeling.\n\nI used to smoke a power of weed, then one night I took an extremely irresponsible amount of MDMA and had a terrible time, since that one single night weed consistantly gives me panic attacks, i stopped smoking it for years after, i now smoke it again but nowhere near what i used too and only need tiny amounts if i smoke too much i will get god awefull anxiety, I look for hemp flower with really high CBD and mix it with normal flower which will most of the time be high in THC, CBD is the antidote to the negative effects of the THC.\n\nHappened to me. I see it happen a lot especially with men around their mid 20s after heavy use. I quit for a year or 2 and got back slowly but could only smoke a little in specific situations. Like other psychedelics, I had to treat it w more respect and not as a crutch"

    "all_comment_text": "It's hell on earth. Thats how it feels\n\nGoing through the same shit myself. The only peace I get is when I'm asleep. I feel somewhat normal while waking  up in the morning until the anxiety kicks in then my day is shot. I agree it's a living hell. I just got back on meds to to try and manage my anxiety... It's been a very rough year in my camp.\n\nHi, what medicine do you take for such constant/free floating anxiety? Does it help? Thanks!\n\nZoloft 100mg has been very effective for me. I also take Buspar 5mg three times a day and Trazadone as needed for sleep.\nAdditionally, I have modified my diet. I avoid junk food and consume a substantial amount of protein, high-fiber fruits, and cereals, while limiting my caffeine intake.\n\nThanks üôè\n\nNp üôÇ\n\nTry to get anyone without it to even understand\n\nYeah. I was just crying in the bathroom thinking that maybe this is as good as I'll ever be. That I just have to get used to this as my normal. It's been so long since I've been truly relaxed. I hope my lexapro will kick in soon. Every so often I get maybe a minute where I feel almost normal and I just sit with it knowing it will be gone soon.\n\nThis is fucking  bullshit, world has so many problems to deal with by itself and we have to deal with this shit on top of it\n\nIt truly is hard. I‚Äôve been battling for a while as well. I never imagined I would suffer this much in my life. But there is always hope! And hope is what kills this monster.\n\nWhat triggers your anxiety? I have forgotten how to live a normal day without this dreadful feeling. I am always afraid that something bad is going to happen. As soon as I talk myself out of one thought and I convince me it won‚Äôt happen, another pops in my mind‚Ä¶ I worry constantly\n\nThat‚Äôs the key though.  Once you find a way to live with it it loses the battle.\n\nFocus on those minutes and know they will come again.\n\nI probably deal with anxiety about 70-80% of the day at the moment, so I just wait for my 20-30% to come back again. \n\nWith any luck it will increase.\n\nJust know you are not alone, far from it!\n\nCan I ask how many mg. of Lexapro do you take?\n\nI'm on 15mg\n\nDid lexapro help you for such constant/free floating anxiety? Thanks!\n\nIt has definitely helped.\n\nWhat makes you anxious? I can‚Äôt seem to gain control over my thoughts. I have forgotten the feeling of a normal day. I have all those catastrophic thoughts coming into my mind one after another. As soon as I manage to convince myself that my fear is not logical and won‚Äôt ever happen, another one pops‚Ä¶ it never ends.\n\nThat waking up thing is so relatable to me. Today the literal first thing I thought about when waking up was everything I had been worrying about yesterday. It feels like there's no escape, even if I go to sleep I know I'll feel the exact same the next day, and the next.¬†\n\nYea,  whatever I got going on is being considered not understood by the people I've talked to and trying to get help from.   Perfectly normal life until a panic attack in 2020 caused a lifetime change.   For me,  yes it's 24/7  and for no reason.   So when I go places to learn chipping skills or to avoid triggers,  none of that pertains to me.   It's literally the constant feeling of sickness inside and my brain being afraid of this feelings and fearing everything.    I can't even read and email without feeling anxious.   Of it weren't for my wife I'd not even be able to do paper work for my short term disability.   I can't stop.   No one understand this at all\n\nI feel 100% the same way brother. Thank God we have angels for wives. We will get better though. I personally demand it of myself. We got this!\n\nI think I'm in a similar boat when 99% of my anxiety is actually being anxious about being anxious.\n\nTo the point where I confuse hunger for anxiety, as it tends to start in the stomach or gets there eventually, and that alone will push into a pretty dark heads space.\n\nI get that feeling and the first thing my brain does is start going over everything I've ever been anxious about to see if that's the cause.\n\nApparently the fix is to simply become okay with being anxious, but knowing that and being able to do it seem very far apart for me.\n\nYeah, I noticed if I get gassy or whatever I'm loke uhh what's this feeling then eventually I realize.    So strange how my mind has programmed to be like this.  It started first time following a panic attack in 2020 but in March 2023 I was un frozen and back to the old me... it crept it's way back in October and been worse then ever.\n\nOn the positive side you have been through it before and know you can come out of it. That is the light I use during my periods of anxiousness, eventually it will pass.\n\n‚ÄúBedtime‚Äù is the worst time of day for me. Beyond normal anxiety bullshit I start worrying about how much sleep I am going to get, what panic attack I am going to wake up with or what I will start spiraling with when the quiet sets in. SSRI have taken the edge off some nights but I hate the side effects. My wife doesn‚Äôt understand why I ALWAYS  have music or podcasts or videos playing. What I hate the most is the charade I have to play around normals so they don‚Äôt know what is going on. The worst is my daughter. I swear she is a mind reader. I hate when she looks at me and says ‚ÄúDaddy are you ok?‚Äù Just the thought is brining me to tears. \n\nYup, a 45 year old man crying by himself in the truck again.\n\nI absolutely dread going to bed because when I wake up (assuming I do) it‚Äôs the same level of anxiety all over again. Saturday is my only day where I have a break from myself and from work. I hate Sundays.¬†\n\nYou are not alone dude\n\n[removed]\n\ni TOTALLY felt this !!!!\n\nSo Im not saying this will work for anyone but me but I found that my GAD was actually misdiagnosed ADHD. I was perscribed lexapro and it was an awful experience. After some neuropsych testing they suggested that I could gove adhd medication a try and i started a low dosage of adderall. It was immediately life changing. It helped me focus on work. When i did think about my stressors I feel it, process it and was able to move on. May sound odd but my \"hyper\" activity was spiraling on things that stressed me out that I couldnt control and it was preventing me focusing on stuff that mattered like work (which made my anxiety worse).\n\n\nAgain not that this is everyone's case but I wish I had run into someone going through this like me years ago so maybe it can help you!\n\nI still have severe gad, Adderall has helped my adhd symptoms but made the anxiety worse\n\nThey tried buprion on me for adhd. I said i felt stimmy and after 1 week stopped and they just said nah u dont have adhd.. back on ssri ‚ò†Ô∏è\n\nWe are trying this  with my little girl next month. \n\nBUT ADHD and GAD are blood brothers.\n\nDon‚Äôt put your kid on stims! I‚Äôve heard neurofeedback is really good for kids with adhd\n\nNot for drugs, trying to figure out what is going on so we can help her.\n\nAhhh ok good!\n\nIt can be for anxiety and depression and more‚Ä¶.ive done it a few times‚Ä¶it helps but then a don‚Äôt do it enough‚Ä¶its 65.00 a session‚Ä¶.but worth it‚Ä¶.i can rent a machine that does the same thing but not as strong‚Ä¶.might have to do that‚Ä¶.rent it for 500.00 a month\n\nHow many sessions did you do? I am thinking about trying it for anxiety, ocd and c-ptsd\n\nI did the brain map which tells you where to work on..that was 150.00 ‚Ä¶then I probably did 5 sessions‚Ä¶$65.00‚Ä¶.it does help but can‚Äôt do it all the time\n\nI got diagnosed with GAD as a result of testing for ADHD. But atp, I should probably get reassessed. Brains change a lot through puberty and I was first tested at 11. I'm super curious to know if I'd qualify for ADHD now and/or autism. A lot of people I talk to just assume I have ADHD because my anxiety often appears hyperactive, like you.\n\nI think I have undiagnosed ADHD that I need to be tested for but I also have anxiety (or at least I had significant anxiety when I was diagnosed with GAD - I'm better at stopping my spiraling but if I get triggered, all bets are off) so that's muddied the waters a bit for me.\n\nThis was me too. Unfortunately my doc weaned me off of Zoloft before starting adderal so the combination of doing that while starting stims made my anxiety insane.\n\nWell were you suffering from panic attacks regularly.\n\nYup. The cadence varied some days there were none and some days I'd have multiple. I think the highest count I had in a single day was 4. \n\nWhat has been told to me by docs and I think it hold true is what is the cause of those panic attacks. If you're having panic attacks about going outside just because, it's probably GAD. If you're stressing about something that happened to you like a work interaction that didn't go your way or that there's a leaking pipe under your sink and you spend hours agonizing over it but don't actually try to fix it, potentially adhd.\n\nSince starting adderall I haven't had a single panic attack. That said I still feel stressed sometimes but it's much more manageable. I'd say it's helped me be more resilient to stress where things bring me to a 6 out of ten instead of always being at all baseline of 8 or 9 then going to a ten (or 11).\n\nInteresting.   I'd say before my first panic attack that basically set the path of my future of extreme fear and anxiety..  I always struggled with getting things done.    I could mow the lawn.. work my job so simple chores.   But to organize the basement or build a project or do things out of the ordinary I'd be searching for stuff online about it and have to make sure I had this right or that right..  to the point I'd get super sick worried about it all.   I can't do certain things because of my mind getting in the Way.\n\nIf your HC plan covers it I'd say give a neuropsych evaluation a try. I can relate to alot of that.\n\nOk\n\nMy wife and I were talking about one of her students, and how they are having a hard time with their anxiety. She asked me how I was able to get it under control, and said how tough it was for her to see me go through it without being able to help. \n\nI told her that you just learn to deal with it. The reality is I still wake up with the same dread, same feelings of impending doom, same feelings of hopelessness. What I noticed was the toll it was taking on my loved ones to see me and not be able to help. So I just internalized it. I‚Äôm okay when I have to be okay, and not okay when I have time to not be okay. \n\nIt‚Äôs exhausting, but the feeling is always present. It feels like someone isn‚Äôt letting me inhale all the way. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. This is just what it is? Our minds are just wired that way? It‚Äôs a cosmic joke.\n\nThis is one of the most relateable things I have ever read. \n\n*\"So I just internalized it. I‚Äôm okay when I have to be okay, and not okay when I have time to not be okay.\"*\n\nThis is such an accurate statement of existing with GAD. It's exhausting.\n\nI feel this so much. I go through phases where it's easier to handle and then phases where it feels like it's taking over my life. And recently it's been taking over my life and my husband reached his breaking point. It is so so awful because I want to feel supported but at the same time i can tell it's weighing on him so much to see me suffer. \n\nAnyway, focusing on supporting him actually helped me get out of the bad spot for now. Once I got over how unfair that felt...it was just necessary. Idk it's so complicated.\n\nJust know you're not alone in doing this.\n\nMy wife is incredibly supportive, but she doesn't deserve to carry the weight on my issues as well as her own.\n\nI feel the same way. Would she do anything possible to relieve me , even if it was for a minute? Absolutely. Does she need that responsibility and stress? No.\n\nI get that too.\nI do meditation breathing and sometimes it's like it's \"gulping\" for me or it knows how to squeeze me.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI think part of the reason why I felt the need to just try to suppress it was the fear of losing my relationship. My then gf and now wife was always very loving, understanding, and supportive. I did see it weigh on her though. She was always monitoring me in a way, making sure I wasn‚Äôt spiraling, and you can imagine how exhausting that could be. \n\nIt‚Äôs not easy as you know. I think internalizing it has been worse for my mental health overall, but it‚Äôs not like anyone can actually help us with this. The answers are all the same. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be okay‚Äù, ‚Äúgo see a therapist‚Äù ‚Äútake your medicine‚Äù, but not if it is really a fix all. I find these to be temporary at best.\n\ni think the worst part of it for me is that every time something good happens i'm instantaneously fully expecting something to ruin it and that ruins it. like the other day my mom made some good food and i was so happy, noticed how happy i was and then got so anxious about something bad happening that i lost my appetite. it's not fair. GAD feels like a sick joke God is playing on me.\n\nHell yea GAD crew üòé\n\nI hear you. Anxiety has been my lifelong companion.\n\nSince I was a young g child. My first memories are of me laying in bed with (unknown to me at the time) insomnia induced by anxiety as I was laying in bed spiraling into oblivion.\n\nI definitely had GAD as a kid and now I‚Äôm just realizing it. My mom has it and she would always say that as a little girl I would be at the foot of the bed or had fallen out of bed in the middle of the night. I have never had a normal relationship with sleep. I suffer from insomnia and I know 100% it is the GAD. I had a lot idiosyncratic habits with food that lead me to being very picky and underweight until I was at least 28 years old. That was the anxiety again. My parents did absolutely nothing to help me with my anxiety as a kid or a teenager.¬†\n\nMy parents didn‚Äôt know what to do and I kept it to myself unless I was going down a very bad path in my head. They never knew the extent.\n\nFor 6 months 24,/7  nonstop fear and nausea.   I can't !!\n\nSame. Been 2 years for me even when I am doing something it‚Äôs always there looming and it‚Äôs horrible. Sometimes you don‚Äôt know what it is that bothering you lol\n\nSeriously man. I always ask myself why I had to end up this way. Why couldn‚Äôt I just be a normal person.\n\nI have a hard time being in situations where I feel trapped, annoyed, or uncomfortable.\n\nIt's a constant struggle to avoid having a panic attack.\n\nIt's the primary reason I don't travel on planes and go anywhere.\n\nIs there any cure for this stuff?\n\nI don't think so.. all my reads say once someone has major panic attacks more then a couple times you'll have \"panic disorder \" mostly for life.   It's just they say you have to learn to manage things.    Well how can we..   Monday was a perfectly decent day for me so why at 3am Tuesday morning did I wake from a dead sleep calling 911 because I was basically dying.  For no damn reason.\n\nCure? No. Most of us cope or mask. It‚Äôs the best we have when the drugs don‚Äôt help\n\nSo for my fellow anxiety sufferers‚Ä¶ as the weather is getting warmer‚Ä¶. For the last 10 yrs or so my heat intolerance is thru the roof‚Ä¶ there have been numerous times when I‚Äôm outside and totally out of the blue , within a few minutes I start feeling weird in the head, super shaky, weak etc‚Ä¶ and it  affects me for many hours and wipes me out‚Ä¶. Has anyone experienced this?  And I‚Äôm wondering if by some\nMiracle my anxiety ever lessens, I wonder if this would go away as well‚Ä¶/ I feel like I‚Äôm\nBecoming a hermit, because not I‚Äôm so paranoid about this happening‚Ä¶\n\nThis happens to me. If I am not in a cool or cold area my heart starts to pound and I start to get super anxious. I can't sit outside in the heat for long or else I start to get weak as well and light headed, it sucks.\n\nOmg this is me as well‚Ä¶ I have lived near the beach my entire life in calif and never experienced this until last 10 yrs or so‚Ä¶ it sucks! I‚Äôm literally not the same\nPerson anymore\n\nI live very close to the beach in Florida, never had that problem either until my anxiety started. Beach days are not the same anymore\n\nOmg exactly!!! I can‚Äôt tell u how much I hate this‚Ä¶ I even remember last year sitting under my neighbors patio umbrella and all of a sudden I got that weird feeling and shakey, trembling inside out of the blue and literally could barely make it 5 houses away../\n\nThis is my biggest panic trigger over spring/summer. I have finessed this a bit by always having an icy told water bottle with me! Because if you get too hot you can pour it on you, if you get thirst you have a drink, &amp;‚Äô if you just need to snap back in a little you can pour it on your hands! Also I recommend getting like a small handheld fan and definitely wear fresh / lose clothing if possible!\n\nThank you kindly for these suggestions‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to try them.\n\nYup I get this too.\nIf i go outside walking I prefer cloudy weather or gotta be near some trees. The heat seems to just pass through me. I have defeated it many times by riding my bike and just saying fuck it, got running again but had to make sure it was 18c or lower so my run was comfortable.¬†\n\nI getcha. Had untreated GAD and depression for years until I finally got help. I‚Äôm doing a lot better these days, but it really was awful beyond belief to have both cycling in my brain at any given time.\n\nHi, what did you do that helped? Thanks\n\nI hear you, I'm a paraplegic, but being afraid all the time, is a more significant barrier to my being able to lead a rewarding life. \n\nIf I could either not be scared, or not be a paraplegic. That's a tough choice, and I really really miss sexuality.\n\nThe only answer I've found is to try and simplify my life drastically. It doesn't make it go away but it makes it bearable.\n\nI tell people that it‚Äôs like waiting for biopsy results\n\nyasss\n\nYes I have the same thing going on I'm now on lexapro now about 1 month don't see any improvement yet yes it's he'll to constantly be afraid hoping it will get better for us\n\n7 weeks for me and barely a thing\n\nId be around 7-10 years I think\n\nTakes the edge off but certainly isn't a cure\n\nHave lexapro helped you for such constant anxiety?\n\nAngel is an understatement.   My wife has put up with my before this mess when I was mainly a drunk and pretty bitty attitude around the house.   Through court cases..   and now this.  I've never felt so afraid to lose someone in my life.  She does everything.    Birthdays,  and neat surprises on other holidays foe the kids. Things I'd never be able to think of or pull off and I used to be like ehh .now I'm so captivated by how amazing she is\n\nAbsolutely it‚Äôs preventing me from living my life. People without anxiety would simply say ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just stop worrying‚Äù. Don‚Äôt we all wish it was that simple‚Ä¶\n\nFeel this so much. I just want my husband to leave me so he can have a normal partner in life who can do things with him. I'm not normal anymore and dont know why. I want to do things but I just..cant. For no reason.\n\nI feel the same exact way. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this too. It‚Äôs actual real life hell everyday for people dealing with GAD. Most people never understand us. I really hope you feel better, you deserve to be happy.\n\nCheck out Netflix‚Äôs episode of their show, *The Mind, Explained* on Anxiety. It explains what anxiety is and why your body thinks anxiety is protecting you from danger. Watching one TV show won‚Äôt fix anxiety, but I found this idea to be really helpful. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=35a3d0f5617f2f1a&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS625US625&amp;hl=en-US&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIJA5oT97MpMwkxu1OiT4389tXZp-g:1715291073088&amp;q=The+Mind,+Explained+episode+(season+1,+episode+3)&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLVT9c3NMyItyzPKqsy2MXEkV-WWlSWmVq-iNUwJCNVwTczL0VHwbWiICcxMy81RSG1ILM4PyVVQaM4NbE4P0_BUAcuZKwJAA7rmX9QAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjC8OOYxYGGAxV5k4kEHfPlB74QrpAGKAB6BAhIEAE&amp;biw=390&amp;bih=773&amp;dpr=3\n\nWe are in the same boat... Everybday (mostly evening) is hell...\n\nsame here. i could start my day at home so well like literally feel SO HAPPY and normal but once i step out in public my face droops from my thoughts and anxiety and out of nowhere my heart starts pounding! i try and start my day with positive thoughts and have to literally keep reminding myself throughout the day to keep the anxiety at bay but no fr it's always lingering ...and i hate that. i wish i could not feel those things ever again\n\nIt really is all consuming. There is so much great advice on this sub, but the best part is knowing you aren‚Äôt alone. It‚Äôs taken me years (I‚Äôm now 40) to find ways to help ease my anxiety. All I can say is we are extremely strong people (it may feel like the opposite) but we are completely warriors for navigating life with this debilitating disorder each day\n\nI‚Äôve had about a year and a half anxiety free since I was 12. I‚Äôm now almost 39. That ~18 months was *amazing*, and I attribute it to having a great diet and exercise routine and true balance in my work/life. (Then the pandemic hit.) I‚Äôd give anything to feel that way again, and I‚Äôm slowly changing my lifestyle to get me there.\n\nHow are things going now? What sort of things are you doing to change your lifestyle etc?\n\nI‚Äôve gotten back into exercising (almost exclusively running but I want to start weight training again) and actually lost about 60 pounds last year. Gained about 10 back in the last few months of the year because I stopped watching my diet like I was. I restarted therapy and probably went through 3 or 4 before I found a good fit. I‚Äôm actively working on stopping my ruminating‚Äîreading books and doing the ‚Äúhomework‚Äù my therapist gives me. I still have a huge problem with isolating that I‚Äôm not sure how to combat; my goal this year is to spend more quality time with my kids. As goofy as it sounds affirmations and gratitudes also make a huge difference on your outlook.\n\nNice one. Glad you‚Äôre making progress. Thanks for the update. T\n\nI can talk for myself but have you ever heard about anhedonia? I have GAD but also a depression background and anhedonia, \"the loss of ability to feel pleasure\", often comes along with anxiety.¬†\n\nYessss\n\nI thought I was depressed due to the lack of joy I was feeling - but didn't really have the other depression symptoms (had energy, didn't feel worthless, still had motivation/interest in activities), no matter what happened, I just felt... anxious\n\nfor real and i hate it. i got diagnosed around august and sep of last year. moderate anxiety. due to life change\n\nYes just spoke to my doctor she upped me to 20mg  hope it helps\n\nWhat medicine? Did it help?\n\nI completely understand. My anxiety was well-controlled for years, until 2 months ago. I don't know what happened in my body that it overlooks the meds I'm trying to feed it's hungry ass üòÜ. It truly is debilitating and the worst thing for me is nothing has to set it off. I can just be sitting on my chair unwinding after a great day at work, and there IT is. Anxiety attack. Crying, shaking. Xanax works for this, but my psych won't allow it daily because it's habit forming. I'm seeing a therapist now and going to ask about cognitive behavior therapy.\n\nI‚Äôve just been prescribed fluoxetine. every single day for me is the exact same as you describe it. from the minute I wake up to the minute I fall asleep. It‚Äôs literal hell. \n\nI hope fluoxetine does something as right now I‚Äôm in a pit.\n\nHas it helped you? If yes - at what dosage?\n\nyes I can say it‚Äôs started to help me now, I feel a lot better! I‚Äôm taking 20mg.\n\nIt‚Äôs also the fact that sometimes people think GAD is the same as ‚Äúnormal anxiety‚Äù that you‚Äôd get Glendora a big test or deadline\n\nI feel this in the core of my soul.  I have to listen to comfort books to go to sleep because escapism is the only way I‚Äôm not in a constant state of near panic\n\nI have like an extremely small window at night when everyone else is asleep where I finally feel like I can relax a little bit because noone's expecting anything from me. I tend to stay up too late to maximize this period, thus stressing myself out more the next day by being sleep-deprived. Rinse repeat. Not a fun existence\n\nOne of the VPs at my job told me I was doing a great job and even though I felt good for a moment I instantly felt dread because I‚Äôm afraid of everything.¬†\n\nDude after I got treatment I was walking around the store and noticed for the first time in like 10 years I wasn‚Äôt on edge humming w/ background anxiety. It was wild\n\nGood to hear. What treatment did you get?\n\nYeah seems shitty\n\nGoing through this right now, been referred to an occupation therapist but the breathing techniques and mindfulness only helps so much, go to bed okay ish from severe exhaustion from being in fight or flight all day then wake up and repeat the exact same thing\n\nI have literally grieved for the person I could have been without this constant anxiety. I could have been so much more, I do the best I can now but I‚Äôm so limited\n\nYou tried meds?\n\nGAD is so terrible. I have had it most my life and was just diagnosed a few years ago. I am a 41 year old male. It just got so bad and debilitating the older I got. I now take meds and do therapy. They help but it is a constant battle of up and down. My mind is always restless and I am always on hyperactive or super down. I also have bad ocd and depression as well. It's like a constant spiral and feels like I am never who I was before. My whole life has been flipped upside down and I now have to learn how to deal and cope with all this. Before I would just bottle it up and not really talk about it. That's how I was raised  wear a mask and pretend that everything is ok. Life sucks major ass sometimes. Thankfully my family and gf have been very supportive.\n\nYou came to the right place, just diagnosed a year ago at 30 but I‚Äôve had trouble since at least middle school but it got to a point where the depression and anxiety were so bad I had to see a therapist, where I realized about all the trauma I had that I had just dismissed for a decade+\n\nIt has helped me a lot, just remember you aren‚Äôt in danger, even if your brain is telling you that you are\n\ntoday on my way to work i was like my anxiety is with me everyday as if i have something like an interview or an exam and my body needs to understand TO RELAX\n\ndefinitely, right now I'm feeling like the world is going to end and a horrible feeling of discomfort/insecurity but I'm trying to deal with it in my own way until an hour passes and I'm back to normal\n\ni‚Äôm constantly fighting myself in my head with GAD and ADHD T_T give me a break!! i am debating and shit before every move and yet i still act impulsively??? im my own worst enemy\n\nretweet\n\nI really feel like my GAD is caused by my candida overgrowth but I have planned steps that I need to go through first.  Was ready to start reducing benzo then wife got really sick with sepsis and it really kicked up my anxiety ü§í\n\nHi, if anyone wants to, could someone explain GAD to me? I want to understand it better. I just want to know what it‚Äôs like. I don‚Äôt have it, but I have social anxiety and OCD. I feel like I can relate to some symptoms on the symptom checklist I took and people always tell me I worry more than usual. I‚Äôm not trying to say I have it or anything, because I don‚Äôt think I do considering how others talk about it (I wouldn‚Äôt say I worry as much) but there was a point where I did think so. Anyway, I‚Äôm just curious and if anyone could tell me about it, I‚Äôd appreciate it.\n\njust think about your anxiety but for everything in ur life, even the small things and you can‚Äôt control them or change how you think and it‚Äôs every second of every day\n\nThanks for responding! If you don‚Äôt mind, could you give an example? Only if you‚Äôre okay with it, I understand that it‚Äôs ‚Äúgeneralized‚Äù but I just want to have a better understanding. Anyway, that sounds difficult. I have contamination OCD so I usually worry about contamination 24/7. It gets really exhausting, I have to think before doing every action and am at home all the time except when I have therapy. So I think I can get it, but I just don‚Äôt know what specific things it is.\n\nspecific as in, thought loops are mostly the same and you get alot of intrusive thoughts that aren‚Äôt even yours, and your body is in constant anxiety mode even when ur calm, it lingers in the background and still doesn‚Äôt feel very great, and even if you try to stop thinking it will never occur. so ur stuck inside ur head feeling scared most the day and then the stuff on top about thinking all the time makes it difficult to live with.\n\nSorry for the late response! It sounds like your GAD is severe, I wonder what a more milder version would be like? Anyway, thanks for replying and I wish you well.\n\nI always thought the same and then I got anhedonia and now I can safely say that is/was my worst mental illness (symptom) ever. Feeling no emotions at all is far worse for me than feeling all negative emotions and very little positive emotions the whole time. (Even tho it was my wish for the longest time to feel nothing instead of emotional pain.)\n\ni feel this, it‚Äôs endless\n\ni can feel u 100%, everytime good shit happening, in my anxiety brain would eventually expected the worse outcome ahead. So, technically it snatch my happiness away.\n\n22M- just started smoking and vaping pot. Big game changer! Like MASSIVE. Haven‚Äôt really had bad anxiety at all if any!\n\nwait till you get addicted it enhances it by a lot\n\ni did about 4 times‚Ä¶it does help rewire your brain‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not convenient going in there all the time‚Ä¶so i think i might rent one for month‚Ä¶i hate this anxiety‚Ä¶its like everyone else is living and i am watching from the outside‚Ä¶good luck\n\nIt‚Äôs literally fucking over yourself. It‚Äôs hell in your mind and I hate it when people say, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôll just go away! :DDDDD‚Äù NO IT FUCKING DOESN‚ÄôT. Mental breakdowns every day, feeling on edge, trust issues (not with everyone that has GAD, but with me at least), etc. I wish I didn‚Äôt have this. I wish I can be a normal person (it doesn‚Äôt help that I get bullied every year for being myself, a weirdo at heart.)\n\nGAD really is just so fucked. I‚Äôm what my therapists call a ‚Äúsubconscious masker‚Äù, so I went most of my life disbelieving the fact that I had anxiety at all, and tried to label it something else because it never had an inciting incident. There was never a trigger that set my anxiety off, I‚Äôd simply wake up feeling horrible and being worried about everything. It felt like depression, but what I had to be depressed about, I worked through intently and wasn‚Äôt thinking about at all in my most intense moments of anxiety, and I didn‚Äôt have a clue what was wrong with me. I was at the end of my rope for years over what felt like nothing, and simultaneously everything all at once. \n\nUltimately, I ended up experiencing psychosis/mania at 31, after having never experienced it in my life prior, or even anything close, due to the sheer intensity of the anxiety that I was still pressing to say I didn‚Äôt even have. Took a year of working with psych for them to say ‚Äúlisten, I know you don‚Äôt believe you have it, but humor me and go on this relatively light anxiety med, and we‚Äôll see if it helps even a little‚Äù. \n\nBasically, the rest is history. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúcured‚Äù per se, but thanks to the med, when I experience anxiety now, it‚Äôs because something is happening that warrants it. Not because I merely woke up and opened my eyes in the morning. Finally leaning in to therapy plays a massive role as well, but the right med was like a light bulb, or some kind of brain hack that I‚Äôd been missing all along. \n\nI hope everyone finds some form of help. Trying to do it on my own nearly took me out of the game altogether.\n\nHi, can I ask what the med was please? Thanks\n\nOf course. I take Buspar (buspirone). I didn‚Äôt list it because I didn‚Äôt want to act like it‚Äôs a miracle med, since everything works different for everyone, but this really does the trick for me, and isn‚Äôt a med that leads to dependence. It did have about a 2-4 week lead in before I really felt any impacts though.\n\nCheers Levi. Appreciate you letting me know. üëçüèº"

    "body": "I'm scared to die. I know I'm young so it might not happen for a while, but i'm still afraid. I keep having a thought that goes, \"you'll never know when you'll fall asleep and never wake up.\" I feel like that's the best way to die, but that's also bad because you never really know when it could happen. That's what scares me. You never know when you'll die.\n\nI can't sleep now because of this. It's currently 2am and I have school in the morning. Finals are starting soon and I know I need sleep. But this thought won't leave my brain. It's making me afraid to sleep. Anyone else have these thoughts? How do you make them stop?\n\nEdit: I'm going to add something. I'm scared of death and what might be on the other side. But I kinda just hope that I see my family when I die . I don't really care what else there is. I mainly just want to see my grandpas because they passed when I was young and I want to know them. What I really am afraid of is the feeling of dying. Like what does it feel like as you're dying? Is it painful? peaceful? Scary? are you even aware it's happening? ",

    "all_comment_text": "Me. Lol death is my biggest fear. And what funny is Death if the only thing guaranteed in life.\n\nIt‚Äôs the idea of permanent non existence that gets people (non religious) I understand religious people many will be very confident of consciousness post death however for a person who doesn‚Äôt believe in this it‚Äôs the concept of eternal nothingness with regards to being unconscious that drives the fear of death IMO. \n\nIn relation to this sub on Reddit ironically death with no afterlife guarantees no anxiety. \n\nPre life / before birth = No anxiety was experienced \n\nDuring life but asleep without dreaming = No anxiety was experienced \n\nPost life / after death = No anxiety will be experienced \n\nSo for the non religious anxious person, if you want a little bit of solitude then take comfort in the likelihood that anxiety is guaranteed to end one day. \n\nBut hopefully our anxiety ends DURING OUR LIFE because we beat it as conscious sentient beings.\n\nYou worded your reply beautifully and quite poetically. Thanks for adding this perspective to the WWW üòä\n\nI am not religious. I see your point though. I‚Äôm not afraid of an after life or not. I am afraid of my body shutting down lol more specifically I am afraid to KNOW that I am dying. I hope it‚Äôs in my sleep or so fast I never knew it came. Lol\n\n[deleted]\n\nI get what you mean! One of my mates said to me we never existed for 13.8 billion years before we were born‚Ä¶ I interrupted him to say ‚Äúwhy do we say only 13.8 billion years before birth?‚Äù Because that number means nothing to something that is not a thing. Before birth is the definition of non existence so I don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt say an arbitrary number of years like 500 trillion years before birth? It means the same in this context. \n\nPeople sometimes counter the argument of death being similar to before birth because you have now indeed been born and experienced life but I still don‚Äôt necessarily see why we can‚Äôt think in a way which floats the idea of an eternal pre-existence timeframe. \n\nIf you have time go on to YouTube and type in ‚ÄòApple in the box theory‚Äô  - just a 2 minute YouTube clip, some people believe life and death is a similar endless cycle.\n\nIn my opinion, being dead is the same as not being born yet. I never had a problem not being born, so why should being dead be any different. I‚Äôve never understood the fear of death.\n\nThank you\n\nWelcome my friend\n\nAnd Taxes\n\nAnd Manchester City cheating their way to the Premier League title\n\nTHIS IS THE ONE! \n(YNWA)\n\nThat's been my worst fear since I was ***NINE*** years old back in 1988.  It's even worse now because I've lost so many of my family members since then. üò≠\n\nI know my time will come at some point.  It could be today...or, it could be in 50 years from now.  But, knowing that day will come when I draw my last breath is absolutely ***TERRIFYING*** to me! üò®üò±\n\nThis is one of so many reasons why I repeatedly wish to go back to my childhood and just be young again.\n\nMe tooooooo ever since I was a kid.\n\nSame! As long as I can remember, I've been terrified of death. As I grow older, my mind goes to \"it's over half over\", or \"someday I'll wonder if tomorrow is the day\"\n\nI relate. I also started worrying around 9 or 10. \n\nI had a health scare recently and it brought all of the panic back.\n\nNot scared of death myself, but im terrified of the death of my family. I cry myself awake constantly dreaming of them leaving me. It gets better, just enjoy every moment you currently can have.\n\nThis was me. Then I lost my baby in 2017 and dad last year. It‚Äôs honestly been one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever been through, but I can tell you as someone who was just like this. You will get through it. You will be ok. Our bodies are made for this.  You can handle it.\n\nI am so sorry.\n\nI‚Äôm so unbelievably sorry. You are so strong‚ù§Ô∏è and so right.\n\nI‚Äôm so, so sorry ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nIm not okay I devloped ocd and ptsd from a similar trauma\n\n I too have both of those things. But we will be ok, I promise. Lean on Jesus and he will walk with you through it.\n\nMajor relate.\n\nI'm just afraid I will suffer or it will be painful. They say that when you are actually going, a peacefulness comes over you. It's some sort of defense mechanism in our brains to ease us as we go. I guess that was from accounts of people who technically died and then were brought back. Sometimes, I get a little panicky because I am a person who was brought to life by my parents, and I have no choice that I have to die someday. I don't know how else to put it.\n\n*Sometimes, I get a little panicky because I am a person who was brought to life by my parents, and I have no choice that I have to die someday*\n\nWell put, and terrifyingly true\n\nIKR?!!\n\nSometimes life just feels like such a unique, unexpected experience...that it almost feels unreal! Like, I didn't ask for it, so I must be special because I was given a life to live and experiences to feel for SOME reason. Even if it is all just one really complicated chemical reaction...there HAS to be some reason I am here and why I was chosen to experience this whole thing\n\nThe chances of actually being alive and being sentient in this vast dark universe are astronomical, I heard. We are like miracles.\n\nI am curious to know, where was I before I was born?, if it the same place I go when I die? I wasn't there for billions...possibly trillions of years..and it felt like a single moment. I hope death isn't like that though, I am in no rush to find that part out. Just had a genuine panic attack about an hour ago, probably because of that line of thought...\nWhole body tingling, dizzy, can't breathe, fucking sucks.\n\nIt gets to feel different when you are older. I'm 55. Sometimes, you just get tired. My Mom is 76. She has a lot of pain and has to have another surgery. When you're young, you feel like you have so much to lose. Do things now and enjoy. Maybe we come back as new people or animals. You could come back as a child of a billionaire or a giraffe.\n\nSounds like you need something to take to calm you.\n\nYeah, I have only ever had 2 panic attacks and for some reason I had one last night shortly after responding to this..didn't feel good at all! Thought I was having a medical emergency lol but I am still alive and kicking. I took a few baclofen and that helped calm my nerves a lot, luckily.\n\nUsed to be, not anymore. After lots of reading and meditating i got over it. Its inevitable. It will happen to literally everyone and everything. That should make you appreciate and enjoy the life you have now. Who knows what comes next, but this is real and its now so make the most of it. Absolutely pointless to worry about anything you cant do something about. Gotta retrain your brain and just let go of the fear\n\nBest post I‚Äôve seen thus far!\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nIm in this 365 meditation guide from headspace. And death is now the theme of the meditation. It is supposed to make grateful for thw present.\n\nIf you want i highly recommend \"the untethered soul\" great book and a good pivot point into conciousness, thoughts, etc.\n\nI will check this out thank you!\n\nYes. 31f. It was the start of my anxiety ever since I was very little. Like 6 I started asking questions about it, and ever since then I‚Äôve been a little ball of anxiety. It‚Äôs also the cause of my health anxiety. Sometimes I just lay away at night thinking about it. Or scared to fall asleep bc I‚Äôll die.\n\nYour story is so similar to mine. I know it was the building blocks to my terrible health anxiety as well. It became more apparent once I turned 20 and witnessed a traumatic event and realized there‚Äôs nothing you can do to stop it - if it‚Äôs going to happen now or 65 years from now and I‚Äôll spiral into a panic attack. I am 35f and I will say one positive I have been taking my health much more seriously especially as I see friends and older family or friends of older family developing terrible health issues or dying in their 50s because they we chronically drinking, eating, partying and general unhealthy lifestyles. I want to at least try and prevent somethings if I can üò≠\n\nYes if anything I‚Äôm becoming more and more aware of my health in a positive way and making changes üòä I now I have 2 children and need to be healthy and around a looooong time for them.\n\n\nIt comforts me knowing that someone else the same age is basically feeling the exact same way as I do! So thanks for sharing\n\nI hate to say it but honestly the only thing that worked for me was to just let the thoughts pass. Eventually you‚Äôll be actually tired of thinking those thoughts, and you‚Äôll just stop\n\nSame, I try to think that living forever when the people you grew up with are no longer around is even worse. I just accept that dying is a part of the cycle, everything or everyone that lives will die at some point.\n\nOh you underestimate my brain lol\n\nand how Long does it take. i have been thinking it for a week\n\nI'm over 20yrs in, I'll let you know when I get there...\n\nI don‚Äôt know your mind obv. But what I mean from my perspective is I got to a point in my life where I had tortured myself so much i started thinking about why I think the stuff I do. And it seems like it‚Äôs easier than it used to be to not obsess over negative stuff.\n\nOmg yes. I can‚Äôt even talk about it or hear people joke about it. I‚Äôve been like this since a child and it‚Äôs honestly a huge problem but it‚Äôs the one thing I avoid getting too deep into in therapy because I feel like it can‚Äôt really be helped. Everyone just says you need to accept it but like‚Ä¶ sorry no, I simply cannot. I don‚Äôt want to leave my loved ones or have them leave me‚Ä¶. Alright, now I‚Äôm depressed lol\n\nAfter a bout with cancer at 26, i spent years afterwards panicking and in fear of death. Eventually, through much therapy and mental conditioning (mostly cognitive behavioral therapy). I realized how much of my life i was wasting being miserable, what's the point of being alive if i am going to waste the time i have in misery and not enjoying it. \n\nI accepted the fact that we will all die eventually, and i didn't want to waste the time i had doing anything but living life to the fullest.  I'm 44 now and while i have stumbled a few times along the way, I definitely am living life better now than i ever did back then.\n\nPlz don't misunderstand me - I get being afraid of death. But for me it's different and depends on who dies.\n\nA loved one died? Please kill me now!\n\nBut my own death? Sure it's the end, but I can't think about it when I'm gone. If you nearly died a lot of times, there's a heavy numbing effect.\n\nSomeone else seeing it this way?\n\nNo. I used to be, but I can personally assure you that it's pure love and peace. No fear friend. Imagine the most happy time you've ever had. It's 100x more.\n\nSo you‚Äôve been there too.\n\nFor me, I got to skip the bad part. Before I could even register what was happening (much less feel fear) the perspective changed, and I was suddenly like a small sleepy child who fell asleep in the wrong place, being carried gently off to bed in the strong, loving arms of my caretaker or guardian‚Ä¶ what I can only assume was an angel (they‚Äôre *very* tall). There was no darkness to be found, just contentment, peace, love. I asked to come back, I wasn‚Äôt ready. There was a somber feeling, but they respected my choice. And hoo boy there is nothing quite like the whiplash of going straight from pure everlasting peace to pure pain and misery in every fiber of your being. Takes a while to get through that trauma city. But I wouldn‚Äôt trade my experience for the world. I don‚Äôt want to go back any time soon ‚Äî I want to be around to raise my kids and help people and finish whatever it is I‚Äôm meant to do here ‚Äî but when my final time comes, it‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôm finally going home after a long tiring time away.\n\nSo all I‚Äôll say to OP is this: Give your fears to God. If you don‚Äôt have a relationship with God, I‚Äôd suggest you start there. Let him put people and words in your path to ease this fear of losing life that‚Äôs causing you to actually lose out on life, and let him replace it with peace and acceptance, knowing that this life on planet earth in your meatsuit isn‚Äôt forever. And know that at the end of your earthly life, it‚Äôs not really the end. That‚Äôs just when you level up, and you will finally be able to break free of the meatsuit and its limitations, and your existence and experience will only get exponentially better from there. Forever.\n\nI am terrified of death. Scared of dying and affecting my family, scared of losing my family, scared of everyone dying around me. It's been in my mind ever since I was little and I feel like the older I get, the closer it is and it freaks me out so bad. And some of my friends are all \"I'm not going to grow old, my life will end when I'm still in my prime, I know\" and it just fucks me over so bad. \n\nAt this point I'm just going to try to outlive everyone because I'm just that scared.\n\nIt‚Äôs so worse when you also have health anxiety. Everyday I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll have some disease and I‚Äôm gonna die.\n\nI actually can't wait. Put me out of my misery.\n\nWorking a 9-5, being a wage slave, just feels like you're waiting to die. So, yeah.\n\nIt's not about being a wage slave for me it's the constant battle of the anxiety and depression.  Can't have one without the other and its just fuckin exhausting at this point.\n\nFelt like a verified wage slave in my 40's, 50's and early 60's , but since daily life goes by faster and faster as we age , other things intrude on that supposition. Doesn't make it any less real , just masks it.  I recommend medication. It really helps.\n\nFeeling like you have to work til you are 100 cos you know you won‚Äôt be able to financially afford to retire at 65.  I catch your drift\n\nLMAOOOOOOOOOO.  It be like this\n\nOmgme too\n\nNot really. A year ago I was really afraid of this but apparently my mind made me numb to it because it‚Äôs natural\n\nI am no longer scared of death I guess cos i died twice and am still here. Yeah 2 accidents. \n&gt;\nNo I am not a ghost lol.\nI was scared before though. \n&gt;\nWhat I am more scared of is losing people around me. (Friends/family etc)  \n&gt;\nI have lost alot of friends and family members (ages 2-45)already in this life long before they should have gone due to illnesses they had no control of (heart/lung illnesses)or one it was too late to get help (suicide). \n\nIt is ok to be scared of death but just think of it this way you will be free of pain and people will remember the good of you and will forgive any bad if there was any. If there is any bad right now you still have time to change that behavior\n\nIt‚Äôs all I think about. Im at the point where partially I do everything to avoid injury and then at the same time wonder why does it matter? Why does anything we do matter? What‚Äôs the point of it all?  I don‚Äôt want to die. I want to able to maintain consciousness for eternity. The idea of a lack of consciousness makes me physically ill. Sleep scares me cause what if I die in my sleep like my grandmother?  I‚Äôm religiousish and believe in a higher power but at the same time idk how to feel.  I‚Äôve been this way for like 6-7 months. I‚Äôm ‚Äúonly‚Äù 33 but I‚Äôve seen way too many people my age passing for no good reason. It scares me to no end. You are not alone.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt but now that I have kids yes\n\nEveryone is afraid of death. I went through a bit of an early mid-life crisis last year surrounding death and therapy helped. Through thinking about it for months and months I think I finally accepted it (as much as one can). \n\nWhat was everything like for you before you were born? The good news is that after you are gone is the same unless you‚Äôre religious and believe otherwise. In that case, you‚Äôre in luck.\n\nMe. Knowing that my life is half over really sucks. It's debilitating sometimes.\n\nI used to be. I think I‚Äôm more accepting of it now\n\nYes I used to dread this thought. Also of loved ones dying. It motivated me to live fully. Love with abandon. Don‚Äôt hide yourself from the world. Do it all with compassion. That way, when it is your time you‚Äôll be comforted in the thought that you were your best self to everyone you cared for. Try not to speak venomously- make every parting word one that you would be satisfied with if they died. Got goals? Start working on them now. If you wake in the night when the world is asleep/ write letters or make art to distract yourself from the void with positivity. Hope this helps ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI'm on the fence about it honestly. I have already died before, was dead for six minutes and my experience with it was this; I saw nothing. It was just black. There were no feelings, no bright light, no dead loved ones just blackness like you get from sleeping without dreaming. However, since there was no thought or emotions it was really really peaceful. It didn't feel like anything, I didn't see anything I just simply didn't exist in that moment. And honestly that alone makes me not scared OF death. What makes me scared of it is the knowing I'm probably going to suffer until my last breath. Honestly missing my loved ones and the hobbies I love is another thing I'm scared of. Not like I would miss this stuff when I'm dead but the thought of never being able to do these things or see the people I love again is what makes me \"scared\" of death. Am I afraid of dying? Honestly not anymore. I have come to terms that it's a natural part of life and it will happen one day, probably when I least expect it. I'm afraid of the suffering I'll probably endure while passing away.\n\nI‚Äôm afraid of not living. I have health anxiety from idiopathic neuropathy. It‚Äôs prevented me from being athletic and sometimes walking is painful. I want to live my life but it‚Äôs made my life smaller. Some days I‚Äôd welcome death because I‚Äôm dealing with a diminished experience. I can‚Äôt stand not living.\n\nYes, very much.  I get intrusive thoughts.  In addition to death, I‚Äôm also worried about the process of dying, such as drowning or fire.  Then I start spiraling about my husband and children dying.  My anxiety and specifically ‚Äúhealth anxiety‚Äù has gotten worse as I‚Äôve gotten older.  \nI know we are all going to die.  I know worrying is pointless.  Yet, here I am.\n\nThe fear of death was a huge part of my life, and especially my anxiety.¬†\n\nOne of the most calming things that was said to be by a friend of mine was: \"Every energy on this earth is recycled; why are humans so selfish as to think consciousness is exempt from this rule?\"\n\nI also have another friend who is heavy into simulation theory, and suggested conscious is probably another database, just like the periodic table, dna/rna, etc. where every consciousness has a specific value in a database, and when our value is \"hit\", we become conscious in that body.\n\nThese are the types of thoughts that give me enough hope that it's not all just going to go end eternally.\n\nI‚Äôm not afraid of instant death, but a slow death like long hospital stay where I deteriorate ya terrifying\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhat‚Äôs wrong?\n\nToo much is wrong.\n\nYou‚Äôre in a stressful time right now, finals looming and can‚Äôt sleep‚Ä¶ know that you‚Äôll get through it and be resting easy soon and just have heart. You‚Äôll be okay.\n\nAt age of 74 and many health issues , I wonder  every day if this is my last day here ?  I do take an anti anxiety drug every day so this thought is not a constant loop playing all day.\n\nI can relate, I was so scared and still am. \nJust know that you‚Äôre definitely not alone in this. That‚Äôs the most comforting thing, everyone who has lived has also died, physically that is. And I do believe that, aligned with the energy cannot be created nor destroyed, a part of us will live on forever.\n\nDude yesss‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm (currently) terrified of dying! I hate it. It can consume my thoughts and can make me feel very existential. It‚Äôs my 2nd greatest fear next to going insane haha (but that‚Äôs another battle)\n\nI‚Äôm hoping it is something that will dull in time but I‚Äôm 33 and I‚Äôm not gunna wait to feel numb about it instead I‚Äôm practicing mindfulness and CBT as well as learning to understand different approaches to death (which can be hard as an atheist) \n\nIt‚Äôs important to ground ourselves and I think getting in touch with nature and practicing staying present is imperative to coming to peace with oblivion.\n\nIf death is inevitable, which it is, don‚Äôt spend the short time you have on earth worrying about when it will happen. You can‚Äôt change the fact you will one day die or when it will happen, so make the most of the time you have.\n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm as scared of dying as I am of just not knowing when and how it‚Äôs going to happen. It does irk me that I will probably never know even after it does. But, I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to care when it does. So, there is that. If you‚Äôre as old as me and you‚Äôve ever watched the Sopranos to the end‚Äî you‚Äôll probably have a good understanding of how I perceive death and why it‚Äôs upsetting.\n\nI think I‚Äôm more afraid of when it‚Äôs going to inevitably happen to someone I care about. I don‚Äôt like thinking of people that way. So in the grand scheme of things, if I ever had to choose between myself and someone I love dying, I‚Äôd probably lose any unease about it in an instant. Which leaves me to wonder if that is an ultimately selfish action or not. Anyways, it‚Äôs a hard to describe feeling.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt afraid until my aunt died very slowly, painfully, and unexpectedly. Then it hit me that you really can GO whenever, there‚Äôs no rhyme, reason, fairness. I‚Äôve been terrified of dying and of my loved ones dying ever since then. I used to work about 45 mins to an hour away from home and some days my anxiety about dying in a car accident to/from work would be so bad that I‚Äôd cry the entire car ride. Each and every time I left for work, I would look back at my fianc√© with so much sadness in my eyes as I was walking out the door because I was so anxious it could be the last time we‚Äôd see each other! I‚Äôd cry at work because I was so far from home that if an emergency happened, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get there in a timely fashion. I have laid awake petrified, thinking that I need to be awake in case my fianc√© stops breathing in her sleep. I‚Äôve started working closer to home, so my anxiety has decreased slightly. I also go to therapy regularly. Fear of death still consumes my thoughts daily, it just hasn‚Äôt paralyzed me or broken me down in a while. I‚Äôm trying to accept it, but how can you?\n\nThe scariest thing about death for me is:\n\nWhat if it‚Äôs just blackness!?\n\nThe one word that no one can comprehend,\n\nFOREVER.\n\nTry to think about how long that is.\n\nWhat if it‚Äôs eternal blackness!?\nIf god is not such a thing.\nWe are just a germ that grew on a rock and when we die we slip in to blackness‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.\n\nFOREVER.\n\nyeah but ur not gonna have a brain to comprehend all of that so i think its gonna be fine.\n\nAre you aware of what sub you‚Äôre in, sir? \n\nCause this won‚Äôt help anyone who reads it.\n\nJust think of it like your best happy dream ever without the blackness.\nLike what was your happiest time (think of that time)\n\n[removed]\n\nThe only thing that is constant is change. You can never say for sure if you will or you wont get to do the things you want to do. Don't lose hope. This sickness that we have is curable. There is a light at the end of this long dark tunnel we're in.\n\nI highly suggest watching NDE's on YouTube (Near death experiences). This has helped me SO much I can't even tell you. I've been obsessed with death since giving birth three years ago.\n\nI used to be terrified of it, but I have recently had some paranormal experiences lately that have given me some comfort as to what comes after this.\n\nCare to share?\n\nI have this too. You‚Äôre too young, you didn‚Äôt specify if you have any health issues. People don‚Äôt just die in their sleep &amp; never wake up without underlying health issues/old age. The only comforting thing is that every person on Earth has to accept it eventually &amp; tons of people are scared too. It‚Äôs not worth thinking about when you‚Äôre so young. Save it for later. It‚Äôs really exhausting. Enjoy being young right now because health issues will come with age. Unfortunately people are forced to be strong. It sucks.\n\nI'm affraid of death also. Not the dying part but the darkness that will last forever when i'm dead. I don't like that shit\n\nI am not scared of death, but I am scared of dying. If i die i want to go quick as possible\n\n‚ÄúYour death won‚Äôt happen to you, it‚Äôll happen to your family and your friends‚Äù  (I always wanna die sometimes, the 1975) \n\nNihilism is pacifying for a moment, and maddening at the same time. I‚Äôm not sure if this is comforting, but it‚Äôs a perspective I‚Äôve appreciated. \n\nFearing death is a condition as old as time. I sometimes think it‚Äôs the point of the whole game, *how well do you carry the knowledge that you will one day die without any knowledge of what happens on the other side?* Some people turn to religion. Some people live preparing for the afterlife, others live in the moment. There‚Äôs no one way to do it, no one can truly say they know what death is like. That can drive you crazy if you think too hard about it, but I think it‚Äôs beautiful and a great equalizing force in this life: no matter who you are, you will not escape death. \n\nI‚Äôve made friends with my fear of death. I‚Äôve made peace with the fact that I will never get a satisfying answer to what it means. I grew up catholic, and I do hold on to some of those beliefs about death because they are comforting and make me feel connected to my loved ones who have passed. But I‚Äôve also grown comfortable knowing I don‚Äôt truly know anything, and it is possible that *none of it is true.* For that predicament, I turn to my man Kurt Vonnegut: ‚ÄúLive by the the foma (harmless untruths, bittersweet lies) that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy.‚Äù (‚ÄúCat‚Äôs Cradle - highly recommend reading.) \n\nI hope you don‚Äôt spend too much time in this life feeling anxious over this, you can‚Äôt do anything about it. As for how to handle the fear, I like Elizabeth Gilberts advice, I‚Äôm paraphrasing: fear is going to be there, and actually serves a purpose (keeping you safe) it is a welcome comrade along for the ride, but it doesn‚Äôt get to make any decisions.\n\nThe feeling of not knowing when it happens is kind of scary. I‚Äôm not scared of dying so much. I imagine it as a great rest. I believe in the afterlife though, and it gives me comfort to know I‚Äôll be able to see friends/family one day\n\nRight now i just find it kind of pointless to worry, if that makes sense? Like, death is the one guarantee in life, why spend your life worrying about when it‚Äôs going to happen? You are wasting time now worrying about the when‚Äôs \n\nDeath is a natural process and the natural cycle of life. If is not unheard of to be scared. Many people are.\n\nI can‚Äôt help you 100%, only thing i can tell you is to ask yourself why you are scared. Acknowledge that it will happen to everyone one day. See a therapist if thr thought is so consuming that you‚Äôre not sleeping.\n\nMy manager took her own life a couple of years ago. She was struggling with anxiety and depression. She was a motorcycle enthusiast and wore her Harley Davidson jacket everywhere. \nWhen she passed away, guess what colored birds started appearing everywhere in my parks, forest preserves, etc? \nOrange and black birds! They literally all look like they are wearing tiny Harley Davidson jackets! \n\nI say all this because, I believe that there is life after death. There is a divine Creator. There is something or someone that created this universe. And they are empathetic and good and loving. \n\nWithout diving too deeply into religion or spirituality, my best advice is to remember that you are here for a reason. Your soul and your existence will forever make its mark on the world. Every good deed you do will make someone‚Äôs day and make your day as well. You are the creation of something much bigger, and when we all die one day, we will all go back to the one that made us and made all of this world possible.\n\nWhile we are alive, just make your life count. Do good things, study in school, make friends, be a better you, and make your mark on this world while you can. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI‚Äôm more afraid of not living the life I wanted. I‚Äôm working hard to get there but I‚Äôm constantly worried I will die in a car wreck or some misfortunate occurrence will find my way while I‚Äôm working on it.\n\nI totally get it, I‚Äôm going through the same! I have a kid and my biggest fear is not being in his life that give me sooooo much anxiety about death!\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of death, I just don‚Äôt wanna be around when it happens.‚Äù\n\nI used to be paralyzed with death anxiety (having panic attacks back through my very young years), but when I really thought about it, there was eternal nothingness before my life, and that was just fine with me. There's a Mark Twain quote that helped put me into that state of mind:\n\n*I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.*\n\n  \nWhat makes me most anxious is suffering or illness. But death? I can do death. I've done it before.\n\nThis was/is me‚Ä¶ best things that have helped me in all honesty is finding some kind of spirituality - it‚Äôs my own thing but it just helps me to feel better. I was hypnotized where I experienced myself dying in other lives and it was very peaceful and freeing. I still have anxiety about it but it‚Äôs easier to cope with now. Oh and THERAPY haha\n\nDeath used to be my biggest fear ever! I read the book Journey of Souls by Michael Newton and it has really helped me so much!! I honestly kind of feel like its changed my whole perspective on life.\n\nYes. I think it is pretty common with anxiety. I‚Äôve been afraid of dying for a good 25 years to various extents.\n\nOddly it‚Äôs one thing I am not afraid of at all. I am terrified of my loved ones dying of course. One of my biggest anxieties is getting into a car accident. I had a little death fear but my mom died in February and since then I have zero. I will either get to see her again or there will be nothingness.\n\nI don't want to miss a second of my kids' lives. The thought of this life ending isn't great but the idea of not being there for my kids is something I can barely live with day to day. It's about 85% of my anxiety I think\n\nIn general, no. I do find it to be upsetting of course, I have both my parents and knowing that they will die is difficult to wrap my head around what happens after I face that inevitable loss. I‚Äôve had people in my life who have had long battles with cancer and the process of dying and  not knowing if I (or anyone) will be comfortable, or able to communicate and have any decision in how they die creates a bigger feeling if fear, not having the finances to die in peace üò≥.  Sudden death is tragic of course. \nSo death in of itself I‚Äôm at peace with (thus far) but dying and possible suffering if myself or anyone is scary üíØ\n\nDeath not so much, dying yes. So many scary and painful ways to go out.\n\nim not afraid of death, I live and whatever happens, what does terrify me is that something will happen to my family, loved ones/friends, that does scare me very much.\n\nit makes me spiral SO BAD. it causes sheer terror to think about LOL\n\nNot really infact I would say that death comes as a friend especially in your old age I mean think about it this way would you really want to be a 90 or 100 year old with extremely bad eye sight if not almost blind can no longer walk on your own and so shriveled up you can barely speak and let‚Äôs face it probably in a nursing home because it‚Äôs hard to deal with a person that age.\n\nAlso I‚Äôve been around death since I was a baby no joke my dads side of the family has a long history of advanced forms of cancer that ends up killing them off at young ages as well as also heart problems that gradually get worse as they get older and by the age of 50 or 60 usually end up dying of sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nmeanwhile my moms family has a history of Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia so either way you look at it I will die eventually if you fear death it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt been around it much to realize how common and unstoppable it is you will die I will die our friends and family we‚Äôll be dead one day I will be a embalmed corpse in a casket there‚Äôs no stopping it.\n\ndo I think about it yes does it bother me a little‚Ä¶yes but not to anxiety levels of fear and panic just more of a deep thoughtful experience thinking of what it will be like and accepting it only hope is I die of something very sudden like a massive heart attack in my sleep and go peacefully no pain no brain damage from Alzheimer‚Äôs just peaceful sleep.\n\nYes, I am terrified of death for two reasons:\n\n1. I‚Äôm afraid of burning in hell / suffering for all eternity \n\n2. I‚Äôm afraid of leaving my daughter alone without me (she‚Äôs only 3.5 right now. Hoping I can hang on til she‚Äôs an adult at least.)\n\nUsually when the fear of death takes over I listen to anything by caitlyn doughty of ask a mortician on youtube. She has a very comforting way of talking about it that helps. She has a midnight gospel episode that was a good watch/listen too. It doesn‚Äôt always help, but it has helped me a couple times!\n\nI try to think of myself as a biological experiment who is lucky enough to exist on this planet at this point in time. I try to think in broad cosmic terms to get over my  little ego. The universe is a huge dance of creation and destruction. It‚Äôs pretty cool and if you frame it certain ways it can lessen the sting of the fear of death.\n\nI‚Äôm not scared of my death but I fear the death of my loved ones, without them my life will have no purpose\n\nEvery single living things will taste death. Welcome to the universe.\n\nSo far I'm only afraid of dying while my pets are still alive.  Because no one can explain to them why they'll never see me again.  \n\n\nDeath at the moment I have no pets?  I think I welcome it. I'm not going into details, but people have done me wrong so much I don't feel welcome on this planet.  Plus I'm ashamed to be human.  Humans do so much harm on and to this planet.  \n\nI also can't wait to find out if there's 'life' after death. I'm not saying I do or do not believe, but I'm very open minded.  It would be nice to see my dead loved ones.\n\nThe way I think about this is to know that the universe existed for over 13 billion years before I got here and will last for trillions more after I'm gone. But while I'm here, I'm going to experience what this life has to offer. Been in love, have great friends, try different foods, travel and experience different cultures, good drugs, skydiving, scuba diving, etc. Stay busy now knowing that death will be peaceful and restful, but I'll enjoy that when it comes. Now is the time to live, my friend.\n\nI had this recently very very much. In another post someone recommended me the book Journey of Souls by Michael Newton. I am reading this now and it helps me believe in the things that (can) happen after death. \n\nTry researching about things like that. Or take up religion. Anything that comforts you that you and your loved ones will eventually be okay. Before and after death.\n\nYes, this is literally what keeps me up at night now. And it makes me super paranoid about my health.\n\nMake peace with death. I learned this a long time ago, accept it, it will happen and it's out of your control, but worrying about it will do no good.\n\nI fear it. I have since my health deteriorated and I developed severe health anxiety. Therapy helped alot but since the birth of my first child in 2022 I'm back to being terrified. \nI am scared of what death is. I think I would find it so much easier to accept if we knew. The thought of nothingness is so hard to comprehend.\nWhat is worse for me now though is the thought of leaving my child while she is young and still needs me. That terrifies me.\n\nI never think it‚Äôs good to offer ‚Äúhere, take this‚Äù over the internet but I had the same thing happen and it wouldn‚Äôt stop and I could not sleep. I started 1) taking NAC (n-acetyl cysteine), which helps curb obtrusive obsessive thinking; and 2) I started repeating things in my head to distract and soothe me from the thoughts. I‚Äôd start by thinking of all the ways I contributed to the world that day. ‚ÄúI smiled at someone at the store. I learned these things so I can use them in the future. I talked to so-and-so,‚Äù and when it ran out, I‚Äôd focus on the things I did that day from the minute I woke up. Eventually I‚Äôd fall asleep. It was hard. It was really really hard. And now when the thoughts start, I immediately imagine it‚Äôs a monster in a box and I shove its head into the box and put the lid on. \n\nI took the NAC on an empty stomach each morning. It truly did help with my bad thought patterns. \n\nI hope it gets better for you.\n\nI'm afraid of death too. I try to not think about it too much. Hugs from a stranger.\n\nSocrates said \n\n‚ÄúTo fear death, my friends, is only to think ourselves wise, without being wise: for it is to think that we know what we do not know. For anything that men can tell, death may be the greatest good that can happen to them: but they fear it as if they knew quite well that it was the greatest of evils. And what is this but that shameful ignorance of thinking that we know what we do not know?‚Äù\n\nNo one knows what happens after we die. It could be the best thing that we will ever experience. It could be nothing at all. I find that meditating and remembering every day that I will someday die, makes me appreciate every day more and not sweat the small things because in the end, it doesn‚Äôt really really matter. Momento Mori.\n\nI think for me, it‚Äôs the process of dying I more so worry about than actual death itself.\n\nI used to be...and then after some personal circumstances realized my time is limited, just like everyone else.\n\nEnjoy the here and now.\n\nHow I die is a big one. I'm not afraid of dying, but I'm afraid of how I die. I don't want to suffer or die a violent death.\n\nI am, I wake up out of deep sleep freaking out about it sometimes.\n\nYes and no. I sometimes want to die but then I also  think about the ppl I love and can't do that to them. I am afraid of dying without my parents bc I've never lived without them, so age kinda scares me.\n\nI'm drawn to death, unfortunately. The fear of death has never been present in my life. I see death in a very unhealthy way. I have a desire to die frequently, but I won't act on it.\n\nHave you ever watched the movie \"Ready Player One\"? It's not a movie related to anxiety, but one of the main characters (the old video game creator guy) dies. And then...at the very end of the movie, he has a line talking about his anxiety. He says, \"I spent my whole life afraid - up until the day I knew my life was over.\" Basically, he was always afraid. But once death actually came for him, his fear left him. I know it sounds silly, but when you listen to it in the movie, it's so powerful and really spoke to me.\n\nI‚Äôm afraid of the process of death more than death itself.\n\nAs someone who died and came back (like really, I should've died, there's absolutely no way I should've come out of that alive but somehow..) all I gotta say is this...\n\nYou should fear not living, far more than death.\n\nYou're not alone. Stay safe, take care, and don't forget to live.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, close to the end of the cold war I used to fear the nuclear apocalypse. It didn't worry me during the day, but in the early hours of the night I'd wake up and look out my window at central London, and think my god it's still there, there are no mushroom clouds rising golden into the night.\nNow I'm old, I'm afraid of life, of outliving those I love, that maybe they'll have accidents or get cancer or something, and even if they don't of seeing them age and become old and imperfect themselves.\n\nI think you‚Äôre suffering an irrational/OCD fear of death called ? Thantophobia. ¬†It‚Äôs awful for I‚Äôve had it and still have odd flare ups of it. ¬†See a Psychiatrist soon for treatment including a Psycho Therapy session.\n\nMy fear of death came on strong after my grandma died.¬† Right around then, a few other people I knew passed away too, all bunched up together.¬† It threw me for a loop.¬† I started asking myself all these big questions: what's the whole point of life anyway?¬† Is there a God out there?¬† What even happens when we die?¬† It scared me for a long time.\n\nThese days, I'm still figuring things out, but the fear isn't as intense.¬† It took a while, but I'm coming to terms with death being a natural part of life.¬† Sure, the fear might pop up sometimes, but it doesn't control me anymore.¬† In a weird way, it even makes me appreciate life more.¬† It makes me focus on the relationships I have with the people around me.¬† Maybe the fear will never fully disappear, but by facing it head-on, I feel a lot calmer and more accepting of death.¬† It's not something I obsess over anymore.\n\nabsolutely, it's something that's unknown and sometimes overwhelming to even wrap my head around, probably one of the first genuine fears i remember developing. I like to think that i'm so scared though because I love my life and friends and family so much, which is a little comforting to me in a way. it's only scary because I love and am loved so much, I couldn't ask for something better than that ü•≤\n\nAs a Christian I am not afraid of what comes next, I look forward to it,  but yeah the whole act of dying is scary for sure. The unknown of it all.  Anxiety has a lot to do with learning how to be OK with uncertainty. \nI just went through the death of my father a year ago and he died over period of a few weeks. I kept asking him if he was in pain or needed anything and he would say no. He stared off in the distance and said Jesus. So I think your body just kind of kicks in and knows what to do.  I think God will be there. Death is one of those things that are somewhat uncertain/unknown and out of our control as to how and when so we can‚Äôt really let it dictate our lives. I find comfort in the millions of people who have gone through it before me. If they can do it, I can do it. Our bodies know how to do it. We have a merciful God who will also be there to walk us through it. That being said, if I was not a follower of Jesus,  I would be terrified. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be separated from God for eternity.  Not a good place to be.\n\nI think once you realize what‚Äôs on the other side of death you‚Äôll be at peace. For me, it‚Äôs Jesus, my grandma, my grandpa, mother in law etc. I used to stress over it and cry about death. But I then realize there is absolutely NOTHING I can do about it.\n\nNot afraid to die, just afraid to hurt the people I leave behind.\n\nI don't worry about dying, I aint died yet how could I be scared of it? Idk what it even feels like.\n\nI don‚Äôt know. I am more scared of dementia, paralysis and such. More like, how I end up dying &amp; who I will be leaving behind. Sometimes the unknown scares me, but the more jaded I become at our current existence as humans, the more difficult unit gets imagining it getting worse.\n\n  \nIf it‚Äôs bad, I‚Äôd suggest spiritual practices (But please don‚Äôt become radicalised).\n\nI died twice once. Ask away.\n\n[removed]\n\nI remember a lot. Death itself is very natural feeling. It's not a shock at all. The journey is timeless, and the destination was comforting.\n\n[removed]\n\nWell, I had a heart attack as a side effect of a rare form of blood cancer. That's the simple version. One moment I was finishing a shower,  the next I was on the floor and we were calling an ambulance. I died the first time in the ambulance. \n\nFirst the pain ends. Then you do, and nothing feels more natural. It's okay to go, and you simply know that. \n\nI didn't feel anywhere. Then I felt everywhere. Then I was myself again but different. I could see my life, my choices, the choices of others, and understand why it all was the way it is.\n\nEmotions aren't really a thing. You know of them, but I didn't feel anything directly. Death is pretty static. It's a state of being, but it's not anything like life.\n\nLife is better, I think. Life is kinetic and interactive in ways death can not be.\n\nSo I'm glad to be here now, but I certainly don't fear going back.\n\n[removed]\n\nI was 36.\n\nAll of the above. \n\nSeeing isn't how I would put it. It's more a sensing of the thing; being aware of it in all it's aspects. \n\nSadly, no. Clarity faded pretty quickly admist the clamor of just being alive. I do feel like part of me was left back, while another was unlocked. \n\nI am an atheist, so I definitely believe in free will, and I don't see any reason why reincarnation couldn't be a thing, I just don't have any proof of such myself.\n\n[removed]\n\nCongratulations on being the first to question any of it. One should. \n\nOnly one thing makes me believe that I was really somewhere else for a while, and that is the fact that they couldn't get me to come back. I died twice, they fixed the problem at the er and had me stable... but I didn't regain consciousness. A nurse climbed on the bed, put her knees on either side of me, and proceeded to slap me back into existence. \n\nI really didn't want to leave where I was. \n\nWhen I came back Everything hurt in such a weirdly good way. Like the nerves were running checks.\n\n&gt;Is there any reason to believe that what happened to you wasn't produced by your brain in an extreme state?\n\nNope. I'm with you one this one. We have no proof. I didn't bring any back with me. \n\nI should also mention that I LOST a good chunk of my living memories when this happened, so who's to say it wasn't all my brain panicking/responding to the lack of oxygen? \n\nThe experience surprised me, after all, I was expecting nothing. Instead I found comfort and continuance. You speak of being shaped by our experiences while living and I have found that it continues after death, just in a completely different way. A distant, after the fact, sort of way, but it's there. \n\nWe are biometric machines. All that energy goes somewhere. Now I know one of the possibilities. I'll not claim it's the only one just because it was mine.\n\nYou didn't die. Your heart stopped and you lost consciousness for a while. Your brain was alive the whole time, as there is no coming back from death.\n\nDeath its self? Not all! \nI‚Äôm afraid of being in a lot of pain to then die. I hope it‚Äôs instant. But I am worried about those around me dying. That‚Äôs the biggest worry\n\nDeath is my number 1 fear and the cause of a lot of my anxiety/panic attacks. I more worry about all the possible tragedies or accidents that could occur. I just have to try and ground myself before it gets past the turning point.\n\ni used to be. Now i really wouldnt mind it! But im still finding my purpose or something like that‚Ä¶\n\nMy biggest fear by far is the death of my mum. I've already lost my dad, so I've only got my mum left.\n\nHappens to me all the time. Sometimes I‚Äôll just sit up at night thinking &amp; scared to close my eyes &amp; go to sleep bc what if I don‚Äôt wake up. But I mostly panic about others dying.\n\nYes I am too. And the pain of it.\n\never since i was little until now id have panic attacks about it. i thought reading this thread would help to know im not alone in my fear but nope, just got another panic attack\n\nMy faith in God helps me have peace. Hope you find comfort.\n\nI am afraid and hope not suffer when it's my time to go. But I'm at ease if I die peacefully with my family, especially my daughters, around holding my hands.\n\n\nBut what adds comfort, ironically, is that there is something after death. What is it? I don't know, but I know there is.\n\nThe only fear I have of dying is the pain and trauma that would cause my loved ones, that‚Äôs really it. \nAs far as my loved ones dying, that‚Äôs a reoccurring intrusive thought I have, yes, and it‚Äôs pretty scary. The grief and how I would react to say- one of my own children passing. I don‚Äôt think I could bare the pain.\n\nEach and every moment you are alive is a bonus and a blessing. You are already winning in life if you can see, hear, feel things. You have family and friends, you have a job. Life is very fragile. Babies just few months old get cancer. I don't know how to put it. But we all are already blessed to be alive, to have felt loved at some point in life, to have had friends and family. Had a safe place to sleep, good food to eat. Make sure to make most of the moment, whenever thoughts of death come to your mind...\n\nI'm afraid of what I'm going to miss.lol, it's really funny if you think about it. I've always follow science and physics, done it all my life. I get really blown away when advances in science are reached. So that's really what I'm afraid of.\n I'm sorry about this anxiety you are having and didn't mean to make fun of it I'm hoping you're going to do well ,you worked hard all year now it'll come to fruition.\n\nI never thought much about death until my dad died, then it became a fear. The only positive reframe that makes me feel better is that whatever‚Äôs on the other side can‚Äôt be that bad because my dad will be there :)\n\nDying in my sleep! I hope I'm that lucky, I've watched loved ones go in much more horrific ways\n\nI'm so scared of death I became a funeral director. Can't control it so might as well learn about it and understand the process, help others through the process, and learn to cope in my own way by interacting with families who experience loss. These families have no idea that they actually help me just as much, if not more.\n\nYeppp. I have to literally not think about it. I find myself morbidly thinking about it way too much. I want to believe there‚Äôs an afterlife but‚Ä¶\n\nNo. I'm almost 69 and at peace with death and where I'll be after I pass.\n\n21 here, death doesn‚Äôt scare me as what will be left when i‚Äôm gone that does. what will people remember of me, what will be said about me, who will actually miss me in the moments of silence and lonesomeness, who will carry on what i have done in this world? that, scares me.\n\nI'm not scared to die but I'm scared of suffering.\n\nMore now since I lost my mom recently, yeah. I mean I've always been, but it's just been ramped up now.\n\nAll my life, all my life.\n\nNo, not anymore. I believe in reincarnation\n\nI feel you, friend. You should join r/NDE.\n\nPerhaps change the way you approach the thought of death. Life is impermanent. You never know if your next walk in the park is your last. Hold on to this impermanence as a motivator. Stop to smell the roses. Death is just a way to appreciate life. \n\nYou may also consider asking for advice in r/Buddhism.\n\nMarcus Aurelius said that either, there was an afterlife with a benign god, In which case there should be no fear, or there is nothing (which he doubted), in which case there is nothing to fear either, because we will not even know about it. \n\n‚ÄúNo evil is honorable: but death is honorable; therefore, death is not evil.‚Äù ‚ÄîZeno of Citium\n\n\"It is not death that a man should fear, but rather he should fear never beginning to live.‚Äù ‚ÄîMarcus Aurelius\n\n‚ÄúBut death and life, honor and dishonor, pain and pleasure‚Äîall these things, equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us neither better nor worse. Therefore, they are neither good nor evil.‚Äù ‚ÄîMarcus Aurelius\n\nConstantly. Not even for my sake. For my kids sake. My parents both died young and I have to constantly work on that impact on me.\n\nOh yeah but I think it's normal, it's going to happen some way or another.\n\nYup\n\nI HAVE CONVULSIONS THINKING ABOUT IT\n\nDeath is liberation. I don‚Äôt want to die anytime soon, but it‚Äôs going to happen and I‚Äôm cool with that. Have to be it‚Äôs inevitable.\n\nI‚Äôm not so scared of it to be honest, but rather the impact it would have on my surviving family.\n\nNope!! because I was real close 3 times.and it's awesome! You leave your body, Kind of like floating. The first time I was 12. Long story. Second time at a Drs office they gave me too much Nitrous oxide and I left my body and watched them freaking out. Jaja the 3rd time I actually saw the white light. My husband tried to murder me I saw an angel also.¬† I had zero fear and this man is trying to murder me! I felt this incredible incredible peace euphoric love like beyond explanation and I managed to come back to consciousness and I just asked him what he was doing and all of a sudden it's like the lights went on and he jumps back and goes oh my God what I've done so I think you should take me to the hospital and so he didn't for three days I was on this high I mean you think I'd be like flipping out freaking out but I wasn't. And I've never forgotten this experience if it felt like something was downloaded in my head and coming out through my heart it felt like you know a vacuum when you have it on reverse but what was coming out was like incredible awesome like there's a snow words love for everybody and everything on Earth. And I forgave him but I moved on I did not remain with him. Go on YouTube and watch some of the near-death experiences that people have and that will probably make you feel better and not so fearful. And I became a Christian after all of this by the way. Not the money grubbers. And I don't get old crazy like I read the Bible I pray a lot I talked to Jesus a lot plus my daughter did die in fact I have a whole bunch of friends that have died and I don't know I just don't have this fear anymore at all and most people that have ndes do not fear death anymore. Hang in there kiddo. We are eternal beings we last forever not in a physical body but we get another body ones that's even better that's free of pain free of anxiety and no dirt because there really is a place called heaven there's no detrous. There's no decay and it is definitely a real place. Oh and I forgot all dogs and cats go to heaven. For real.\nAnd of course we continue as who We are we don't become nothing because that's not possible. Energy never ceases it only changes form. And that's science. And the form that we change into his looks exactly like us all right we are still us we never stop being who you are you just keep getting better. And I'm not coming back to this place. Because a lot of people believe you leave go to heaven and then you choose to come back well that's a choice fine I'm not coming back.¬†\n\nno i‚Äôm excited for it bc I believe in God and Heaven and I know i‚Äôm going to Heaven. I recommend reading the Word. God is very different from what a lot of people make Him out to be.\n\nHey look.  If you die it  isn't your problem anymore.\n\nI try to use it to fuel my resolve to live a good life, so when it happens I have no regrets. The fear never fully goes away, but that's not a bad thing. It's how you react to it that really matters. Try writing down all the things you want to do and what kind of person you want to be. Who knows, it might help when you think about this stuff."

    "all_comment_text": "[removed]\n\nThank you for the reassurance\n\nSeconding the above response. Sounds like you‚Äôre a part of a good team. I can attest that careless mistakes I made at work have made me far more thorough today and more responsible. So own it, let it hurt a little but then grow from it. Future you will appreciate it later.\n\nPersonally, I can't express how awesome they are being letting you grow and learn from it. I've seen people fired for just using the wrong dashboard.\n\nI‚Äôve screwed up a few times at work and each time it absolutely killed me. But after a day or two, I realized the thing is no one died and it truly is a learning experience. One thing that really helped me was speaking through it with my supervisor and assuring them that I was sorry, it wasn‚Äôt my intentional, and that I will do better. They likely know that but I felt like I had control over it again and made me feel a ton better.\n\nI have to remind myself that no one will die because of this\n\nThis 100%.\nMy wife works in a role that means if she does make a mistake, someone could die (unlikely, but possible).\nI make a mistake, nothing happens. The world keeps turning and no one really cares.\n\nI once sent confidential information to the wrong client.¬†\n\n\nI then had to come clean to the information security team.¬†\n\n\nMost companies have processes in place for things like this because it literally happens all the time.¬†\n\nBe rigorously honest. In retrospect one of the best things I did at one company was a minor screwup which I followed up with a detailed write up of exactly what happened, how I got to the wrong decision, signs that I missed when getting there, and practical changes I could put in place to prevent recurrence\n\nThere are certain things that I hold to be absolute in my career and one of them is a saying I heard: the coverup is much worse than the crime. As in, mistakes happen, but the dishonesty of trying to cover your tracks and hide the mistake is much much worse and shows a character flaw that a) shows a crappy person and b) potentially leave the company open to huge liability because they can‚Äôt respond the the mistake. Owning your mistake rarely gets people fired. Hiding mistakes gets you fired and potentially sued and in some industries makes your criminally liable\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n&gt;I caused a data breach...\n\n&gt;This is from receiving lack of training...\n\n&gt;I thought I did the correct thing by helping a customer....\n\n&gt;...they do not want me to be upset. I just need to learn from this.\n\n&gt;I don‚Äôt deal with situations like this very well....\n\n&gt;they seem very concerned about me.\n\n\nThis sounds as though the main issue is your own disappointment in making a mistake. That you are hurt that you were not 'perfect' at work.\n\nThere are many people inside your mind (not multiple personalities). One of the people is called \"The Critic\" and they are ruling things right now. The Critic is a liar and abuser. \n\nYou are not perfect. Your company seems to know this, but you are not letting it go. It sounds as though you work at a really nice place.  They want you to see this as a learning moment, a chance for you to grow in the company and improve. So, do that instead of letting \"The Critic\" beat you up. Vow to be even better, by learning from this situation. In the future, you might find another newer employee who repeated your mistake. You can then counsel them and build them up, as you were there once.  This can be a good thing if you think about it objectively.\n\nThank you. I know I can be very hard on myself. I will look into how I can work on my inner critic\n\nOne of the things that helps me is to role play. I know it sounds cheesy, but if you have someone you can have act like you do and beat themselves up, you‚Äôll notice that you‚Äôre naturally inclined to comfort them and walk through all the steps of why it‚Äôs not the end of the world.\n\nI needed to this.  Thank you.\n\nYou are not your mistakes. You are what you do in spite of them. \n\nGet more training, find out what happened and what you can do to prevent a similar incident and‚Ä¶.\n\nMove forward. Move forward. Move forward.\n\nYou won‚Äôt be the first and you won‚Äôt be the last. This is all a part of the learning process.\n\nI‚Äôm a manager and BOY have I screwed up plenty in the past! I‚Äôve also had to correct massive screw ups from my team. They‚Äôre still a part of my team. Why? Because, I know, after what we had to go through, it‚Äôs very unlikely they‚Äôll make the same mistake again. Whereas, a new hire probably would.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal. It‚Äôs human. You are human. You will make mistakes. \n\nWhat‚Äôs important is that you are honest with your peers and ask for help as soon as things go wrong. The longer you leave them, the worse things get. The sooner you seek help, the sooner it can be resolved. I know it‚Äôs anxiety inducing, but you‚Äôd have been far less anxious having the problem resolved early than how you‚Äôre feeling now.\n\nAnd you are way too hard on yourself, you need to be kind to yourself instead. Give yourself some thought, love and care. Self-reflect, acknowledge what went wrong, think about how you can avoid making a mistake like that in the future and then‚Ä¶ forgive yourself, and then reward yourself with something nice, like ice-cream.\n\nAs for your interview, this video helped me a ton:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ks-_Mh1QhMc?feature=shared\n\n‚ÄúFake it until you become it,‚Äù you are capable of big things if you believe you are. The power posing isn‚Äôt all that necessary, works for some and not for others. But, how you dress and see yourself can have a huge impact on how you feel.\n\nSo, get cleaned up and dress in whatever makes you feel confident. And go in with your head held high. Going into an interview with anxiety takes guts, and you have plenty! So, don‚Äôt back down, don‚Äôt shy away, you go in there and give them everything you‚Äôve got. The worst they can do is say no. That‚Äôs all. But, you will prove to yourself that you are capable.\n\nThank you so much, I really appreciate this message. I‚Äôll have a look at the link you provided\n\nYou got this!\n\nThat‚Äôs the world of work‚Ä¶ screw ups happen, you learn and carry on.  Nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes.  I‚Äôve fouled up before and it sucks, but you get over it.  \n\nDon‚Äôt beat yourself up over this‚Ä¶ easy to say I know. Is there anything in your past that‚Äôs made you particularly sensitive to things like this?  \n\nTbh, for something like this you need someone to be telling you already that you‚Äôve done nothing wrong, you‚Äôre not in trouble and everyone is going to learn from this and get better otherwise your anxieties are just going to keep on bouncing around.  \n\nStay strong ü§óü§ó\n\nThank you ü©∑\n\nYou‚Äôre most welcome.  Take care ü§ó\n\nI‚Äôve screwed up at work before and I work at a financial institution.¬†\n\nShit happens. Take it as a lessons learned and don‚Äôt do it again¬†\n\nI used to work in a sector where this sort of thing happened more often then you would think due to human error. It happens and I'm sure the manager / whoever spoke with you about it has made the exact same mistake themselves or something similar. \n\nIt's how we get good at our jobs - learn from our mistakes and ask questions where you need. You now know what you did and won't do it again! Even the best of us make mistakes and whilst anxiety makes us beat ourselves up repeatedly over it (I am the same), it's really something that is very common and if anything would highlight a training issue on their end which is why they have let the entire team know (I used to do the same with errors made).\n\nTake a breath and the rest of the day to calm down and then get back to doing what I'm sure is an excellent job :)\n\nThank you, this was very reassuring\n\nDo you think everyone else is perfect? Or that no one else screws up? My man, we ALL screw up. We ALL make mistakes. That is how we learn.\n\nI get how you feel, I've absolutely been there myself. I will say that now with more years under my belt I look back and think \"well I didn't handle that right\" but... I learned and didn't repeat the mistakes.\n\nBeating yourself up will absolutely not help. It's OK to feel bad for a bit - my wife and I call it a \"pity party\" day - but then you suck it up, fake it till you make it, and move forward.\n\nI know nobody is perfect and I am very understanding when other people make mistakes because I know how horrible it feels. Whenever it‚Äôs myself making the mistake I am just so hard on myself. I know I am not a perfect person but my brain gives me a very hard time about it\n\nCrowd strike brought down the entire world last week. Don‚Äôt worry. People forget real quick even if it feels like the most important thing in the world to you right now.\n\nI once transferred a scammer call to a hotel room because I didn‚Äôt verify the proper information. Not a good situation but guess what? I was promoted twice in a one year span after that. Mistakes happen!\n\nOh no lol. Congrats on your promotion!\n\nThanks! I‚Äôm not there anymore. But wanted to give a positive story!! Do the interview üòâ\n\nLearning from mistakes is one way of getting better at what you do, anyone that says they haven‚Äôt experienced that would be lying. \nOnwards and upwards, good luck with the interview!\n\nI know this has already been said but everybody makes mistakes. Your company knows that. It's how you handle the problem that impresses people. From my experience you need to admit the problem, then you either fix it or apologize for it. Then you learn from the experience.\n\nA few months ago I was I interviewing for a position in another department just like you. One of the questions in the interview was about if I made any mistakes lately. I had to tell them how I accidentally missed a step in my procedure and we had to redo the whole process over again. That ended up wasting a solid 24 hours of labour. I am pretty good at my job and I still made a simple mistake. Sure I had to fix it, but others had an opportunity to learn from my mistakes. \n\nOwning up and taking responsibility is pretty impressive in unfortunate situations. Good luck on your interview.\n\nThank you, I will definitely learn from the situation and can apply it to my future work so I guess there is a positive outcome from this\n\nTheir response is very telling‚Äîin a good way. They see and value you, not your mistake. \n\nI know it‚Äôs hard but do your best to view this as a learning experience and nothing more.\n\nI once typed some code for work that was simply supposed to log user logins with their name and email. Except I put the user‚Äôs password in instead of their name. Nobody caught this for months as raw user passwords were logged into this database. When it was finally discovered my company had to scrub 700,000 records from said database. \n\nYour fuck up is nothing compared to that.\n\nI don‚Äôt think I would ever recover if I did something like that. I hope nothing too bad happened to you. I know humans make mistakes but I think the fear of judgement from others is what gets to me\n\nYou made a mistake, it happens to everyone and it sounds like your employer understands this, which is a good thing.\n\nI‚Äôd not be surprised if when you are ready to go back to work at least one of your co-workers tells you about some mistake they made that makes yours look like nothing.\n\nIdentify what went wrong, ask for more training etc and move on.\n\n\"Lack of training\". It seems you're covered, so all good.\n\nIcedpeachte - mistakes happen and everyone in the world has made a mistake. Hell, some of us have made HUGE mistakes. \n\nYour company told you that you should learn from it.  My advice is you learn from it and ensure it does not happen again. \n\nYour interviewer will most likely not know what happened and even if they do, tell them how you learned from your mistake. \n\nI promise you it is not as near as bad as you think it is. The company has already told you their thoughts. \n\nGo back to work with your head held high and crush that interview.\n\nThank you very much!\n\nA good worker will make mistakes, a good job will understand. \n\nAlso there are measures in place in the event something breaks. Heck last week the airports were shutdown. \n\nLastly, realize that you have learned from the experience. Take your time and ask questions.\n\nOne time at work I got caught in the background of a call making a joke about a gang bang. We all make mistakes, there are people who get paid far more than you to worry about things like data breaches caused by human error - it's a part of life. Please be kind to yourself, I promise you're okay - you're not in trouble with anyone, nobody is upset with you\n\nMessing up at work is a daily cycle for me I still don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm not fired yet.\n\nI‚Äôve accidentally switched up crews and sent uncleared people to the pentagon once. It was a real debacle but guess what? I worked there for like four more years. My boss wasn‚Äôt happy but i helped resolve it, and I‚Äôm still alive to tell the tale today and so are the guys I absolutely gave fucking heart attacks to. I was so apologetic and They were understanding with me, even with weapons drawn on them. Mistakes happen to everyone and they will always happen to everyone, you‚Äôre not alone in a fuck up! It‚Äôll be okay!\n\nI recently screwed up at a job I‚Äôve been at for 16 years and I was so mad at myself for days afterwards. I definitely beat myself up over how ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve known how to do this‚Ä¶‚Äù etc. Chin up! Sounds like your department was understanding; which is helpful in itself, but you‚Äôll pick yourself up and learn from it.\n\nThey're more worried about you than the breach.  That says alot.  I hope you feel better soon about everything and definitely take advantage of a counselor.\n\nOne technique I learned back in 2020 is to list all the factors that went into the situation.  Your training was inadequate.  Inadequate training is a sign of a place that is overworked or understaffed or both.  Were you tired?  Had you had a bad day?  Were there other things on your mind?  Had you had a GOOD day, meaning you were excited?  A good day can also impact the situation.\n\nThere can be any number of factors that influenced what happened.  When you write them all down and assign percentages of how much they influenced the situation, you'll find there were multiple factors and your involvement was likely a very small factor in the whole situation.  The percentages need to add to 100%. Thus, you may have made a mistake, but the situation set you up to make the mistake in the first place.\n\nAs for that other interview?  Go to it.  I almost canceled an interview many years ago.  I talked to a friend.  He said \"don't tell yourself no, let someone else tell you no.\"  You had the confidence for that other job before this.  One incident doesn't change that.  Go to that interview.  Don't tell yourself no.  Answer the questions to the best of your ability.  You can still get that position if you want it.  Good luck!\n\nHey, I'm in IT and this happens! I would much rather my coworkers come forward immediately and not be ashamed or embarassed, because that makes it easier for me to do damage control. These things are engineered to trick you. But making a mistake is the absolute best teacher. You don't learn as much if you never mess up.  You'll be okay :)\n\nHello!! I have something maybe useful for you!! \nI have the anxiety and I used to work in information security :) \nMost mistakes like this are a failure of a system. Bad training? (No training)\nPoor communication? \nNot enough controls on your email or other systems? \nProbably all of the above. Usually. \n\nIt‚Äôs not on you. It FEELS like it‚Äôs all your fault of course I do get that (I feel that). But it‚Äôs not you. I promise.\n\nBut also!!!\n\nASK FOR HELP!!! Always. Always. \nYes it sucks. Speaking to people is not my favorite thing. So I do get that. But please, ask.\n\nIf you‚Äôre working somewhere that doesn‚Äôt allow questions - for any reason - and you‚Äôre able to leave - I fully fully advise it. Toxic environments are bad for your brain and teach you over and over that you can‚Äôt ask for help, it‚Äôs your fault etc. (I acknowledge getting out isn‚Äôt easy so that‚Äôs why my corollary here is ‚Äúif you‚Äôre able to!)\n\nAt least your workplace is a great place. And people seem to be so understanding.¬†\nMy work we had a bad day one day, and the boss starts brining in the pitchfork\n\nIt happens. Take that interview. One has no effect on the other. This shit happens.\n\nDon't be so harsh on yourself, you're not perfect. You can do it! I felt pretty identified reading this post. People at my job tell me to take it easy lol. I started therapy to work through this stuff. Perhaps it could be good for you too?\n\nRecently just went to a PD workshop where they gave us the quote \"most crises are not actually crises\". This has helped me refrain my mindset. It FEELS like a crisis to me, but if you step back and look at the bigger picture, it's not a big a mistake as you think.\n\n  \nI was in a similar situation last year when I forgot to place an order for supplies on an event day. Felt incompetent and spiraled. Like you, my coworkers were super understanding and kept repeating everyone makes mistakes. What I took from this is that every mistake is an opportunity to LEARN and IMPROVE. My current organization system for purchase orders wasn't working. I worked to create a new one I would remember, and haven't missed one since.\n\n  \nTry to remember too that companies don't usually care if you make a mistake. They care if you make the same mistakes over and over again and don't take well to feedback/criticism.\n\nYou are a good worker!! Try to relax and know that you are not the first or the last, rest up and get back on Monday and it probably won‚Äôt be brought up again. Hugs\n\nOh no! I'm sick to my stomach for you just reading your story. We all make mistakes from time to time, though I know that may not help the pain you're feeling right now. Just know that these things happen all the time and your work has policies and procedures in place to deal with the fallout because this is such a common occurance. Try to give yourself a break :) when I'm really beating myself up, I try to give myself a time limit for feeling really upset, then it feels a little easier to move on and forgive myself. Sending hugs üíú\n\nI work in cybersecurity, so I know this happens often.  Like you said, they want you to learn from this situation. So take whatever cybersecurity training they give you and just stay vigilant going forward. \n\nAnd they seem to really care for you if they want you to see a counselor.\n\nTry not to worry about this too much.\n\nHi I just want to let you know I‚Äôm an infosec consultant with a couple of decades of experience under my belt. I am probably the most expert person you could ever hope to talk to about this. DO NOT WORRY about this. People make mistakes. People delete files. People fall for phishes. People accidentally send links to things or the wrong email addresses. People accidentally click on ads. It happens all the time, to smart people, to capable people, to contientous people. It has happened to me. It happens to my coworkers who have dedicated thousands of hours of their lives to security. Today it happened to happen to you.\n\nIt sounds like you were social engineered by someone pretending to be a customer. I am a professional ethical hacker and I can tell you that it is EXCEEDINGLY common for these attacks to succeed, for both me and the bad guys. I can count on one hand the number of organizations who have hired me that I haven‚Äôt snagged at least one person. Attackers exploit your willingness to help, a sense of urgency and all kinds of other psychological strategies. These folks have dedicated enormous amounts of resources to infiltrating organizations this way. This is not your fault. Having sat in that chair, having sat in many debriefs for these kinds of incidents, I promise you the folks working through this incident do not consider you untrustworthy or gullible or anything like that.\n\nIt‚Äôs good to get additional training, ask for clarification if you want it, and be cautious so it doesn‚Äôt happen again. The organization may put new procedures and training in place and that is their responsibility - it may even prevent future attacks! In the end, this is why we have incident procedures, and this is why we have antivirus software and security departments and all those other controls. \n\nI hope this puts your mind at ease a little bit!\n\nAs a person in management that deals with resolving data breaches, the end user that allows the breach is never considered at fault. The criminal performing the activity is always at fault. *hug* It‚Äôs okay.\n\nFeels like it's me reading this - lack of training and too anxious to ask for help. Sitting at work everyday feeling like I'm on pins and needles and everyone hates me for small mistakes. Don't worry, your brain is trying to fool you. You matter and aren't defined by your mistakes but are remembered by all the good you do. Good luck\n\nI‚Äôve messed up at work a handful of times as well, each time has cost my company money. Never enough to cause trouble I don‚Äôt think but it stressed me out beyond belief. Best advice I can give you is to learn from it, and moving forward double check everything. If you aren‚Äôt sure, reach out. The anxiety of asking is better than the anxiety of not asking and messing up.\n\nAfter being thrown to the wolves with little training in multiple jobs I finally learned to tell myself it‚Äôs their fault not mine. Hell I even said to my last boss, ‚Äúif I make a mistake because y‚Äôall failed to train me that‚Äôs on y‚Äôall.‚Äù These companies don‚Äôt care to invest properly in their people, not my problem. I do the job I‚Äôm paid to do, nothing more. Try to start recognizing when you‚Äôre ruminating about work off the clock and make a conscious effort to think about something else. I have to practice this all the time.\n\nYou didn‚Äôt get fired right. Your job seems cool with it. So don‚Äôt focus on the ‚ÄúI messed up‚Äù or ‚ÄúI deserve punishment‚Äù mentality, we move on and focus on the next day now.\n\nI made an awful mistake in my job once, it really sucked. I felt embarrassed and many of my colleagues saw/found out, which made it even worse. When I met with HR and management, I came clean and told them why I did what I did and what was my thought process. For sure, I thought I was gonna get terminated. Fortunately tho, they overlooked my awful mistake and were fine that I did not lie and accepted any consequences (the consequences got waived. Ever since then, I‚Äôm still not the best at my job but far from the worst at my job; which I‚Äôm okay with :). It was a really great learning experience for me, not just for the job but as a person with anxiety. I hope everything works out, it usually does :)\n\nThis is so normal to feel this way but you shouldn‚Äôt hide from your feelings! If you need a complete stranger to talk to, I‚Äôm down to listen and offer advice. But dont beat yourself up about it. It‚Äôs ok! You are ok! And, the best part of this whole thing is you still have a job that actually fucking cares about you!!! \n\nTrust me when I say that 90% of companies would have just fired you. This company is good. Lean on them for that support. They got your back. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è with love and light\n\nThe scariest thing my work had us do was carry glass beakers of hot oil worth at least 3x our yearly salary. If an alarm went off that shit would be on the ground and me fired\n\nYou need to know that your reaction to something does not change the outcome to a situation. It's not the thing, it's what you say to yourself about the thing.\n\nat least now you have an answer when they ask you whats the biggest way you screwed up &amp; how did you react/handle it.\n\nI feel for you and understand how your brain can be working against you in times like this, but from what you‚Äôve said I can confidently say everything is going to be okay. Just try to relax and see the positive in this that you now have that experience and will be better at your job now than if it never happened. Be kind to yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nMy manager once sent out the entire company's pay information to everyone. My ex manager accidentally overpaid like 500 people. Both were not fired, but were reprimanded for their mistakes and were told to be more careful. Depending on where you live, when any data breaches happen, they do have to be announced just so people are aware of them and don't make the same mistake.\n\nRemember, you're a human. Shitty mistakes happen and it can feel awful like you're not good enough to work. But you really are just a human, doing human things. We are not perfect. It's hard not to berate yourself. \n\nI've done minor issues myself: Once sent sickness information to my agency (at the time) rather than the correct agency. I think 8 people were affected and they had to be told that their sickness data went to the wrong people. All were fine and just wanted to make sure the wrong agency deleted all the information. They did! And even the Head of Data Security told me it's nothing to worry about, but I cried and had an anxiety attack. I couldn't easily go home at the time so my manager took me to a room and honestly I just cried for ages there.\n\nDon't hate yourself for it. You really are just a human, not a robot. We're allowed to make mistakes. Be kinder to yourself.\n\nHahaha working as an EO in civil service mate I can tell you,\n\nI log these all the time.\n\nDon‚Äôt stress üòÅ as long as your not on your 6 month probation you‚Äôll be fine.\n\nSlap on the wrist really.\n\nHuman errors happen.\n\nChin up bro üåû\n\nI used to work as an Escalations case manager for a huge PC company. Ended up making a massive mistake at work and got filled with dread, ended up quitting the next day. I was a supervisor too. Honestly don't dwell on your mistake, literally everyone makes them. Seem like you have good coworkers. When my shit happened I got screamed at by my boss' boss. Just learn from it and your good.\n\nOne time I permanently deleted our email subscriber list of 56,000 people on accident. \n\nI didn't get fired. It'll all be okay!\n\nUgh this is so me! I empathize with you!\n\nI once caused a half-a-day downtime of a very important application used by thousands of users at my workplace. It broke me for weeks. The first weekend I could not get out of bed and was crying all day. \n\nWe work from home so I only see them 3-4x a year. Coincidentally on that same evening, a team dinner was scheduled. I wanted the earth to swallow me. The thing is, my manager barely brought it up to me? She‚Äôs totally okay with it as she understands it‚Äôs human error. That somehow made it easier for me as no one seemed to be upset about it other than myself. \n\nTime will make it better, but I will never forget how it made me feel. I just had to learn something from it. And that is, ask questions when in doubt no matter how I think stupid I will look. I was too shy to ask for help on which buttons to press/process to follow, and it led to that org-wide interruption instead.\n\nSame. Im unemployed for almost 8months now. I cant get over it. It destroy my image. That company and the client still blames me to this day. Tho nothing major happen since my colleague fixed the issue same day. But still they referring me as a \"hacker\" even thought i did not do anything. I just did the right procedure that we are taught but got unlucky because the one that i talked to is a \"scammer\". But the thing is that scammer uses voice changer and verify all the information needed on the process. But still they blame me. I literally lost my faith to myself and trust people. Its hard."

Make a small mistake or a conflict I can't navigate and then bail. Never had a job longer than two years, most much much less. It's gotten better with age and experience, though.\n\nSame here\n\nSame here. It‚Äôs an awful cycle.\n\nFuck I feel seen\n\nSame\n\nJokes on you I'm too anxious to even start looking.\n\nFucking same.\n\nSame as me, although I left mine yesterday because of prostatitis üòî\n\nBacterial or non-bacterial?\n\nNon bacterial\n\nDm me if you are having difficulty getting it under control. I suffered from it for 3-4 years\n\nThank you so so much, will keep it in mind!!\n\nSecond verse the same as the first\n\nSame here. I feel really bad when I quit my job. It feels like I failed or something.\n\nBut usually, I'm so mentally burned out that I have no choice but to quit.\n\nMood\n\nBe smarter\n\nI‚Äôm the same way.\n\nI feel like I should walk away from mine because I can't cut it anymore\n\nI feel this one deeply\n\nThis. And I e only has mine 3 weeks. Sigh\n\nMy god I‚Äôm in your boat! Like, totally\n\nIt‚Äôs so frustrating\n\nIt‚Äôs really hard. I wonder if I can ever really do it. Coul have had ‚Äòthe career‚Äô - but not really. Ugh.\n\nYeah I had to alter my career plans and I work exclusively in NPs as they seem to be the most flexible. The job I have currently I can bring my dog to work, my boss shares some of the same chronic issues and has her own accommodations, I can work from home twice a week and whenever I absolutely need to, and I get every second Friday off for all my appointments.\n\ncurrently dealing with this. Level 2 tech support, been here a month and was given no overview of how their systems and procedures work but currently getting tickets assigned to me with no clue how to even start aside from what i already know. Management has a ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù on your own mentality. the one helpful guy was just let go due to downsizing. so now im the sole contractor trying to navigate. currently applying to everything i can find.\n\nI miss having a helpful, collaborative team.\n\nI feel we‚Äôre on the same team, at the same job‚Ä¶ So spooky as this is very similar to my experience right now\n\nI had to quit my job. I was a teacher and I was having panic attacks while I was on my classes.\n\nI believe this well\n\nSame\n\nSame\n\nSame\n\nSame here. I really wanted to stay, but every cell in my body was screaming LEAVE (insomnia, eating problems, constant panic attacks and exhaustion). Eventually I had to acknowledge (therapy helped) that I had fought for it but it was not a good fit for me and listened to my anxiety. I still grieve my teacher self sometimes, but I know it was the right thing to do.\n\nFor three years I taught at uni on the weekends but I dread it the whole week. I love teaching and I still dream of doing it for the rest of my life but I really need to step back. It's been a year since I stopped. Last week I went back to sort out some documents and just being there gave me a panic attack.\n\nOmg same\n\nSame\n\nAh I relate to this so much. I have a similar position to a teacher where I have to interact with parents and kids. Were any of you able to go back eventually after dealing with the anxiety?\n\nThat‚Äôs so saddening to hear! I can only imagine how much anxiety being a teacher would bring, I have severe anxiety and I have three kids and always give props to their teachers cause I don‚Äôt know how they do it with all those kids at once ü§Ø did you try seeing someone and getting on some meds? Zoloft helped tremendously! But be careful because once you‚Äôre on its near impossible to come off without losing your mind- literally.\n\nI quit my job because of anxiety a few months ago, I had panic attacks daily and couldn't even relax when at home in anticipation of going to work\n\nI think this is called anticipation anxiety. It also happens to me when I know I have like a Doctor appointment at 3:00 pm I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything like hang out with someone or run an errand until after the appointment.\n\nYess I get this, I had to tell people in my life not to be uncertain about plans bc if they say we're meeting at 6 I'm gonna spend the whole day paralyzed until 6. lol. But yea I found this wasn't that bad in the past with jobs I didn't hate, so finding a job I like is important\n\nI tell my aunt this ALL THE TIME and she still makes it a habit to ask me if I want to go somewhere at the last second, and then has the audacity to get annoyed when I say no. üôÑ\n\nI also love it when she doesn't tell me other people will be there. That's fun üò¨\n\nOh my gosh this is me. If I have anything in a day I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything else.\n\nThis is comorbid with ADHD, btw.\n\nI have been there and now I‚Äôve been unemployed for over 6 months. I hate the feeling of getting home trying to relax but you know you have to go back tomorrow.\n\nI'm so sorry to hear this. I had/have this type of anxiety as well. I just could not ease my anxiety for so, so long at my current job. Literally every day and every 1:1 with my boss would tip me on the edge of a panic attack. Therapy and medication has helped, but it's still a work in progress. But I'm hoping for the best for me and all of you.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that the meetings with your boss would stress you out so much. I'm currently on the other side of this and don't know what to do differently so that my teammate is not getting triggered. I'm kind of this crappy boss and I don't know what to do about it. Would you mind giving me some tips on what would have helped you? All the best for you!\n\nThank you and be kind to yourself. You're not a crappy boss if you're asking how to help your teammate. :) I think everyone is a little different and so are our triggers. It might be a good idea to break the ice with your teammate and ask how they prefer their one on ones. If you decide to make some changes proactively, I recommend explaining those changes. I think a lot of anxiety for me comes from uncertainty and filling in the blanks with my own anxious thoughts.\n\nThis is what helps \\*me\\*, but everyone is different:\n\n* When my boss explains changes in routine. For example, \"I'm moving everyone's 1:1 cadence to once a week because I'd like to be more available for the team to answer questions.\" Or, \"I'm moving everyone's one on one cadence to every other week so that I can give you all back an extra 30 minutes of your week. But I\"m still here if you have any questions in the meantime.\" So, basically, when applicable, just explain that changes are affecting everyone, not just one person. Otherwise I start to fill in the blanks myself and think that I caused some issue.\n* Write out questions before the meeting. I feel like my brain stops functioning when I'm triggered and it's hard to think on the spot. But having questions emailed to me before a meeting gives me a chance to think about my answers. Again, explain why you're doing this. Just say that this is something you do for everyone (if that's true) and that you're doing it so that people are prepared for questions and not caught off guard.\n* Send a meeting agenda. Again, uncertainty drives me crazy. If I just have a 2-3 bullet point list of items that we're going to cover, that would help me understand what the meeting is about.\n* Flexible meeting cadence. Sometimes no matter what happens, just the thought of a one on one is rattling. So instead of having face to face one on ones each week, maybe do them every other week and just communicate questions via chat or email on the in-between week.\n\nThose are things that help me personally, but these could actually trigger anxiety in other people. I think just breaking the ice and asking your teammate what they prefer is a great step.\n\nBest of luck! And again, I think you're a great boss if you're actively trying to find ways to avoid triggering your employees. Be kind to yourself!\n\nThank you so much! I think your tips a great starting point for an open discussion! I'll suggest putting more to informal writing via chat and I'll make sure they don't feel singled out.\nI hope you find a good way to communicate with your boss... I see the chances are high with your amazing ideas and communication skills!\n\nThat's great. Best of luck. Yes, it's taken me years to advocate for myself and to even recognize that I had so much trauma around 1:1s. It's a work in progress and I think communication is the key. I'm rooting for you and your employee!\n\nI‚Äôm going through the exact same thing. I‚Äôve quit my job for a while now, but I‚Äôm so scared about going back to work. I don‚Äôt know what jobs to look for that won‚Äôt trigger my anxiety. What kind of jobs worked better for you in the past?\n\nHonestly jobs that have elements to them that relax me because I enjoy them. The one job I loved and had no stress about, a lot of it was having casual conversations with people (which I enjoy doing as an anxious extrovert). I could also choose to go outside so I didn't feel trapped in a building. I worked at a food bank and the feeling of making a difference also eased my anxiety. \n\nThe job I hated was very high pressure, a lot was on me and if I messed up that was it because I worked alone. I hated working alone and having so much responsibility solely on me. It wasn't good for me as a person.\n\nSame here. i couldnt sleep due panic attacks and got them while zoom calls when in worked from home completely becasue of the panic. I just had to protect myself and quit. Looking back stupid decision cause they should have fired me so i get safety money from government but at that time it was necessary and i would do it again if i was in that position.\n\nReally wanna quit due to anxiety but I need money to live.\n\nSame! Many times I just want to leave, but we have little choice but to work through anxiety (therapy, friends, medications, etc.) to make a living.\n\nThis is my current situation too. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to make it.\n\nI will never surrender to anxiety. I am doing everything I can to advance in my field despite anxiety. I‚Äôm on Lexapro and Inderal and I will continue to challenge the thoughts that seek to bind me and I shall train this dragon to my will.\n\nThat‚Äôs the best attitude imo. The more you let it control your life the more it destroys it\n\nReally well said. I left work because of anxiety and now, two months later, really regret it. I think sometimes it‚Äôs best just to push on and you‚Äôll make it through to the other side. Quitting the job felt like throwing in the towel, which accepts defeat.\n\nThis right here, awesome.\n\nNot yet but I think I'm about to...\n\nI quit my job few years back because of anxiety.. change of management and it gave me so much stress so I walked out.. I should‚Äôve done it differently but I was so upset and stressed.. gave them 7 years of my life though.. now I work at home..\n\nWhat kind of WFH job do you have and how did you find it?\n\nHome attendant! I take care of a family member.. one of my niece quit the job and before hand she asked me if wanted to replace her.. I agree.. it‚Äôs part time for now. Good benefits though.. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nI already lost 2 jobs because of anxiety, can't say it was good jobs tho, but when my anxiety was hitting hard I just stopped going to work for like a week, I wouldn't call my boss, I even never said anybody that I was having anxiety, \nAnd I showed up like in a 2 or 3 months later to sign my departure papers it was kinda similar for both of those jobs. I hope I'll don't lose another job. I bet everyone around me is thinking how lazy and stupid I am but I'm just really suffering, lot of people here says they have anxiety from work but mine is not from work.\n\nI feel you, it‚Äôs difficult. I try to not fall into what others may perceive about me, that cycle is never ending, in the end does it matter, like truly? \n\nDr Claire weekes book ‚Äúself help for your nerves‚Äù has given me back my life to a certain degree - I recommend it to every single person with anxiety. \n\nI hope you find peace.\n\nI really tempted to quit my job lately\n\nMan I hate this story. But it might help people. \n\nI took a job in China. Really interesting private school with a great community and support system. I freaked out after getting there and blanking on lesson plans. Froze. Couldn‚Äôt do anything. Quit during the first week and moved in with my in laws. I had *no idea* what anxiety was back then, so I took all of the intense feelings and emotions as an accurate reflection of who I was. \n\nI was mortified and defeated. It was a terrible feeling, and I still hate thinking about it. But I got things together pretty quickly. I started tutoring in my wife‚Äôs hometown on a small basis. Once things went well I started teaching small classes. The kids and their parents loved me, so I felt better. I think the only difference was I eased into this and avoided the worst of the anxiety. At the time, I thought I just got better. \n\nThat was a long time ago. I moved back to the US on my own terms, went to grad school, got my PhD, and became a professor. I‚Äôm still learning, but I‚Äôm good at what I do. \n\nI learned what anxiety is and got treatment for it.  I still struggle with it sometimes, but it hasn‚Äôt taken a job from me ever again. \n\nTl;dr anxiety can wreck you and take your job away. If that happens, it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker. Don‚Äôt feel embarrassed. Work on the anxiety and pursue a second chance. \n\nI really hate this story.\n\nThis is an important story. I‚Äôm learning the same thing right now. Any direction forward is positive, whatever we have to do, we need to support ourselves in doing it.\n\nThank you. I‚Äôm sharing it in the off chance that someone is where I was in the week after. I took this as a defining moment for me and labeled myself a failure.\n\nHad I known it was an anxiety, the result wouldn‚Äôt have been much different. I would have just insisted that anxiety made my dreams and economic prospects hopeless.\n\nIf anyone ends up there, neither of those statements were true of me and they are not of you. My psychiatrist once told me I was the most ‚Äútightly wound person‚Äù she ‚Äúhad ever seen.‚Äù All things considered, I‚Äôm doing pretty good now. \n\nBased on her description, I was a literally a worst case scenario. Now I‚Äôm sincerely happy and usually not hindered by an anxiety. So it‚Äôs not a platitude to say if I can do it so anyone else.\n\nIf anyone needs to talk, hit me up.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI took a holistic approach. I found that exposure/non-response was the most effective. When feelings of anxiety, physical symptoms, and fear would come on I would stop trying to fight them. I might even lean into them, pretend I liked them, and see if I can make them worse. Mostly, I would try to do what I would ordinarily be doing even if anxiety wasn‚Äôt there. It sounds crazy, and it feels really fake at first, but it deactivates the fear response and makes anxiety symptoms boring.\n\nExercising also did a lot for me. Cardio and strength training. \n\nIf you haven‚Äôt, check out  The Anxious Truth on YouTube. He boils down this method in a really easy way. They have a great support group on Facebook too.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYep! I read her book and it went a long way. The Anxious Truth channel is mostly applying the concept to practical situations today.\n\nIt feels like I‚Äôm about to. Long hours, far away from home, getting stuck in traffic and my horrible anxiety are starting to make me doubt about this new job I‚Äôve just started last week\n\nI quit my job last October because my anxiety was so bad I couldn‚Äôt handle it. I quit to try and get my mental health right. I‚Äôm still not working, I‚Äôve been to psyche wards and seen many psychiatrists. I am a welder so I made good money. It‚Äôs sad. But I was living in agony every day. Couldn‚Äôt think straight, constantly freaking out thinking I‚Äôm dieing.\n\n‚úã Many.\n\nI broke down and quit my last job 4 years ago, I‚Äôm now going back into work. I‚Äôm extremely anxious but after 4 years of working on myself in some ways I feel I‚Äôm much more ready (anxiety is still there but manageable)\n\nsame for me, broke down and quit my job 4 years ago. what tools are helping you ease back into the work field? every time i think about it, it‚Äôs incredibly daunting still.\n\nI also did this, after 3 years of not working I went back to work and I hate it. I‚Äôm so anxious again\n\nI‚Äôd say it was a root cause.  My workplace became highly abusive.  When I normally can handle certain situations, I struggled within the last year.  Started getting heart palpitations and resistant insomnia so I resigned.\n\nI only work the same job because I‚Äôm afraid to find a new one and start over again if you know what I mean. I am afraid that I will lose my job. I am afraid that I‚Äôm going to mess up. And I am constantly afraid and think that someone is out to get me fired or something. I cannot quit. The constant fear drives me to work myself to death. I can‚Äôt tell if I am being a people pleaser or just incredibly paranoid.\n\ni left my most recent job because of it i couldnt take all the daily social interactions and im a akward person so it was not a good experince plus the job was draining me and i was doing most of the work and i was just high all the time while the boss didnt do shit about my coworkers fighting and not doing anything all the time\n\nI had a easy job, but it paid like shit, so I switched to something that paid more. The new job caused me a lot of anxiety and it affected my work. I got fired bc of it. I tried getting my old job back, but it was too late. They already hired someone else.\n\nSame here. 3 years in, promoted but promotion came with 3x the responsibility and only 0.25 more an hour. The only position that was above mine was my bosses. So I got a job opportunity making a little more an hour in an office setting. They didn't really know how to train properly. Said I wasn't doing everything I was supposed to. Meeting one there was nothing that could be listed I needed to improve on. Second meeting that was promised never happened because they just fired me the following week. My job after this I'd \"missed too many days\". Even when I had time accrued. There were no meetings or verbal/written warnings etc. So part anxiety and part crappy management. From here on out I'm asking for the specifics on everything. I now have more anxiety from being fired twice. Seems like I get ok with a place and they let me go. Wishing I would have never quit my first job I was at for 3 years. I could probably go back honestly, but it wouldn't be the same position.\n\nIf it was a good work environment might it be worth it even if a different position?\n\nDang, in hindsight I now see the value of some past jobs where the work environment was good. But it seems I always find something to be upset about that makes me want to leave. There was one job I had that was perfection in all ways but the company had to sell out or go bankrupt and I was laid off by the acquiring company. Anxiety was high with them before that as the culture was more threatening.\n\nPossibly. It's been 2 almost 3 years since I've been there. Some of the same people are still there but everyone I use to work with has since left. It's considered seasonal work and within a school system so we would get spring break, winter break and summers off (optional because of summer programs). Those are all unpaid. I felt the pay should have been a little higher for the responsibility I carried. But they did work with me through a medical leave of absence. I often wonder if it was just because they couldnt/can't keep people though and didn't want to lose an employee. \n\nIt's hard having anxiety trying to work. I think the people in my work place play a huge role in how comfortable I feel. I can make friends with anyone but sometimes it's hard.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI‚Äôm so afraid to do this. It would be best for me but I‚Äôm so worried about what others will think or getting bullied.\n\nThis! I decided to take the full 3 months instead. Job secured for 12 weeks. Or you can spread it out. If you have this option take full advantage of it. They can‚Äôt touch you or ask any questions. My sister suffers from depression and she takes days off any day when she feels unwell.\n\nI‚Äôve quit a few jobs already, I just couldn‚Äôt cope with the stress. Now I‚Äôm not working and I‚Äôm applying for jobs again but I feel so scared and anxious. I don‚Äôt know what kind of jobs I can handle with this intense anxiety and I‚Äôm just at a loss of what to do.\n\nI get anxiety thinking about work at home...at work i'm usually concentrating and i'm good. \n\nI'm also thinking about leaving my job for less intense job or i'm tired of being a diesel mechanic.\n\nI had a perfect part time job in September, for a few months. The furthest I had to drive was 5.7 miles. ONCE A WEEK. I couldn't do it. Now I'm totally stuck at home. üò¨\n\nYo. I was being bullied by the upper management and couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. I‚Äôm 48 years old. I probably let them destroy my career. I‚Äôve been looking for a job for a long while now. Hundreds of applications.\n\nI've lost several and am in the process of losing another. Trying to fight it but it feels impossible sometimes\n\nYes but if the management was better I wouldn‚Äôt have had anxiety. \n\nAnd with my new job if the children‚Äôs behavior was better I also wouldn‚Äôt have any anxiety\n\nI was promoted 3 times over 4 years and, I still quit  my job because of anxiety. No amount of praise helped.\n\nI've quit jobs due to anxiety. I was younger and though it pushed me back financially i don't regret it. I then did temping and fixed-term contracts for a few years, which suited me quite well. But now with couple of kids to support, I need a steady income. So I've got to find other ways to manage my issues. It's so tough but I keep thinking that right now I have anxiety with a steady income. If I quit, I would still have anxiety but with no money.\n\nüëãüëã over here. Me.\n\nInitial thinking has me at 4 good and 2 more ok ones.\n\nHow come you guys didn‚Äôt go out on disability?\n\nThis is why I always mark yes on the disability portion on the job applications. Twice I've had to take leave in two different jobs. Unfortunately, it's a lot of paperwork when you're already having a hard time and on the verge of a mental breakdown. But I used to say no, I did not have a disability on job applications because my anxiety made me feel like I was lying or trying to just downplay it. But marking yes gives that opportunity if things go south that I'll still have a job if I need a time out.\n\nI had to quit a government job.\n\nDidn't know what was wrong with me at the time.\n\nMeüßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èMan oh man and I regret it sm. It was my first ever job, the pay was great, distance was extremely walkable, it had great benefits, the work  was up my alley. Been there for a month and got sick so naturally I have to call my job to call off sick. My managers didn‚Äôt communicate by text or email. It was strictly phone calling but not their phone I was supposed to call, oh no, I had to call the STORE phone and pray everything aligned for the manager to be in the day I called. It was set up in a very tedious inconvenient way and I blame my manager tbh. If he just gave me HIS cell and not fucking corporate then I‚Äôd still have the job. *Sigh* One of the shift managers called my phone 2 times and left voice mails üò≠I did not call back but listened to the emails. I was glued to my bed in fear of having to call them back bc of the weird process of it all. Felt like some IRS type shit and it wasn‚Äôt even a  government job. \n\nI eventually did call after a huge pep talk with myself but it was 3 days late and it didn‚Äôt matter anymore cuz I got taken off the schedule. Phone calls are my biggest biggest BIGGEST fear especially if there‚Äôs a whole inter-looping system involved where I gotta jump through hoops and talk to person to person to person just to repeat the same shit. I can text and email but I cannot call youüò≠I lost my job over that stupid fear but tbh who the fuck doesn‚Äôt give out their work cell or email in this day of age? It made sense cuz my manager was from the damn Stone Ageüòêüòíhe probably didn‚Äôt even know what a work cell/email was. I‚Äôll admit it was my fault but again who doesn‚Äôt give out their number to be DIRECTLY contacted for reasons like this? Why would you not give out the number you‚Äôd be able to be contacted though especially when you wanna get info in ASAP on who‚Äôs gonna come in and who‚Äôs not? Why make your employees go through all these loops and transferring? I was extremely flabbergasted when I found out employers/managers give their employees their cell number to contact directly. Like this could‚Äôve been solved. It‚Äôs 2024.  Rant over.\n\nNot a job but I dropped university like 3 times. Going to start this year again\n\nI've attempted college many times and never completed. I'm enrolled again and currently doing very well. But I'm also not working so I don't have to balance a job with it.\n\nAlmost every job I've left, bar one, has been because of my anxiety...\n\nI‚Äôve quit one job due to anxiety. I had anxiety already but the work environment I was in compounded it way too much to handle.\n\nJust quit one of mine a few days ago due to health anxiety. It‚Äôs definitely a challenge‚Ä¶\n\nMost of em! Therapy has helped a lot.\n\nLots, and people are getting less tolerance,\n\nEvery single one.\n\nI left a job where I would‚Äôve been able to make six figures consistently due to my anxiety. It was remote and I had good benefits and unlimited PTO. I took a job making half my salary and now I‚Äôm struggling.\n\nSorry to hear that and if you don‚Äôt mind me asking what kind of job was that ?\n\n100%. I was essentially offered a job as a 3rd AD (assistant director), on future films that another AD was working on. But my experience as anxiety of working 12-14 hour days for weeks on end wouldn‚Äôt let me just accept it, even though it probably would‚Äôve been good experience and better pay.\n\nYea I lost a job that I made $18 an hour 8 hours a day because I was not comfortable doing phone calls and tech support. They sold the company and I used to do data entry before that. They deleted the position apparently so I had to do that instead\n\nI‚Äôm ready to leave my job that pays $50/hr over the amount of phone time, interactions with providers, and giving terrible financial news to clients. I don‚Äôt know how long I can do it. Data entry sounds great, I‚Äôm sorry they eliminated that position.\n\nYou should try to find a good paying data entry job. I can‚Äôt imagine the anxiety you feel with the phone. People are so cruel  and get angry over little things that aren‚Äôt our faults\n\nI have a lot of PTSD from childhood trauma so when people get angry I just shut down. I started studying for medical coding because that seems like minimal interaction or at least less than I have now. Honestly I should probably leave healthcare all together. üò¢\n\nYep. Lost a very lucrative career being an Intellectual Property paralegal and now work at a grocery store barely making minimum wage and royally fucked up my life. Anxiety/depression is a bitch.\n\nhope you‚Äôre doing/feeling better ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nme\n\nI lost a county government job cause I just couldn‚Äôt handle my anxiety being turned up to 11 during my divorce. I was already struggling to learn the ins and outs of my first professional salary job and just kind of crumbled. I was on FMLA to go to therapy so I probably could have sued them for wrongful termination but I was not in any condition to do so.\n\nME! \n\nProudly. \n\nI would never exchange my peace and calm for an employment that I'm not even comfortable working at. \n\nI've been unemployed for three months now and still looking for a job but I've never felt better.\n\nI've had so many amazing opportunities straight up given to me that I passed on because I just couldnt make myself do it\n\nThis!! My god I‚Äôve been offered incredible job opportunities and turned them down due to disabling anxiety and panic attacks and I break down crying knowing how amazing my life could be if I had a normal brain. I take Zoloft which used to help but stopped after a few years on it.¬†\n\nThe answer is yes, all of us have lost good jobs due to anxiety\n\nme, my favorite job ive had to this day but i kept having panic attacks at work and eventually couldnt do it anymore cause i kept having to get fresh air outside\n\nI finally got a great job two years ago. Didn‚Äôt even feel like work. Due to anxiety and substance use I would call in sick often or leave or be late. \n\nI was supposed to be called back this year and wasn‚Äôt. The other one I was let go because of attendance. \n\nAwful feeling.\n\nMe. I had a really good and simple job, then I decided I can't do it anymore. I regret it now. I haven't found any job since I quit üôÅ\n\nHere here. Last gig I had, I had a low key anxiety attack.\n\nIt wasn't necessarrily a good job where I was working but I got fired from having anxiety. Mainly due to bullying that started to occur in the workplace and the workload was out of control. \n\nI had a private meeting with my boss to talk about the bullying myself and another girl was receiving and that I started  taking antidepressants because of the anxiety the job caused me. \n\nHe said that I should of told him about my anxiety before I started the job (i hardly had anxiety when I started) he fired me that day.\n\nLawsuit!!!¬†\n\nI quit my job because of my anxiety. It was stressful and felt like I was on an island. I also quit on a particular difficult time of my life. My dad was diagnosed with cancer and i didn‚Äôt deal with it well. That was at the end of 2022. I still regret leaving when I did. I was so depressed with myself for quitting and knew it was a bad idea and did it anyways. I did nothing for the first 6 months. Like absolutely nothing. I got a part time minimum wage job since then and am still trying to get back on where I was on my career path. Also I started therapy and feel so much better about handling both my depression and anxiety.\n\nNever had a job went to trade school so I could have a certification for a job I did want and finally had the courage to apply but they won‚Äôt hire me bc I have no experience üòî I‚Äôm really trying\n\nMe and have had hearings because of absence with all my jobs\n\nYeah I kept losing my job bc I would have extreme panic attacks. The kind that feels like you‚Äôre having a heart attack and the you screaming in the ER room bc you‚Äôre fully convinced you‚Äôre dying. \n\nUntil I got prescribed klonopin I went through a whole list of different meds for my anxiety and none of them worked. But now I‚Äôm able to hold a job\n\nI quit my job of 3 years as a data scientist (first job in tech industry) because I had crippling anxiety and no self belief. I use to drink during morning meetings. I eventually quit b/c I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nI worked with multiple professionals on this, specifically to try and keep going at an old sales job where the money and benefits were S-tier. Meds and therapy to try and work through the anxiety and not give up a good job because of it. Did not work. Everyone has basically told me that I couldn‚Äôt stay there and not to beat myself up, but I still do.\n\nI‚Äôve gone from job to job to job. New job, get anxiety/panic attacks, leave, rinse and repeat.\n\nThankfully I‚Äôve found a great job with solid work-life balance now. The staff seems to appreciate me and likes me. I‚Äôve gone from daily \npanic attacks to maybe one or two a year. (Once in a while I think about how much physical damage my heart took on having that daily panic attacks where I‚Äôm clutching my chest in pain‚Ä¶) But the pay is less than half of what I was pulling back then. Hard not to feel like a failure.\n\nI havent worked since december and was put in inpatient in march, im too unconfident and anxious to start working again without outpatient treatment which starts today.  I know i should just start working anyway but i dont feel like ill be a good employee as i am right now.  It really sucks.  Im hoping my treatment will help me gain the confidence to be able to do the things i wish i could do.\n\nMy previous job feel through as I couldn‚Äôt hold it down because of ocd and anxiety but aside from the money and some of the ppl working there I‚Äôd consider it a bullet missed fucking shithole to work for the hr manager was actually a total bully..enough said\n\nI had an amazing job I would have gave blood for and like wise with me. Unfortunately I had bad anxiety and in the end I walked away as it wasn‚Äôt fair on them. They always said I could go back when ever but yeah‚Ä¶.. fk anxiety\n\nLost a 115k job due to anxiety it crushed me immensely\n\nI lost a wonderful job with the most excellent benefits at a federal department of energy site in the Bay Area because of my anxiety. I couldn't stop chewing gum and gum was not allowed at all and I got busted a couple of times.\n\nAnxiety was the cause of the end each of my jobs except two.\n\nI've lost countless jobs due to my anxiety and panic attacks. It sucks.\n\nI've been considering getting a remote work job for this exact reason\n\nFeel the fear and do it anyway.\nGet into brene brown, amazing work.\nGood luck finding what works for you!\n\nImpulsively quit due to anxiety and feeling left out so in some sort of way Yeap\n\nbro i lose good everything because of anxiety\n\nI was laid off back in 2012 and then my husband was as well. We relocated for his job and I was so messed up from the job loss and relocation I didn‚Äôt work for the 8 years there other than a small self-employment situation I created training dogs. I was so anxious about working for someone else and my hubby made good money so it was ok.  \n\nThen he got laid off and we had to relocate again. His income still allowed me to not work and once again I was a mess from having lost all I had built with my little business and friends I made.  Fast forward and my hubby was laid off again and though I had started my little business here it wasn‚Äôt enough to survive on so I HAD to get a job. Customer service in a medical setting. I hate it and my boss is an idiot jerk.  \n\nThe multitasking element of the job stresses me out regularly and my anxiety flies through the roof when things get high pressure, and while I feel I‚Äôm fairly intelligent I make stupid mistakes and forget procedure easily and since my boss can only rage around and fixate on the bad, we never get any positive reinforcement and my anxiety shoots up when he‚Äôs around hovering. I‚Äôve learned that I have some real deficiencies in memory, coping with pressure and multitasking and that I‚Äôm probably on the spectrum.  I wish I could WFH but don‚Äôt know how to find jobs that lend themselves to that or even what they‚Äôd be. \n\nI‚Äôve got a big hole in my work history due to my anxiety and depression. I‚Äôm good at repetitive, linear work. I‚Äôd need additional training to do something like coding. I‚Äôm not good at making judgement calls though.  I also have a lot of anxiety around authority figures such as bosses and supervisors and always have this anticipation anxiety that I‚Äôm going to get busted or criticized or something. This is probably why I have worked for myself with small businesses which I actually sucked at because I‚Äôm lousy at self promotion. However there‚Äôs anxiety there due to always having to get the next gig, no security.\n\nI would start a dog training business again but the industry has moved past me and the anxiety over the promotion process has me stalled out. Sure made good money relative to the low wage grind I‚Äôm in now, though.\n\nYep, I was an airline pilot but couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I quit just as the money was getting good. It sucks because I was good at it but couldn‚Äôt sleep before my trips.\n\nI have.\n\ni lost the job i rlly liked and i m so sad that i can‚Äôt have an income now, i try making lives on tiktok from home with my games and it‚Äôs making me some money to buy food at least but yeah, my nausea tremors and panic attacks were so bad i didn‚Äôt have a choice rlly\n\nI've been really close to not walking into interviews for jobs because I was so anxious.\n\nmeüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò´\n\nI quit my last job due to anxiety. The people there didn't make it any better because  there was always some kind of drama and of course, piss poor management. It got to the point where on one or two days I would have a drink before work.. that's when I knew it was time to go. I went back to school for my associates a few months later and I'm doing well!!\n\nI quit my job as a dentist after graduating dentistry because of the anxiety. \n\nI‚Äôve been unemployed for a while and now I am looking for junior jobs in different industries to get a start in another career as I can‚Äôt even return to dentistry because I lack experience severely and I am not even a fresh graduate anymore so nobody would hire me and that‚Äôs fair. \n\nI feel like working as a dentist is worse than anything when you have severe social anxiety.\n\nI have.\n\ni love my job but then sometimes i just get random anxiety attacks and i panic for no reason and it just creates an awkward environment when having a conversation w my clients :/\n\nI was harassed for months because of my mental health. Fired without cause and recently settled a lawsuit. Don't let anxiety stop you from getting legal representation.\n\nI‚Äôm currently dealing with high anxiety in my job, but it‚Äôs not a good job so I won‚Äôt feel bad when I‚Äôm able to quit.\n\ni left my favorite job because of anxiety, i want to go back but i know the same thing will happen again\n\nAnxiety + weak brain\n\nI had to give up my Career in EMS due to PTSD/Chronic Anxiety. Still coping with the loss.\n\nI graduated college in Construction Management, got a job with a highly esteemed construction company my dad worked for. I left after the 1st 6 months due to anxiety, not believing in myself, not being to wrap my mind around the tasks needed. Needless to say, I could be making $20+/hr if I had stuck it out and made some mistakes but learned the craft in project engineering and maybe, eventally, Project Management.\n\nAre you sure it‚Äôs anxiety causing it?\n\nLost job at Apple, manager position\n\nI heard a good saying yesterday, action is the anecdote to anxiety. I'm saying when need to not quit out jobs and get help where possible. It gets hard but quitting is an easier way out. Invest in yourself and get some help to get through it. Having a job and purpose helped me get through my anxiety. \n\nIt's not for everyone but take baby steps and push through a little\n\nAll the time. It‚Äôs rare I find a job I can handle and if I do it usually pays like shit. UGH.\n\nI got fired from a job for having a panic attack I have severe anxiety and PTSD so when a customer screamed I put him on hold and just had a panic attack then when I calmed down I transferred him to the supervisor it was a 15 min hold and I was still dealing with the effect of my panic attack while I transferred I did let my supervisor know but she still fired me but I was on FMLA so I ended up getting unemployment was the best thing ever since now I‚Äôm a stay home mom cause I can‚Äôt handle working with people. I‚Äôm working on going back to school so I can get a degree working where I won‚Äôt deal with anyone. I don‚Äôt think my anxiety will ever go away\n\nI've been fired a couple of times because of anxiety.\n\nI've never lost a \"good job\" but I have lost jobs because of my anxiety. I end up quitting after a while and starting over somewhere new. It's beginning to be a problem, so much so, that I might eventually end up on disability. üôÉ\n\nI was quitting. I moved from Italy to Belgium and my anxiety was over the stars. If I had left, I should've paid 4k to that company - as they paid for my relocation - and I really did not care. \nI did not leave at the end. I feel so proud that I won over it. Sometimes I still get some anxious behaviors but not paralysing anymore.\nBtw, it's been 1 year in that company today and can tell you I've met great people.\n\nI had a big job in the sales department of a massive car brand that I had to walk out of\n\ncannot even get a job with it. I have ocd. I just shit myself at interviews. Even if i get a job i start catastrophising.\n\nI have a great job and a great boss, but I think of quitting every day only based on the feelings of my anxiety.\n\nSame. Id have a solid career by now if not for the anxiety/trauma. However, after lots of therapy, it‚Äôs much better now so I expect my working life to become far more stable.\n\nNot yet.  I've always done really well at all my jobs, but the one I have now of 12 years is going to be in jeopardy soon.   As I habe posted way to many times on here I have some wicked case of anxiety and panic disorder that came about.  And the last few months of my life it'd becoming rather un livable.    I once could do anything placed in front of me and now I'm barely getting by.   New company has bought our mom and pop shop and eventually when they start changing things around.  I'll be a goner.   This mental issue I habe is way to strong and I will most likely never be able to work a new job ever again and make remotely what I do now.   I'll lose insurance and the ability to cover what little help I'm getting now.   After that it's probably not going to end well.\n\nNot yet lost but censured and suspended at my last job!\n\nI have. I have also developed agoraphobia so it‚Äôs difficult to even leave the house. I had to apply for disability benefits over it.\n\nThinking about quitting mine because the anxiety is unreal. :/\n\nhi there! what did you end up doing?\n\nHi there‚Ä¶ I did leave my job and found a less stressful one and I‚Äôm a million times happier! I wish I had left years ago. Change can be scary but when something is so obviously effecting your mental health it‚Äôs worth it\n\nWhen I worked in an office I used to get so anxious I couldn‚Äôt function well.\n\nI looked for remote jobs and I have worked remote for 5 years. I still get anxious sometimes, but it is 100X easier to deal with in bed wrapped up in your own blankets with a cup of tea or glass of wine and your laptop on your lap.\n\nI know not everyone is like me, but when you can work from your couch or bed I feel like work is wayyy better.\n\nEvery job and there was alot like 20.  And I had to drop out of high school at 15 and leave when I tried to go back even though I was ahead by 3 grades.  Also got half my money back when I was having panic attacks after practically acing my G.E.D. ...All because of panic attacks and severe anxiety disorder.  20 years later, I'm 42 and still suffering horribly.  The FDA and shortages &amp; changes with the generic benzos in the US has me losing my mind literally."

    "all_comment_text": "feeling like my head is light. constantly scared of passing out. disconnected. shaking. racing heart. air hunger. exhausted but can‚Äôt sleep due to heart palpitations\n\nSame here, it's awful I can't live my life anymore\n\nSame for me. I haven‚Äôt had an episode in a while, but today while driving I got this exact feeling. I had to blast my AC and drive in silence for a bit. I hate the feeling of just being out of my head and out of control. I also get like my ears are plugged up also, which then makes me dizzy.\n\nI have the ear issue too and I‚Äôm always dizzy and started having tinnitus I‚Äôm so sick of it and I‚Äôm always afraid it‚Äôs not anxiety but a real issue happening because it doesn‚Äôt stop. üò≠\n\nMy heart rate spikes and I feel like I can‚Äôt get enough air even though I can. I can get in enough air to hold a full conversation and get my brain is telling me it‚Äôs not enough.\n\nI think this has been happening to me lately. I‚Äôll get insanely red and feel all hot and sweaty and nauseous for a few seconds and then if I keep breathing it kinda stops. But it happens a few times a day.\n\nsame!\n\nsame.\n\nNausea, lots and lots of nausea\n\nI tried to eat a banana earlier and it just came back up, serious lack of appetite, then the vicious cycle of feeling sick cause i havent eaten etc‚Ä¶ ü´†\n\nOh man, I feel you there :( it sucks. I‚Äôve started to eat very little meals when I‚Äôm out because at home a can eat a little bit more. Just knowing I have a safe place (my room) where I can be alone is comforting so my body relaxes a little bit more. When I‚Äôm out in public though‚Ä¶ I swear on my life, more than 3 pieces of nuggets and I‚Äôm on the verge of throwing up. I rather just get home to eat something a little bit bigger. Iy was worse last year, it seems to be a little bit better this one, no idea why haha. I‚Äôm sorry you are going through this too üòû Has this always happened to you?\n\nI have this exact issue! Have you found any way to avoid it while out eating in public? Going on vacation was a nightmare for me because I didn't feel comfortable anywhere.¬†\n\nHoly, my grammar died lmao. Sorry, I hope I got my point across.\n\nSurprised I had to scroll so far down to see this. This is always my first and most intense symptom.\n\nYou're not the only one!! I have nausea every day and this weird feeling of being bloated and needing to push against my abdomen to relieve my pain. Literally living off of ginger candy and peppermint tea\n\nThis is so crazy. I was about to make this same post. I‚Äôm dealing with post nasal drip. Never knew it was part of anxiety. Feels like something is stuck in my throat. I can literally feel the post nasal drip in my mouth leaking. Chest pain of course (which I‚Äôm having now). Left arm pain (having this too). Tingling feeling in my feet. Feel as if I‚Äôm going to pass out. It‚Äôs a lot. Start feeling overwhelmed. Tired. Oh then I get angry or depressed.\n\nOooh the left arm pain and tingling!! I often forget those ones omg! üòî\nI also get very angry and depressed and usually end up going to bed and lay in the dark trying to calm myself down‚Ä¶ \nThe ones that are hard to explain like your feeling of having a post nasal drip, i get a basket full of such strange feelings i wouldnt even know how to describe them, one is that all my organs are floating around in my body and arent ¬´¬†attached¬†¬ª to anything\n\nI have random feelings like that too. Which of course send me to the drs. Which of course nothing is wrong. Well at least that‚Äôs what the drs say. I swear they are all wrong lol\n\nHere I am thinking I was the only one dealing with this situation. Although I don‚Äôt experience the majority of other symptoms, I‚Äôve been dealing with that crazy ‚Äòpostnasal drip‚Äô symptom. Ever since Covid a couple of years ago, I feel like I haven‚Äôt been the same. It usually comes and goes every couple of months or oddly every time I happen to get sick? But these past couple of weeks the anxiety part of it has been the worst. Especially at night üò≠\n\nüò≠üò≠us having the same symptoms is quite baffling to me!\n\nCurious to know do you get the post nasal drip?\n\nyes i do. üò≠üòÇcurrently happening right now i am so aggravated by it.\n\nThat make‚Äôs me feel so much better!!!! I thought I was the only one.\n\nTHIS! Omg you are the only person that I‚Äôve come across that has this post nasal throat situation where you‚Äôre constantly coughing/clearing throat and there‚Äôs like nothing there but it feels like there is. It got so bad for me that I don‚Äôt use voice for gaming or go to movies or anything like that cause I‚Äôm constantly clearing my throat, throw in covid and I just don‚Äôt go around people anymore. Now that I‚Äôve seen your post I‚Äôm starting to realized it comes around for a few months then gone again omg thank you for sharing this!\n\nThese have been my exact symptoms for a week! I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not alone (minus the nasal drip)\n\nWait I get crazy post nasal drip, it could be anxiety? I'm literally going to the Dr to try and figure out why I've been getting it\n\nIBS, oddly enough extremely LOUD, OBNOXIOUSLY loud stomach grumbling, sweating, hot flashes, headaches, breath holding, &amp; nail biting.\n\nI have all these also! Recently there are days, when my stomach just feels full of air and i have to force 10 millions burps for relief üòÇ\n\nOh so my hot flashes are linked to my anxiety?? I will do a simple walk and start pouring with sweat at the minute. Or if I‚Äôm stressed I get super warm.\n\nThis is really helpful to know thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nIronically when I used to get panic attacks when I was younger, I‚Äôd be cold to the touch. A literal ice cube, and I‚Äôd start shaking uncontrollably. I learned how to control my panic attacks. I don‚Äôt get them anymore but now when I do semi panic about something (usually a trigger) i start shaking uncontrollably, my teeth start chattering &amp; I usually just tell ppl I‚Äôm cold.\n\nfeeling ‚Äúoff‚Äù/unsteady/off balance but not ‚Ä¶ dizzy. its so annoying üò≠\n\nAhh the walking on a boat feeling. A classic of mine.\n\nSame with me! I feel like this almost always.\n\ni can‚Äôt remember the last time when there wasn‚Äôt a day that i didn‚Äôt feel like this atleast once\n\nSeriously every day!! I want just one day where i don't feel wobbly\n\nThis occurs daily for me now. I even had an MRI on my brain to make sure it wasn‚Äôt anything serious. Turned out to just be anxiety and maybe a mild case of vertigo.\n\nUsually I have really bad stomach problems, in the beginning I never thought it related to my anxiety. At my worst, my nerves are shot and my tummy is just upset. üôÉ\n\nI get chest pain almost like a squeezing behind my sternum and shortness of breath where it feels like I‚Äôm gasping for air to the point I start gagging.. been to the er multiple times in this state and all vitals were normal. it‚Äôs crazy how anxiety can physically make you think your feeling when it‚Äôs all in your head.. very frustrating for me\n\nSo so real‚Ä¶it seems most of us nearly all have it focused in the chest area which is by far the most destabilising‚Ä¶ive also had to go to the ER and have all the tests which turned out to be panic attacks‚Ä¶i hate it so so much. Like why is my body doing this to me\n\nThe ER experience has happened to me multiple times\n\nChest pain.  So much.  Been to the ER multiple times and everything has been fine, just anxiety. But now I‚Äôm anxious and worried about if I just think any chest pain is just anxiety and I do nothing and I die from heart problems.  Which causes more anxiety‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.\n\n[deleted]\n\ni get this!! feels like im about to have a seizure or pass out, its horrible\n\nConstant chest pain. Feels like I don‚Äôt even get a minute without the pain.. (been to ER 2 weeks ago all good just has a pulled muscle in my chest). Sometimes I wonder will it ever get better.\n\nThe chest pain is by far the worst, ive also been to the ER x2 cause i was pretty sure i was having a heart attack, now ive got extra anxiety that I will have a heart attack and write it off as a panic attack instead\n\nHaha, that's my fear too. Never been to the ER because I always assume my chest pains and needles in the heart are anxiety, but I wonder if I'll be able to know if/when it's not.\n\nI try to write it off as panic/anxiety aswell but so hard. I feel tired and on edge all the time and always needing to look for reassurance. I have my heart results from 2 years ago which were all normal yet I am still anxious about it. Wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anyone!\n\nHeart palpitations, headaches, stomachaches, dry mouth and constant urge to swallow saliva, blurry vision and pressure in the eyes, dizziness, fatigue, sweating, fast heartbeat and high blood pressure and there are probably more that I forgot.\n\nPalpitations as in your heart actually skips beats ?\n\nUgh. Same\n\nDisassociation is the worst symptom to me, feel like I‚Äôm going insane\n\nDepersonalization for me üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nThankfully I don‚Äôt have health anxiety about that one. I just feel so WEIRD and out of place some times sometimes!\n\nI would not wish drdp on my enemy's.\nLiterally torture.\n\nI used to feel like my soul was disappearing. Like I'm losing grip on my own body. Really freaky feeling\n\nShortness of breath and fatigue were my worse ongoing ones that triggered my severe anxiety where I struggle to go anywhere ü•≤. I occasionally have acid reflux that feels like my throat is burning. But during an anxiety attack the main ones are feeling dizzy with ridiculously rapid heart palpitations that feel like my hearts going to burst out of my chest and a need to get out of whatever situation I‚Äôm in. Not to mention the deep feeling of dread inside me when I‚Äôm about to push myself to do something outside of my comfort zone.\n\nPS playing the sims is also my escapism ü§£ they live the life I dream of living again\n\nOmg!!!! I play The Sims for the exact same reason\n\nYou guys should all try taking magnesium. That and changing your diet. It‚Äôs helped me out a lot\n\nI was curious about this and if it helps\n\nMagnesium has helped me a lot. Also I'm getting back on my diet. Definitely recommend.\n\nWhen my anxiety is bad I start to feel high. Like dissociated and not myself, as if I have a bad high\n\nThat‚Äôs a good way to describe it\n\nOh my god yes.\n\nDoes anyone else get head twitches or jerks? My latest thing is when I walk or run my head jerks to the right involuntarily. Doesn‚Äôt happen when I‚Äôm sitting or laying down. I‚Äôve been under a crazy about of stress lately unfortunately.\n\nYes i do\n\nHey there, can you tell me more about it please? This just started for me back in mid July and I'm trying to understand it better. Have you had any success in resolving it or anything along those lines?\n\nOne of my main symptoms is twitching. I also have been really sensitive to noise the past few years. When Im in anxious situations, its almost like my body will lock up and any sort of noise makes me jumpy. Unfortunately, no success with tackling this issue :( \n\nI hope that helps. Lmk if you have any other questions.\n\nI was wondering about this been happening to me lately but not just my head my arm also ü•π my brain constantly feel like it‚Äôs tingling\n\nThe same happens to me with a spiked heartbeat. its the worst.\n\nAnxiety shivers\n\nPins and needles, feeling very hot, air hunger, chest pain, leg cramps , can feel my heart beat in my ears , difficulty swallowing\n\nThe worst symptoms I‚Äôve ever had made me feel like I was actually going to die. Hands, knees, jaw and other extremities completely lock and can‚Äôt be moved. Pins and needles sensation all over. Chest rattling, heart pounding. Shortness of breath, vision blurring. Dissociation. Feeling somehow so weightless that I‚Äôll drift off but so heavy I can‚Äôt move.\n\nChest pain, abdominal pain, headaches, brain zaps, arm pain, rib pain. It rotates, its mostly one of those symptoms at a time\n\nsamesss plus post nasal drip. the brain zaps literally make me feel nuts üò≠\n\nRib pain has been freaking me out lately. I‚Äôm (not) happy to see someone else has this symptom.\n\nPalpitations, dizziness, weird vision, light-headedness and paranoia\n\nReal\n\nMy heart starts beating really fast, I feel like I can't breathe and like I can't sit still or chill TF out.\n\npost nasal drip, back pain, body aches, leg tingling‚Ä¶honestly i have health anxiety as well so if i look something up my body will mimic the symptoms\n\nchest pain, dizziness, tunnel vision , heart pounding , sometimes my hands twitch\n\n[deleted]\n\nI feel disconnected from my body and start moving my hands to remind myself I‚Äôm controlling my body. A weird one I know.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI feel you, my appetite is shot to hell when i get very triggered, i could easily starve if it wasnt for my family‚Ä¶then everything feels worse cause of not eating‚Ä¶just one big loop\n\nAside from the usual i feel my back pain increase severely ü•¥\n\nOmg! I have arthritis in my neck/back and my back has been killing me lately. usually when its cold or when it rains it flairs up. The forecast has been clear... I didn't put 2 and 2 together\n\nI feel lightheaded, panicky.  Periodic feelings of impending doom and real fear.\nI am disassociated from my body and mind and have a desperate urge to run away from myself.  It's awful and I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.\n\ni get this weird feeling sometimes and i genuinely feel like i‚Äôm about to have a seizure? i can‚Äôt really describe it, just feels like severe agitation, body feels jolty, feels like theres electricity going through my body and i get a horrible feeling in my stomach/chest. if i try to sleep when i feel like this, i just continuously jolt awake and feel like im hyperventilating. its so so odd. then also the general feelings like chest tightness, dizziness, brain fog, vision changes, nausea, shaking. i hate anxiety so much\n\nMy chest feels so heavy all of a sudden. Its the worst feeling ever.\n\nMy chest starts burning for me. I‚Äôm dizzy and I completely stop eating all I can do is sip on water.\n\nThe worst physical anxiety symptom I have is a tingling like feeling in my chest and stomach. It legitimately feels like I‚Äôm being electrocuted and nothing makes it go away. Sucks to suck I guess. üò≠\n\nNausea, stomach cramping and diarrhea, shaking/tremors, sweating, jaw clenching‚Ä¶\n\nPhew just typing this is sending me üòÖ\n\nEdited to add I also forget to fully exhale, which makes me feel like I‚Äôm not getting enough air.\n\nI have bowel issues, like nervous pooping. Sorry if that‚Äôs gross. I also feel nauseous and can‚Äôt eat. I‚Äôll start meals because I recognize I‚Äôm hungry, but I can‚Äôt finish them. My heart feels like it‚Äôs constantly skipping a beat. When I‚Äôm speaking I stammer and blush. I get headaches. It‚Äôs debilitating. Last night I fell asleep literally cradling my cat‚Äôs furry lil head and that helped a lot.\n\nI hate when I have nervous poop! üò´\n\nThere‚Äôs alot.\n\nMy right eye and eyebrow will start twitching.\n\nI start picking at my nails, my face, calluses on my hands.\n\nIf I am in a conversation and I happen to be anxious at that time, I feel very light headed and can‚Äôt even focus on what the person is saying. Sometimes it‚Äôs so bad I feel as if I‚Äôm about to pass out. \n\nAt times I feel as if I can‚Äôt catch my breath or there‚Äôs a severe lack of oxygen going to my brain.\n\nRinging in my ears.\n\nDry mouth/excessive thirst/frequent urination \n\nNot being able to fall or stay asleep\n\nSame. Currently wearing a 7 day Holtor due to all the heart racing and flippy palpitations and it‚Äôs making my anxiety worse. I‚Äôve been in a panic basically since I put it on yesterday. üòñ\n\nAt the moment I am super congested, runny nose, head aches, and wild mood swings üòÆ‚Äçüí® it‚Äôs so weird how symptoms almost shift around and take each others place sometimes, sometimes it‚Äôs a lot of things at once. It makes it even easier to catastrophize the whole thing and make it even worse, but the best we can do is our best; be aware that it is anxiety and try to be present. I am about to start therapy and try different medication hopefully soon, but in the meantime awareness goes a long way. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nConstantly clenching my teeth‚Ä¶ \nThe last panic attack I had, my vision blacked out and my head felt like it was going to explode.. NOT FUN\n\nTight chest, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, dizziness, blurry vision, off-balance feeling like I could fall down or faint, hot flashes, sweating, nausea, the list goes on üò≠\n\nNausea, that slowly becomes more extreme, eventually including retching and, when really bad, vomiting.\n\nThis is in addition to stiffening of all muscles (I curl in to myself) and uncontrollable shaking like shivering.  I sweat profusely, and that sweat has a distinct odor that is very strong even to myself.\n\nMy stomach hurts and I get so nauseous to the point where I feel like throwing up bc I get a ball in my throat and my mouth gets dry and my heart starts to speed up. And on top of it I have a throwing up phobia so it‚Äôs like a cycle lol when I get a panic attack. I had to get on anxiety meds bc it became crippling.\n\nnausea, headaches, fatigue, constantly feeling like i can‚Äôt breathe, spiked heart rate, dissociation, dizziness, etc üò≠\n\nI used to get just heart palpitations/racing insides. The past two months, though, after a year of medical issues and life/family hurdles, my symptoms have gotten out of control. Matter of fact, I finally broke down and started meds this week. But in short order, I experienced covid-related nerve problems that triggered a lot of health anxiety. It's triggered my asthma and made it feel like I can't get a full breath; it's caused so much face and neck tension that I've now got a tired jaw that makes it difficult to speak/makes me sometimes slur my words, and have been dealing with absurd levels of dry mouth and sensations like my tongue is swelling/throat is closing when nothing is actually happening. And it's given me twinges on the left side of my chest that have spooked me enough to have worn a heart rate monitor and do a cardiac stress test (still waiting for the results, but I am feeling better now and feel like I'm \"coming down\" from things.\n\nIt's a beast.\n\nI have a very low heart rate, but my heart pounds hard enough to be visible all over my body, especially in my abdomen.\n\nLiterally feeling like i have the flu lol\n\nHeart starts beating fast , crazy tightness in chest &amp; heavy breathing. Sometimes butterflies in the stomach &amp; sweating\n\nWhen it's at it's worst I cant move besides shaking aggressively due to the worst pain ever in my heart and horrible nausea.\n\nExact same symptoms as you, but the worst was the pit of doom in my chest. I recently started on beta blockers and it has made an incredible difference! I feel like I can finally breathe and a massive weight has been lifted off my chest.\n\nHuge. I‚Äôve been on propanolol for some years now. Changed my life. No panic attacks. It‚Äôs like this ‚Äúsafe‚Äù pill, knowing my heart won‚Äôt get all jacked up. Also has helped tremendously with skipped beats.\n\nSevere brain fog and inability to focus. Blurred vision. Air hunger and always feeling the urge to take a big huge deep breath. Tingling and weakness in my hands. Dry cough.\n\nTight feeling in my stomach, nausea/lack of appetite, woozy foggy headed feeling, prickly feeling all over skin. Idk just generally overactivated and not good!\n\ni‚Äôve had every physical symptom under the sun, but now it‚Äôs acid reflux only :(\n\nI end up feeling super exhausted, my brain feels stuck in a loop and I struggle to snap out of it. I would cry my eyes out and curl up on the floor somewhere warm, but then my bones start to hurt after a while. Sometimes I might get a stomachache. \n\nMy skin can also break out in itchy spots, so I guess random inflammations.\n\nI'll list all symptoms I've experienced:\n\n- Dizziness\n- Vertigo (bouncy ground/wobbly legs)\n- Nausea\n- Ringing in ears\n- Body aches (shoulders, neck, chest)\n- Tension headaches\n- Neck tension\n- Head pressure\n- Visual snow (also photophobia etc)\n- Diarrhea after every time I eat\n- Head feeling space-y\n- Dissociation/Depersonalization\n- Chest tightness\n- Random abdominal aches\n- Arm aches\n- Legs feel tired from knees down\n- Feeling off balance\n- Random dull aches in shoulder blades\n- Random dull aches in armpits\n- Brain zaps (not on any medications)\n- Stuttering when feeling anxious/nervous\n- Brain feeling overstimulated/excited\n- Whooshing in my ears when lying down\n- Brain fog (short term memory issues too)\n\nI'm now only experiencing some of those things and it's been a week so far but if I could get what's remaining under control and it stays that way - I think I'd feel a heck of a lot better.\n\nThe top and the back of my head ache, it feels like my brain is sinking and I‚Äôm unsure why\n\nCan‚Äôt swallow feel like I‚Äôm not breathing and there is pressure in my chest\n\nMy anxiety has gotten a lot better over the years, but it‚Äôs still there. When I‚Äôm anxious I feel very nauseous and will start gagging. Sometimes I‚Äôll throw up. Another symptom I have is my heart feels like it‚Äôs racing.\n\nChest pains/tightness, random aches, palpitations, shaking, sweating, chills, suddenly going hot, dizzy and feeling faint oh and sudden spike in HR and BP sometimes too\n\nStomach pain. I‚Äôve been fighting off burning and aching and back pain for going on two years. Right now I‚Äôm doing better but I don‚Äôt know how long it will last and leave me pain free.\n\nDizziness and racing heart\n\nI have difficulty in breathing and even swallowing!, my heart is pounding and my hands are sweating. Sometimes I get nauseous.\n\nI usually can't stop moving when I'm anxious. When I'm having a panic attack, I'm always moving, can't stay still, and normally can't breathe, like I'm not getting enough air. I'm a really reserved person and mask most emotions, and I have bad social anxiety, so I always have a way to move or fidget without people noticing. I don't think I have really any physical pain from anxiety, but if I'm too worked up or something I'll cause myself pain, like for some reason I'll hit myself in the head and other things, but strangely it helps me calm down, not in front of people though.\n\nFeels like my hearts going a mile a second and my throat gets dry and hard to swallow which causes me to feel like i cannot breathe.\n\nI just recently was taken off of Klonopin that I was on for 15 years. I ended up getting arrested and the jail wouldn't let me have my meds. I spent 5 months in jail ripped off of my meds all cold turkey. (40 mg of celexa, and 2mg of Klonopin 3x daily). The withdrawal from these meds sent me into a severe panic for the next 5 months. Tunnel vision, racing/palpitating heart. Sweating profusely, seizures, tremors, uncontrollable shaking, fainting, lightheadedness, blood pressure swings, loss of feeling in my extremities, extreme migraines. Basically I felt like I was going to die. I also got weird sexual side effects like getting erections randomly, wet dreams, pain in my penis and testicles. This all actually ended up happening in full force until I got out of jail and got back on celexa. I was also put on propanolol today for anxiety which I can already tell is helping tremendously. I refuse to go back on Klonopin due to how horrible coming off of it made my symptoms, but I'd be a liar if I said I haven't thought about it. It's nice to be completely sober though ;)\n\nIt's hard for me to know what I'm feeling, so it took me years to know it was anxiety.\nIt comes in many forms:\n1) I can't breathe properly, I take long breaths without being able to breathe and I feel like I'm drowning, to the point of clinging to something to help me.\n2) Derealization, it happens to me from time to time, but once it lasted a whole month. I had the impression that nothing was real, my vision was blurred, sometimes I counted my fingers to make sure I wasn't dreaming.\n3) Discomfort in the chest. At the moment, since I can't recognize certain emotions, I still haven't figured out where it comes from, but a logical answer might be anxiety. It's often when someone comes to talk to me, even if I'm enjoying the interaction, this discomfort in my chest appears and I feel like breaking everything because it's so unbearable. It puts so much pressure on me that I don't know what to think, and I can't concentrate on anything.\n\nIf you recognize certain things as something other than anxiety, please let me know. Like I said, it's what I think it is, but I can't be sure due to my inability to recognize what I'm feeling. Thank you\n\nHeadaches nausea shaky dissociation light headed dizzy hot feel like I‚Äôm gonna pass out racing heart beat tinnitus chest tightness stomachache.. all this daily\n\nmy anxiety exclusively manifests physically. i get really nauseous but i also have emetophobia so it makes my anxiety so much worse. i swallow a bunch of air too because for some reason burping helps my anxiety when im having an attack im not sure why though.\n\nI start to shake uncontrollably\n\nI can‚Äôt really explain it but it‚Äôs just this absolutely awful pins and needles feeling all over like when your foot falls asleep but it‚Äôs your whole body. It‚Äôs so terrible.\n\nFeeling like I am watching a movie of me and not being actually me, also dizziness, can‚Äôt sleep, hyperfocused on my body\n\nYeeees! Watching myself from outside behind a glass panel. All whilst being conscious and aware that i feel like that, then just operate on auto‚Ä¶ so hyper focused on my body also. Feeling things that i dont think i should be like i ¬´¬†feeel¬†¬ª my organs, it makes me so uncomfortable i want to transform into a rock,¬†my body feels foreign to me, like its not mine\n\nI‚Äôm here to tell you it gets better. At my worst from the physical symptoms I had extreme disassociation / depersonalisation, heart palpitations, neck / shoulder pain, gasping breaths, headaches and ‚Äòeye pressure‚Äô, insomnia, visual snow, loss of appetite, hot flushes, insomnia and random ‚Äòtwitches‚Äô. \n\nIt really does get better\n\nFeelings of unstableness and dizziness, even though I'm perfectly stable and can literally balance on tiptoe up to 3 and a half minutes on each foot.\n\nThen, the most usual, shortness of breath and racing heart, for which I've done almost 40 electrocardiograms, 15 ultrasounds and 15 blood tests, up until early June, from which I haven't done any testing, as I am more in control of it.\n\nThen, the lump in the throat feeling, which contributes to the perception of shortness of breath.\n\nFrequent urination and relentless perspiration (these two are what I've had since I was a little child, so they're not worrisome at all to me, it's how my body usually responds to anxiety and stressful situations).\n\nAll in all, it's a mess. But I handle it much, much better than 3 months ago, when I was going to hospitals or health centres almost every single day, even in secret.\n\nSweating like crazy \nIm shaking from the inside but not from the outside \nHeart palpitation\nVery low energy \nAnd weight loss\n\nOof, when my ex would yell at me my vision would start to box in, then my hands and feet eould feel like they swelled to 5√ó the size of normal. I'd rub them and breath deeply, but what I really needed was to get the hell away from her!\n\nFatigue, chest pain, insomnia just to name a few\n\nFluttering chest!\n\nWhen it is bad a tightness in my abdomen thoughts race, it becomes hard to talk and feels like I have a lot of saliva in my mouth. If it stays like this I feel disassociated from my body. I haven't had it that bad in 8 months but I still get the tightness from time to time. The oral thing is quite strange. It's kind of hard to describe. But it feels like there is just too much saliva in my mouth. Very odd.  When I was younger I'd have that nagging feeling of tightness in my lower abdomen. made me feel like crap.\n\nFor me it‚Äôs the feeling of feeling nauseous, to the point where I am unable to eat because I feel so nauseous. I also feel extremely tired\n\nHeart racing, chest pains, left arm pain, and nauseous/dizziness to the max.  It's debilitating and is happening more and more often right now, contemplating going to er to get checked out\n\nSevere Neck pain/tightness/ feels like the vein in my neck will explode, hard to breathe, and I actually pass out occasionally from getting too worked up. Also major heart palpitations.\n\nMainly heart related symptoms that aren‚Äôt heart related symptoms. However recently I‚Äôve started to get symptoms in my legs once I got pain one day and started to worry about blood clots and circulation issues in my legs that may travel to my heart or lungs. I mean I get the default ones like basic chest pain, tight chest, numbness, etc. but once I become fixated on some health problem my anxiety seems to create phantom pain in that area, and it can get pretty real in terms of real pain. But once I get checked out and told I‚Äôm fine, it magically disappears. I know doctors say to see anxiety as like a flawed friend looking out for you or something, but it tends to drive me even more crazy cause I‚Äôve basically lost all confidence in what pain is real and what pain isn‚Äôt. It also creates a cry wolf thing with your doctor which stresses me out even more, as they will start to attribute anything to your anxiety first thing.\n\nstarts with the literal sensation of adrenaline squirting into my belly region then it expands and the racing heart starts, pins and needles in my arms possibly, may feel shaky, voice may crack at times.\n\nI‚Äôll just blurt out a sound and do a little twitch üò≠üò≠\n\nAppetite loss and then weight loss associated with it and don‚Äôt get me started about the chest pains.\n\nYour insides feeling jittery and you can‚Äôt calm it. Feeling dissociated from myself and life, feeling like it‚Äôs floating by. Loss of appetite. Slight nausea. Feeling sore. Headache after a while\n\nAnxiety turns to agitation turns to anger.\n\nAll of the above and then some. But most especially the crushing chest tightness and stomach problems.\n\nI have the same issues! In addition to all of that I feel like puking and I get a really bad coughing fit‚Ä¶ oh and lack of sleep\n\nThroat so tight I thought I had throat cancer, chest so tight and it feels like a knife stabbing through me. High heart rate, etc.\n\nIf my anxiety is really bad and I‚Äôm upset I‚Äôll end up vomiting against my will..it isn‚Äôt fun\n\nChest pains are the biggest symptoms for me. It feels like a thirty pound weight is on my chest it‚Äôs been so bad as some occasions that I nearly throw up. I also get heart palpitations occasionally.\n\nMy scalp tingles, especially if I‚Äôm angry with anxiety.\n\nNausea and upset stomach\n\nRecently my anxiety has gotten worse. Specifically the physical pain and symptoms that are associate with it. My dr has increased and changed medications to adjust for that with little positive outcome. \n\nThat being said my list goes like this:\nHeart race spikes\nMy stomach feels like I‚Äôm on a roller coaster\nNausea \nShaking or trembling without control\nInability to speak properly because my lips become numb\nLoss of grip strength\nMuscle stiffness \nIntense temperature changes from sweating to shivering \nFood avoidant/ unexplained rapid weight loss-or sometimes my body physically rejects food \nIBS\nThose are time main ones. We‚Äôre in this together even when we feel alone. Communities like this give me hope. I came here to look for support because my Husband is out of town. Usually he is my ground to reality. I‚Äôm trying to let him enjoy his trip with his friends without my persistent burden. Thanks for letting me come here and find people to stand in his place for the day :)\n\nMuscle twitches / leg pain/ weakness \n\nIts sucks just want it to go away\n\nAcid reflux\n\nI get sharp pains in my hands, feet, and stomach. I can sometimes get nauseous and I have extreme difficulty stopping my legs and feet from shaking. Something happens with my hearing but it's hard to explain. Kind of like they swell and make everything muffled? If it turns into a full blown panic attack, for some reason, I start humming and am unable to stop until I'm out of the attack.\n\nDoes anyone clench there hands at night and wake up with hand pain?\n\nCold chills and shivering. I need a heated blanket during periods of bad anxiety even in the height of summer.\n\nI get the type of palpitations that will hurt; not the type that you get when you run or get thrilled. My heart rate suddenly increases and it feels like my it is sinking into my stomach. Having trouble breathing too---like something is clogging my throat when there's nothing. My knees suddenly get weak too and I get light headed. \n\nSadly none of my family takes my symptoms seriously and that I should pray so it won't happen to me. They keep triggering me and here I am trying to prevent an episode ://\n\nmy stomach starts to hurt\n\nFeeling rather hot, red ears/cheeks, rapid heart beat and it usually triggers my IBS.\n\nMy most common physical anxiety symptom in the past few years has been skin tingling. That has abated since retirement, thank goodness, but I sometimes get behavioral symptoms like the inability to think clearly, extreme determination, and a short temper. I try to use awareness, reflection, and self-compassion when these things happen but have had only mixed success.\n\nweird pressure in my chest, weird (bp?) feeling, arm and leg pains, fatigue, heart rate increases, lightheaded, feel like i need to keep having deep breaths, chest pains, etc.\nanxiety can make almost ANY symptom happen. it imitates so much.\n\nChest tightness, intense tingling sensation around my body, rapid heart rate, sometimes nausea, general body tension. I have been trying to work on progressive muscle relaxation and breathing techniques\n\nWhen my anxiety is up I sometimes get diarrhea.\n\nI often feel that my neck and upper back are tight, get a strange headache, and feel like I'm rocking. Sometimes I feel a bit dizzy, and off balance. Before I was medicated, I felt like I was vibrating and would actually lose my balance. I get an awful, dreadful feeling, overall. Hard to describe.\n\nI don't get chest pains/tight chest, but the worst symptoms I get are stomach pains (like butterflies in your stomach but 5x worse), dry mouth, increased heartrate, sweaty palms and feeling like I'm going to die.\n\nFeeling like I have horse blinders on, adrenaline spikes, hot flashes, feeling of doom, horrible nausea, bloating/gas and the need to pace to calm down\n\nitchiness. ruining my life.\n\nNausea, tingling arms &amp; hands, muscle twitching, trouble breathing - alternating between way too hot and shivering - The first time I genuinely had it this bad I had convinced myself I had lung cancer and was dying - I recently had another attack about work stress and in a way I am glad I did because it affirmed to me that I am okay physically - cancer symptoms wouldn't go away for two years and suddenly come back for no reason.\n\nI have so many symptoms that come when I have a wave of anxiety. I feel like my baseline anxiety symptoms are like sinus pressure, headaches, shaking, etc. when I am feeling overly anxious I get the racing heart, shaking, lightheadedness, dizziness and just overall feeling like crap.\n\nPrickly sensation in my forehead.\n\nShaking, heart racing, picking at my lips with my teeth chess tightness, palms sweating and I tend to hold my breath/stop breathing\n\nFor me personally, my body gets really tense, it‚Äôs really difficult to concentrate, I can become overstimulated when it‚Äôs bad, and my mind races. \nSpecifically during an anxiety attack:\nMy breathing gets shorter and more erratic. (It‚Äôs difficult to concentrate on my breathing at this point.)\nFingers experience numbness.\nI get light headed and dizzy. \nThen my legs start shaking uncontrollably. \nFainted once. \n\n\nEverybody and every body reacts differently to their own anxiety. So I also appreciate reading the experiences of others.\n\nMy heart rate goes up, I get the shakes, bad poops, I usually can‚Äôt concentrate very well, I get super fidgety and can‚Äôt sit still.\n\nI don‚Äôt have AS BAD anxiety symptoms as I used to but i remember anxiety gagging. Everytime i would try to eat, i would literally gag and couldn‚Äôt finish my food. Another one is just hyperventilating, whenever I cry or get super anxious it‚Äôs very hard for me to breathe. I remember once my anxiety peaked so much that i felt i was having a heart attack, called 911 and went to the hospital.\n\nI‚Äôve had all the symptoms you‚Äôve described along with dry heaving ( gaging and feeling like I‚Äôm vomiting without actually vomiting at all) along with throat feeling hyper fixation and constant concern that I have some kind of cancer ( I don‚Äôt)\n\nMost of my anxiety comes out in physical symptoms. I get dizzy, I feel light headed almost like I could pass out. I feel sick to my stomach, I get chest pains and start to sweat. My whole body will start shaking. Sometimes I also feel like my throat is closing. All of these are just the small list of things I have dealt with from anxiety.\n\nMuscle twitching and I basically go fight or flight and you can see it all over my face\n\nI literally just feel a quick strike of blood from my heart quickly warming my body and then I almost don‚Äôt feel my hands and feet\n\nA sort of tickling sensation inside the body, especially the limbs, but also the back. Sometimes accompanied by shortness of breath, pressure in the chest and a lump in the throat. All this can be relieved by stretching the body (which lasts only for a while) or by more physical activity. Meditation also helps a little. I don't take any medication (it caused this to me).\n\nI would also include the frequent urge to cry, although that is more of an emotional symptom. But I experience it very physically.\n\n        I get extreme stomach pain and can't eat any oils. People try to comfort me with food and urge me to eat and it just doesn't work. \n    I also tense my jaw and shoulders, get a tummy ache, and feel shovers down my neck and get into flight mode like some rabbit.\n\nI feel dissociated, I begin to either panic or just chill with anxiety‚Ä¶ I have both anxiety attacks and panic attacks. It‚Äôs not very fun. My chest feels like an elephant is on it, my head gets dizzy, I get light headed, I bounce my leg, I will get clammy.. and if it‚Äôs an panic attack the same things happen but things around me feel so far away‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs weird\n\nMine begins with a burning fire feeling in my chest that moves down my arms into my hands almost like my nerves are on fire, I get super shaky, light headed, and racing heart. My stomach gets upset and I end up with an IBS flare on the toilet most of the time.\n\ni start manually breathing and it can go on for hours.... i'll feel like if i don't force myself to breathe i'll just stop. ik that's not true so idk why i can't just make it stop.\n\nI experience; dry skin, muscle twitches and weakness, can't sleep or find it really hard to stay asleep, fatigue, heartburn/tightness in left breast, numb left arm, tension headaches, globus/something stuck in my throat sensation, burning/prickly sensation due to tension on neck, shoulders etc, dry mouth or lots of saliva etc\n\nI get tunnel vision, and my head gets super heavy like a 20 pound dumbbell \n\nIf I am stressed or anxious for a longer period of time like a week or more, then I get terrible back pains which makes it difficult to even get up from bed\n\nmy big one is feeling like my throat is closing. like as if it were physically closing up and like the air isn‚Äôt passing through it. it‚Äôs genuinely scary because I get this really intense physical sensation of being unable to breathe. it really truly no exaggeration feels like I am dying\n\nDiarrhea.\n\nThere‚Äôs almost no physical symptom that you‚Äôre amygdala (fight flight) system can‚Äôt create. It‚Äôs designed to get your attention in order to have you participate in staying safe. But we all fight the symptoms because we don‚Äôt like the symptoms so we create a feedback loop. That simply escalates everything. \n\nI‚Äôve seen everything from people in the ER who we can‚Äôt convince aren‚Äôt having a heart attack, to instant rashes, vision, problems, pass out, ulcers, hemorrhoids, frozen speech‚Ä¶ You name it as long as we set the system up to this regulate, it will keep screaming, louder and louder until we finally back off the fight against it, recognize it as a critical function for survival, and treated like you would a colicky baby. Eventually, it will stop this regulating.\n\nEver heard of those stories of people who can lift a car off their child? That‚Äôs the same system. It can do amazing things.\n\nGoogle  the Anxiety Release Protocol (ARP), that is a multimodality protocol that can help shift you from a hot mess and turn it into your superpower\n\nAnyone else‚Äôs arms go suddenly numb? That‚Äôs how I know when it‚Äôs bad.\n\nI was just going to make a post cause I have been saying I have anxiety but idk if that‚Äôs what it really is.. \n\nfor an example I was suppose to have a neck ultrasound and they told me it would take 45 min. Then I thought about not being able to move for 45 min‚Ä¶ omg what if I move‚Ä¶. What if I get dizzy and pass out‚Ä¶ oh these lights hurt my eyes‚Ä¶  what if I have a panic attack‚Ä¶. What if‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶ if‚Ä¶ my heart started beating fast and I felt like I may pass out and I got irritable and as soon as I left the office it‚Äôs like a wave of calm rushed over me it took awhile to full calm down but leaving the ‚Äúthreat‚Äù helped. \n\nAm I crazy?\n\nRacing heart, night terrors, tremors, feeling of dread, heart palpitations, hyper aware of every movement in my body.\n\nDizziness, not feeling real (like a kind of drunk / high feeling sometimes??), chest pain, random shooting body pains, feeling sick, needing a wee, stomach ache the list goes onnn\n\ndissociated a lot of the time, every time  I step outside it feels like I‚Äôm not real, constant light sensitivity, light headedness, vision issues, stomach issues, fatigue and brain fog.\n\nI have every symptom in the book and then some.¬† Internal tremors,¬† sweating,¬† fainting, nausea,¬† blurred vision, hypersensitive sense of smell,¬† sound,¬† sight,¬† touch. Migraines. Palpitations, strong heart beat, dry mouth,¬† fear and dread,¬† dark thoughts, sore stiff muscles,¬† burning muscles,¬† weakness,¬† chronic fatigue, vertigo, heightened senses. Unable to swallow,¬† muscles spasms under jaw and throat. Breathing difficulties. No appetite.¬† Weight loss. Memory loss.¬† Confusion. Brain fog.¬† Stabbing pains.¬† Joint pain¬† just a few off the top of my head. That's why I think I'm dying most of the time.¬† This isn't now and again,¬† or a bad day, this is 24/7 no break.¬† I'm exhausted and had enough,¬† going on 10 years.¬†\n\nI had a massive panic attack on the 9th August 2024 felt like I was having a stroke since then I have \n\nDizziness/lightheadedness \nBrain fog \nBrain zaps type thing for a few secs \nLegs feel like jelly and the ground is moving under me.\nNeck pain at the back of neck\nHeadaches \nScared of passing out \nChest pain randomly \nHeart palpitations \nFlushed face \nBuzzing especially at night while laying down \nClenching teeth\nOff balance feeling \nExtremely Fatigued \nRinging in ears \nEar pressure \n\n\nIt's been 4 weeks EVERYDAY of these symptoms I sleep like a baby I'm so knackered wake up still feeling like crap has anyone else had symptoms the whole time for a long period of time. I'm not on any medication and it absolutely sucks. \n\nSomeone HELP!!!!!!"

    "all_comment_text": "Retired corporate job and now work at a doggie daycare. Anxiety went from 1000 to about 10. I play with puppies all day and haven‚Äôt needed Ativan in months.\n\nIt‚Äôs my dream to work at a doggy daycare and open my own eventually!\n\nI worked at one a couple years ago. They are lovely if you're a huge dog lover like me. But be advised that the barking is very loud and nonstop. You have no choice but to get used to that if you're working with dozens of dogs at a time. Also, cleaning up their piss and shit was a constant too. Literally every 5 minutes someone went potty on the floor of the play room. Walks are multiple times a day for most dogs, too. Mostly though you do get to play with them and cuddle a lot. But it is very much a job.\n\nAlso the pay is quite mediocre most of the time and hours are not often full-time. Even then you may want to consider a second job if you live alone. This is not to discourage you!! Just some realistic factors to consider beforehand.\n\nYou made enough to retire what\n\nI ran the sustainability program for a Fortune 500 company.  And I can only retire now because my husband of 22 years died suddenly 2 years ago and his retirement assets rolled over to me. Otherwise I‚Äôd have to work another 10 years (I‚Äôm 57 now).\n\nI wish you much luck and joy in the future.\n\nCan relate. Can‚Äôt wait to leave the business environment and do something with less pressure‚Ä¶ working with animals, flowers or even just making coffee at a small cafe would be ideal\n\nI am currently at a top 3 compay listed, and I seriously envy your job. I‚Äôm happy that your anxiety dropped and you live a better life, I‚Äôll reach there one day.\n\nMiddle school teacher üíÄ\n\nYou are out there doing the LORDS work\n\nAMEN üôè\n\nKindergarten teacher‚Ä¶ just changed careers to school psychologist\n\nI‚Äôm a school psychologist as well and sometimes that anxiety be getting me during my report out at an IEP. But I make it through. It‚Äôs helpful i work alone most the time.\n\n[removed]\n\nCan I ask how exactly did that help you?\n\nHigh school teacher checking in. 80% of my anxiety is work based.\n\nI bet!!!!!!\n\nYou are a special person!\n\nHey me too! What a frigging year, down to the last 4 weeks!\n\nHigh school teacher here. It's like we are asking to have anxiety issues at this point.\n\nOh God I am TERRIFIED of middle schoolers üòÇüòÇ\n\nSame. HELP\n\nI‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with the parents\n\nAttorney.  One of the main reasons I have anxiety.\n\nWow, I can imagine üòÖ\n\nI worked as a legal sec/assistant for my whole career and i lost 10 years off my life! Omg\n\nI‚Äôm a divorce attorney, so same ü´†\n\nSame\n\nSame.\n\nEntering my second year as a solicitor. Aging quickly\n\nIronically air traffic controller\n\nAre we really safe up there? I have horrible airplane anxiety üò≠\n\nWe are so safe in planes. Those things are so over engineered there‚Äôs like 5 backups for everything and the stress tolerance for everything is unimaginably high. Planes are a lot stronger and safer than most people know.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI‚Äôm a commercial pilot! Thank you for all you do to keep us safe! \n\nMay I ask, TRACON, tower or something else?\n\nRight now I‚Äôm working at an AIC doing flight following but I‚Äôve worked at towers before in military\n\nWatering plants by hand at a huge plant nursery. I throw my earbuds in and do my thing. It took me a long time to find something I could do outside the house. I came on as a seasonal worker. When I realized it was good for me, I let them know I was interested in staying on permanently. It has been almost 2 years. This is the longest I have lasted at a job in a long time.\n\nOh wow, I would love this. Watering my garden is one thing that grounds me.\n\nThat sounds super chill! Love that.\n\nThis is my dream job as well. May I ask if it‚Äôs a private nursery or a box retail store? I JUST want to water the plants (and anything else to do with the nursery but prefer next to none interacting with the public).\n\nI‚Äôm about to be a bartender, barback, and food attendant/runner for a casino. \n\nI‚Äôm sick of killing myself in a warehouse to not get by.\n\n**ETA:** My tribe owns four casinos total between Michigan and Indiana (3 in MI, 1 in IND). I‚Äôm actually working at the two satellite casinos in MI, not just one like I applied for. Also just need to pass the physical on Wednesday (which I will).\n\nThat's a rough position but if you can work in a warehouse, you can do this for sure! Rooting for you. üëç\n\nThank you! I definitely expect a lot to learn and overcome in terms of anxiety, BUT I‚Äôm so sick of learning everything in warehouses just to get passed up for promotions. Like my last job where I knew more than quite a few people in my department, let alone the entire warehouse because I worked in every department. \n\nI really hope I can do this, because it‚Äôs my tribe‚Äôs casino. Honestly I just applied for barback and pt. They turned it into a dual-rate ft job. I hope I don‚Äôt let anyone down.\n\nYou got this!! When I was a little younger I took a job at a hotel restaurant and I was the only bartender, only bar back, the only waitress, only cook (for breakfast, for dinner they found real cooks lol) and opened/closed the whole damn show. If I can do it, I know you can. Congrats on your new start!! You‚Äôll pick it up faster thank you realize! üíú\n\nThat‚Äôs insane! Thanks! I‚Äôll take a breath and handle my anxiety like before a boxing or BJJ spar. I can‚Äôt wait to start learning!\n\nThere's not hoping to do this, there's doing it. You have this in the bag for sure. Try not to stress about it as much, this isn't as crayzy as a job as you might think me mentally. Keep your cool, act normal, and that's all there is to it. You will succeed and enjoy another period of time through your anxiety and do well. Be Positive. Think positive. It's all good.\n\nYoure right, the time for hoping was when I applied not now. Now it‚Äôs time to touch gloves, force life into the corner, and throw those counters. Make them continually run back to the center of the ring to reset. \n\nThank you.\n\nNursing unit secretary in a hospital. 12 hour shifts. It can be pure torture.\n\nwe appreciate you and you are so underrated\n\nThank you. The nurses are my hero‚Äôs. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è But it‚Äôs my weekend to work , and I‚Äôm here and feel like I‚Äôm dying. Counting down the hours until I can go home to my safe space.\n\nElectronics tech in a factory. My job is nice for my social anxiety. I spend a lot of time by myself troubleshooting broken equipment and spend very little time in meetings. All of my socializing is with the 3 other techs I work with and we all get along and help each other out.\n\nI have two. My first is retail (ewwwwww) and my second is a research assistant for my college professor. My team and I are transcribing children's diaries from 1830s-1920s. We have diaries from all over the United States, UK, and New Zealand. I wish this job lasted forever because I love it so much, but I will say now it is a full summer job because we got another grant to extend through July now! :D\n\nI used to be a research assistant for my prof then I had a panic attack because my data won‚Äôt translate properly while using the software I created (it eventually did but it took longer then expected) so I respond he kicked me out as ‚ÄúI was a liability‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs awful :(. What‚Äôs nice about mine is it‚Äôs all at your own pace and time and at home. She is super supportive and has always answered all our questions and then some! But that‚Äôs terrible you were fired over having a panic attack because of something that is a very big deal to you.\n\nWaitressing! When it gets busy, I don't have time to think of my anxiety. (Of course, with the exception of feeling physical pain, then I start to worry but quickly forget.)\n\nThat sounds nice üò≠ when i‚Äôm overstimulated and anxious my anxiety overpowers more and I get overwhelmed and like frozen unsure what to do next espically in school\n\nFair! I sometimes freeze up, I get overstimulated when it's loud, it's understandable! I just try to push through it until the rest in between rushes. When it's my break time, then I decompress (or try to, anyway, not always successful). It's not a perfect job but I'm happy with what I earn and I'm happy for the friendships and connections I've made so far. :)\n\nIronically, waitressing really helped me deal with my social anxiety - Dealing with strangers all the time really improved my social skills and the physical work makes it easy to fall asleep at night.\n\nI‚Äôm a waitress too and this is true I forget about everything some days I‚Äôm so busy lol\n\nCleaning houses. I Make my own schedule, and can reschedule whenever I need to.\n\nMe too. I like it when the clients are out and I can listen to podcasts/music. Awful when they are home tho (cause of my social anxiety)\n\nCase manager but I recently quit. The office setting was horrible. Everyone thought ‚ÄúI was too good‚Äù to hang out and talk in the hallways I kept saying I was just introverted which I am but really it was anxiety\n\nI've received this \"feedback\" too. Meanwhile, we'd love the friendship and human connection but judgemental rude co workers make the anxiety worse.\n\nPayroll specialist! Fully remote and decent pay. About 98% of my interaction with coworkers is through email. I do get anxious on processing days, but that‚Äôs only a few times a month so it‚Äôs not too bad.\n\nHow did you get into this?\n\nHonestly I just got really lucky! I started off with no payroll experience, so I applied for an entry level position paying $17/hr. The pay wasn‚Äôt great, but it got my foot in the door. Then I took one more payroll job after that before I got my current role making $27/hr. My advice is to apply for entry level positions to start. And then work your way up. For remote work, my advice would be to look for local jobs instead of searching remote. A lot of local jobs offer remote work but may not advertise it. That‚Äôs what happened in my case.\n\nAww great for you!!! I‚Äôm a dance/cheerleading coach at an all-star cheer gym, it‚Äôs the only job I have right now &amp; it‚Äôs part time (I‚Äôm still recovering from an absolutely traumatizing 6 months as a substitute teacher). We have a payroll specialist/accountant for our gym who works remotely. I‚Äôve only ever interacted with her over the phone and via email, but she‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôm sure you are as well!!\n\nI‚Äôm a lawyer. Anxiety makes my job a lot harder than I wish it was but I manage.\n\nZookeeper, the anxiety helps with keeping the locks locked lol\n\nI‚Äôm a lunch monitor (4 hour shift /5 days a week, summers off) at my son‚Äôs elementary school. Prior to that I was a stay at home mom for like 10 years. My mental state has always been a hiderance even it comes to employment. We‚Äôve been lucky that my husband has a strong income.\n\nI have a bachelors degree in economics but I basically had a breakdown after college and never really recovered as far as my career path goes.  My OCD is well managed now so I‚Äôm trying to get back into the workforce and it‚Äôs going well!\n\nMy anxiety got so bad that I had a nervous breakdown (Feb 2023). Was so sick from it I spent 6 months recovering, unemployed. Now am working as a research assistant in cancer research, part time. I do all the scut work, but don't have to handle the public or even talk to my co-workers much while continuing to recover.\n\nHigh school counselor\n\nBut I haven't been doing well with attendance\n\nI‚Äôm in retail at a grocery store and I hate it so much\n\nMedical coder. I got very lucky and got hired into a remote position as my first job. All communication is email or slack. We do have meetings occasionally but most are not interactive. No direct contract with providers like in some coding positions. It‚Äôs the most perfect introvert/anxious person job I‚Äôve found. Just wish it made a bit more money. üò¨\n\nHave any tips or recommendations? my girlfriend wants to pursue this because you can work from home.\n\nIt can be a long road finding a job. I got incredibly lucky finding the job I did because most new coders don‚Äôt get to work remotely right away. It‚Äôs becoming harder and harder. Even the company I work for now no longer hires new coders (CPC-A). As far as getting into it, find a reputable school to get the training (I used careerstep which some people had a lot of issues with, but I had no problems with them so ymmv). \nOnce you actually get to the job-hunting part, unless you get lucky, you will likely have to take either on-site jobs to get experience (many will then let you go remotely after some time), or taking ‚Äúfoot in the door‚Äù jobs with the hopes that you can move into coding somewhere.\n\nI work as a lunch lady for an elementary school, and it's the easiest, most unstressful job I ever had. My hours are the same everyday 7am to 2 Monday thru Friday weekends off holidays off and paid for and summers off. Another bonus is it's a minute away from my house\n\nYou're living one of my dreams, doll. üíú\n\nMarketing executive ‚úåüèª\n\nSame! Although I work in an agency and clients stress me so much I‚Äôm tired üò≠\n\nSame but I think all agency sucks so bad. I really think working in an internal marketing department where you don‚Äôt rely on big asshole brand clients would be better. I‚Äôm a senior manager and make 100k working from home, but it blows. I work insane hours. I‚Äôm never off basically and the stress is killer. The clients constantly push for more and we never have any boundaries because they can easily leave us and take their 3 million yearly budget with them and basically all of our jobs too, not mine since I manage multiple large brands but there would be big layoffs\n\nNone. I'm on disabilities (Wajong for Dutch people on this subreddit). But I volunteer in a second hand store once a week, which I love doing.\n\nDog walker &amp; Pet Sitter in NYC üôÉ Some days are amazing and some are pure hell, constantly being outside around so many unhinged people and on the subway twelve times a day is def taking its toll on me\n\nironically, a psychologist. It affects my work, but it doesn't originate there, It often helps to have contact with other lives and people in pain, not because it is pleasurable, but because it gives me a sense of meaning in life, of being able to contribute to the person‚Äôs process. \n\nBut yes, I feel guilt and a worse psychologist than my colleagues, for suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. Even though I know that it is not a question of personal value, but rather an illness, the feeling and anguish are blinding.\n\nI‚Äôm in the mental health field as well. We understand our patients better than our colleagues because we‚Äôve been there. Not that it‚Äôs a competition but there‚Äôs a reason why we‚Äôre in this type of work because we get it!\n\nNursing\n\nRegistered Nurse here. It‚Äôs where 99% of my anxiety comes from\n\naww I just graduated and have been applying for so many positions, any advice??\n\nRemote customer service. Answering phone calls, chats, emails etc. its pretty fun for the most part. I enjoy it.\n\nUsed to be in sales. That was the worst\n\nTeaching, but I‚Äôm heavily medicated üòÇ\n\nWhat medication üòÖ im considering either leaving the teaching field or also getting heavily medicated because it makes my anxiety insane\n\ncurrently working as a janitor\n\nUSPS, by myself a majority of the day driving.\n\nMining... kick it in a machine by myself for 12 hours listening to podcasts üëå\n\nThat sounds dope\n\nAccounting. It definitely contributes to my anxiety and stress. But I would be more scared to work somewhere irregular and not have a reliable income stream, I think. Both are not ideal :)\n\nER nurse but I‚Äôm switching specialties thankfully. This job has exacerbated my anxiety severely.\n\nI can‚Äôt thank you enough for what you do but can completely understand the impact this would have on one‚Äôs anxiety. Happy for you to be switching specialities!\n\nSince I started my job, I've had the option to work from home, but never wanted to until my latest bout of anxiety. I moved in with my BF and started working remotely. I don't get nearly as muxh physical activity as I did in the office, but other that that, it's been okay. Glad to hear I'm not the only one who did this.\n\nI recently started working remotely and it‚Äôs been great so far. I was looking into those desk treadmills and standing desks. I think those would help with the movements and exercise throughout the day\n\nProgram manager. \n\nInvesting in my mental health to build a better relationship with anxiety has undoubtedly spurred a second growth phase in my career.\n\nCinematographer üé•\n\nHow do I get into this line of work, I post my cinematography on TikTok under the name @hystericfilms (I‚Äôm 19 and use a Sony a7iii)\n\nI'm in nursing school. I'm stepping waaaay out of my box. About 5 years ago I also struggled to leave my house. Even now I order groceries online and pick them up because I don't think I can make it through the grocery store alone. Everyday is a struggle but I keep persisting the best I can through school. It's hard for me to not be at home even though I desire to be out and about. I think my fellow classmates think I'm quirky.\n\nI'm an RN. Terrible social anxiety. It gets better the more you do it. Definitely not always easy, but I just keep pushing through. Most days are pretty manageable at this point.\n\nKeep pushing through! You got this. I‚Äôm a teacher and feel the same way. But going to work physically has helped my anxiety a ton. Staying home isolated makes it way worse for me personally.\n\nI'm in a similar position. Social anxiety bad enough to make me holed up at home, but desiring to go outside and see the nature, and in nursing school. I'm in my 2nd year in univ. It's nice to know there are others like me somewhere in the world...but I've yet to meet someone irl.\n\nMedical billing\n\nI‚Äôm considering getting into this but really not sure where to start. Any tips?\n\nI started by going to Ross Medical Education Center which had a 9 month long program that was based in medical Coding &amp; billing. Once I got that education, I signed up for an AAPC membership and studied medical doing (self paced course), took the exam on 2017 &amp; then just recently finished the billing course through AAPC. \n\nI will say, you won't find a job doing billing &amp; coding right away. You will have to start by doing reception, medical records , etc to move up somewhere. I started at an urgent care, then did reception &amp; coding/some billing at a small private office and now I'm a billing supervisor for a hospital\n\nI love that! I'm studying medical billing and coding right now. My next class starts on the 17th. I'm nervous because we're finally going to be learning about codes and how to use them and I'm afraid that I won't be able to understand it ü´†\n\nYou will be just fine! Once you fet the gist of it, it's easy! ICD-10 doing is the easiest. CPT is harder, I don't like cardiology at all - it's very complex! I do billing and coding for a family practice so it's fairly easy. You can always ask me questions :)\n\nadministrative assistant\n\nme too, I hate it, the office that I work for is very social and I mostly struggle with social anxiety. but i‚Äôm terrified of every other option, so I don‚Äôt even look for other jobs\n\nTeacher. It sucks. I hate it. Exploring other options. Too overstimulating, too much responsibility, meetings, parents, preparation. I just don‚Äôt think I want to do it\n\nI totally agree‚Ä¶I‚Äôm also exploring other options. But I used a Teach Grant to get my masters and technically have to teach for 2 more years. Not sure if I can handle the pressure though.\n\nI wish wish wish I had a job I could do from home and I don't know what to take or where to apply to get one.\n\nI work lousy retail and it is extremely difficult for me sometimes.\n\nSocial secretary, children and their families\n\nI'm a nurse and was a PCT for 3 years prior, it was *awful* in the beginning lol I had to learn how to compartmentalize my anxiety. Even then, there are some days where before work I'm like freaking out nearly in a panic attack. I appreciate it though because it taught me how to get out of my head and get used to being anxious in public settings.\n\nReservations coordinator at a hotel\n\nI‚Äôm a journalist!\n\nMarketing &amp; Communications Coordinator\n\nI recently left teaching for a cushy government job and 95% of my anxiety has diminished. I send emails all day in the comfort of a private office. Zero regrets.\n\nHealthcare. The worst kind of job you can have a person with anxiety. I‚Äôm not complaining tho\n\nwork remotely at an online styling company. i basically cannot work in person and will probably be forced to work for low wages at remote companies forever üò≠\n\nWhat kind of work is online styling?\n\nLibrary associate! I'm still in school though and I'm aiming to be a histology tech :)\n\nParts Counterperson at a car dealership. Terrible for anxiety as you are almost always trying to do 3 things at once.\n\nNetwork administrator for the govt, WFH.  My anxiety is all tied to my personal life, so I actually feel better when I'm working.  It sucks not being able to relax.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI‚Äôm a social worker üôÉüôÉüôÉ\n\nLicensed vet tech and licensed social worker. The SW Job allows me to work remotely. I can also provide vet nursing advice remotely.\n\nIm currently working to become a programmer, fully remote and makes really good money.\n\nNo job! Fuck people!\n\nCashiering at a high school. It wasn't a choice I applied for food service to be in the background of the kitchen but they just kind of pushed me up front to cashier and it makes my anxiety so bad because the students do not even know what distancing is they are literally an inch away from my face or crowding around me all of the time. My manager asked me did I want to come back for the next school year and I said yes but I am having second thoughts I want a job where I can be alone or work in the background.\n\nEvent planner / communications director for small town government. I am basically Leslie Knope.\n\nNursing and yes anxious all the time on and off job!\n\nI clean hotel rooms. I am on my own most of the day so its very stress free for me. And when I leave work I don't have anything I have to do at home. I can switch off. I don't think I could work from home. Im a terrible procrastinator and its good for me to get out of the house.\n\nOn my days off my anxiety is a lot worse and I have no energy.\n\nworking with mentally disabled people, feeling my best at work :)\n\nElectronic and PC repair\n\nWorkers comp and liability claims\n\nIm in operations so I don't directly talk with the injured people butI part of my job is read and analyzing claim notes.. Careful out there everyone. Crazy shit can happen to anyone.\n\nSenior Digital Publisher (publishing website content)\n\nI‚Äôm a server and it‚Äôs honestly not too bad, except when I get double sat or something goes wrong with a payment. That shit triggers my anxiety bad\n\nSelf employed taxi driver here\n\nFully remote software engineer\n\nSurprised this is the only one of these I‚Äôve seen so far, besides the person currently learning. I thought we were all huge balls of anxiety just slamming code in the dark all day.\n\nI‚Äôve been in sales for around 12 years now. It definitely doesn‚Äôt help my anxiety, but man I feel like a rockstar for just being able to pull it off. \n\nAwesome to see so many folks in here with high stress jobs pulling it off. Congrats, troopers!\n\nsocial services &amp; it is completely debilitating. really wanna transition to the data analytics &amp; research world, something remote by all means\n\nI work stocking shelves and do my best to keep to myself. Only interact with customers really on the weekends and use breaks and lunch to decompress\n\nI'm a Spanish teacher, paradoxically my job is almost the only thing that makes me happy. Every work day I'm very happy I have the opportunity to teach people and talk to them since languages are my passion. \n\nEverything else makes me anxious lol\n\nI‚Äôm a kennel technician. I work at a rescue and my shifts are all worked alone so I thrive off of the isolation.\n\nIronically I‚Äôm a mental health professional\n\n I managed a ski hill for years and it caused me insane anxiety. I developed anxious tics and would struggle to fall asleep at night because I hated the person I had to be at that job.\nNow I‚Äôm a wastewater operator and spend a lot of time alone and not dealing with customers. My anxiety levels have improved!\n\nBank back office\n\nI was a teacher but my anxiety was through the roof so I left teaching a few years ago and now work as a Virtual Assistant and I specialize in email marketing and customer support/inbox management\n\nyouth librarian üòá\n\nI work from home to and I don‚Äôt even have to deal with people or calls but I still have bad anxiety while I work.\n\nI get stressed when family or roommates couldn't grasp the idea that I am actually working and not just sitting in front of the computer lol\n\nI once got asked by my Dad to run an errand to the supermarket while I was at a meeting ü§£\n\nI work in criminal justice. It massively made my anxiety worse\n\nI‚Äôm a lawyer and will probably die prematurely of a heart attack bc the daily anxiety is A LOT at my job\n\nData Analyst. 90% remote. 10% travel. Remote is great for my anxiety levels.\n\nI do outdoor work. Brush clearing, limb trees, defensive space, weed eradication, etc. And other jobs that come up like blowing off roofs, pressure washing houses, waxing cars, etc.\n\nLifeguarding for a themepark, although my anxiety has gotten heaps better in recent years :)\n\nYouth counselor! Because of what I've experienced in mental health, I work with children and youth who struggle in the same ways. It's very rewarding work, and can be very healing :)\n\nFunny story. I am the General Manager of a hotel. On top of dealing with guests I also manage a team of 20 employees. It‚Äôs pretty funny to think about because I originally got into hospitality to get over my social anxiety and it‚Äôs helped a lot!\n\nHahaha... Therapist in private practice. I work 18ish hours a week, one of the days is from home. Being able to stay home 5 days a week is really beneficial to my symptom management.\n\nParamedic, my anxiety makes it so i don‚Äôt get tired on long shifts and also helps me zone in when shit gets real\n\nI‚Äôve had generalized anxiety since I was 13 I work as an emt and at a volunteer fire department\n\naccountant in a corporate. currently I can work from home which is much better for my anxiety\n\nPsych hospital tech per diem.\n\nLots of social work, lots of therapy groups\n\nFull time behaviorist at a k-8 school.\n\nLots of social work, lots of of social emotional learning groups\n\nI‚Äôve been grooming dogs for 13 years. I also work the kennels and reception when grooming is slow at a dog boarding facility. It can be anxiety inducing when a dog is bad but I have a lot of patience for animals. The true anxiety is having a shitty customer who just treats me and/or the dog bad. Worrying the won‚Äôt like the haircut or understand why I needed to do something or they lie. And I have anxiety about cutting dogs. It‚Äôs literally the worst feeling for weeks/months when that happens. My body also hurts really bad. I have a pinched nerve in my neck and tendonitis. I know I won‚Äôt be able to do it forever but I‚Äôve been working with dogs for 16 years and don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd go from here. Now that causes me the greatest anxiety. I would kill for a remote position one day.\n\nIn 2011 I did corporate tech support. They made money per call, so they actually wouldn't let me send out memos with tips to prevent most of the issues.\n\nAround the one year mark, it was pizza day. I got up, picked up a sheet pizza (one good supervisor winked at me and told me to go ahead) and walked out.\n\nFrom then on I've been doing in-home tech support for seniors. No cubicle prison, nobody telling me what to do or where to go. I eat wherever I want every day. I just go to old folks' living rooms, so I feel like I'm at home. I reset their passwords, make sure they're not paying too much for their Internet, and get them away from AOL.\n\nRecovery Peer Specialist at a suicide prevention non-profit called Here Tomorrow. Thankful that I‚Äôm able to make my suffering from anxiety worth it in that I‚Äôm able to understand and support other people going through it.\n\nPeer Support Specialist. I talk to people struggling with mental health and addiction. I‚Äôm pretty new to it, I got into it after I got sober.\n\nAn ER nurse in a busy hospital. I weirdly don‚Äôt have anxiety about my job. I have anxiety about my body, family, and current events. Work allows me to not think about myself for 12 hours.\n\nNightshift away from people...Hard to sleep sometimes but easier for me\n\nI have a job can make 3k a week,but¬†\nIt suxs...¬† Rather make $1200 and¬†\nBe happy..I've had a lot of money¬†\nAnd i was not happy ...¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm a dasher and sometimes I spark on the side bc I hate regular jobs. I can't stand dealing with ppl who are mean and come to places like the gas station and fast food places to take their anger out on the workers. They're mean and nasty, entitled, condescending, and honestly just hateful and rude as hell. I like dashing bc it helps me pay my half of the bills, pays for food and gas, my daughters clothes, and no one can tell me when I can and can't see my baby. I also have anxiety and depression and not having nosy coworkers or an overbearing boss helps me deal with it better than if I had all of that drama in my life.\n\nCommercial HVAC/R and kitchen equipment\n\nServer/bartender, the fast pace is a wonderful distraction! If I feel anxious on my way to work, I always feel better a couple hours in. I try to remind myself that on super bad days. Also being social with my coworkers helps a lot.\n\nA Nurse\n\nI‚Äôve got an internship in learning design for the English department where I attend university. So far, it‚Äôs all remote, overhauling a Campus LMS course used to share resources among instructors. It‚Äôs fun, but I‚Äôm in Vocational Rehabilitation through the VA. I couldn‚Äôt afford this sweet deal before I got partial disability.\n\nI work in retail. Yeah, it‚Äôs not the best thing for anxiety.\n\nCashier.\n\nI'm a piercing apprentice but hopefully in a year I'll be an APP piercer! My goal when I was a kid was to be a mortician but school and college was too difficult for me. I tried Web Development but that fell flat. I'm happy to be where I am. Took me a long time to get here.\n\nNurses in here im gonna need yall to step out I can‚Äôt have people with the same mental problems as I have in hospital settings üòÇ i‚Äôm kidding but how the hell do you do it? Hospitals give me intense anxiety people coding and fucking dying around you\n\nMod pizza lmao got the job because it will work for my schedule when I go to school to become a surgical technologist\n\nBarista. I have horrible social anxiety but I know I'm good at my job where dealing with confrontation is rare. I basically get to listen to music and make cute lil drinks to make people happy all day. Some days are worse than others and I'm usually drained by the end of the day.\n\nPilot üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è\n\nSecurities operations manager. Financial advisors and their assistants. Ironically I spend a large chunk of time calming people down when they make $$ mistakes and acting as a therapist to my 30+ direct reports."

    "all_comment_text": "Slow, steady breaths. Talking to someone who can reassure me I'm safe. Playing with a fidget. Drinking very cold water or herbal tea. Crying.\n\nYou can get through this. It sucks, but it will pass.\n\nThank you for your kind words ‚ú®üíï\n\nOh yes, crying about it really does help. It‚Äôs like a release, letting go of the feelings. It‚Äôs also about being compassionate with yourself and understanding that it‚Äôs a difficult time. Good answer!\n\nYeah also jumping into a very cold shower or pool snaps me out of it. I also hate it so much but it shocks my nervous system into a reboot.\n\nChallenge it to get worse, say bring it on, tell it to kill u... nothing will happen and your mind will start to settle, treat anxiety like a bully that u are finally standing up to. Takes courage but please try. Best of luck my friend\n\nDude, that's beautiful, thank you!\n\nThank you for this advice, I‚Äôve never tried this before but I feel like it might work.\n\n I tried this now I‚Äôm dead thanks!\n\nI exercise as intensely as I‚Äôm able. I will run or do buprpies or something to try to burn it off. I do this until I‚Äôm having a hard time catching my breath. Usually by this time it‚Äôs gone.\n\nhow do you get yourself into the workout mode? when my anxiety is acting up (pretty much all the time lmao) it's so difficult to even get the strength to move\n\nAh, I get the flight side of fight flight or freeze. I can‚Äôt sit still. Some times I will literally wake up jumping to my feet if it gets me at night.\n\nI used to do this , this can also be caused by sinus issues when you cannot breath your brain thinks sonething is wrong and JOLTS you awake heart racing .adrenaline 100+...... Started using the breathright nasal strip across my nose .....problem solved.\n\nLike a breath right strip?\n\nPretty sure that's what he means. \n\nI have a friend was getting doom gloom in mornings was sleep apnea.\n \nHe has some medical approved thing that is not cpap that is works well and doesn't have any moving parts.\n\nYes exactly.....\n\nSame pops me awake early morning\n\nI get this intensely whenever I smoke weed (very seldom) It catalyzes me into pushups and burpees in a mad dash to burn off the anxiety.\n\nI am also a \"curl into a ball under the covers and panic\" person. Everyone has their own unique response to anxiety, so do whatever you need to do for yourself in that moment and know that as long as you're not endangering yourself or others, and it helps, then it's okay.\n\nI found my anxiety was often like this and I got sick of feeling unable to do much - exercise could be something to work toward, but if you are frozen, could meditation be an option?        \n\nIt‚Äôs just that I figured on days where i felt I could only do nothing but sit there, I set myself to at least trying to do that in a productive way (I.e. mediation). I think when my anxiety was at its worst I‚Äôd often sit for 1-2 hours at a time, as I didn‚Äôt have the energy to do much else.\n\nI usually start with rubbing my chest slowly while controlling my breathes. After that I just do something simple like stretches. Then I can get up move. You have to build it up in increments to get it in motion\n\nI think I‚Äôll try this. Thank you !\n\nCount how many times I‚Äôve felt like it was the end and then realise I‚Äôm batting 0 on guessing when I‚Äôm going to faint or die.\n\nThis is making me laugh because same üòÇ\n\nlexapro and therapy\n\nWhen did you start taking the lexapro?\n\nI started 5 days ago (5mg) and it is already helping a lot tbh.\n\nI was prescribed lexapro and it worked great but completely ruined my libido. Also eventually got the twitching side effects a few months in (apparently its rare but if that happens tell your doctor or therapist) and had to taper off ü•≤\n\nHave you tried to work out? Maybe that helps for the libido\n\nI've never heard about working out helping but I suppose I could've tried that! I'm off my meds now\n\nI started about 9 months ago, I‚Äôm at 20 mg and it works very well for me.\n\ni‚Äôve been taking lexapro for 4 weeks :)\n\nStarted lexapro some weeks ago and man do I feel *great*.\n\nDo you really?  I‚Äôve been taking it for over 2 years and still have horrible anxiety. Like OP said impending doom. And always tense. And no energy.\n\nHave you started implementing healthy habits? Like working out and eating clean?\n\nI never realized how important this is until I started running and eating better.  I had 6 cookies last night on a bender and have felt like crap all day lol\n\nYea I work out everyday and watch what I eat\n\nHow tolerable were the side effects if any?\n\nI‚Äôd say the worst side effect I had was insomnia- I didn‚Äôt get any sleep for a night and a half- *however*, I believe that‚Äôs primarily because I took it late in the afternoon and it was my first time taking it. Started taking them early in the morning and haven‚Äôt had any problems with sleep since! \n\nThere was also a little nausea, but honestly it wasn‚Äôt that bad compared to the nausea my anxiety gives me. I also feel somewhat twitchier than usual but it‚Äôs not something I notice often or that‚Äôs really that bad. \n\nSo, overall I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs been pretty good in terms of side effects!\n\nThanks for sharing. Did you start with 5 or 10mg?\n\nThe first tablet I took was 10mg. However, after the insomnia, I decided to ease onto it by taking 5mg. After about two weeks I believe, I started taking 10mg again.\n\nMy anxiety got to this point and i decided to start EMDR therapy. I had a great talk therapist for years (still have her) but we realized whatever I was dealing with was going a lot deeper, so EMDR has helped me re-wire how I think about my safety, basically. I didn't realize I was constantly feeling unsafe and had that \"bracing\" feeling all the time. it was exhausting.\n\nI‚Äôm in the process of EMDR rn and have only done a few sessions. How is going for you so far? Has it helped?\n\nI am the same. I have done talk therapy for 11 years. And I gave done a few sessions of EMDR, but it scares me for some reason. Has it helped? What are your thoughts/experiences with it?\n\ngo outside and run as far as you can until you‚Äôre tired. works insanely well.\n\nI would love to work my way up this, but I have fears of my heart giving out when I get up to the 150bpm range. I‚Äôm working to overcome this though so I can exercise more intensely\n\nThis. Thats the problem isn‚Äôt it. Health anxiety is ass.\n\nYou could try challenging your heart to stop. I lived with that fear for decades and gradually defeated it by telling it ‚Äúgo ahead and stop if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to do‚Äù. Of course your heart isn‚Äôt going to stop but gradually the habit pattern of your mind will change and you‚Äôll lose that fear. You have to directly confront this fear, don‚Äôt distract yourself with exercise, meditation or nice thoughts just yet. After innumerable medical tests, blood tests and other medical examinations I couldn‚Äôt avoid the obvious: my heart was perfectly healthy. At one emergency room visit the doctor said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the healthiest person we‚Äôve seen all week‚Äù. I was either going to go home and continue being worried about my excellent health while laying in bed wondering if my heart was going too fast, missing too many beats, or I was going to confront these fears. The very first time I challenged my heart to stop I went from nearly crisis anxiety to falling asleep within a few minutes. That wasn‚Äôt the end of it and I had to struggle for a couple more years but it was clear that I had made a breakthrough and those couple of years felt like running downhill. You can do it too.\n\nYou could try yoga. Much gentler on the heart. Helps ease anxiety, I find, mainly because I'm focusing on the poses my body is doing and less on \"oh shit this thing is about to happen.\"\n\nAnd I like to write down the things that clog up my mind; I've heard it described as \"writing them down means they exist in the physical world, and not in my brain.\" There's a paper shredder in my study that's hungry. Write it, shred it.\n\nThis is a great idea thank you\n\nOk, the general rule for your heart rate max is 220 then subtract your age. Unless you're over 70, 150bpm is nowhere near dangerous, or if you actually have a heart condition, then consult your cardiologist on how high you can let your heart rate go. I am turning 48 in a few months m, so that would put me at a max of 172. I am in pt for my hip and it has been feeling better and it really only gives me problems on inclines, so I have been pushing it more and more. Last week, I pushed it up a steep hill getting over 180bpm and it didn't give me any kind of chest pain, my heart didn't feel like it was going to explode or anything. I was just out of breath and came down to a brisk walk and it did take about 7-8 minutes to allow myself to get under 120, then I pushed again. Like I said, unless you're pretty old or have heart issues, 150bpm is nowhere near dangerous.\n\nTo be honest, running isn‚Äôt for everyone. Heavy muscle work is more effective at calming the nervous system anyway like bike riding, dumbbells or digging in the garden.\n\nReminding myself that I shouldn't worry about things that are out of my control. I shouldn't worry about things that haven't happened yet. Focus on the moment and enjoy every minute you have. You won't get that moment back so why not make the most of it. üíô‚úå\n\nThis is very helpful. Thank you!\n\nThe Rootd app has made a huge improvement in my anxiety attack management. There's a literal Big Red Button to hit when I'm starting to spiral, and it provides some reassurance via text, and also voice if you want. I've totally sat in the dark with my eyes closed, hitting the button over and over when there's one I really need to hear in the moment, like \"even though this feels very scary and real right now, I am not actually in danger. I am safe.\" \n\nThey have features like journaling, as well as lessons about how anxiety works, what the body and brain do during anxiety, etc. Admittedly, I don't take full advantage of those features at this time, but would like to eventually. Right now though, the access to someone calmly reassuring me, as many times as I need to hear it, when I feel myself spinning and feel like I'm dying is priceless.\n\ni used to be this way all the time. like insane bouts of adrenaline boosts to the point i thought i was gonna pass out.\n\ni stopped paying attention to it &amp; it eventually went away on its own. i still get really insane adrenaline rushes sometimes but the less you pay attention to it the quicker it'll go away\n\nI‚Äôm trying to learn that, but it takes practice I guess\n\nit took me dozens of trips to the hospital and several breakdowns before i was able to push it away.\n\nwhen i feel those adrenaline rushes coming on i don't sit and focus and try to breathe through it, i immediately push it out of my brain and don't even give it acknowledgment. it's hard at first and it took me a good 6 months to get to where im at now but its possible!\n\nThank you so much for this, going to try it.\n\nStaring at the horizon does it for me. \n\nWhenever I feel so full of doubts, fears and anxiety I go visit the beach and stare at the sunset or just the waves. Even going at night at the beach feels liberating enough and makes all my problems insignificant and futile. \n\nI know we have different coping mechanisms but I hope this works for you too. \n\nHugs OP. You‚Äôre fine. You‚Äôre okay. Everything‚Äôs alright.\n\nI have the same fears tbh and then I start thinking could this be my intuition warning me about something bad about to happen.. wouldn't recommend, it makes you believe it more üòÖ\n\nI‚Äôm the same way üò≠\n\nHi, I feel you could have experienced something I like to call \"Impending Sense of Doom Disorder\" can you please give your feedback or insight into this? I'm trying to make a community to bring awareness to mental health conditions which people seem to experience but are not yet classified by the DSM \n\n&gt;[Impending Sense of Doom Disorder?](https://www.reddit.com/r/unclassifiedmentaldis/comments/1h76bpq/impending_sense_of_doom_disorder/)  \nby[u/Creepy\\_Guess1138](https://www.reddit.com/user/Creepy_Guess1138/) in[unclassifiedmentaldis](https://www.reddit.com/r/unclassifiedmentaldis/)\n\nI‚Äôve been like this Sunday. fight  or flight mode.\n\nI‚Äôm on meds, I went to the gym 4x this week. I tried meditating. \n\nAt this point, all I can do is just try to relax and wait for the storm to pass\n\nThe best thing you can do is sit still for a couple minutes and talk directly to the anxiety and panic rising. Tell it very directly that you will give it the next 30 seconds to do its very worst. You will not interfere or prevent it, rather allow whatever course it wishes to take. Then start the countdown from 30, and count slowly but surely.\n\nThis is hard to do as it goes against the fight or flight instinct taking off inside of you. But it is the appropriate response to an inappropriate activation of fight or flight. When panic strikes, a lot of people will do breathing exercises, walk, or something that distracts them. This is fine as it can definitely help make the experience more tolerable, but it‚Äôs ultimately reinforcing the fight or flight response by ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù. By ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù you‚Äôre telling your body that something is in fact wrong that requires a response, which in turn will perpetuate the panic response.\n\nBy not interfering, you are giving no signal to your body that there is something to fear. In turn, the panic and anxiety subside quite literally within seconds.\n\nI know it sounds too good to be true, and it‚Äôs easier said than done. It requires courage and a willingness to be uncomfortable and go against your instinct. But you can do anything for 30 seconds, even if it means surrendering to the temporary discomfort of panic and anxiety. \n\nIf you do this, you quite literally can rid yourself of panic attacks by not fearing them.\n\nEdit: Download the DARE app *\n\nAbsolutely !\nI have the DARE app, I‚Äôm just struggling to fully implement it. Idk if it‚Äôs just my OCD or what but I just focus on it and I can‚Äôt help but to feel like I have to ‚Äúfix it‚Äù \nI watch a ton of dare videos and whatnot, I just struggle to let go\n\nI feel the very same. How are you doing?\n\nI‚Äôm doing alright. My PMS is likely making it all the worse, and harder to reign in . \nListening to podcasts/youtube videos about anxiety and intrusive thoughts helps\n\nSame. My pms seems to make it worse. I like listening to YouTube videos about anxiety too. Makes me feel less crazy ha. Best wishes to you.\n\nGo to bed and sleep\nAs long as I can.\n\nSame, I get those feelings sometimes too. I read it‚Äôs from anxiety and a form of panic attack which is a negative emotion that you just need to turn into a positive one by just distracting yourself with something positive that‚Äôs make you feel happy. Good luck!\n\nI used to feel the really intense urge to go to the hospital. I was in there frequently enough at one point that they were visiblt annoyed with me üòÖ Which didn't help kfkfjf.\n\nAlcohol mostly!\n\nLol. Pretty sure I self medicated a lot until I started taking a low dose of Sertraline (Zoloft). Just enough to take the edge off.\n\nThis made it soo much worse for me in the long run.\n\nMe too, I can't talk to anyone, it drags them down and they don't like it. Soni have to try and hide it. \n\nSometimes I'm able to deeply logicise it and actually think though all of what's going on, like what I'm doing soon which is often what I'm worried I've forgotten something for and it'll go horrifically, so I can then make a plan or take actions now to avoid most pitfalls, like making a list of things not to forget to do.\n\nAs an example: I've got a bit of OCD from it, I have to check every door and power switch in the house multiple times before I leave and check I've locked the front door more than once. More because I'm not present enough when I'm doing it the first time, to be confident I've done it minutes later, even though I have. So I can't trust my memory.\nBut it helps me fell less doom impending as I drive down the road.\n\nSomething physical helps to distract me and turn my mind away from it. Running, up a hill, hard.\n\nOften I'm not in a situation to do that, so it's mindful meditation. Some classics like the 4444 or 478 breathing do a job but I really have shout the count in my head to draw me away.\n\nHonestly the DARE response has helped a lot\n\n[deleted]\n\nRecognise this as a threat response. There are four: fight, flight, freeze, fawn. You could be in constant freeze mode, it having been triggered by a trauma. Your subconsious doesn‚Äôt feel safe. Treat it like a tiny you which you have to reassure. Your threat response is working overtime, spotting or expecting threats to you where there are none. \n\nIt‚Äôs really important to know that your brain is hardwired to keep you alive. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs sole mission. It treats all threats like they will kill you because it‚Äôs rooted in being a cave person foraging where you might get eaten by a tiger or eat the wrong mushroom and die. You have to tell the brain of the difference. \n\nRepeatedly tell yourself that you are ‚Äòsafe, happy and fine‚Äô. And question everything: ‚Äòis this a real threat or are you just overdoing it brain? It‚Äôs not a threat so chill the f out we are fine‚Äô. \n\nGood threat response: I will freeze and not step out in front of this car because that could kill me. \n\nOverdoing it threat response: this shower; leaving bed; germs; email from boss; going outside; that person; [insert reason here] will kill me so I should not do it/not leave bed/the house etc.\n\nThis happens to me and it‚Äôs a lot when I‚Äôm driving with someone in the passenger seat. Just the craziest impending doom and fear but I have to sit there in silence and ride it out. It‚Äôs literally the worst feeling I‚Äôve ever felt. Like I could snap at any moment but I just contain myself. When I start to feel one coming I‚Äôve stopped a few by talking to myself (in my head) that I‚Äôm in no danger. I also wiggle my toes and fingers as a grounding mechanism. Helps a little but I know what you‚Äôre going through. I do find that exercise helps in the long run\n\nI actually have a pretty odd way of calming myself, I'm a huge nerd, and when I feel anxious about my health or fear an unlikely impending event, I recite the fear mantra from Dune. It actually helps a lot. \n\n\"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear and I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see it's path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\"\n\nUnclench my jaw and roll my shoulders back. Works wonders.\n\nMedication, meditation, sleep.\n\nI say to myself ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine, you‚Äôre fine, you‚Äôll be okay‚Äù.\n\nMedication and therapy\n\nI find that this breathing exercise helps:\n\nInhale 4 sec, hold 7 sec, exhale 8 seconds. Repeat\n\nI have a weighted blanket that‚Äôs good for this. Having a really clingy dog is helpful too. I‚Äôm just out here chugging ice water and snuggling my dog and hoping that shitty feeling goes away lol\n\nMedication and therapy. My cats and dog\n\nI have this problem before work. I get up early enough to sit &amp; chill before I leave for work &amp; no matter what, I feel dread half the time. I just go to work &amp; do my job to the best of my ability &amp; usually in the end I am ok. I do journal about it when I feel like being sick.\n\nThank you for asking this.  It is my constant state of waking existence.\n\nSame\n\nRelax your jaw, shoulders, neck, everything else. Find where you are tense and give it a little massage\n\nI got myself back on lexapro and waiting/hoping for it to start kicking in. A small dose of klonopin for when I'm really having a hard time. I cocoon myself in my electric blanket and watch some fun tv. Sometimes I cry and scream. I have a lot of worries.\n\nPray.  It helps even just to feel like I'm talking to someone about it, even if I may not be able to see them physically\n\nYes I do this too!!\n\nI‚Äôm right now in a chapter of rebuilding finances and it‚Äôs awful as I am waiting for the shoe to drop and it to be bad again. \n\nBut the I‚Äôm crazy delusional is hurting me as well. And then I go off then I overreacted.\n\nI would play with my dogs and play videogames that make me feel scared to just make my brain think that's why we are in danger. Exercise helps too, I have one of those little step machines with added pressure, makes me feel a quick burn in my knees and thighs that makes me concentrate on that pain long enough to forget.\n\nI get the same way. I keep thinking worse case scenario for when I‚Äôm ready to take it. The truth is, I‚Äôm not taking in any of the good. I‚Äôm in worse case before i can enjoy.\nI‚Äôm learning to enjoy not knowing. So much is going on that I don‚Äôt know, and, probably, has nothing to with me. It‚Äôs about dusting yourself off when the bad happens. Learn to move on.\nEasy advice to give, I know. I‚Äôm trying to learn this as well.\n\nChange what I am doing, generally I would be still, when it hits me I run I jog or simply go for a long walk. I have been noting that moving does help me a ton more than any understanding approach\n\nRide it out, and try to do some stuff to distract yourself, but you have to on an emotional level accept that you're doing the stuff to distract yourself not to avoid the anxiety, but to just not let it impact you. I know that might sound weird, but look into how the amygdala part of the brain works in regard to panic attacks, anxiety, etc. It can't tell if a threat is real or not, so when you try to avoid something all the time your brain actually thinks the danger is real. This is why breathing methods and all this stuff never worked for me when I had severe, severe panic attacks. The only thing that worked was going on benzos for 2 weeks in order to calm down and plan on how to deal with the panic attacks, then I stopped taking them and took on the panic head on, it was very painful for a few days, then it quickly subsided.\n\nMeditation and therapy\n\nMedication is the only thing that works for me. My partner always knows when I forgot to take my meds because I'll randomly start crying or shaking and if she tries to talk to me I start asking if I'm dying or if she's going to leave me. I get my meds, twenty minutes later I'm fine lol\n\nNo advice, but I can relate so I feel your pain! I will say the days I get some exercise in help. It‚Äôs anxiety. I personally try to avoid medication so that‚Äôs the best I can do.\n\nYou may have a physical condition that you're unaware of. The human body isn't that dumb, it desperately tries to reach homeostatis. If your environment is decently comfortable and you feel that way, you may be missing something crucial. For me it turned out to be SIBO, my bowels completely colonized by bacteria. They pump out gas like crazy which inflates the intestines like a balloon, so I was constantly shallow breathing because it takes away crucial space for my lungs. They also produce toxins, steal nutrients and water, an endless list of life-ruining problems. When you don't know or don't remember what it feels like to be normal, you can miss extremely obvious sensations in your body. The entire body is a holistic loop, if your mind is 'broken' there's an extremely strong likelihood that something else is broken. Don't get hung up on any one part, and especially not the brain or your heart! Instead, it's the entire story of your body you want to map out, starting from the nutrients you put in your mouth and where they end up, what happens to them, etc. If you listen closely, you can notice all sorts of thing that were just swept under the carpet of your perception, but persisting as some unknown anxiety and stress with no apparent origin.\n\nI developed gastritis a couple months back and I spiraled mentally . I‚Äôve had bad panic and anxiety ever since. The gastritis has gone, but I was tested for H pylori and it was negative. But I see a GI soon. \nI‚Äôm beginning to wonder if it‚Äôs just a gut thing\n\nI don't fight it now. I know it's my body thinking there's danger when there's not.\n\nSo I Iean into it and g myself up as if I'm about to fight a bear. Eventually my body realizes there's no bear and the anxiety eventually subsides.\n\nThat‚Äôs a good idea. I usually end up spiraling with it because it feels so uncomfortable\n\nThat's understandable. \n\nA anxiety/panic attack is different In a sense that the more we fight it, the worse it gets.\n\nI use to use breathing techniques but for me that's a form of control or fight against the attack as I'm trying to stop it which is working against the adrenaline our body is releasing to fight against whatever threat it thinks were in danger of.  \n\nSo now I do the above and it's been good so far.\n\nGood luck with your health journey.\n\nUsually XanaxüòÖ but I need to start doing cardio and try to burn off some of my stress\n\nGet buuuuuusy and stay away from alcohol and pot.  If you‚Äôre not drinking or smoking and you‚Äôre already busy af, visit a doctor.\n\nYeah I‚Äôm pretty sedentary. I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs. I‚Äôve seen the doctor and stuff and they say it‚Äôs just anxiety\nI worry too much so that doesn‚Äôt help\n\nI appreciate the extra info.  Everybody‚Äôs going to be different but outside of decreasing alcohol putting myself in weird situations on a daily basis helped.  Go to the barber if it‚Äôs feasible, go solo camping, go to a meetup. Cause yourself anxiety in a controlled manner.   Baby steps.  I eventually started feeling a bit numb to what would historically have caused me anxiety.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI‚Äôve had a full cardiac work up about a month ago. I have PTSD pretty bad and panic disorder, so it‚Äôs a common thing for me\n\nI do a lot of breathing exercise and recently started mantra meditation. It may not be everyone‚Äôs thing but reading eastern philosophy and working on embracing and accepting my life as it is has been helping me to cope with the inevitability and unpredictability of oblivion.\n\nL-Theanine and CBT helped me immensely. And time. Don't expect this to be fast. It took me more than a year to get rid of that crap.\n\nI always do something comforting. Put on a comfort show or movie, read a favorite book, do whatever sends you to a nostalgic place.\n\nI tell myself that if I made it through the two minutes before this, I can get through the next two minutes and so forth\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes the cold stuff helps so much !!!\n\ni'm currently sleep deprived bcs of this\n\nHonestly I give it a timer. I learned about from a video I think, but basically give that doom 10 seconds. Give it a very generous 10 seconds for it to happen. And when nothing happens i.e you don't die its soooo relieving. The 10 seconds is hell but it helps a lot.\n\nIt‚Äôs unhealthy but I put on my plate carrier and prepare, if something wants me it won‚Äôt be easy\n\nEat something sour\n\nI try not to think about it too much. Give myself forms of distraction, such as watching my favourite TV programmes and/or films, designing slides for my Facebook page and things like that.\n\nI've been there. To say it sucks is an understatement. There were three things that really helped me get out of the spiral.\n\n1. Have a snack and some water. Sometimes my brain would go into panic mode if I got too hungry or dehydrated but my hunger signals would get completely bypassed.\n\n2. Set a timer for 5 minutes and write everything out. I mean absolutely everything you're feeling and thinking in excruciating detail. Do not stop until the timer is up. Your hand will cramp and you will run out of things to say, at that point write anything. The alphabet, song lyrics, all your friends names. Eventually I'd get so fed up trying to just continue writing that I'd feel better before the timer ended.\n\n3. Repeat a mantra until it loses its meaning and sounds weird. Stuff like \"I have survived 100% of these events\", \"I'm safe, I'm okay\", and \"every storm passes.\" Because unless you're on Jupiter, the storm will pass, it will end.\n\nYou'll be okay.\n\nDistractions and cbd oil\n\nDrugs drugs drugs for years!!!!! Went into recovery three years back and Did emdr for ptsd anxiety and it helped. Now gabapentin seems to help along with occasional cannabis and kratom\n\nBut doom is still ever present , just not always so impending\n\nStay so busy that you don‚Äôt have time to think. Work, take care of family, laundry, clean, read, etc.\n\nExercise and meditation, Mindful Peace on You Tube helps me so much!\n\nEdit: spelling\n\n500mg Tylenol, give it 1.5 hour to kick in and last 4-5 hours. Sounds silly I understand. But I have experimented on it and FOR ME it does calm my anxiety down. I have panic disorder and am prescribed Klonopin, but have never taken it.\n\nFor me after dealing with it enough to have had enough of all the bullshit that comes with anxiety and social anxiety, I‚Äôm getting a med card ü§©ü§ó\n\nCompartmentalise it.\n\nMy anxiety has been settled for a long time now, but back when it was high - beta blockers helped a lot, more so because they let me know I had a way to stop my physical symptoms should I need it. Otherwise, exercise and meditation.       \n\nNowadays my anxiety is pretty much at normal levels - however I occasionally get random midnight panic attacks where I feel like I‚Äôm going to die. For these I find I just need ti sit and breathe for a few minutes, or watch some Tv if I have to.\n\nYou got it! Being able to sit through it is amazing. I usually watch a movie or a tv show, color and watch some YouTube, or just running! Running makes me feel like I‚Äôm able to ‚Äúget away‚Äù üòÖ\n\nOh man it‚Äôs so hard üòÇüòÇI‚Äôm like WAIT WHATS HAPPENING\nbut I‚Äôm trying to get better at sitting it with and letting it flow\n\nFRRR it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm being hunted for sport üò≠üò≠\n\nCompassion for yourself n know we all have a fate/mortality, your not alone, but I get it the old alarm system goes off in yr body n mind. Take care\n\nwhat I do is I watch like a series to entertain me and distract my mind, usually about an episode later my mind is too focused on the series completely forgetting about what I was thinking about previously, something I recommend to NOT do is overthink the feeling, I find doing that in my personal experience worsens the anxiety, you can also just try anything else to distract your mind\n\nI always overthink the feeling üòûcould be due to my OCD. I have an awful fear of something bad happening to me so I tend to ruminate on it and try to force it away. Which is the absolute worst thing to do when it happens\n\nyeah I completely understand, I also have trouble avoiding overthinking about things that bring me anxiety especially when I‚Äôm currently anxious about them\n\nI always knew there was something about breathing techniques that could help but it wasn't until i strengthened my lungs that ive been able to (meditate/breath) back to a calm state. I bought a breathing exercise mouth piece on Amazon and man what a difference has it made. A few things have changed like my asthma is better, i don't catch myself huffing and puffing doing physical stuff and most importantly i don't i have a clear path out of feeling  anxious. I can only speak on My theory for my anxiety which i believe is that I'd be so much in my head I'd basically involuntarily hold my breath until my nervous system started freaking out, then I'd get bouts of feeling like something bad was around the corner and I'd basically be useless on the verge of freaking out or fainting. I genuinely think I was depriving myself of oxygen and my neurological response was to be in fight/flight mode. Since using the mouth piece i have learned diaphragmatic breathing which has been a game changer. I still catch myself with the feeling of impending doom but i can correct it in less than 20 minutes. I find myself using the mouth piece way less because you'll see improvement almost immediately. The best part is once you've gotten good understand of breath work it feels like i have a hidden weapon against anxiety in my back pocket. Even just knowing it's an option relieves a bit of stress. Good luck. I'll send a link in DM so the post doesn't get flagged\n\nSounds like you need prescription that starts with an X and ends with an X .Rubbing Vicks vapor rub and putting a frozen water bottle on the center of my chest helps with my anxiety.I have a whole medical cart that I sleep next to with a bp machine, blood pulse ox,blood sugar tester(not diabetic)over the counter inhaler (no asthma)baby aspirin (im case of a heart attack) I also have a plug in inhaler machine in my closet, antibiotics I have on hand just in case too.No to mention the various OTC medicine I have right next to me .I even considered getting a portable defibrillator.\n\nUnfortunately I have OCD and I struggle to take meds because I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôll hurt me somehow which is stupid  . Ice packs have been a massive help. I have like 6 ice packs in my freezer üòÖüòÖ\n\nYes it's¬† amazing and soothes me. I also wrap my entire body including over my head with my down comforter(it has to be down)\n\n/u/salemsocks\n\n\nSince I've been diagnosed with Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity and Casein (milk protein) intolerance, if I am really strict with my diet, avoiding processed food (even if labeled gluten free) and cooking everything from scratch at home, my extreme anxiety crisis, nightmares, night terror and panic attacks are gone for good. Nowadays I eat everything but gluten+avenin and casein containing foods and i keep an eye on cross contamination.\n\n\nAn elimination diet for 2 or 3 months is gold in helping to identify food triggers. Some people advocate for Carnivore (meat, salt and water), but i personally prefer the AIP (autoimmune protocol diet). In 20 to 25 days while on a very strict elimination diet, you gonna find your baseline and probably be really amazed at how life can be so easy and so effortless. After around 90 days, you keep adding new foods each week or so and journalling your reactions.\n\n\nIts really worth it. If you got food triggers like me, you gonna find meds (check the fillers!) are so much more cost-effective (because of lower doses). In some lucky cases, you might even discuss with your psych reducing your prescription.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\nI do have a soy intolerance ü§îü§î\nI recently had some tests done, and they found markers for inflammation in my intestines and I do have a dairy issue (I can‚Äôt drink whole milk) I see a GI soon. I get rapid heart beats after certain foods. \n\nHow did you get tested/confirm your food allergies? I wanna get tested to figure them out .\n\ni think to myself, ‚Äúhow many times has this happened? and how many times have i woken up the next morning to a new day?‚Äù or i talk to my brother. i know its hard, im just starting to get over this. ive had severe health anxiety for about 6 months due to fainting and convulsions that were the result of severe dehydration. i have an intense fear of illness, or sudden death in a painful way. i still have my days, more than id like, but theres always a light at the end of the tunnel OP. you will survive this, and will come out as an even stronger person :)\n\nI just realise everytime i get this sense, that its not true, because always did i came as a winner out of it. I never died, and i never killed myself.\n\nThis can be a genuine medical symptom\n\nI have OCD, and anxiety so, I get this feeling constantly from my intrusive thoughts. I‚Äôve had a full cardiac work up done\n\nPersonally I have a long history/story of that impending doom feeling. It started in 2020. the first panic attack I had was right before Covid and ever since that panic attack I haven‚Äôt been the same since. On and off still to this day I get episodes. However when I first experienced it I had no idea what it was, shit I was scared i was gonna feel that way forever. I couldn‚Äôt eat like at all. Food made me gag. I lost SO much weight. There were many more side effects; too much to get into. I was fucking miserable. I thought I was losing my mind. But man I‚Äôve done A LOT of research and getting to understand what it is and that is DOES go away and is ALWAYS TEMPORARY I cope a lot better. I‚Äôve found ways to manage for me. I now take celexa (antidepressant that focuses on anxiety more than depression) and I take Xanax. The Xanax really fucking helps. So do herbal teas. Me in 2020 would have been MORTIFIED to take any sort of drug but I had to step out of my comfort zone. And man I don‚Äôt regret it at all. The most important thing however is that it does go away and you‚Äôre not crazy; it‚Äôs completely natural. Mostly women experience this because of hormonal imbalances. I still don‚Äôt know why I get these spells to this day but I‚Äôm trying to find out what my triggers are. To be honest I don‚Äôt even know if there‚Äôs a reason I think it‚Äôs just random for no reason at all. I may not know why but at least now I know how to manage and take care of myself when I‚Äôm having an episode. With time it gets easier cause you begin to understand it a little more. I promise it gets better. Don‚Äôt be afraid of your own feelings; embrace them. Feel them. You have to accept and that is the first and most important step. You are going to be okay, love. I promise you‚Äôre gonna be okay\n\nEdibles!\n\nDrugs....lots of drugs."

I will try to keep it up :P\n\nAnd you be proud to tell us all about it. I just finished my workout because of your post. I didn‚Äôt really feel like it. I read your post and I was like. Yeah, get up and just do it. It always makes me feel better\n\nI'm glad something positive came from it :)\n\nNo it is a very good thing. I stopped working out recently and its made my anxiety much worse. Keep it up and good job!\n\nThanks! I hope you get back to it too :)\n\nThank you. I'm planning to start tomorrow so this was a nice motivator for me to see.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, how many times a week do you do this? I used to walk around the neighborhood at 4.30 in the morning 3 or 4 times a week, but have no motivation anymore due to relapsed. I have stationary bike at home tho, but only exercise like 4 times a month.\n\nwhats about just forget yourself and for example, always after going to toilet jump on the bike and just do 5 minutes. No obligations, just to check it out is it squicking¬†\n\nYeah, I should do 5 minutes at a time. I could probably do that more often in a week if I exercise for a short time.\n\nAmazing, I bet if you not over think just do it, can be Pavlov effect. I'm so glad for you, I know what achievement it is.¬†\nStart slowly, don't put¬† push yourself to much. Find balance\n\nThank you.\n\nI just started yesterday :) woke up very sore today so may have to take it a little lighter but will attempt over 5K steps again when legs are better\n\nYep, I agree. The first time was rough hahaha. I tried to run during my first time but my legs couldn't take it. \n\nAnyway, good luck to you!\n\nI ended up doing 3.6K today :)\n\nAwesome! Exercise is good for mental health but don't force yourself too much. I don't think I could do what you did today. But I am going to take it very slowly with my stationary bike. Probably 5-10 minutes per day.\n\nAll movement is an improvement on nothing. Good luck my friend!\n\nI have cardiophobia ( not as bad as it used to be, thanks to my meds ) so this is INCREDIBLE to me! i try to aim for at least 2K per day since its better than nothing but I am mostly frozen to the couch unless necessary üò≠ I‚Äôm terrified of my HR getting over 120/130\n\nI had the same , i went from 10 cardiologist, i was terrified to do sport ‚Ä¶\nOne year later i run everyday 40-50 min and my anxiety dropped down dramatically.\nMy resting HR is now 50 BPM before it was 65-70.. i was unable to walk 300m without being dizzy, with my HR over 130 ‚Ä¶\nLook my last run of today :). \n\n[workout](https://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2024/42/1/1728858223-img-0573.png)\n\nThis is incredible! Great job!\n\nThat's awesome! I was afraid too and now I can reach up to 15000 daily. Just remember it's really good for your physical and mental health! We are here for you! ‚ù§Ô∏èüå∏\n\n15,000 is a lot, damn. Well done!\n\nThat‚Äôs absolutely amazing!! Do not discredit yourself! I know how it feels to be sedentary and scared to move, even just getting out of bed to use the restroom. What you accomplished is a big win!! üíï\n\nThat is very good, i know how you feel. I just actually made a post earlier basically how sometimes exertion or any physical activity makes me weak and shaky and feels like my heart will give out (panicky)   So congrats to you and kick anxiety in the a$$\n\nThis is awesome! I know how scary that can be, and I‚Äôm super proud of you!!\n\nThank you! &lt;3\n\nCongrats!!  I‚Äôve been trying to go on more walks to be more physical too, and it‚Äôs worth celebrating!\n\nGood luck and keep going!\n\nYayyyy!!! Congrats ü´∂üèºü´∂üèºü´∂üèºüôÑ\n\nAwesome bud!!! I'm so proud of youüíúüíúüíúüíú I started walking way more as well for my anxiety and it helps so much so keep it upüíú\n\nCongratulations on the achievement! With consistency, this will help your anxiety a lot!\n\nYAY! Well done!\n\nThis is good. Whatever is wrong with me I‚Äôve quit going to the gym sends me into a panic\n\nCongrats this is a huge milestone! Keep it up üòäI find exercise is one of the best things for my anxiety but just facing doing it was so hard at first!\n\nGood job!\n\nCongratulations! That's absolutely amazing üí™üèæ\n\nGood Job! I was in Vegas for the past week and avg 10k per day. Think it really helped me. But I do walk 2-3 miles every morning.\n\nAyeee congratulations dude!! That's super awesome, i remember how excited i was when i used to reach 5k steps a day so i can just imagine your excitement. That's such an awesome thing to accomplish honestly, you are now my inspiration to get back into walking üôè\n\nProud of you OP! This is amazing\n\nso proud of you! that's a big step (pun intended???), amazing job&lt;3\n\nWell done, keep it up. Walking can be so enjoyable l.\n\nThat's really impressive to be honest\n\nVery nice OP :) Walking is proven to calm your nerves dowm. My mom and I have anxiety and we would walk during mornings to relieve ourselves. Take the courge to walk and feel free with it\n\nWell done, you should feel proud. &lt;3 You can do this.\n\nYou are inspiring me to to this too. Went from taking 10k steps a day to 500 due to switching of jobs.\n\nThat‚Äôs awesome! I need to get back into walking again, I‚Äôve definitely been slacking recently. Seasonal depression has hit and my motivation tanked.\n\nAmazing üñ§\n\nCongratulations. That's fantastic!!!!! üòÄ\n\nI told myself this week I was going to have a win like yours! Congrats on that!\n\nThat‚Äôs wonderful!\n\nCongrats OP, keep it up, you're doing really well.\n\nDudeee awesome!!\n\nCan you tell me please if your knees and feet hurt?\n\nOh they definitely did yesterday so I took a rest day but today they're better and I'm currently on 3,500 steps!\n\nThat's so good!!!! Our bodies are SO much more resilient than we give them credit for, it took starting to exercise again for me to realize this.\n\n\nI've been pretty sedentary for a few years now and it's gotten significantly worse since my anxiety spiked a year ago. I've had every physical symptom you can think of, and despite all of that, I can still exercise pretty rigorously if I can actually get myself to get up and do it!¬†\n\nThats more than a mile if you‚Äôre walking more than one foot a step!!\n\nHell yeah, keep going! keep looking that toothless dragon in the face, it's all a bluff.\n\nI Like how literally every comment under this post is positive and expresses support to the Author, that's so cute, basically yeap, you have obviously done good work, you shouldn't stop but continue to move more, good job man\n\nI didn't expect all this support üòÖ\n\nMy body is very tired now. I will try to go again tomorrow!\n\nI walk 7,000 steps every day, 9,000 on weekends¬†"

    "all_comment_text": "Waking up anxious, high heart rate after eating, fear of everyday tasks, avoiding situations, high heart rate at rest, insomnia, fear of dying\n\nYep, these are my symptoms too - well, aside from the fear of death, because I can‚Äôt help feeling at least I‚Äôd no longer feel like this\n\nSame. I used to be afraid of dying in my sleep, nowadays I‚Äôd embrace it\n\nSeriously. I know I‚Äôd be leaving my cats but the thought of being at peace‚Ä¶\n\nFear of everyday tasks and avoiding situations are such a part of my life. The sad thing is that it's become so normalized I don't really know how to bust out. Lately I've just sort of going through the visuals of me doing the task, seeing nothing will happen, and then just start it. Whether it be laundry or checking an account I haven't checked in ages. I'm still new with this but it's been working as of late.\n\nI think that we gave in to our fears so many times that it‚Äôs grown huge. My research from reading is we need exposure therapy and to continue to do more things that gets us doing more. But that is so much easier said than done for me\n\nMe as well. Waking up with anxiety is so annoying, and heavy on the fears. I have impending doom anxiety- actually having it right now üò≥\n\nTwin.. where have you been?\n\nMe too. It‚Äôs like that feeling final destination gives and I can‚Äôt shake it. Then I have the lingering effects that are like a hangover. Nauseous and pounding headache\n\nAt parties I can't eat at all because of my anxiety. I eat before I go and ppl go \"What are you gonna eat over there?\"\n\nMy heart rate always goes up after eating, like why???\n\nSympathetic nervous system has to use energy to digest food is the short answer\n\nThat's actually normal, I didn't know that until recently and it freaked me out. Your heart has to pump more blood to your stomach to help with digestion.\n\nThis is so me\n\nA lot of it is high cortisol\n\nHow can I confirm high cortisol??\n\nI did on a hair mineral test but a doctor could run some tests for you. It‚Äôs pretty easy based on just symptoms waking up in a panic is usually a tell tale sign or having a rapid pulse is another clear indication. Cortisol is the main adrenal hormone associated with fight or flight. It‚Äôs elevated in mostly anyone with anxiety.\n\nSame except fear of dying took a back seat to fear of embarrassment in public.\n\nGI issues and muscle tensions - I also fucking hate the chills out of nowhere\n\nI‚Äôm glad to see someone else talk about the chills. It could be 105 degrees outside and I could still get a chill.\n\nIt's nice to know the chills on a hot day is anxiety. For the longest time before reading that others experience this also, I thought something else had to be wrong üò¨\n\nInteresting. I get hot and sweaty and my stomach feels really uneasy - like it ‚Äúdrops‚Äù and I feel sickly. Sweaty palms, sweaty face, neck. I feel like I‚Äôm literally on fire and I‚Äôm gonna vomit. Then I start calming down, and then I get chills so bad my teeth start chattering and I can‚Äôt stop shaking.\n\nYep. I get those too! Exactly like that it‚Äôs crazy. Nice to see I‚Äôm not alone in that experience.\n\nSame! I have struggled with these for over a year now and most people sympathize but can‚Äôt relate. It feels very isolating.\n\nI get that all the time. And when I‚Äôm chilled, my hands can be sweaty and gross\n\nI have GI issues as well. Anxiety can make it so much worse.\n\nthe chills definitely\n\nDizziness. Weird sensations on my body that feel like mild numbness or burning. Malaise.\n\nDamn i have this everyday..gut causing me this+ anxiety\n\nIt will go away! Actually I had a flare up recently then I went to the health anxiety thread and saw that so many other people experience the same symptoms. Then the next day it magically went away. Anxiety is weird!\n\nI‚Äôm happy for you mine are 7months now everyday getting used to them ü§£ it sucks do you take any ssri? They prescribed me one but m too afraid to take it\n\nI don‚Äôt take ssris, I am also too nervous to take them. I‚Äôd only take them if wasn‚Äôt able to get out of bed I was so depressed. But I‚Äôm pretty functional. I had a psychiatrist tell me once that long term anxiety that goes untreated can cause depression which I think is kinda true. We are so in our heads it‚Äôs cray!!! \nI do get prescribed Ativan and beta blockers to take ‚Äúas needed‚Äù. Those (esp the Ativan) can be very helpful in times of distress. As can rest, exercise, cutting out alcohol &amp; caffeine, and letting people close to me know that I am feeling not so great. I hope u feel better soon. Normally I think the very physical symptoms of anxiety can be a warning sign for me. So that‚Äôs when I start my lil ‚Äúprotocols‚Äù of cutting out everything that is bad for me\n\nWell I‚Äôm on bland diet I quit smocking drinking even sex üòÖ everything I did 2 courses of antibiotics (hp pylori) 7months sickness really put me in a dark place ..i go to gym 5 times a week night walks I try to keep it as positive as possible, but I was thinking lately about trying an ssri to help me relax just like a week or smthing u know a little push up‚Ä¶well I hope everything will work out for u u seem genuine ü•∞ thank you again for the infos\n\nMain symptoms are: NAUSEA (x300000), feeling like my throat is tightening to where I can‚Äôt swallow or feel like a pill is stuck in my throat, sweating, upper abdomen/stomach pain. Mine are all GI related concerns that hit me out of nowhere all at once.\n\nI also had this and it‚Äôs what pushed me to try anti-depressants because I couldn‚Äôt eat in public at alll with the nausea and I couldn‚Äôt sit comfortably because I would constantly need to üí©\n\nSo what finally worked? If anything I hope?\n\nAt first I was given beta-blockers to help with the panic and while they made me a little more chill I found they didn‚Äôt really help with the nausea enough so I tried anti-depressants and went through 3 SSRIS before landing on an SNRI that worked well for the symptoms I had. There‚Äôs a lot of anti-depressants out there and most of them are very good at helping anxiety so if that‚Äôs something you want to try it‚Äôs worth a go\n\nI‚Äôm on Paxil, the most sedating SSRI and it‚Äôs the one that works best for me!\n\nWhich one worked for you¬†\n\nVenlafaxine currently\n\nHave you ever had nausea for weeks straight? I've been nauseous for 2 weeks now, took two pregnancy tests and they came back negative. Convinced its my anxiety flaring up, because I become extremely anxious whenever I eat and am really nauseous at night, which I usually experience when I'm having a bad bout of anxiety\n\nExtreme headache, Extreme fatigue, skin rashes, insomnia, high blood sugar, hair loss, dizziness, acid reflux. Psychiatrist still won't prescribe anything strong. Life's beautiful\n\nTMJ !!!!! And head pressure are my least favourites\n\nyep TMJ is a new symptom for me. I used to only get a sore jaw during and after a panic attack. But now it‚Äôs just constant all the time for the past month.\n\nWhat is that\n\nWait whatttttt\nI didn't know this is a thing \nSomeone linked an article.\nRecently I have been having this a lot\nAnd head pressure I had been having since forever \nWow\n\nRestless Leg Syndrome. I sit there and shake like a leaf, then I pace in circles for hours sometimes.\n\nBy far the worst is the gut rot. Just that feeling of a black hole eating away at my insides drives me mad. It‚Äôs by far the worst symptom for me.\n\nYessss. I get heat in my stomach that tries to radiate out through my veins. The heat rushes suck¬†\n\nDoes anyone else have the thing where your throat kind of closes up and you have to either continuously try to gulp in order to not cough, or hold your breath? (social settings only, of course)\n\nYES, I hate it, and it always happens to me when I'm in a quite place or If I'm doing a test, it sucks. It was one of my worst enemies while in high school. :/ To me, it felt like I had spikes on my throat, It got very dry, and I started coughing uncontrollably.\n\nSorry, what? Eye floaters are a symptom of chronic anxiety?\n\nThey aren't at all. Anxiety or stress doesn't create eye floaters. It's an age related change in the eye. All anxiety does is heighten body awareness so you notice them.\n\nI saw that, too. Really? I have them, and they‚Äôre aggravating.\n\nI got them last year and it freaked me the hell out because it'd never been that bad, went to the optometrist and she pretty much just told me \"Nope! Eyes are healthy, bye. that just happens\". If this is true, that's just one more thing I can put on anxiety for scaring the shit out of me.\n\nYes. They tell me to live with them. It is frustrating.\n\nIt IS! She said to come back if they got worse, but the reason I went in the first place is BECAUSE they got worse. Idk. It's wild, hate healthcare sometimes.\n\nEye floaters are blocked out of your visual processing, anxiety is a mechanism that makes us more alert for threats. Now, imagine realizing the pervasiveness of eye floaters while experiencing high anxiety- you would probably notice them a lot more since they are now associated with anxiety.\n\nAs my chronic anxiety has improved I've not really been bothered by them as much but they used to be a source of anxiety for me.\n\nThere's no reason to hate healthcare for this. She did nothing wrong if she completed a thorough exam of your eyes. Floaters are a problem if you suddenly experience say, 50.\n\nOmgh ME TOO. mine worsened suddenly and I thought my eyes were going bad, I was so scared. Went to the optometrist and was told I still have 20/20 vision and my eyes are perfectly healthy üò≠ I have to wear anti-reflective/blue light glasses all the time though- just for the eye discomfort with floaters + light\n\nThe OP is incorrect about the eye floaters and anxiety.\n\nNo, but awareness of them is\n\nNausea/vomiting, insomnia, shakes so bad it's hard to type this. Easily startled. Jaw clamping. Stammer-jaw speech. Vertigo, and an overall feeling of hopelessness.\n\nOh my god I have these too and it actually drives me insane\n\njust this constant feeling in my chest i can‚Äôt really describe. like my heart is constantly in a fight or flight mode even if i don‚Äôt cognitively feel anxious\n\ni have tmj, eye floaters, throat tension as well for about 2 years. right when i entered my ‚Äúcareer‚Äù post college\n\nTMJ clenching, muscle tension in neck and shoulders, high heart rate and feeling panicked like I can‚Äôt breathe, sometimes my stomach will hurt too if I‚Äôm really anxious.\n\nOh and stress rashes\n\nI‚Äôve had about everyone of them under the sun. \n\nI‚Äôve dealing with panic disorder for about 10 years now. Debilitating to the point of losing jobs, friends, family, possessions. Etc. \n\nI‚Äôm just now discovering that the way to beat it is to trick your mind into ‚Äúliking‚Äù the anxiety. Challenging it and telling it to do its best. And when nothing happens.. you don‚Äôt die, you aren‚Äôt sick, your heart isn‚Äôt gonna explode etc. \n\nTrick your mind into welcoming the sensations that come‚Ä¶ it will be hard at first. Probably won‚Äôt even feel like it‚Äôs working but it will over time \n\nCombine that with breathing and contraction exercises daily and I‚Äôll promise you over time‚Ä¶ it will get it easier. \n\nMuch love.\n\nI see someone else likes the DARE approach!\n\nIt is magnificent. I just started it and I‚Äôve never experienced such fantastic results. I have severe anxiety issues and there is an audio tape for every single one of my problems. I‚Äôm gonna stick it out‚Ä¶ see how it goes for sure. If things continue to get better I‚Äôm gonna subscribe to support them because it could be the freedom in life I‚Äôve desires for so long‚Ä¶ \n\nI‚Äôm excited for this feeling\n\nNausea, gagging, dry-heaving\n\nThis ^^^\n\nThroat tension is a big one for me, also insomnia and poor digestion\n\nHeart palpitations and headaches. I still cant get rid of them. My head is chill, my body is panicking haha\n\nSame dude, the only time my heads not chill is when I focus on the body panic and think it's the big one lmao\n\nEXACTLY! I feel like I might have high blood pressure and I start panicking haha.\n\nAlso, Im afraid Im gonna have to stop taking ritalin because of it üò´\n\nBefore I had my prescription, I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all,\nhad random headaches, muscle pain, severe fatigue, mind fog, tremors, you name it. The worst by far for me was the derealization feeling that always came with dizziness and a feeling of like, like the ground was moving? I literally thought I was becoming insane. Those were very hard days. I experience all those symptoms if I don‚Äôt take my meds but in a larger scale, because I have to add the withdrawal. Chronic anxiety just fucking sucks.\n\nSorry for you I hope you will feel better\n\nWhat meds are you on?\n\nWhere do I begin‚Ä¶chest pain, tight throat, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, sweating, hot, cold, thirsty, itching , frequent urination, insomnia, feeling weird, off balance omg the list can go on\n\nI have the shortness of breath as my main symptom but it‚Äôs basically all day 24/7. Do you have that too? It‚Äôs so debilitating it‚Äôs unbelievable\n\nThat‚Äôs one of my worse symptoms the shortness of breath makes me so nervous! I feel like I can control everything else!  It comes in waves though. I had to see a pulmonologist because I was going insane.  They gave me X-rays, breathing test, MRI and ct scan and told Me to go see a psychiatrist lol\n\nMy list on notes lol from past 2 years, current one I think is vertigo for 3 months but idk if it‚Äôs 100% connected, just hopeful really. \n\n- Burning hands or arms like a lighter burn \n- Heart rate at 120 longterm \n- Nerve pains down arms\n- Rashes in skin \n- Numb arms for few days sometimes \n- Pins and needles in head\n- Throat closing up / choking sensation\n- Hand tremors longterm \n- Shaking eyes\n- Heart tickles\n- Heart rate dropped longterm (didn‚Äôt know it could go the opposite way üòç)\n- Teeth chattering longterm \n- Jaw clenching \n- Vertigo longterm\n- Tinnitus longterm \n- Full body shivering for days  \n- Feet and hands wet for a week ü´†\n- Severe hypnotic jerks (0 hours sleep in 4 days words cannot explain üòç)\n- Pins and needles everywhere all the fucking time for no apparent fucking reason üòç\n- Leg cramps for days\n\nBlood in my stool, chest pains, dizziness, and the worst of all is shaking hands\n\nAnxiety cant cause blood in your stool, id be seeing a doctor about that one.\n\nI did and thats what my gastro told me\n\nI think it can. It makes you blood preassure higher, which can get you small blood vessels to burst resulting to blood in stool/blood running from the nose.\n\nSource: had them both.\n\nExtreme headache/migraine, muscular fatigue, dizziness, sweating, facial flushing, GI problems, throat constriction, restless legs, insomnia‚Ä¶..\n\nIdk if it‚Äôs all ‚Äújust anxiety‚Äù, cause I feel like I‚Äôm dying, but my tests are fine. Dizziness, muscle twitching for months, stomach issues every day (ibs and sibo), bad sleep quality, neck tension, random body pains, eye floaters\n\nThis is literally me. I'm so sorry you go through this... I have been struggling with it for 4 years now... So exhausting.\n\nIn the same boat. me and my wife got into an argument and boom now I have bad panic attacks, so fun  üëé\n\nAm I the only one who's getting neck pain and headaches? It comes with the intrusive thoughts that I can't dispel when I have an episode. Also my GI is fucked.\n\nI carry all of my anxiety and stress on my shoulder which causes severe neck pain and headaches. My muscles literally turn into a ball.\n\nHeart palpitations, chest pain, muscle spasms (eyelid, eyebrow), more aware of visual disturbances (floaters, sparkles, spots), having a hard time swallowing, tingling sensation, stomach issues.\n\nWhen y‚Äôall say TMJ do you mean simply jaw popping? I started getting that mid way through the final stretch of my Masters program‚Ä¶very stressed. Does the shit ever go away naturally? I really accredited it to chewing gum literally all day long so I‚Äôm kinda curious now which I stopped but it still happens. Also severe anxiety can bring chest pains but subside when stressor is gone, been evaluated to confirm anxiety is the trigger.\n\nWhen I get bad TMJ symptoms it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm stressed and clenching my jaw in my sleep or while I‚Äôm working. I‚Äôve had some dental work done so my bite is different now and I find myself biting into the inside of my lower lip, I‚Äôll wake up with it swollen and painful cause I was chewing on it in my sleep.\n\nThe worst one gotta be the feeling of impending doom/dread\n\nDiarrhea babyyy. I love being worried about shitting myself on top of anxiety haah ahaha auahahah\n\nFloaters arises as a result of the vitreous humor's synchysis (liquefaction), which is generally a normal process that occurs with aging.\n\nAnxiety/stress, alone, cannot cause floaters. I am guessing that it only heightens one's awareness of said floaters.\n\nI had so many I couldn't even remember by now. But I wanted to say that it all stopped shortly after I got on meds when they started working.\n\nHow long did meds take to work and what medicine seemed to work best for you\n\nCant wait for my meds to work\n\nIs nausea a symptom? Or like the feeling of an upset stomach?\n\nYes, it‚Äôs a very common symptom. Because anxiety puts you in fight or flight, your body tries to excrete everything to make you lighter\n\nThanks. I was feeling nauseous after my relationship ended which I figured was from anxiety. But it happened randomly and not when I would‚Äôve expected it.\n\nYeah unfortunately it can just hit you out of the blue :/ I hope you find some relief soon!\n\nHairloss, fatigue, constantly catching colds, GI issues and eating disorder.\n\nTMJ. Restless leg. Chronic burping (idek if that's what's it is). Can't catch my breath\n\nChest pains/tightness, tingling arms, and neck tightness are the most common ones for me.\n\nNaturally, I became convinced I was having a heart attack everyday until I went to go have an EKG done lol\n\nIn the past it was wide spread burning pain, literally all over. My head, my abdomen, my legs, my arms, everything. Nowadays it's nausea, abdominal pain and cramping and chronic constipation. If it gets too much, long lasting physical fatigue too\n\nThere‚Äôs an endless list.. and sadly a lot of people don‚Äôt know/believe how wide ranging and debilitating physical anxiety symptoms can be. \n\nHeadaches\nShaking\nNausea/throwing up\nOther gastrointestinal issues, digestion.\nMuscle tension, clenching jaw.. \nHives \nChest tightening\nHeart pounding\nSweating\nHypervigilance \nDizziness\nFatigue \nInsomnia \nDifficulty falling or staying asleep.\nPain, back pain, leg pain ect. \nBeing restless \nTingling sensations\nHot flashes \nFeelings of impressing doom, Catastrophizing. \n\n\nFor people like me with CPTSD, my anxiety almost created a full blown phobia of sleep. \n\nWhich leads me in to, if you‚Äôre someone with say PTSD or CPTSD, BPD, chronic anxiety and stress ect. We tend to have higher levels of cortisol, adrenaline and other stress hormones because we tend have overactive nervous systems and stress response which will have us living in states fight or flight which create symptoms all on its own which can amplify the symptoms one may be experiencing from a co-occurring mental health disorder like an anxiety disoder. \n\nAgain on top of creating other symptoms of its own like trauma nightmares, flashbacks, avoiding people places and things that remind them of the trauma ect. \n\n\nI hope everyone dealing with physical symptoms from their anxiety or other mental health issues feels better. I understand how hard it is&lt;3\n\nChest pain, dizziness/off balance,  sometimes my vision seems off, tmj, muscle tension\n\nNeck pain! Shoulder pain, extreme fatigue. You name it.\n\nEye twitches, extreme muscle tension in the same places that push pressure on nerves\n\nMost of mine have simmered down, but I still get an all over buzzy tense feeling and a sense of being slightly off (vaguely dizzy/shaky and out of it) every now and then.\n\nStomach pains, constant sense of dread and fear, and just perpetually uncomfortable\n\nDry heaving and digestive problems.\n\nThe feeling that every single cell in my body is vibrating.\n\nStress induced IBS is the fucking WORST. I can‚Äôt do anything I‚Äôm uncomfortable with and feel ok. I lose all of my appetite for like a week and can barely keep food down. Just makes me more stressed and feel worse. Only ‚Äúcure‚Äù I‚Äôve found is weed but my parents are completely against it and it‚Äôs illegal where I live. I gotta get the fake stuff and it‚Äôs not the same.\n\nTremors, shortness of breath, elevated heart rate, complete loss of appetite, tension in my lower back, I have to piss a lot when I‚Äôm anxious, pacing aimlessly, random twitches. The horrible ‚Äúbutterfly in my stomach‚Äù feeling. Dry mouth list goes on‚Ä¶\n\nIm the sameüò≠\n\nWaking up shaking with my heart racing and a weird feeling in my stomach, blurry vision, random muscle twitching, insomnia.\n\nheadaches, fatigue, dizziness, hair loss, acid reflux, chills, GI problems. so many.\n\nNeck stiffness &amp; uncontrollable shaking of legs at nights (short bursts of it, mostly happening when Im about to sleep)\n\nThe shaking at night has happen to me a few times. Freaks me out\n\nWhile I can't say for certain all of them are linked to the anxiety itself I tend to experience\n\n-IBS-C\n-A second irritable wind right before bedtime where I am emotional and can't rest\n-Jaw and neck tension to the point I've been prescribed muscle relaxers for when it's the worst\n-When I attempted to work years ago, I would get so anxious I would vomit for days on end like the worst stomach flu you've ever had until it forced me to quit because I felt like death and couldn't keep water down \n-Jitters\n-Scrunched up face\n\nStartling during sleep, tremors, eye twitching, constant yawning, physical fatigue, stomach pain, chest tightness, palpitations, dizziness :))\n\nI never knew eye floaters can be a symptom‚Ä¶ I have healthy eyes (according to my optometrist and Ophthalmologist) but I get them often. I also get muscle twitches. Those were the worst when my anxiety was the worst, so they were easy to diagnose. I used to get stomach pains when I was younger, but not anymore.\n\nEditing to add dizziness, which is one of my more prominent symptoms. I deal with it so much, that I‚Äôve forgotten about it, if that makes sense. It‚Äôs like a part of my daily life now.\n\nAnxiety attaches to physical pain. And my face contorts, winces, grimaces, and I hear myself hiss or growl when I am sure I‚Äôm alone. The worst is being heard, in distress like that. I am so ashamed for making someone worry. So self isolation is ideal. Like a wounded wolf, just trying to keep it pushing. I become reactionary. The horrible attitude of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take this anymore, try coming at me, I need one more push to choose violence.‚Äù Anyone get those GIANT forehead üí¢ vein spasms, like a cartoon? If you can catch this on camera or have someone else see it, it‚Äôs at least hysterical to look back on. But at the time, it‚Äôs tunnel vision panic and nothing is funny.\n\nwhat‚Äôs the giant forehead vein? can you explain that to me.. my girlfriend who has GAD when her anxiety revs up gets a puffy swelling on her forehead.\n\nIt‚Äôs an anime trope to use these big red cross popping veins when a character gets‚Ä¶ anxious. It‚Äôs interesting how it‚Äôs used to show romantic anxiety, full on rage, or just a character‚Äôs response sometimes to a tiny WTF moment.\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/yghYbGhv7bGgwicB8\n\nPerpetual tightness/lump in my throat drives me mad.\n\ntrouble breathing\n\ngrinding my teeth severely in my sleep and unconsciously when im awake, daily nausea, almost daily panic attacks, stomach pains/issues, mouth salivating, tight throat, cold sweats, can‚Äôt catch my breath, being zoned out all the time :(\n\nbathroom issues, stomach cramps, muscle twitching in calves/face/arms, tension headache constantly, jaw clenching that i can‚Äôt control, dizziness, uncontrollable sweat, seeing ‚Äútv static‚Äù, nausea, major loss of appetite, constant cough or yawning, itching, brain zaps etc list goes on\n\nI have really long lasting headaches on one side of my head that throb like crazy. I have a lot of pressure in my right eye and ear somehow. I also have muscle twitching and like stabs or pins on all of my body, as if someone was poking me with a needle. I have the usual shortness of breath too.\n\nDizzy episodes that can last days, random muscle twitch (once had my eye twitch for 8 months), palpitations, muscle weakness, shortness of breath, neck pain, head pain, floaters and flashes, ear pain, depersonalization, buzzing in my head and body, high heart rate while trying to sleep, elevator drop sensation.. the list could go on\n\nitching, shortness of breath, muscle pains/tensing, stomach pain\n\nHeadaches, eye twitching, tiredness and most annoying i feel like i can only breathe manually\n\nNausea, Headaches, Stomach aches, throat tension, muscle spasms\n\nAll these honestly. Urgent anxiety bathroom issues, like I go somewhere new or have to talk to someone important and I immediately have to run to the bathroom because I‚Äôm so stressed. Got to the point where I could literally feel my body flood with cortisol. I got my medical marijuana card for anxiety (diagnosed GAD) and it helped for awhile and then I noticed my anxiety getting worse. I quit about 8 months ago and I‚Äôve never felt better honestly.\n\nSurprisingly almost nothing that I notice on a daily basis outside of elevated cortisol levels making losing weight a bitch and anxiety induced insomnia. I can't do much to fix the former and I'm on medication for the latter. Said medication unfortunately has the side effect of depressing my metabolism adding to the weight loss issue. I have CPTSD and the circumstances that caused it have allowed me to bind up and suppress things up to a point and then I have a meltdown. 99.9999% of the time the meltdown trigger happens at home. I've learned to suppress panic attacks until I'm in a safe place. I spent 2 hours silent crying in a car while holding a conversation with my mom who triggered the panic attack. She didn't like me showing emotion she felt was \"wrong\" for a given situation (aka couldn't be upset) or that she expected from me. Now I have severe anxiety, can't car pool unless I control leave time, and have problems regulating/processing emotions (I have started hysterically crying when happy).\n\nAdrenaline gets high that i start to gag or dry heave while eating in public, especially anything sweet. It's what got me into therapy in the first place because as a teenager, I couldn't eat around my girlfriend or her friends. People found it strange and I remember even having the problem as a young kid. It rarely leads to actually throwing up but it has on occasion. Medication and therapy helps, but it still creeps up. I'd say that people are more understanding of this than 20 or so years ago. Also a lesser issue has been tingling in my chest. Sort of like how your foot falls asleep and you try to walk on it, only felt around the lung area.\n\nRestlessness, increased heart rate, messed up stomach, derealization, cold hands, lightheadedness, dizziness.\n\nI get tense throughout my whole body, where my movements become either very twitchty and quick, or slow and strained. I tend to drop more things around me accidentally. and the usual, loss of appetite, nausea, shortness of breath and insomnia.\n\nI've always got tense shoulders and a headache\n\nMine mimics heart attack symptoms so that‚Äôs fun. My mind plays a game of chicken and I always lose.\n\nHigh blood pressure, sweaty hands, TMJ, breathing problems\n\nLack of energy, physically and mentally \nAnd this cause me a very low motivation on doing anything\n\nStomach pain, shortness of breath when stomach pain gets bad\n\nHigh heart rate, muscle aches, sweating (Hyperhydrosis), migraines, hot flashes.\n\nI usually get chest pains, rashes on my skin, numb hands, eye twitching, and sweating\n\nStomach issues, chest feels heavy, hot flashes, clenched jaw, tightening in my neck and shoulders, and shaking.\n\nHeart palpitations\n\nIs body temperature a symptom? I constantly have a warm body.. like warmer than regular people.. always. My pillow is never cold. My head is even hotter. \n\nOther than that, ig I have tmg, gut problems (nausea and acidity) and headaches. I'm not sure as I never got diagnosed but these symptoms seem to worsen during stressful times\n\nPretty much all of my \"Anxiety Symptom Roulette\" is listed here, but one I don't see mentioned is what I call \"itchy brain.\" Unlike a headache, it feels like when you refuse to scratch an itch for 30 seconds, just letting the sensation build. It's by far my least favorite symptom.\n\nShaking hands, muscles locking up, stomach pain, headache, body jerks, idk if this is related but I‚Äôve noticed when I get really really anxious I drool‚Ä¶.\n\nMy tongue goes numb, sounds weird, but I can tell when something is really bothering me when that happens\n\nI had so many‚Ä¶ the worst being so nauseous with a combination of the whole lump in the throat feeling I‚Äôd actually throw up in the morning while having panic attacks. Lots of GI issues, too. The derealization, sweating and heart racing was the worst though.\n\nTo offer some hope, at least for me, these all went away after I recovered. I haven‚Äôt had any symptoms since 2022 at this point. \n\nAnd, Yes, recovery is possible.\n\nLooking out my front door before I walk out. Just to make sure no one is out, so I don‚Äôt have to say hi to the neighbors while walking to my car.\n\nI could write you a novel but the #1 thing is not being able to sleep or stay asleep. I'll wake up randomly at 3 am and just think about work for absolutely no reason. I even got medicine for it and it doesn't work.\n\nHeavy on muscle tension in shoulders and throat. Anyone have tips to relax those areas?\n\nIf my anxiety gets really bad, I will get horrible chest pains for hours. First time it happened I thought I was having a heart attack.\n\nBack when my anxiety was really bad (thankfully i found good meds) after a panic attack, my muscles would lock up for the rest of the day, or until i could find sleep. My legs would become so stiff I couldn‚Äôt walk properly, i couldnt turn my head because my neck would lock, and i also couldn‚Äôt speak without slurring my words.\n\nMostly sweating and undergoing a ‚Äúspeechless‚Äù or catatonic state\n\nInsomnia is my worst symptom. Can‚Äòt make it through the night without waking up a couple of times. When the anxiety is very high because some upcoming event or a long workday ahead, I often can‚Äòt fall back asleep and lie awake from 3-6 when my alarm goes off.\n\nhives, itching, shaking like a puppy, increased HR, stomach drops like on a roller coaster, headache, back pain, stuttering, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, weight loss, chest pain, twitching, the throat tension I FEEL YOU, insomnia, procrastination. these are just from the top of my head, i‚Äôm sure a lot more. it sucks lol\n\nI‚Äôm surprised nobody mentioned about weird crawling sensations in feet and hands. Don‚Äôt know how to explain it but feeling like a strand of feather touched that part of the skin.\n\nDoes anyone else get muscle pain in your chest, shoulders and underarms? It‚Äôs so horrible\n\nWell I convinced myself I had MS until I realized all of my symptoms were also symptoms of anxiety and got worse with stress, if that tells you anything. Leg weakness, tingling, forgetfulness, dizziness, eye floaters‚Ä¶\n\nSevere muscle tension in my shoulders that can lead to tension headaches/ migraines, stomach pain and clenching, diarrhea, insomnia\n\nDM‚Äôd you beo\n\nMy lower GI loses its mind. Nausea and the runs when I am havng a major flare.\n\nDizziness, arm weakness, numbness, derealization , tachycardia,\n\nI start getting tingly limbs and muscle tension so I‚Äôll just constantly be stretching, nausea so bad I‚Äôm unable to eat, feeling like my heart has dropped, tense jaw that starts causing pain, I become really dissociated, fatigue, gasss so much gas and urge to üí© that I could go to the toilet multiple times in an hour, my hands shake, a really fast heart rate, a dry throat and sticky mouth.\n\nTmj, restless leg syndrome, motor tics, not recognizing my hands in peripheral vision. \nAt least right now\n\nHead pressure. Arms tingling/numbness. These concentrated short lived knifed pains in the head. Chest pain.\n\nConstant offbalance wobbly dizzy feeling\n\nshivering out of nowhere, excessive sweating, pains in my thighs, dizziness, heart racing, nausea and my stomach acting up\n\nBruh! My jaw just dropped bc I had no idea TMJ was an anxiety symptom and I had that. But for me GI issues, fast heartbeat, drowsiness,\n\nshitting my guts out\n\nWhat do you mean by eye floaters? Little black spots \"flying\" through your vision? Do you always have that, or in specific weather conditions only?\n\nRecently my heart rate has been around 110-120, so that‚Äôs fun (I‚Äôm going to a cardiologist but I‚Äôm fairly sure it‚Äôs anxiety related).\n\nI vomit every morning when I wake up\n\nMy heart races.\n\nHeadaches, sharp pain behind eyes, bowel movements. These 3 are the most annoying\n\nI found something life changing for those who are suffering I didn‚Äôt need my SOS meds today!!\n\nI lost my job and my find out my Gf was cheating on me, let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm using anger now.\n\nAre eye floaters related to anxiety? I‚Äôve had those since I was a kid\n\nI haven‚Äôt pooped in 6 days‚Ä¶\n\nrashes, hair loss, dizziness, scalloped tongue, stomach issues. when I am having periods of extreme anxiety I chew the insides of my cheeks in my sleep. This doesn‚Äôt sound major but my mouth becomes a crime scene and it‚Äôs painful to move my mouth and eat/or drink and it‚Äôs visibly puffy from the outside\n\nBrain fog has been the worst one\n\nNausea, nausea and nausea\n\nIBS\n\nGrinding my teeth\n\nGlobus sensation is the one that gets me down the most. I can reassure myself about my heart rate, am getting used to the palpitations and nausea, but that fucking globus sensation takes up my whole mental capacity and I can have it for a week or two at a time. People don't understand it's hard to concentrate, to hold a convo or go and do fun things when it feels like someone is gently garroting you from behind. Ugh!\n\nI cant eat icecream anymore. It causes me to go into a full blown panic attack. Its a real bummer. Chronic for me would be, fear of sudden death, body hurts, constantly tired, racing thoughts."

    "all_comment_text": "The constant worrying\n\nAbsolutely horrible feeling\n\nYep, worry everyday my heart isn‚Äôt feeling right. Makes me extremely paranoid. End up having to pull the car over and pace around for a minute to calm me down. - had afib 3 times when I smoked the Juul. Gave that up and haven‚Äôt had it since.\n\nI actually have a cardiologist appointment today since I haven‚Äôt had one in almost 4 years. \n\nAnd I made a psychiatrist appointment which I haven‚Äôt had in 2 years.\n\nI got an Apple Watch just to monitor my heart rate because I am terrified that it‚Äôs going to give out at any moment. It gives me some comfort. \n\nMy 8 year old already worries about his heart rate, without me having ever mentioned my struggles. So this is just something we anxious people do.\n\nMe too, that‚Äôs exactly why I got mine. But I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a blessing or a curse anymore because mine barely reads my finger anymore so it ends up causing me more anxiety.\n\nMy 13 year old is the same way.  He's already on Google looking up symptoms. I did my best to hide my anxiety from him all these years.\n\nMe too! And mostly not even knowing what I'm worrying about! The constant feeling that somethings just not right.\n\nAnd sometimes when I‚Äôm not explicitly worrying about something, my brain has this super annoying impulse of ‚Äúmaybe you‚Äôre underestimating something‚Äù\n\nDoes anyone have any tips to quell the worrying? I've been making slow progress towards reaching a sort of peace of mind my entire life, but the set-backs feel so damning\n\nThe only thing that helped me was meds. I tried all sorts of hobbies but it didn‚Äôt completely stop the worrying/ruminating.\n\nMantras, I think of worrying as a habit and not a regular function that I‚Äôm stuck with. I‚Äôm 40, I‚Äôve had this habit for a long time but I keep seeing the light so I know this works (for me at least). You have to form new paths in the brain, I worry about everything to some extent so different worries require different mantras. The catch is as soon as the worrying thoughts start, you have to stop them. If I start thinking about a health anxiety issue, I stand in the mirror and tell myself I‚Äôm fine over and over. When I have issues with friends I say this is just change it doesn‚Äôt have to hurt, over and over. I am not cured and will always struggle with this it seems but having these little tools help me to move on more quickly or not ruminate. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWhat type of thing are you worrying about? I find staying busy helps, trying to distract myself, have a glass of wine if it‚Äôs the eve. Go on a walk. Could you try regular exercise ?\n\nWell, ive had health anxiety for as long as I can remember. For 18 weeks ago I started getting visual disturbances. So I went to a private eye doctor that dilated my eyes and I dont know If everything went worse from that.\n\n- negative afterimages\n-dpdr\n-tinitus that hurts in the eye\n-laggy vision\n-pain in eyes/light sensitivity\n-random colors bursting up on vision\n-the sky is glittering\nAll this came from nowhere.\n\nI have lyme disease aswell apparently that Im now eating doxycycline for. Im on day 8/10 and nothing has changed.\n\nIts just too much going on for me. I dont know what to do.\n\nYep. And for me, the sickening feeling of wanting to do anything to not feel so scared. The flight instinct but without the capacity to flee a situation.\n\nExactly. I feel like i make reasons for myself to worry about. I think my mind hates me, for it makes me think that even the simplest of mistakes can destroy my life and how i should worry the fuck out over them.\n\nThe impending sense of doom ü´§\n\nOr the impending sense that you forgot something :(\n\nThis is almost tied for the worst feeling for me too. I always feel like I‚Äôm forgetting something and usually I am.\n\nAnd even if you‚Äôre not, it just this unquenchable feeling that never goes away\n\nThis is one reason I got out of the contracting field. It always felt like I was missing some crucial information on my contracts. I was always on edge and couldn‚Äôt get myself to rest, even on wknds!\n\nConstantly being in fight or flight mode and never being able to fully relax and enjoy anything\n\nYes. The smallest sound will make my jump out of my skin. I‚Äôm on high alert 24/7.\n\nI hate it! Even when just a pen drops I will jump up in fear. It sucks!\n\nIt‚Äôs taken away everything\n\nParanoid that people are talking/thinking about me behind my back\n\nI experience this too. Whenever I hear people whispering my mind automatically assumes they‚Äôre talking about me.\n\nsame when people laugh, especially when I'm doing something or when i pass. although at that point it's definitely about me.\n\nI hate this. I go through this constantly‚Ä¶\n\nYuup I immediately assume they hate me and if I really like that person, I avoid them. A lot of the time I find out later they actually liked me or didn‚Äôt hate me at allüò≠\n\nI feel youü´Ç\n\nthe worst üëéüèº\n\nOmg yes. Just last night I passed by 2 people who were having an ongoing convo, I tried to converse to 1 of them and they both ignored me. My automatic thoughts shot to ‚Äúare they annoyed at me? Did I do anything to make them hate me again? Or did they think I was talking to myself? Or did they purposely ignored me because they didnt want to have a convo with me atm?‚Äù :(\n\nThat‚Äôs me all the time. It gets to the point where I need to walk away from work and get my shit together\n\nAll of a sudden being too aware of my body and it‚Äôs functions\n\nWhich makes you even more anxious \nHyper awareness sucks\n\nI swear. I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe at all.\n\nI get this 24/7 it's so frustrating\n\nirregular/rapid heartbeat. Feeling my heartbeat gives me even more anxiety because i get worried there's something wrong with my heart\n\ni feel u w all my soul on this one\n\nOh yeah. I've had countless EKGs, several holters, a stress test and an echo cardiogram and still worry about my heart.\n\nMan am I glad I'm not the only one!  I thought I was some kind of paranoid idiot because of how many times I had my heart tested because of panic / anxiety episodes.\n\nOmg same! Everything seems normal but the heart  ‚Äúflutters‚Äù are mildly painful and pretty scary.\n\nPalpitations are the worst symptom\n\nSame, I already have a pre existing health condition that can affect my heart and when I feel an irregular heartbeat, I panic\n\nI totally relate. But on the other side, i feel assured that im not alone. Sometimes, i would tell myself that this is what being alive feels like to ease my worry.\n\nI know exactly what you talking about\n\nCan‚Äôt tell you how many times this sent me into a panic attack because I thought I was having a heart attack or dying.\n\nmine isn't even the palpitation itself, it's just that my heart sometimes beats hard and I'm completely confused thinking that there's something wrong, even though I suffer nothing, absolutely no alarming symptoms like fainting, blood, extreme weakness, nothing major, just the heart beating hard but for some reason I think it's beating hard because it's having difficulty circulating the blood, this paranoia is very irritating\n\nTHIS!\n\nCame here to say exactly this. A few years ago, I convinced myself I had congestive heart failure (I'm fairly healthy and was in my late twenties at the time).\n\nThis along with random chest pains (due to slouching and sleeping on my sides and compressing my chest in) I would have to sit straight and take deep breaths to prevent myself from having full blow panic attacks. \n\nI also noticed that i don't like listening to OTHER people's heartbeats. Like my own kids, if they hug my head to their chest I can only be like that fir a few seconds before I feel uncomfortable/scared\n\nThe random nights where nothing wrong has happened all day, but my heart really starts racing before bed and I get that feeling like I‚Äôm about to get caught doing somethin bad then I can‚Äôt sleep.\n\nYeahh! Like, I be lying on the bed and then suddenly I get chills as if I've done something bad and it came out and now I feel so guilty and embarrassed? Bruh I'm just trying to sleep leave me alone\n\nMe\n\nevery night\n\nDepersonalization\n\nI was going to say feeling cold, but yes. Definitely this one.\n\nI feel like for me its the uncontrollable crying because whenever im in an uncomfortable situation I instantly cry and always feel embarrassed because everything else I can kind of \"hide from the world\" except shaking but the crying is just so so so embarrassing\n\nAnd the sweating you cant really hide which is causing me alot more anxiety as well lol\n\nanxiety fucking sucks all round like omg can't I just be normal\n\nTrue true... Sometimes i really envy normal people\n\nOmg the sweating!!! I have so many antiperspirant products that I might as well just roll in flour\n\nHyperhidrosis is a bitch man. Just now i was at the barber shop and i was dripping sweating üòÇ\n\nWhy cant there be a pill to lower body temperature!?\n\nHot flashes ü´∞üèª\n\nSince I entered my mid 40s, the relationship between my hormones and anxiety is just a source of endless fun.\n\nYup that's my specialty haha\n\nthis combined with anxiety nausea is the worst\n\nYEP! And this just amps up the irritability, which makes me feel like an unfit mother, which causes MORE anxiety!\n\nThis is anxiety related? Damn, I really hate it when I have these. I immediately think ‚Äúim not pregnant or menopausal, why am I having these?‚Äù Learnt this from my mom, that you cant have it unless youre either of those; apparently shes wrong and outdated.\n\nsometimes i get black dots in my vision and feel like i‚Äôm going to pass out!\n\nDamn that sounds scary\n\nOmg I get the black dots too! It‚Äôs so scary and makes me think something is worse üò≠\n\nFeeling panicky and worried 24/7 for no reason (which in itself is horrible) when other people get to live their lives as normal and worry about the odd thing here and there like a dentist appointment or a driving test. Or even those lucky ones who never worry about anything! Wow, my life would be the polar opposite if that was me.\n\nThe waves of sadness\n\nYess the waves of sadness with unexplained cause and just feeling out of place\n\nChest pain. I‚Äôve been dealing with high blood pressure for the past 15+ years and even though I don‚Äôt have any heart problems yet, if I get chest pain, I freak out. It‚Äôs horrible.\n\nIts horrible as soon as i get anxious i start having chest pain and its pretty bad\n\nparanoia, crying, trembling, nausea\n\nThe insomnia for me. Wanting to sleep but being scared to fall asleep\n\nNever being able to be stress free. If it‚Äôs not the bills, it‚Äôs the health of my pet, if it‚Äôs not the pet then it‚Äôs work, if it‚Äôs not work then it‚Äôs making time to get stuff done. One thing substitutes the next\n\nHyper aware of things I wouldn't normally be, itches, hair moving, how things smell stronger, heart beat, breathing, all that lovely stuff.\n\nMy bowels turn to water. It‚Äôs so bad.\n\nYep the IBS added onto the anxiety is horrendous\n\nYep. Anxiety triggers IBS triggers anxiety...around and around forever. **It's the cirrrrcle of liiiife!***\n\nLmaooo I felt this so much!\n\nThe brain fog/inability to focus\n\nDoes brain fog make it sort of hard for you to talk? I almost start slurring my words when it‚Äôs really bad. I also become incredibly clumsy and not aware of my own body.\n\nDizziness and that everything is more exhausting that it needs to be\n\nYahh all day dizziness and u find any relief\n\nSocial anxiety, and lack of sleep\n\nThe tremors and palpitations\n\nThe physical symptoms like numbness in parts of body or heart palpitations breathing weird something feeling wrong with my body\n\nI get that 100%! I been feeling off for a week now, mostly physical symptoms like left side head tingling, pressure back of head, feeling dizzy( out of balance ), not feeling like i‚Äôm present in situations, it makes me think something is really wrong with my body but i have had test done on my heart, blood work, xrays, and absolutely nothing has came up.\n\nStomach pains and heartburn üò≠ can't sit still or relax. Can't sleep properly.\n\nOpportunity cost. The fact that you know full well about what you could've successfully done in a situation or achieved if we consider longer term, yet not being able to do it despite being aware of it in the moment because you're too anxious to.\n\nConstant feeling of dread just being an inch away from you. Clawing a paper thin barrier trying to get to you\n\nThats so energy draining\n\nThe heart beating too fast and nausea. I usually have to lie down for it\n\nOver thinking and the side effects\n\nshaking/tremor when waking or just not feeling good\n\nCortisol belly. Feeling that warmth in my mid belly section and being worried non stop then my heart races\n\nI get that cortisol belly alot too it's horrible\n\nOmg I didn‚Äôt know that had a name üò≠\n\nMe either, but it's perfect.\n\nMight be tmi but the stomach issues, when I get really bad anxiety it normally festers physically in my lower gut. Constant stomach drops and painful indigestion. Worst feeling ever :(\n\nBeing aware of everything on my body , i search for problem that doesn‚Äôt exist\n\nAnytime one problem ends another starts, never ending cycle.\n\nMy binge eating\n\nPuking is my worst fear in life and my anxiety makes me feel nauseous, which in turn makes the anxiety even worse and I spiral.\n\nSame here.\n\nNot being able to handle someone else's music and other loud or annyoing sounds (like loud exhausts). My blood pressure shoots up, i'm sweating and my heart races, especially when someone is playing (loud) music in the night, i can't sleep because of it and then i start to worry about not getting enough sleep which also hinders my sleep. Lots of people think its normal to play loud music until deep in the night, can't visit beaches since everyone has a bluetooth speaker and sitting in public transport there are so many people talking on speakerphone. \nBeing sensitive to those sounds is hell in todays world where silence is a luxury good.\n\nI‚Äôm exhausted and sore all the time from constantly being tense and the adrenaline jumps that come with being hyper vigilant.  I would say the most embarrassing for me are that I‚Äôm sweaty as hell.  I used to shake so badly I would have to sit on my hands so no one would see it, but that‚Äôs been better as I‚Äôve gotten older.\n\nI have a bad habit of chewing on the insides of my cheeks. When I'm particularly anxious, I start to taste a tiny bit of blood.\n\nDigestive issues and nausea\n\nNot being able to breath for months at a time consistently\n\nMental‚Äî The endless paranoia that keeps you from doing anything\nPhysical‚Äî Throat closing up and quivering voice out of nowhere\n\nThinking I‚Äôm about to drop dead any second. \n\nIt used to be heart health anxiety and now I‚Äôm constantly worrying that I am experiencing stroke symptoms. \n\nIt‚Äôs so exhausting.\n\nI spend so many days thinking that any minute is going to be the last and I should have done something to stop it.\n\nheadaches and blurred vision\n\nTo protect myself from anxiety I've basically turned off my emotions. It's a double edged sword because while I don't get super anxious anymore I also struggle to enjoy things. I don't get excited about things anymore. It's kinda Patrick Bateman 'i simply am not there' \n\nBut when I did have strong anxiety it was always the heart palpitations and manual breathing/air hunger that was the worst.\n\nThe physical symptoms like the shakes, the palpitations and the way it plays cute little games with my IBS as if they‚Äôre tag teaming me into submission. The way that all the therapy in the world can‚Äôt fix my overreactive nervous system. I can be managing my thought processes just fine (thanks CBT) and enjoying a social experience and then my body just betrays me. Love that for us.\n\nTo top it off, people coo over how slim I manage to stay no matter how much I eat, especially when I‚Äôm eating a meal. It‚Äôs so awkward only having the options of either brushing it off with laughter or giving an explanation that my body can‚Äôt hold calories like a non-anxious person because it‚Äôs burning stupid amounts in fight/flight/freeze mode and shitting out the rest.\n\nshortness of breath, trouble swallowing\n\nIf I‚Äôm having an anxiety attack in public, it usually starts with me breaking out into a cold sweat. It gets progressively more miserable from there. So I‚Äôd personally say sweating\n\nSame same üòÆ‚Äçüí®\n\nThe spinning of thinking the same thought over and over and over! Like damn, brain, calm down.\n\nThe urge to throw up, using the bathroom. It sucks so bad\n\nI was an adult before I realized that burgers at a fast food place we frequented weren't really making me sick. Traveling to college, we used to have to stop so I could use the bathroom after. I realized that the grease was just enough to cause stomach problems if I was anxious. If I wasn't anxious, nothing happened. \n\nI wish I had told my parents about my problems instead of getting getting sick like every day in highschool. Then again, I'm not sure that they could have sent me to a high school small enough for my anxiety lol.\n\nThey also probably wouldn't have understood anyway\n\nThe irritability. It's bad enough when I have a high anxiety day, but I hate it when it directly affects others that I care about as well\n\nTinnitus \nIt is a slow semi regular thump in my eardrum. I can't relax it away, no breathing exercises, no 5:5 .\n\nEating, I can't stop eating every time feel anxious and for that reason I get fat. ¬†And in past years it was the opposite, I didn't eat at all. I hate my life.\n\nI gained over 20 kilos due to anxiety\n\nThe worst thing is that eating relaxes a lot when we have anxiety. I would have preferred to be a smoker ü•≤.\n\nderealization, feeling like im about to go insane or die.\n\nFeeling like I can never stop/relax\n\nThe physical pain it causes my body.\n\nThe Itchy feeling sucks because it‚Äôs super overstimulating and draining.\n\nfeeling of doom/feeling like i'm gonna die and losing feeling/control of my hands\n\nThose moments where you feel slightly better but then you remember that looming thought and then your stomach pitfalls.\n\ncrying for sure ü´†ü´†\n\nThe feeling of either gagging or throwing up. I just found out yesterday it's worse if I'm on a boat.\n\nMy bladder or bowels decided to join the game\n\nShallow breathing, not feeling like I‚Äôm getting enough air.\n\nspiraling and not believing any logic. i will worry about something happening and have ALL the facts in front of me that it won‚Äôt or isn‚Äôt happening and i will still be unable to believe that it won‚Äôt happen. like that 1% could be me. even though that could be true, it‚Äôs extremely unlikely but my brain won‚Äôt allow me to believe it.\n\nHow it makes me lose all rationality and critical thinking. Being anxious + suddenly thinking all other kinds of shit can happen is a dangerous combo\n\nIBS/chronic gastritis and the nausea. \nI have emetophobia, when I get nauseous I get really anxious and when I'm anxious I get nauseous. This has spiraled so much that whenever I get VERY mild stomach pains I get severe anxiety.\n\nDizziness ü•≤\n\nworrying about everything every minute. simple things like cooking a meal can trigger and my mind starts spinning and all of a sudden im in my  head thinking a cant do a fucking simple dinner and my family will hate the food etc. but usually i feel that way with the tasks at work\n\nMy weak bladder. I always have to pee when I‚Äôm nervous. Also panic attacks and racing thoughts.\n\nWhen you constantly feel the need to go to the bathroom! Even when you‚Äôve just been.\n\nSweating and explosive diarrhea :/\n\nIBS flare up\n\nThe bowel pains and uncontrollable urge to poop ü´†\n\nWhen my body is tense and I try to think of why I‚Äôm anxious so I can help my body relax but I have absolutely no good reason to feel anxiety yet I cannot make my body relax :( so I‚Äôm tense all over\n\nTie between the constant hypervigilence and the nausea.\n\nThe heart palpitations and chest pain. It‚Äôs definitely the scariest part for me and it just hurts\n\nFeeling like I can‚Äôt breathe even though I‚Äôm fine? Also the health anxiety of thinking ‚Äò what if? What if it‚Äôs ‚Äòc word‚Äô? I‚Äôm so tired of this ‚òπÔ∏è\n\nbounding pulse is soooo fucking annoying man\n\nMixed physichal symptoms that won't stop or switch from one to another - like please give me a break \n\n\nI can get headache for hours then suddenly switch to chest pain then switch to abdominal pain then switch to right arm.and leg weakness then back again to shortness of breath\n\nFeeling like I‚Äôm not quite awake or ‚Äòwith it‚Äôs 24/7\n\nmaybe panicking while trying to do something as simple as going to the grocery store will do it\n\nWhole body tightness + cold hands and feet making me feel sick when I walk or move (heart pounding)\n\nDropping sensations. The my heart then beats more!\n\nConstant Worrying and Insomnia. Insomnia comes with the worrying. I wish I could control my thoughts. People say to distract yourself but as soon as the distraction ends the thoughts come back. It's like whenever there's nothing it's filled in with fear as a default. It keeps me up at night and makes it agonizingly difficult to get good sleep.\n\nThe tightness in my chest and nonsensical feeling of impending doom\n\nFor absolutely no reason most of the time\n\nwhenever i‚Äôm in literally any situation with something that could cause damage (cutting up an apple, walking next to a road, etc.) i have to consciously keep myself from doing something to myself out of fear that im just gonna do it, even though i don‚Äôt experience genuine suicidal thoughts. i also get intrusive thoughts which is a whole separate issue and i always have to clench my fists or tense up my face to make sure i don‚Äôt act on them because im terrified that i will subconsciously, so i just make weird faces randomly and its kind of embarrassing.\n\nPhysically, the nausea is the most debilitating, it's like I can't concentrate on anything else and I feel like it's never gonna end. I've had an entire year in the past where I could barely eat anything, I couldn't even smell alcohol without gagging. Lost lots of weight and felt so awful the entire year. All because of my anxiety...\n\nAlways nausea/dry heaving.\n\nBeing stuck in fight or flight mode to where the smallest sound will make me jump like I‚Äôm under attack.\n\nWhen it feels like a heart attack\n\nFeeling hot like not from the weather but like hot all of the sudden and awareness of your breathing and heartbeat! Usually after all this nausea kicks in!! I really heat all this and that I have no control\n\nIntrusive thoughts.\n\nDiarrhea, its really annoying\n\nThe butterfly nauseas acid feeling\n\nThe spiralling, with my brain gathering as much fuel around me to create new worries and problems.\n\nMy brain trying to convince me that it's as bad or worse than it is.\n\nAvoidance\n\nThe unrealistic overthinking, you know that it's silly, but it still doesn't take away how it make you feel\n\nDizziness and palpitations üòî\n\nPalpitations\n\nFeeling like my throat is closing\n\nFor the most part my physical symptoms have subsided over the years (maybe due to meds). I‚Äôd say the edge has mostly been taken off as well but sometimes, man, I just spiral. One thing goes wrong and I completely dramatize it and my mind goes to worst case scenario for a number of things\n\nPanic- leaves me completely unproductive\n\nRepetitive and obsessive worrying over the same thing on an endless loop for hours or even days on end\n\nPalpitations. I hate it so much.\n\nThe constant sense of uneasiness. I can feel it all throughout my body.\n\nHeart palpitations/erratic heartbeat\n\nThe painful muscle spasms affecting the face, hands (midwife's hand) and feet.\n\nRight now? The inability to sleep comfortably. Doesn‚Äôt happen often but sometimes when I go to bed (like tonight) I have an irrational fear of sleeping and when I do manage to sleep I pop awake every 2 hours.\n\nI work late night shifts and this doesn‚Äôt help when it‚Äôs my day off. Currently on negative hours of sleep cause I didn‚Äôt sleep well the night before (4 hours at best) came back from work to sleep mm maybe 1.5 and now trying to wind down from waking up with a panic attack with nausea\n\nfeeling like i can‚Äôt breathe right\n\nChest pains and hyper sensitivity to my innards and scenarios, middle chest sensations\n\nLimbs seizing up with extreme pain and slurring of words with numbing of face\n\nHands down, the dizziness absolutely killllsssss me\n\nIt can change day to day‚Ä¶ but usually the incessant mind pops/mental chatter, and paranoia\n\nDamn am i the only one who gets sweaty when anxious.\nHave not seen anyone mention sweating\n\nThe anxiety part\n\nRumination"

    "all_comment_text": "For emergencies, Xanax. If I can feel it coming on, I have a list of things to do. I go through them until one works. Meditation, breathing exercise, take a walk, call someone, etc. I just go down the list and have the ones that work well higher up.\n\n\nI understand the hesitancy that professionals have with prescribing benzos, but I‚Äôve used it responsibly, only for emergencies, for nearly 10 years now- and every time I need it refilled, it has to be a mega hassle. I‚Äôm always treated with suspicion and it just perpetuates my anxiety. I wish there were a better system for it\n\nYeah. I‚Äôve been on them as needed for about the same amount of time. I usually need to schedule a check-in psych appointment after a couple refills. A lot of docs are now starting to try to wean people off of them because of the possible link to dementia. I use a little bit every day just so I can sleep a bit better and don‚Äôt have to have an alcoholic drink, so it‚Äôs suited me well and I‚Äôve never gone up in dose.\n\nCome to Mexico. Psychiatrists in here dont deal AS MUCH as in the US with drug addicts. So most of them in my experience never hesitate in prescribing benzos at all.\n\nI'm in Europe and have received benzos for emergencies from my GP even. Had another doctor tell me to immediately taper off them because I was addicted according to her, so I did that, but never got any withdrawals and now use them occasionally whenever I get extremely anxious or simply cannot sleep.\n\nYes!!!! Ironically they won‚Äôt prescribe it to people who are mentally going through it when that‚Äôs when I need it the most!! It‚Äôs so frustrating.\n\nI use them the same way, it's genuinely easier for me to buy them off the dark web\n\nWhere would one find on the dark Web? Asking for a friend haha\n\nGet a .onion browser extension and go to dark.fail to find a market's current address. I've had success with Bohemia but they all exit scam eventually so don't keep any money in it and always do transactions in Monero if possible. Always take the time to use PGP encryption when communicating with sellers, it's not as hard as it seems. There are sites you can do the encrypting/decrypting on. Buy from well reviewed vendors in your country. Never the cheapest ones. Test for both fentanyl and xylazine, you can buy the test strips on Amazon.\n\nAnother option, I believe you can just buy bromazolam as a research chemical over the clearnet, which IS a real benzo. A lot of research chem sites are scams though, do your research carefully before ordering. Again test for both fent &amp; xylazine before using. Don't buy anything from anyone off Reddit.\n\nIs it your provider that causes issues? \n\nI have a .5mg script for Xanax (as does my wife) and I've never had an issue getting a refill.\n\nAgree. Although my psych does not want to keep prescribing me Ativan for its addictive nature. I only take it during the worst of the worst panic attacks and it calms me down within 30 minutes. It‚Äôll be sad to have them gone!\n\nI can't really get xanax so for my emergencies it's alcohol. Does basically the same thing to the brain, just way less healthy\n\nHere‚Äôs a link with some things that I stole for my list. https://themighty.com/2020/04/digital-resource-toolkit-get-through-coronavirus-pandemic/?utm_source=engagement_bar&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=story_page.engagement_bar/\n\nYa Xanax and putting on big bang theory for me\n\nSame. I get 20 a month. Sometimes I take the 20, sometimes I take 10. Because of that, I have like 80 in a personal stash! But the doc makes me feel like I am a drug addict every single time‚Ä¶ been on this amount for 10 plus hears\n\nI‚Äôm really glad I‚Äôm not the only one who uses Xanax. My therapist makes me feel like I‚Äôm a druggie for using something prescribed for the situation.\n\nhugging my stuffed animal (Pusheen) and watching Pusheen videos on YouTube\n\nPusheen is the best!\n\nIf you like Pusheen, check out Bichi Mao.\n\nAww this is sweet\n\nI have a Pusheen too! And a little hamster squishmallow that are my anxiety friends. I'm 32 and sleep with stuffed animals at night LOL I need to be holding something üòÇ\n\nOmg I sleep with stuffed animals at night too haha I‚Äôm 29\n\nI know they can be unpopular on this subreddit but beta-blockers (if I have any) are something I can take and guarantee I won‚Äôt end up having a panic attack. \n\nFailing that, a call to my mum‚Ä¶I‚Äôm in my 20s but I don‚Äôt care, she‚Äôs the best support ever.\n\nI'm 44 and still call my parents when it's overwhelming.\n\nWhat's your secret to a good parent / child relationship, I need to know üòÖüòÇü•≤\n\nDon't know if there's a secret I can disclose. They've just always been very supportive and their children means a lot to them. I sometimes think they feel it's partially their fault I have the difficulties I do, but it's no ones fault. But you really just want your children to be happy no matter what. As a father I can attest to that.\n\nDamn, I wish I could say the same about my parents. But hey, it's not anyone's fault except whoever played the cards üòÇ\n\nI wish I could do this! ü´∂ My parents are majority of the reason for my anxiety/ptsd.\n\nI honestly think my dad may be some of the reason my anxiety is as bad as it is\n\nHUGS! Talk Therapy has been super helpful for me and the family dysfunction.\n\nYes to beta blockers!! Propranolol has been a life saver for me.\n\nLove me some propranolol\n\nCame here to comment propranolol. I personally don‚Äôt have any side effects besides, just less anxiety\n\nI usually NEED to diffuse an anxiety attack after I talk to my mom ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nWhy are they unpopular here? I just started taking them and wish I had earlier\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe only issue that I‚Äôve ever had with them as an avid runner and road cyclist is that they absolutely ended my ability to participate in those activities. And the hotter it was outside the quicker I wound have an issue. They‚Äôre otherwise great tho. I had to switch my BP meds to benazepril, tho, and while these work pretty well for BP they‚Äôre just not the same for the anxiety.\n\nInteresting, I‚Äôve been wondering if that‚Äôs been the case with me‚Ä¶I went to hot yoga yesterday, which was the first intense workout I‚Äôve tried while on them. Worst class I‚Äôve ever had lol, just felt like I was gonna pass out after 15 mins and almost left early. Last time I went I felt fine (pre beta blockers). For you, do they reduce your fitness, or make you feel faint?\n\nThat‚Äôs sweet\n\nYes! My anxiety is so physical based, and on the other hand, physical symptoms cause anxiety. So propranlol has been a lifesaver to me.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPart of my job is presenting in front of a group of small people‚Ä¶ so my psychiatrist gave me propranolol to take 30 min before each presentation and it has helped significantly!!\n\nSame for me. I started running group therapy and propranolol has been an absolutely game changer for me. Love it\n\nYes beta blockers I'm on propranolol 10 mg always works.\n\nTurn on an old tv show or movie that comforted me as a kid and curling up on the couch or bed. I get some panic attacks that last for hours and nothing helps those.\n\nIt's funny that I get super anxious about stuff from the past. Like old TV shows or songs that remind me of when things were better. That summer of '69 song always gets me anxious, I feel like so many missed opportunities in life and for some reason that song triggers massive anxiety about things I could have or should have done..\n\nI turn on the 24/7 Yugioh channel on Pluto.\n\nI take a half a hydroxyzine (12.5 mg).  In extreme situations I take a .25 mg Xanax or Klonopin.\n\nI was taking like 200mg of hydroxyzine and it wasn't helping hahaha. I'm glad it is working for you! It's crazy how meds work for some and not others.\n\nHave you tried gene site testing? It sounds like your body cannot metabolize Hydroxyzine correctly.\n\nI haven't. I went through 4 years of med changes and trying a ton of medicines. Burnt out on that end right now so I'm just taking what I'm prescribed and trying to work harder in therapy and trying to make positive habits. I'll probably revisit though once winter hits again. I've been on an upward trend since summer began.\n\nInsurance is a bitch to cover it, but ever since I got the testing done I haven‚Äôt had any issues with medications. I understand feeling burnt out on med changes &amp; I think it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre working in therapy &amp; trying to make positive habits! It‚Äôs way easier said than done.\n\nWere you taking it regularly?! 200 MG is wild unless you have tolerance. Xanax and hydroxyzine both don't carry the benefits(for me) if taken too often.\n\nI was. It never worked even at a smaller dose xD. My psychiatrist was bewildered. I have a twin sister who could only 25mg because she would fall asleep sitting up hahaha.ive realized my body just thinks it's in danger and going to die all the freaking time... so being gentle and kind and checking in with myself seem to be better at relieving some anxiety than meds currently.\n\nWeed, specifically more sedating strains. If I‚Äôm having a breakdown of some kind it‚Äôs like a silver bullet.\n\nAny recommendations? I‚Äôve been experimenting to see which works best for anxiety and tbh the only reason I got into it.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for specific effects, you should look into how terpenes work, and figure out which ones would suit you best. Then just look into which strains have those terpenes. Leafly has some info on this.\n\nFor me, GMO has been a favorite. When I use it I feel calm, but not too cooked to think. It‚Äôs also good for tension and pain.\n\n1mg xanax for the win. Only to be used in emergencies. Or i go to my friends and curl up on her couch so im not alone and she makes me feel safe.\n\n&gt;Or i go to my friends and curl up on her couch so im not alone and she makes me feel safe.\n\nThat's so cute I wish I had that\n\nimma be real, the cars movie\n\nLIFE IS A HIGHWAY and due to the terrible road infrastructure of the country I reside in, it‚Äôs gettin really hard to enjoy the ride, and I have no choice but to RIDE IT ALL NIGHT LOOOOONG\n\nFully relate to this tbh. That movie is just so comforting and chill for some reason lol.\n\nYou are incredibly real for that, I also fuck with the Cars movie\n\nYou should play the cars game for the ps2! It's a fun game plus it allows you to explore the town, the desert, and the forest area with the old gas station. When I was a kid I loved driving around and iirc it even has a similar soundtrack to the movie.\n\nMy dog, a walk outside, or Seinfeld. But mostly my dog. I call her my \"lil Xanny.\"\n\nLmao Seinfeld is also my comfort show üòÇ\n\nIntense exercise (run, swim, bike, etc.; helps release cortisol and subside the fight-flight feeling) and/or putting my face in ice cold water (‚Äúreboots‚Äù nervous system)\n\nAs a runner and road cyclist, do concur!\n\nReplenish electrolytes. 1-2 t spoons of sea salt in a 17 Oz bottle of water, and magnesium and potassium supplements. Because for me my anxiety comes from electrolyte defienciency. May be due to dieting, but even before dieting I'd have it, but I always feel better after supplementing.\n\nSame! I‚Äôve been tested for POTS and Dr has recommended more salt. I tend to avoid salt a lot up until my diagnosis. My low sodium can trigger an anxiety attack. I keep liquid iv on hand or throw salt under my tongue in desperation too.\n\nKlonopin lol.\n\nüòÇ I‚Äôve been there\n\nOk, I'm gonna sound a little weird but... I improvise a sauna in my bathroom.\n\nHear me out:\n\nI turn on the shower so it's just dripping a bit, and put it on the highest temperature. \n\nThen I close the whole bathroom, windows included. These two steps will create steam.\n\nThen I grab my cellphone and a comforting book (the most effective the last times was Howl's Moving Castle) and lock myself there. Nobody interrupts a shower, you know? So they don't even have to know I'm freaking out.\n\nThen I put one of two music videos. One is \"Pok√© and Chill\", on Youtube, and the other is \"Zelda and Chill\", also on youtube. \n\nThen I sit on a place where I can feel the water splashing slightly on my feet, but the book won't get wet.\n\nAnd then I read. \n\nThat's it. At first, it doesn't seem like it will work, but slowly, as I focus on the water, the heat, the steam, the music, and the story, I get calmer and calmer. 30 minutes are normally enough to quiet even the worst of the panic attacks.\n\nIn the end, I get out and sit a bit in front of my fan, feeling it cool me. \n\nI don't do it that often (thankfully I'm finding techniques that work so things don't get as bad), but when nothing else works, this does.\n\nPanic SOS meditation on the Calm app. Listened to it on repeat and it saved me during a particularly rough episode\n\nxanax üòä\n\nI take a propranolol, and within 20 minutes everything goes away (if it doesn't then I drink or eat something sour)\n\nWhat's your dosage on propanolol? I am on 10 mg and I even took 20mg today and still had a really bad panic attack, had to leave work early\n\nDid your heart still race or was it more hyperventilating and other symptoms? I ask because propranolol stopped the heart racing for me, but I would still be having just as bad a panic attack because it seemed to make breathing feel even harder than usual and gave me dizziness. The heart pounding used to be my biggest fear but after my propranolol stint, I've realised that I'm much more scared by the breathing symptoms. And I actually got more scared that I was freaking out so bad with a slow heart rate and convinced myself I was gonna die from too slow a heartbeat ffs\n\nlmao man that blows and I‚Äôm only commenting here because I know exactly how that train of thought goes and I find myself going down this exact same spiral all the time üòÇ don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôre not alone. Anyway I hope you see this comment before I delete it! Drink some water and head to sleep\n\nThank you and sorry you know what this shit is like. Its the worst. I'm doing a bit better now and did in fact get some sleep. Hope you're doing okay too and having a better day today\n\nSame for me with the breathing symptoms on propranolol - that is the worst.\n\nIs there a benefit to sour? Or just works for you? I feel like I‚Äôve heard this somewhere\n\nNot OP but when I can feel anxiety coming on I just eat something wild like for instance a banana pepper\n\nTakes the edge off it's crazy lmao\n\nI take daily 20mg Propranolol for my migraines and 200 mg Sertraline for my anxiety. I'm currently taking them at nights since I was getting really bad anxiety attacks in the mornings before work, but maybe I should switch to mornings....\n\nHydroxyzine.\n\ni really wanted to like this as it did take away some physical anxiety but it didn‚Äôt help the anxiety in my head üò≠ just gave me more panic attacks about side effects esp the side effect that made me so dizzy and off balance. hoping to get a new med in a few weeks when i meet with my doctor\n\nSame..my anxiety remained, but I was falling asleep at my desk!\n\nYup, it just makes me super drowsy and sleep a lot with very vivid dreams and nightmares.\n\nAt what dosage? It's so strange because after getting prescribed hydroxyzine, I got it filled but didn't use it except for morning after taking full spectrum CBD drops before bed, I woke up at 7am having a panic attack. I took half of a 50mg pill and within 10 mins, I was snapped out of it. Like, that feeling of adrenaline just gone in the snap of a finger. Best feeling ever. However, it made me drowsy the rest of the day.\n\nNow, if I take half of a pill, it just makes me feel drowsy and sleep a lot then sometimes have vivid dreams and nightmares.\n\nShould I take the full 50mg? I want that feeling of an adrenaline rush disappearing again when I'm dealing with anxiety.\n\nI hit my thc vape pen\n\n5 things you can see, smell, hear, taste, feel etc\n\nMy daughter does this too. Her process is:  5 things she can feel, 4 things she can hear, 3 things she can see, 2 things she can smell and 1 thing she can taste.\n\nClonazepam. Paper bag (if it‚Äôs a panic attack). Hot shower. A hug from my loved ones. Sleep, if possible.\n\nInvest in a well made large faux fur blanket. They work wonders. You get what you pay for. Don‚Äôt go cheap.\n\nI purposely made my bed similar to a hotel one down to the smell. If I‚Äôm gonna rot my life away I wanna be comfortable. \n\nTen pillows. \nMattress pad. \nWhite sheets. \nThe smell cheat code? Powder tide and bleach. Don‚Äôt ask it‚Äôs super therapeutic lol\n\nTalking it out with my husband. \nHe has learned over time, how to talk me down when my gremlin brain starts getting out of control.\n\nIf he‚Äôs not avail for whatever reason, going for a run also helps.\n\nIf we're talking like an impending panic attack emergency? Half a Xanax. I call it my 'anxiety rescue inhaler'.\n\nGum, sour candy, and running my hands under really cold water or taking a cold shower if I‚Äôm at home. I‚Äôve found tapping into anything to do with my senses that‚Äôs sharp (i.e cold/ice, sour, etc), it helps bring myself a bit back to earth and not let my ENTIRE being fall into anxiety.\n\nIf I had that I wouldn‚Äôt be constantly suffering\n\nSame\n\nThe 5 Sense grounding strategy\n\nI go for a walk. Every single time I have had an anxiety attack I calm myself just enough to flee and go for a really long walk no matter the weather. Nature is the only place I feel safe enough to be myself and not be judged. Sometimes I talk to my mom, but she can be over protective. I often feel very much alone when dealing with negative emotions and I am too much of a burden for people to care or want to listen when their problems are bigger than mine\n\n. My best friend though had a chat with me about this mentality last night and told me I need to text her or something when my emotions become overbearing because I opened up about how much within the past year or so I have been on my own struggling with my own emotions. It has gotten much better though with her help too, and it made me teary eyed when she told me she was so proud of me for how far I have come in learning to become healthy with my emotions, and was especially proud I was able to calm myself down the last time my anxiety was getting bad that she knew it was going to explode, but I was able to self regulate with the tips she had given me. \n\n  \nBut yeah, a walk... that is the only thing that helps me reallocate my extra energy when anxious and help soothe me when I'm having an anxiety attack. I hope this helps!\n\nWarheads ~ the extreme ones are the most sour. Blue and red work the quickest\n\nNothing is bound to work. I try to thrown away the anxiety thoughts, not recognising them as mine. Like \"you don't belong here, and you are without power\" and then I try to focus my mind on something else, like music where I can sing along or something similar.\n\nmy journals. I even have a \"gibberish\" journal where I can just write nonsense on it until I let it out. It helps me a lot\n\nNo word of a lie, Pym the Shower Cat on TikTok\n\nI just discovered this the other day, but I watch the math rounds of 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown on YouTube. I'll play along and the math problems completely occupy my brain while the contestants make me laugh. If for whatever reason I can't, I'll do something similar by reciting the periodic table of elements by 7s or some other number, which takes every ounce of my brain power to remember.\n\nPerscribed narcotics\n\ncold water on my chest, neck, and face + a Dramamine (if it‚Äôs making me dizzy or nauseous, which it often does) + noise-canceling headphones + a cough drop or mint in my mouth\n\nHopping in the shower has a 90% success rate for me\n\nOld Vine compilations\n\nPillows and blankets and stuffies\n\nLorazepam\n\nmy puppy and weed\n\nListening to SpongeBob music and imagining I'm just in some zany cartoon, and that the thing making me anxious is just a goofy plot device.\n\nPraying, breathing, writing it down\n\nIt‚Äôs not a good coping method and borders on emotionally addictive but I was prescribed mirtazapine about six years ago for anxiety-induced insomnia. It still works really well to this day to the point where I pretty much go numb if I double my usual dose from 15 mg to 30 mg. I have emetaphobia so I usually start with taking some antacids, but if those don‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll take the mirtazapine and hope for the best. I even take it with me when I leave the house knowing damn well I can‚Äôt take it if I‚Äôm driving because it causes extreme drowsiness, but knowing that it‚Äôs on me is reassurance enough. Aside from the emotional dependence, the only downside is knowing that I‚Äôm stuck inside for the day if I take it early enough because I‚Äôll sleep for anywhere from 9-12 hours after I take it.\n\nI have emetaphobia as well! I have somehow managed to hoard a good amount of zofran for emergencies, but mint gum is also helpful if I‚Äôm not too nauseous.\n\nI use mirtrazapine too! Before i got xanax i used half a mirtrazapine and it works pretty well for anxiety.\n\nListen to rain asmr videos\n\nTulsi tea or passionflower tea\n\nKlonopin in my key chain at all times , Benadryl with it if needed\n\nClonazepam\n\nclonazePAM\n\nFor emergencies, alcohol. If I‚Äôm at home though I can generally take a beta blocker and it‚Äôll help\n\nMy doctor prescribed me a Xanax to take in case of emergencies. But I want to try sour candy. I've heard that the sensory experience helps relieve anxiety, which makes sense because you're so distracted by the sourness. \n\nI do box breathing or 4-7-8 breathing and that helps. I also hop on the treadmill or do a yoga class to help relieve my symptoms.\n\nIn my ER anxiety attacks I take a Clonazepam, lay on an ice pack and breathing techniques.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYep, same. But unfortunately, I'm now a daily user- I adjust dose according to how bad my anxiety is that day. Still, it's better than fearing death at every moment and ending up with paramedics at my house every other week.\n\nXanax\n\nLaugh.\n\nClonopin lol\n\nmedical marijuana saved me tbh\n\nLorazepam, but to be honest sometimes alcohol.\n\nWeed\n\nPsyllium husks two tbsp in warm water.  It thickens like oatmeal.  Eat it with a spoon.  Not sure why but it does the trick.\n\nClonazepam, weed or a cold drink\n\nIt's a bit of a time investment but self help books. Just that reminder that my feelings aren't crazy and that others feel those same emotions.\n\nOther than Xanax or Ativan, an ice cube on my ear. Really helps ground me\n\na cigarette:3\n\nEmergencies: low dose of Gabapentin or ‚ÄúGABA Calm‚Äù supplement by Source Naturals.\n\nMystery Science Theater 3000\n\nooh i like this question. i take showers in the dark\n\nI'm on Prozac for my anxiety, but recently, it hasn't been working. I get anxiety attacks less frequently, but when I get them, nothing works. The only thing that even comes close to letting me start to think is my animals (horses, dogs, cats, and nature ), and my bf ( I basically try to sync my breathing to his which helps lower my heat rate) which, I don't see my bf often. At this point, music only seems to help me not bawl my eyes out, just not stop the anxiety.\n\nQuetiapine\n\n10-30mg of Propranolol.\n\nzofran.\n\nWeed &amp; hydroxyzine.\n\nSplashes of cold water to the face, it's like a hard reset for me\n\nOrgasms and exercise\n\nA highly specific to me playlist of songs that I associate with strong emotions/memories. It cuts through the spiral for me and it helps to have it so easy access. Those THC gummies that have CBD in them (a 1:5 ratio) at the same time if I'm desperate.\n\nXanax. Then some hypnotic to put me on a cloud long enough to recover my thoughts.\n\nlisten to some of my favorite music\n\nWeed for me, just a hit or two when I‚Äôm about to have a panic attack and I chill out pretty quickly\n\nA serious dependency on prescribed benzos. 6mg a day every day.\n\n1mg of xanax is my last resort but has really saved me so many times\n\nLay outside the shower on the cool tile and listen to the shower run. \n\nIf I am out/at work, music helps.\n\nMy Patrick star blanket that goes over my head like a hood, a beer and watching SpongeBob.\n\nWatch an old comfort show, or call my mam &gt;_&lt;\n\nMy MD has never prescribed a benzo, just increased the Prozac dosage. I get why she's hesitant, but it sucks because I have no history of substance abuse, and my anxiety has interfered with several jobs. \n\nSo, for now, deep breathing, if I'm in public. At home, a nap, or petting my cat.\n\nLemon Drops or Warheads. The sour taste makes my brain take a hard reset.\n\n40 mins of cardio\n\nI can't tolerate the stronger emergency meds, so docs suggested liquid Benadryl. A dose of that + either a guided meditation or a comfort show and I'm either knocked out or not thinking anymore in 30 minutes lol\n\nI take beta blockers for migraines and a heart condition, but it also works to help with my anxiety. Done wonders for me. I also have Seroquel i take when it gets really bad. Then there‚Äôs the typical take a walk, call someone, watch an animated show (family guy, bobs burgers) etc.\n\n1mg of Klonopin, my dogs, my bed and anything on TV. Lately it's reruns of either Psych or High Maintenance.\n\nDuring the day working out or just going for a walk to get the natural serotonin/dopamine flowing, at night if I have the luxury of not having any plans of leaving the house and I‚Äôm just trying to relax or sleep, thc works wonders for me but. That‚Äôs not for everyone and it doesn‚Äôt really relax me when I‚Äôm out and about in public. Really just a couple hours before hitting the sheets kinda deal anymore lol\n\nMy emergency meds were always Ativan.  Used it during emergencies only (as in, hospital trip if I can‚Äôt stop the attack).  \n\nI‚Äôve luckily haven‚Äôt needed to use my ‚Äúepipen‚Äù in years, but my other go to is running my hands under cold water.  If i catch it early enough it can stop an attack within minutes or at the very least end it sooner!  Holding a cold water bottle also works well for me :)\n\nWeed, specifically Purple Punch strain it‚Äôs the only thing that calms me down in the middle of a panic attack.\n\nEdit: and a weighted blanket\n\nIn the state of extreme emergency where the panic attack is already here, I dunk my head in very cold water. Otherwise, if I'm not able to do that at the moment, just look around and identify the objects around me in the room I'm in to ground myself in reality. In my downtime I practice mindfulness because to me it's the most powerful tool.\n\nEmergencies - 5 mg Valium\n\n2 mg Valium - when I‚Äôm waking up feeling vulnerable and know I‚Äôm on edge. \n\nMeditation and talking myself down before I end up having a full blown attack.\n\n20mg Hydroxyzine + TV. Occasionally an Ativan if it‚Äôs an intense anxiety attack\n\nValium valium\n\nXanax. But I haven‚Äôt took it in a long time. I might refill my script, but probably not\n\nBetter to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. Id go for the refill.\n\nKlonopin, a nap, Abbott Elementary, or an endless string of TikTok‚Äôs\n\nXanax, meditation\n\nI always carry some clonazepam with me.  I will take some clonazepam  (0.5 mg-1 mg.) if I think that my day will be stressful.  When I get home, I  heat up some chicken noodle soup.  I crawl into bed and watch some familiar television show (like Law and Order) or a movie (maybe Jaws or To Die For).  I might take some more clonazepam as well.  Sometimes I will also go on Reddit when I‚Äôm in bed to distract myself from my feelings of anxiety.  When I calm down, I just shut my eyes and listen to the program until I fall asleep.\n\nClonazepam and or Tetris. Or just dealing with it because it‚Äôs been a part of me so long I often forget I don‚Äôt have to feel anxious and things can be done about it.\n\nValium\n\nLorazepam ‚ú®\n\nXanax - right as rain in 30 minutes\n\nPop a Xanny\n\nXanax\n\nTake a benzo and practice my breathing thing I do.\n\nI don't know if any of these things that work well for me will work for anyone else, but I'll list them just in case:\n\nThis one is simple but I find it very helpful. Rather than thinking in terms such as \"I am anxious\" or \"I feel anxious\" or \"I have anxiety\", when it occurs I say \"There is anxiety present\". I acknowledge that it is there but I do not IDENTIFY with it. I see it as something external, make space for it to be there and then just move on without engaging with it further. It's sort of a Buddhist-adjacent \"no self\" sort of thing. Works really well for me. A variation of this that I use is to take the perspective that the persistent, troubling, anxiety-inducing thoughts are not actually mine. I picture them as a narrative coming out of a radio in the room and I go about my business while more or less tuning them out the way I might with any other background noise. Become the observer of the thoughts and stop identifying as the thinker. I think the basic mechanism for both of these methods is that the cerebral cortex overrides the limbic system and reduces or stops the production of cortisol and adrenaline.\n\nTriggering the mammalian dive reflex. I first heard of this on an anxiety-related podcast and it works very well for me. Some people fill a bowl with ice water, hold their breath and then submerge their face in the water. Hold your breath for as long as you comfortably can, then lift your face up, exhale and then take a deep breath, hold it and repeat. I use a similar but easier method that works for me, I have a gel face mask that I keep in my freezer. While standing upright, I take a deep breath, then place the cold mask over my face and lean forward rapidly as though I'm diving into water instead of using the water-bowl method. Quick, easy, less prep and no cleanup. There's lots of stuff available online about the physiology involved in this and I suggest reading up on it from multiple sources. Here's the basic Wikipedia entry about it:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving\\_reflex#:\\~:text=The%20most%20noticeable%20effects%20are,in%20humans%2C%20heart%20rhythm%20irregularities.\n\nSince this isn't always a readily available remedy in the wild, I will sometimes substitute just the breathing part. I'll draw in a deep breath through my nose, hold it for a while, then exhale and repeat. It doesn't tend to work quite as intensely but it's still very helpful.\n\nRecently, I have been drinking a lot of homemade seltzer and I always thoroughly squeeze a couple of lemon wedges into it and let the rinds float in the drink. I find that the limonene in it has a nice way of evening things out and preventing anxiety. Limonene is available from other sources as well, but this one is delicious and refreshing into the bargain.\n\nWhen worry is inducing anxiety (I tend to catastrophize, \"What if this happens? What if that happens? Oh! NOOOOO!) I can usually derail that thought spiral by repeatedly asking myself \"What if nothing is wrong?\". It tends to take the wind out of the sails of the anxious, worried thinking spiral.\n\nI recently started taking fish oil capsules daily. I think the omega 3 fatty acids help stabilize my brain chemistry to a degree.\n\nI want to acknowledge that I understand there are people here that are dealing with anxiety that is much more severe than mine. I do not mean to trivialize their suffering with these relatively simple, holistic approaches. I'm just putting them out here because they work for me and some or all of them may be helpful to some degree to others. More arrows in the quiver. If they help anyone, even in a small way, then the time spent writing this was worthwhile.\n\nanything ending in zolam\n\nGrabbing my cat and cuddling her, she has such a loud purr and it helps calm me. Since she‚Äôs not readily available everywhere I go, I blast rain sounds into my headphones\n\nVistaril/Hydroxyzine as a PRN. The only downside of my hydroxyzine is that it's essentially super-benadryl and I always conk out for a very long nap. But hey, it works.\n\nBut I used to carry vanilla tea bags in my backpack at all times when I was homeless. If I ever needed a pause, I'd find someplace to grab some hot water, make myself some vanilla tea and take a moment to ease my nerves and remind myself of what's important. The smell of the tea and making myself focus on the warmth of the cup in my hands REALLY helped.\n\nI'm no longer homeless, thankfully. But I still use the tea trick to this day if I'm feeling like my head is all over the place. Focus on the smell and the warmth in my hands, and nothing else. Cinnamon chai has been my favorite these days üíï\n\nIMO this is a little weird, but I'll shake a body part or rock back and forth so I focus on that action rather than the bad thoughts. It also helps when your heart is racing so I don't feel the strong beating sensation.\n\nAtivan\n\nRead a book. Drink some water. Have some food.\n\nAlcohol and xanax\n\nGrab a sour (warhead) or spicy (hot tamale)¬† candy. It helps rehijack your brain so you can get focused enough to breath and think logically.¬†\n\n1) Grab a bottle of hand sanitizer. There is nearly always one in my purse for this reason.\n\n2) Squeeze a little too much hand sanitizer into my palm. Is it cold? Notice that.\n\n3) Let it sit in my palm until it starts to melt from a gel to a liquid. Notice how that feels.\n\n4) Begin to SLOWLY rub the hand sanitizer in, paying attention to the feeling of passing my fingers over the lines and creases in my palm.\n\n5) When it starts getting drippy and messy and annoying, go ahead and quickly rub the rest in the usual way.\n\n6) Finally, take a BIG whiff of that nasty combo of alcohol and green apple/vanilla/whatever scent I have on hand. This is really bracing and delivers a sensory shock to the system that grounds me and brings me out of my head and back into the present. \n\nI like this one because I can typically do it in public without attracting any unwanted attention to myself, and it doesn't require me to do a lot of mental work when I'm least equipped to do so.\n\nAlternatively: Hold an ice cube in the palm of my hand, the crook of my neck, or (if it's really bad) my armpit, until the cold becomes *almost* painful. The effect is similar to the hand sanitizer trick."

    "title": "Finally gained control of my anxiety (mental and social) at 26. This is what helped me. ",
    "body": "After many years of off and on anxiety (Diagnosed with GAD and SAD at 20)  and some very dark times recently, I‚Äôve finally been able to feel peace and a sense of control over my mind. \n\nI am fortunate enough to have found an outstanding therapist that was very experienced in dealing with anxiety and things in general. I have also been on Lexapro (10mg)  and Cymbalta (60mg) as needed. \n\nSo what clicked for me to finally stand up to and let go of those catastrophic, ruminating, overthinking, obsessive, and scary thought patterns? \n\nTwo big things. The first is examining my beliefs about worry. \nAnd this is the truth that I had to realize: Worrying is the problem, not the solution. \n\n(The solution in most cases is action or planning) \n\nYou may hold positive (or negative) beliefs about worrying that perpetuate it. Such as it‚Äôs ability to protect you from bad things happening or that it‚Äôs your responsibility. Or that it‚Äôs the only way to ensure you don‚Äôt overlook something. ‚ÄúOnce you realize that worrying is the problem, not the solution, you can regain control of your worried mind.‚Äù \n\n\nThe second thing that I knew in my bones but didn‚Äôt want to admit is that my Self Confidence was piss poor. \n\nI was hesitant, timid, always seeking reassurance and second opinions, because I did not trust myself. Trust and confidence are great weapons against anxiety. If you doubt yourself and your abilities, you will be at the mercy of the uncertainty of the world. If you do not think you can ‚Äúhandle it‚Äù, there will be danger and pitfalls all around you. (Spoiler alert: You are stronger and more capable than you think). \n\nBy practicing acting confidently and affirming to myself that I could survive even the bleakest outcomes, the catastrophic thinking subsided, as well as the overthinking. \n\nI hope this helps at least a few of you. \n\nTL;DR : Examined beliefs about worry, realized it doesn‚Äôt actually do anything but make you sick. Recognized low self Confidence and what I needed to do to feel more secure and capable. ",

    "all_comment_text": "Thank you for this post, it gave me hope and motivation\n\nü§úüèª\n\nYes! Me and my therapist reached the same hypothesis. Much of my anxiety is caused by overthinking and avoidance of uncomfortable or difficult situations as a coping mechanism.¬†\n\n\nFacing those challenges gave me enough confidence to don't have to worry about those specific problems again.\n\n\nGlad you found out a similar solution to your problems!\n\nThis post is very helpful. I just wanted to add that including some form of exercise into my daily routine has worked great for my confidence. Even if it‚Äôs just a 30 minute walk daily or every other day, I feel more alert and it never hurts anyone to drop a few pounds and get your blood flowing. I was also told by a therapist at one point that even mild exercise helps my medications function better.\n\nThe past month I‚Äôve felt crippled by anxiety and how everything was going to be taken away from me, and how I was going to lose it all. This morning I feel like something can change thank you so much for sharing your story.\n\nThis is me. Thanks for the pep talk! I needed that today.\n\nAfter 8+ yrs of seeing psychologists, with no meds, my most recent Dr. said something like this that was so profound to me and will always stay in my mind as motivation. \nAfter digging deep, we discussed that my anxiety is rooted in me always needing to have a plan to adapt in the worst case scenario. So she responded with:\n\n**\"anxiety, worrying, and panic planning are not ways to achieve true adaptability to difficult circumstances. The confidence you have in yourself that you can survive and navigate any circumstance that comes along is what brings true adaptability\"**\n\nFrom then on, I started to really focus on building my self confidence. Positive affirmation meditation/mindfulness has been a game changer and always makes me feel great after.\n\nVery nice. Congrats!\n\nCan you give more examples on how to pragmatically work on the confidence issue?\n\nYes to all of this!! Could not agree more! These are basically the themes my therapist and I have been working on over the past six months. The ability to trust yourself and know that whatever comes your way in the future you'll be able to handle diminishes anxiety!! Because for me at least my anxiety is very much based around future what if scenarios of terrible things happening TO ME and my not being prepared enough to handle it. So I thought the worrying was helpful in that I could plan and prepare for whatever came my way. The sad reality is no one can predict the future or plan for everything and in all likelihood you will just end up wasting your time and life preparing for things that may never come. I also got on Zoloft when I began seeing this therapist which has made all the difference! This is the first time I've ever taken medication for my anxiety and I'm overjoyed at the results of it! Been seeing various therapists my whole life for basically decades but I finally feel like I've gotten a handle on it. Congrats to you for getting a handle on yours too!\n\nThank you so much!  This helps!\n\nYasssss!!!\n\nIt is great to see a post like this gave me some hope and motivation, because I am working in a similar direction to overcome anxiety. Thanks for sharing mate\n\nThank you so much for sharing your experience and insight you've gotten from your journey! It's really helpful to hear what you've learned as someone that's still on the journey to dismantle the worry.\n\nI am so happy for you. However, please be careful with Cymbalta. I had a VERY difficult time getting off of that one.\n\nThis post saved me right now. Reading it with tears in my eyes, a smile, and feeling an immense relief. Thank you endlessly for this. I'm saving this (only if that's ok for you of course) and make sure to look at it everyday. I'm so happy for you, too!¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†\n\n\nSeriously, I can't put into words what your post did for me. I'm usually dealing quite well with my anxiety but something (actually 'minor' but a big disruption for me) happened that made me worry nonstop, seeking constant reassurance, etc and I'm tired and exhausted of worrying to the point I'm actually having a headache from all the tense neck and shoulder muscles.¬† ¬†¬†\n\n\nI have to wait until Wednesday for my next therapy session (had to be delayed because of a cold) and didn't know how to get through the weekend. THIS makes everything so much better. Thank you!!¬† ¬† ¬†\n\n\nYou're my hero of the week!! All the very best for you!¬† ü•π ü´∂\n\nSo glad to hear, Thank you so much. You got this!\n\nhow long did it take you?\n\nThis is definitely helpful. I want to avoid meds if possible so I'm really focused on changing my ways of thinking!\n\nI'm 26 right now and starting to have some of these realizations, but not as concretely as you've laid out here.\n\n*Worrying is the problem, not the solution*.\n\nI spend so much time worrying because I feel like if I don't, then I am a person who is ignorant to my flaws and shortcomings, and that without worrying I will have no way to become a better person.\n\nI see things I don't like in other people and think it is because they are not self aware enough to correct it. So, to me, I HAVE to be painfully self conscious because if I am not, then I'm allowing myself to be bad.\n\nBut the worrying is what is really killing me, taking hold of my entire being and keeping me from living any life at all. I simply cannot spend every second examining myself for what I might be doing wrong without also slowly killing everything about myself in the process.\n\nHow do I stop worrying every second of every day?\n\nIm going to. Start taking meds, what has been you experience?¬†\n\nIt was great. I was on Effexor. At first it wasn't doing anything for three months, raising the dose after each month. And after the last raise it felt as if 80% of my anxiety was suddenly gone overnight. It felt like a miracle. From there the rest of anxiety slowly stopped until I reached a point where I noticed I haven't had anxiety at all for some time.\n\n[removed]\n\nDo not suggest or offer to move discussion to another venue or DM. This includes but is not limited to: other applications, other social groups, and vlogs/blogs.\n\nThis is the official discord for r/anxiety: [Invite link](https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9). \n\nIf you are looking to chat or setup a chat, we highly encourage you to checkout the sub‚Äôs discord.\n\nThank you¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs giving baby girl. Go to the gym, stop playing video games, learn how to be a leader instead of some anxiety induced freak\n\nI‚Äôm 99% sure you have the same personality as the person I rejected\n\nAlso based on the texts, she rejected you\n\nA woman attracted to a masculine man?\n\nNo, a dumb c*nt"

I have almost the same coping mechanisms. Especially it hit me when you said ‚Äúdaydreaming while pacing around listening to music‚ÄùüòÇ\n\nVideo games and reading. I like escapism.\n\nI get even more anxious when playing competitive game for some reason\n\nI guess you gotta go to the single-player or sandboxy ones. Competitive is the fastest way to lose your temper.\n\nI have been a competitive gamer since I found out about internet and I was good at it. Sometime somewhere my anxiety triggered and its been 2 years of struggle to leave multiplayer games... Ill find a way around it one day\n\nI really recommend single player games. when (I) get lost into a story, my mind floats away and indulges into the story, the action, etc. I stopped playing MP a long time ago. it helps my anxiety so much (although i never gotten anxiety over MP) however playing online doesn‚Äôt help lol\n\nThis is why Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing are my anxiety gotos. I have hundreds of hours in both\n\nFr Stardew doesn‚Äôt allow me to think about anything other than my in-game relationship and crops lmao\n\nIt‚Äôs why I always avoid competitive game modes in the multiplayer games I play. It‚Äôs too much stress.\n\nI can no longer focus on video games when I have bad anxiety.\n\nSame here. My PC sits, off and unplugged and covered (dust) far more than it is on these days. Since I only really use it for gaming. I just can't bring myself to play anything. I'm get anxious about having a heart attack for example while playing and then that's my $2,200 system sitting there on with no one to shut it down and unplug it. Seems silly to worry about, I know. That's just one aspect of it though.¬†\n\n\nI hate how my anxiety has robbed me of my favorite hobby.¬†\n\nI can barely focus my combos in chivarly 2 its as if I forgot all the combos and feints\n\ni do too but its a different kind if anxious you know ???? lol\n\nOmg when i learned to read an actual book ...i never stopped.

Weed makes me anymore anxious most of the time and Instagram makes me depressed and envious üò©\n\nWeed is a game changer except its illegal and hard to get by in my case\n\nFair play\n\nRdr2 is a real good game. Story is amazing. Even though they abandoned online I'll still.hop on just of how peaceful it is gping round the map collecting and hunting etc.\n\nI need to get around to playing it. In games stuff like fishing is pretty nice :)\n\nYes its a really chilled out game online. Story is amazing.\n\nI will 100% play it in the foreseeable future. No doubt about it.\n\n!!!\n\nCleaning/organizing. I pick a room, put on What We Do in the Shadows, and do an episode per room. I get so much done this way, without doing too many cleaning/purging projects at once. \n\nSorry to hear about the breakup - sending good vibes that you get to the other side of the rainbow soon!\n\ni‚Äôve never thought to do it by room before!!! love this\n\nThat‚Äôs a great idea, not just because What We Do in the Shadows is awesome.\n\nCan you give me this power please!?! Executive disfunction is always never not a thing.\n\nI adore this idea! It‚Äôs keeping busy and feeling useful but for a finite time w each ep and funny as heck!! Thank you for the idea\n\nThis is great if you have a TV in every room\n\nI just use Hulu on my phone ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nSpending every waking hour on my phone\n\nWheeeew this is so meeeeüòÆ‚Äçüí®\n\nSame üò≠\n\nFor me chewing minty gum takes my mind off things.\n\nyup i am the polo guy to all my friends\n\nI do cough drops!\n\nI go on a run before sunrise or before sunset so I can catch them just right on time. Seeing them helps ease the anxiety i'm feeling and also helps me recalibrate better. Before I make hasty decisions on days I'm highly anxious, I go for a run first then compare how I feel after.\n\nKeeping my body healthy; eating well, getting the right amount of sleep, drinking enough water, regular exercise. Keeping up with work because if I slack off due to one type of anxiety I know I'm just making a different kind for myself tomorrow. Taking a walk at least once a day; even if it's just a quick one it's better than nothing. Magnesium spray; I can't take supplements as they trigger my IBS but I spray a magnesium oil twice a day- inside of wrists, chest, back of shoulders in the morning, tops of feet and back of legs at night. Chamomile tea. Finally- having something to look forward to, even if it's something small, as long as it's something I can be a bit excited about.\n\nI started journaling. I‚Äôve had anxiety since I got out of the army in 08. I‚Äôve been on meds since 2010. They‚Äôve helped but about 2 years ago they stopped doing anything. I‚Äôd have crippling anxiety every morning, to the point of throwing up some mornings. It took a solid year of meditation, positive thinking/no negative self talk (that was hard and took six months of diligent practice and being self aware when I‚Äôm doing it) and journaling. I took to journaling because I was having a hard time pinpointing what was making me anxious. That took 6-12 months but slowly I‚Äôve started narrowing down what makes me anxious and then I work on that individual issue. \n\nI went from thinking suicide would be the only thing that would stop it in 2022 with anxiety at a literal 10, to on my worse days it‚Äôs a 6 and I can push it down from there. Also a daily cold shower for 6 minutes, good European study on cold water and anxiety. Google it!\n\nI‚Äôm in the army right now and I have horrible anxiety and stress which manifests as health anxiety\n\nGet that shit documented, as much as possible. So when you‚Äôre out it can be service connected and the va will help.\n\nhow exactly do you journal? do you write down your thoughts when anxious or do you do it at the end of each day and recap everything that happened?\n\nBoth. I write a sentences or two every morning and ended it with a guess each day(as to why I woke up anxious, am I anxious about this? About this? Or about this? I Did my work day until lunch with that thought/s and at lunch added another few sentences, usually acknowledging that those things I was anxious about didn‚Äôt happen. Then end of day as few more sentences about the day and how tomorrow CAN be a good day too. I read a study that saying can instead or will be or is going to be had a more positive effect on people‚Äôs day, I guess saying you CAN work hard or CAN have a good day puts it more into your hands and control.\n\nThank you for your service\n\nPracticing being grateful for everything around you. Thank God or who ever for this morning, for the warm shower, for food, for my dogs etc. at first it will seem forced but eventually it becomes natural and I seem to always be happy. When someone pisses me off or does something to me say in traffic, I wish them a blessed day. Im not sure why but its almost like everything becomes positive and I realize we are always in control of how we chose to see things\n\nGym, more gym, bit more gym.\n\nI second and third this.  Punching bag too.\n\nHousehold stuff, cleaning, organizing. Makes me feel better when I can 'fix' stuff around the apartment.\n\nGet outside and go for walks, tends to help calm me down.\n\nreading / puzzles / music production / generally things that occupy the mind.\n\nExercise. For some reason, I also choose learning a new language after a breakup to distract myself. It's the only reason I know German and Japanese lol\n\nBeing active and repeating some inspiration quotes in my head.\n\nWhat are some of the quotes or do you have a link? I‚Äôm also going thru a breakup.\n\nDancing as hard and wildly as I can. Whitney Houston‚Äôs Whitney album does it for me, with breaks for yoga during the slow jams. But I do it through the whole album, and repeat if I can, until I‚Äôm completely worn out. Dua Lipa also works lately\n\nThe best thing during a panic attack is to remind myself that I'm being triggered by something and this terror is not because of a real threat like my brain thinks. I tell myself, \"You are having a trauma response. This is not real. This is a trauma response. This is not real.\"\n\nI think i need to re-understand what coping skills r.\n\nPlaying a video game with a great story, cardio session after working out, avoiding doom scolling, if i feel extra anxious n cant control it i go to bar and drink\n\nI smoke a cigar and watch Battlefield (it‚Äôs on YouTube). I love learning about WWII battles and this helps. The cigar helps me focus on breathing.\n\nI just keep super busy. My x fd me up really bad. Would take breaks to cheat on me. Even more fd up is we lived together. I was friends with her family, they treated me like family and agreed she was messed up. Anyways. Busy busy. Always doing something. I'm fixing my mom's neglected suv. Repainting my bathrooms. Sanding kitchen floor. I cycle between so I don't get burnt out. Also like mowing the lawn with loud music. Smell of fresh cut grass. Admiring the work I've done.\n\nThe best natural, non-pharmaceutical coping mechanism for me is working out, especially running.\n\nBreathe\n\nWhat helps me most is EFT tapping (you can find many EFT tapping videos on youtube explaining how to do it but you basically tap on acupressure points and say whats bothering you out loud or in your head and it processes the emotion and trauma and flushes it out the body)\n\nWalking, reading (I like to play forest/nature sounds on the telly as well), playing online games and adult colouring books üòÄ. It will get easier in time I promise.\n\nMusic- it instantly changes my vibration and gets my mind off of worry\n\nGonna sound dark but recently I ask myself ‚Äúyou could have one day left on earth alive. What do you want to do today?‚Äù \n\nI also like listening to sound baths on tik tok or YouTube for anxiety and to help me fall asleep.\n\nPuzzle games\n\nWalking and listening to music; going to a beach or a lake.\n\nsitcoms forever and always. i love watching comedy when i feel anxious. it makes everything feel more lighthearted.\n\nComfort tv‚Ä¶I put on Seinfeld or What we do in the shadows. Or a fascinating documentary.\n\nListening to music \n\nA hot bath \n\nGoing for a massage \n\nNew cozy and nice pajamas, socks, underwear \n\nSpending time outside \n\nChecking out new coffee shops around town \n\nUtilizing DBT skills (can be found online)\n\nHelping others \n\nEating a clean and healthy diet \n\nClean bedding\n\nAvoid having clutter in your home/car\n\nAromatherapy / incense \n\nRelaxing spa / New Age music \n\nGetting lost in a book \n\nHaving a pet to focus on\n\nMeditation. Quality tea. Journal what I love about life and myself.\n\nMindfulness and meditation. Change your perception about her. Forgive her if need be and truthfully let go. The world is nothing but abundance. There‚Äôs a ton of significant others out there\n\nHmm. Exercise could be good. Not necessarily hardcore exercise. But like how about going for a decent walk, with your earphones in listening to a decent podcast/radio/music, whatever you prefer. \nThat way you‚Äôre distracted by what you‚Äôre listening to and you‚Äôre also moving which helps with anxiety. Like how people pace when they‚Äôre anxious, they do this because it actually helps get the nervous energy out I think. \n\nSo yeah try to tire yourself out a bit with some walking. Other than that. Maybe watching tv, a good series that will get you hooked and not thinking about the outside world. \n\nOr maybe a good comedy series that you‚Äôve watched a million times before but always make you laugh. Stuff that you‚Äôre familiar with can feel comforting.\n\nJournalling and writing down my anxious thoughts. Repeating phrase to comfort myself\n\nI‚Äôve had a tough day with anxiety, had a couple panic attacks last night and today too. I also have FND so I get tics when anxious. I just went for a cold water swim and I am feeling a lot better. It helps so much.\n\nListening to music\n\nJournaling to let those racing thoughts flow scape somewhere. Doesnt even have to be an official journal, just some paper.\n\nVideogames for escapism. It gives your mind a full objective to focus on\n\nGoing on walks. Keep your body moving and get some sunlight. Your neighborhood can be good for just getting active. If you can escape to a trail or a park and get some greenery, that goes a long way as well\n\nI'm very physically active and a bit of an adrenaline junkie. I do combat sports such as boxing and Muay Thai. Sparring and training in martial arts helps me with my anxiety and forces me to ground myself in the moment and focus.\n\nGym\n\nRunning! Literally run every morning and feel so much better\n\nWatching videos and movies I‚Äôve already seen\n\nRecently picked up bouldering and it made me feel so good. But I wonder if that might be another form of escapism lol\n\nJogging/running. I hate that I‚Äôm admitting this but my husband pointed out that my anxiety and mood are directly related to my movement. I argued this for years and now that I‚Äôm 6 months back into a regular routine of walking/jogging/running at least 3 times a week I feel completely different. I think i manage to self talk myself through more while I‚Äôm off in lalaland running or something? And I‚Äôm not talking crazy miles. 30 min at most each time.  Hate that he was right lol\n\nDrugs. I am sorry, but I'd rather be honest.\n\nExercise, especially if very hard\n\nThis will sound weird. It‚Äôs something I tried recently and it‚Äôs a good distraction. Try singing along to your favorite songs with the music playing aloud. When I tried it to calm my anxiety, i think it helped just a little bit. Also remembering that what I was anxious about in the moment won‚Äôt last forever. You got this. Hopefully this helps you\n\nAlso, asking yourself stupid, silly questions like where your left foot is at, etc, etc. it will ground you\n\nCooking, giving myself time to be by myself, self care and also a sweet treat every once in a while.\n\nListening to music, do art, or go horseback riding. Or spend time with my significant other.\n\nOkay so the thing I do when someone I love and can‚Äôt get over breaks up with me? I focus on what are the positives about this situation. You NEED to write this list. Here are some examples. This is only half serious maybe it makes you laugh a little? \n\n1. I never liked their family, so I‚Äôm glad I never have to see them again\n2. They snored\n3. They weren‚Äôt very good in bed\n4. They didn‚Äôt give me thoughtful birthday presents \n5. They weren‚Äôt good with their money\n6. They were selfish \n7. They weren‚Äôt a good cook\n8. I didn‚Äôt like their friends \n9. They didn‚Äôt like the same tv shows\n10. I felt alone around them\n\nCrying. And listen to commentary videos on YouTube. Cleaning also helps.\n\nLet yourself cry (it relieves a lot of stress out of your body) stay busy, but not too busy. Read interesting Reddit stories (I like the creepy stuff), work on yourself like work out, go on walks, or jogs, and eat healthy. Healthy eating is good for the brain. Be around friends and family, having a support system definitely helps the grieving process of the break up. Listen to happy music. Mindful thinking (think of happy times, and beautiful places) &amp; love yourself! Say things to yourself like ‚Äútoday is gonna be a great day, I‚Äôm gonna love this amazing day‚Äù. It‚Äôs odd, but it helps subconsciously.\n\nHi, I‚Äôm also going through a breakup right now, it‚Äôs really hard but I‚Äôm coping by escaping in music, taking long drives when most people are still asleep, smoking, caring for my animals, daydreaming, reinventing myself (new piercings, hairstyles, changing my comforter to a new one), and cleaning.\n\nThe best way to cope with a breakup for me is to block or mute them on social media, otherwise they will show up on your feed.\n\nthe best coping for my anxiety is meditation and yoga.\n\nPhysical activity. Find a book to lose yourself in.\n\nWhen I‚Äôm really in panic mode, spiraling, One of my favorites is in that moment thinking of:\n5 things you can see\n4 things you can hear \n3 things you can feel\n2 things you can smell\n1 thing you can taste\n\nJust talking (distraction) or, yall will probably judge me on this, chewing bottle caps. Idk what it is, I guess a textural thing? Usually only do it during a lot of stress or panic\n\nBe really scared and contemplate my untimely demise. I‚Äôm very consistent in my use too.\n\nCrotcheting has changed my life\n\nPlaying video games and talking to my friends and family :)\n\nReminding myself that ‚Äúthis too shall pass‚Äù, cry it out, spending time in nature and trying to keep myself busy. But i think what helps me most is spending time with my friends, talking about how i feel and tell them i need their love and support. Making a list of all the good things about myself. Brain dumping in a notebook. And going to therapy. It‚Äôs hard but it will pass. Just don‚Äôt stay alone. Try to process the pain with support. Don‚Äôt break the no contact rule. And cry a lot until you get it out. I am going through hell at the moment. Free floating anxiety, feeling like strangled and my heart is being ripped but this too shall pass.\n\nThe Sims. Any simulation game lol. Weed. Therapy. Walking.\n\nUsed to be drugs, now it‚Äôs going for a walk and listening to music\n\nReading, walking, I follow growithJo dancing workout videos sometimes (you‚Äôre gonna feel silly at first, but I‚Äôm always in a better mood afterwards), watch relaxing movies/shows, I make playlists on my Spotify just to keep my mind busy sometimes too\n\nOh and color by number games on my phone/ipad\n\nI‚Äôm trying to be kinder to myself.\n\nColoring/doing art of some kind. Also weed.\n\nPacing around listening to music, diamond painting/ digital coloring by number on my kindle, journaling, watching nostalgic tv shows.\n\nI have a rubber snake, or many of them. As long as it‚Äôs in my hand I can feel like I‚Äôm in control, without it my anxiety often gets really bad and I feel exposed\n\nI play genshin impact, shit helps when things get overwhelming. I journal when I have the capacity to. Due to recent horrific experiences I've become sort of poetic so I just write down lines that come to mind.\n\nCry. Gather ideas for future art. Try to distract myself with productivity or cleaning up my room so the clutter reduces. Think of ideas to better my life n make it into achievable bite sized goals. Take a walk. Eat nice food. Give up for the day and just say 'ill try again tmrw'\n\nBreathwork and meditation 100%\n\nDistraction- anything that makes me have to concentrate helps- sudoku, random text books, duo lingo etc\n\nDon‚Äôt check their social media. Delete your apps for a month if you have to\n\nHot shower or cold works too, skateboarding, going for a walk. Everything seems hard to do with anxiety I know but you gotta keep your mind occupied.\n\nWatching/reading simple stuff. Easy on the mind. Cheesy movies, romance or poorly written smut books (i remember reading a shrek smut book?? Idk what was i thinking lmao but was fun), cartoons, maybe vlogs on youtube. They distract you from thinking and you don‚Äôt need to think or analyze them. That‚Äôs especially true for cartoons. Everything goes well, everyone‚Äôs always happy, no bad thoughts, no bad people. Just love, fun and friendships.\n\nReading fiction really helps me to calm my mind and redirect my focus.\n\nWorking out (weight lifting / peloton / walks), meditation, mindfulness (like meditation but in everyday life), video games, weed, and just in general - find something to keep your mind occupied. I‚Äôm on the spectrum and if I have a special interest take hold I‚Äôve found I pretty much never ruminate on things I shouldn‚Äôt be.\n\nVideo games &amp; canvas painting.\n\nJust pushing through the awkwardness\n\nDeep breathing techniques. Watching comedic stuff (try not to laugh meme compilations or stand up for example). Escapism I'm general. Watching cartoons on my phone. Eating/drinking something cold. Also anything tart or salty helps for whatever reason. Blasting my white noise/nature sounds.\n\nAudiobooks or sitcoms just casually playing in the background all the time to address floating anxiety. \n\nAlso, when I‚Äôm feeling discombobulated or ungrounded I make lists out of the things on my mind. I organize the information that‚Äôs whizzing around. \n\nIf I‚Äôm hung up on an emotional response i had that i‚Äôm embarrassed about, i deflect the thoughts by keeping busy.\n\nI just go to sleep\n\nExercise. Getting a good nights sleep. Eat nutritious foods most of the time. If I think I‚Äôll have trouble sleeping drink sleepy tea or take melatonin, and do relaxing things before bed. \n\nIf you feel you get anxious with certain patterns/seasons etc. it‚Äôs worth writing down/tracking. I am able to get a head start on some coping strategies when I know triggers are coming. I also like to think out my week and write a list of upcoming things, and small goals for the week. This helps me plan out my time which leaves for less surprises.\n\nCranking my hog\n\nVideo games, keeping my mind busy. Talking with friends on discord also really helps. Positive talk to myself relating to others.\n\nDoing anything I enjoy and getting thru an hour at a time,  5 min at a time,  a day at a time. Whatever it is,  I take it. \n\nI'm old enough to know that I will get thru the cloud into into the sunlight... if I just wait it out. So these days I have infinitely more ability to just wait it out.\n\nWhen it hurts,  I acknowledge it.  \n\nWhen it's my mistake,  I own it.  And forgive myself. \n\nWhen it's their mistake,  I forgive them. I don't want their baggage.\n\nThe completely unconditional love of a pet. But if you get one,  choose thinking forward to how they are going fit into your future life, not just your current moping on the couch in pajamas hugging your cat or dog life (if that's where you are at). They have feelings too and are a lifetime (theirs) commitment. \n\nEat healthy... and allow yourself your favorite junk food.\n\nDress up when you go to the store.  Stay in your pajamas all day. \n\nDo whatever helps you pass thru the cloud ‚õÖ.  Good luck my friend!!\n\nPaint by number is my favorite since I'm not good at drawing/painting on my own.\n\nYoga, meditation, mindfulness and breathing. My anxiety is generally lower when I take better care of my body.\n\nWatch my comfort shows from my bed with a cup of hot chocolate with whipped cream.  Or else, watch a very intense movie that requires my complete attention e.g. Uncut Gems\n\nRage, like if i feel like im going to have a heart attack or something i just face it like cmon mother fucker get me then or the anxiety i just face it\n\nLet it go! Simple as that...\n\nElder Scrolls\n\nI'm going through the exact same thing. Honesty, trying to take care of myself, one step at the time. I write letters that I will never send, and it helps to manage my feelings. Talking to someone when feelings get overwhelming is also a good way to let the worst thoughts out of your mind. If you need to vent, I'm here OP, sometimes it is good to talk to someone anonymous. \n\nwishing you the best luck\n\nTaking a shower, putting on a face mask, going thrifting, planning potential trips, listening to music while I color..\nI suggest making a list and just adding to it as you find things you enjoy doing. It‚Äôs been helpful to me.\n\nI conquered anxiety when I learned to tell myself to shut the fuck up as soon as any symptoms came on and now if I even get the slightest bit of anxiety, i don‚Äôt even have to tell myself anymore it just shuts it down immediately. It is literally all a mind game. Conquer that and you‚Äôre golden. Also go for a walk.\n\nI push on walls when I‚Äôm really frustrated\n\nBreathing. Exercise. Games. Comics. Books. Jujitsu.\n\nMOVE YOUR BODY. not necessarily exercise, shake your hands walk move. In any way move. I like to shake my arms as if I‚Äôm shaking off the anxiety. It weirdly helps\n\nive found that writing forces me to put feelings into words which makes my mind slow down\n\nWalking in nature, hiking if I have easy access, pilates, cardio workouts, watching sitcoms or binge watching, sometimes skincare masks if im up for it and self help books.\n\nI watch instagram reels about animals, especially monkeys and parrots. End up laughing. They just make me feel good and take my mind off other things.\n\nKnitting while listening to audio books. But if I‚Äôm really freaking out/dysregulated then a cold shower or face in an ice water bath. It sounds crazy but it activates your mammalian  dive reflex and really helps me physically calm down.\n\nFocusing on the ‚Äúwave‚Äù between inhale and exhale instead of the latter. Usually focusing on my breathing would freak me out more but not* when I focus on the in between\n\nTIPP DBT skill for emotional dysregulation and anxiety. I use a flat gel ice pack on my eyes, hold head down &amp; hold breath for 15-30 seconds.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UuvH_j9O0f4?si=wWmRlVm-Ddn6Vtih\n\nTelevision, star gazing and petting my dog\n\nI like to go to a cafe and just read. Sometimes, I am not able to concentrate so I just put on some music and pretend to read.\n\nIt's been quite a while I enjoyed playing any video game, but i found a game which doesn't require much of your focus to play it, it's not a story based so i can just put on some music and start  playing it with a youtube video running on the side.\n\nSometimes going out on a short drive helps me clear my head.\n\nPutting on comedies while I fell asleep helped me through my last breakup. Gave me something to focus on while falling asleep instead of just my thoughts. Getting outside for a walk every day, even just for a few minutes. Taking on a new hobby or spending more time on a hobby you already like. Journaling. I gave myself specific times during the day where I could think about my relationship and process. When that time was up for the day, no more thinking about it. It helped me sort through my feelings and organize my thoughts about it.\n\nGoing for a run\n\nGetting busy with a chore or activity such as cleaning, organizing, or playing a video game. Or if I'm nervous about something in particular, trying to prepare for whatever I'm nervous for.\n\nNapping\n\nHealthy distraction.\n\nHonestly, the best coping skill is sitting in it and letting the discomfort wash over you. Recognising that feeling and dealing with it is the most powerful tool there is. \n\nAlso, reality checks are super helpful too. Breakups are hard, but you‚Äôre going to be absolutely fine and you know it.\n\n-'Drawing! I use a collaborative app called DrawnTogether (one word)\n\n- run could water over my arms for 1 minute then put my hands behind my neck \n\n- a lot of good suggestions on the finch app which is adorable and free including grounding exercises. Tap on the lighting bolt in the top right corner of your home page then tap on \"first aid\"\n\nUsually music....at the bar...after about 5 shots of whiskey\n\nGrounding works really well for me\n\nI walk. Even if the place where I‚Äôm going to is far, I walk. Walking while listening to music helps my anxiety to subside. When I broke up with my ex, I walked for 4.3km and that‚Äôs more than an hour to walk.\n\n!Remindme 12hours\n\nThis is the prominent habit that has helped me, so I have shared this here.\n\nMine is I look at clock periodically and frequently to make sure I'm aware of current time of day.\n\nBecause from listening podcasts about anxiety and ADHD symptoms, I have heard that folks with anxiety, general anxiety struggle with time perception, it means that time perception is either slowed down or fastened up depending on surrounding and scenarios.\n\nTry it and you will understand the difference. Make a habit of looking at a clock either wrist or on wall for 10 seconds and you will get the point. and do it frequently.\n\nHaving routines that I enjoy: walking to a gym zone I always go, stretching at the sun, cooking or cleaning. One of the firsts things I do when I'm anxious is cleaning my room and focus on the environment (sounds, objects, etc.) Getting out of my head.\n\nIt‚Äôs grief. You can‚Äôt avoid it, you have to go through it. You endure the feelings. Find outlets. My marriage ended after 20 years. I had my kids to look after so I had to keep it together. I used to scream and cry in the car after dropping them off from school or going to collect them. The outlet was helpful. In the beginning I didn‚Äôt want to get out of bed. I had to and it took everything I had to do it. But no one knew what an achievement that was. So I started congratulating myself for everything I did - ‚Äúwell done, I know you didn‚Äôt want to get dressed but you did and now you feel just a tiny bit better‚Äù. I did this for everything and it started lifting my mood, helped me realise where I was strong, the things that made me feel better and I started choosing things/actions that encouraged that feeling. A year or so on and I applied for and was accepted to the best university in my country for a masters degree and I‚Äôve job interviews lined up. I adore my kids and I‚Äôm so grateful I have the time with them that I do. My friendships are solid and I‚Äôve really worked on balancing things out as soon as I was a little stronger. I had no faith in myself at the beginning. It‚Äôs slowly building. It‚Äôs kind of like doing then thing then looking back and saying ‚Äúoh look, I did that, huh!‚Äù. Mood follows action has become my mantra. It‚Äôs what I was doing but hadn‚Äôt the words for it till someone else said it and it encapsulates it all. The feelings for my ex have been working themselves out naturally during all of that. It‚Äôs been really, really hard but it does get better.\n\nChecking the facts and radical acceptance (DBT skills)\n\nHonestly all DBT skills I'd suggest looking into at least once\n\nReading, writing, sleeping, playing pickleball, and working out. I also just got a self love workout that has been helping a lot lately\n\nI‚Äôve made a specific playlist. It‚Äôs quite relaxing compiling it and when I listen to it it‚Äôs like it programs my brain to relax ü§ç\n\nHonestly usually I cope and get by, but..\n\nThis one time I took LSD, ( have done it in the past tested pure to mention) and this time I was also sleep deprived. So I take it and completely lose the ability to talk or form a sentence. My mind went blank to a degree one can‚Äôt comprehend till it happens. The visuals were different I had some sort of break from reality and then out of no where anxitey came I knew this was not normal and convinced myself that I permantly lost my mind. This anxitey came out of no where. Imagine being so terrified in that moment you know and believe your delusion the fact you just went brain dead for life a fate worse then death. \n\nWas extremely terrified to a degree that I still remember. Someone took me to hospital at this time I complete forgot anything and never knew how to talk and went basicly mute and my visuals were so scary I can‚Äôt even explain it. But that whole time in my mind I knew I just lost my mind and was more scared then I ever been. After a while idk what they gave me but I finally got my thoughts back something I couldent even imagine happening. And it wore down after a bit and ever since I appreciated my mind. I still get anxiety tho but not to that degree in that state.\n\nSleeping, but it comes with some drawbacks.\n\nI think for me as well as all the cool hobbies people are listing which I share in some.. for me what really helped me was my therapist and I figured that a lot of the stuff we do for hobbies shouldn't be done \"to help me relax\". I mean it's the goal but that is not the focus.  The focus should be acknowledging that yes I'm anxious, yes I have insomnia, yes I might be a bit depressed... So I'm going to do just what I want. Essentially be miserable in comfort. Remembering that before I do any of my hobbies helps me really be present and get out of my head. Which in turn reduces my anxiety and insomnia issues.\n\nvideo games, music, reading, drawing , jacksepticeye playthrough etc. These things make me able to escape everything for a small moment\n\nRunning. Journaling. Cleaning. Sleeping.\n\nYou can try something new or get back to something you used to love doing but haven‚Äôt done lately.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry you have to go through this. Know that it will always get better.\n\nReading or writing !!\n\nReading, writing, gym and watching my fav youtubers. But i love reading i just get to escape everything.\n\nConfiding in a trusted family member or friend and just talking through my feelings always helps me.\n\nAlso learning a new hobby like picking up a new language or instrument is another one I like.\n\nGaming, music (still learning), cooking, cleaning, working out.\n\nI‚Äôm homeless, lost my career through injuries almost 20 years ago, foiling any attempt to have enough money to live on. I‚Äôve died twice, both times in medical establishments so all good, I‚Äôve been divorced once and my second wife became alcoholic through work pressures and had to leave for rehab. I wasn‚Äôt able to afford to keep the house and I‚Äôve been homeless seven years now. Three years before that my wife discovered she was asexual so no sex, but we‚Äôre still extremely close, but live in different cities. And one of my dogs just died.\nI‚Äôm fine. Not really but I‚Äôm fine I tell you\n\nMeditation üôè\n\nSleep and ignoring my worries lol\n\nSport everyday, stretching, trips, tv shows, therapy, self-confidence through fear exposure, self-reflection, weed only when calm, but overall helpful for daily anxiety, having a good sleeping schedule. In social settings focus on having fun and zero on other ppl or yourself, try thinking positive thoughts before getting there, listen to good music etc, dance made up infront of a mirror. Basically, my anxiety is never at zero, but most days it stays around 3/10, which is a win ü§£\n\nTw: I come from a very conservative family and have had a difficult childhood. My father often used to beat me up growing up and always mistrusted me. As a kid, I learnt to lie a lot as a defence mechanism. The fear was very strong and I would often freeze. Now, whenever anything happens in my life, I spiral into overthinking and cannot get out of the spiral for days. If I fuck up at work, I get so disturbed, I cannot even breathe. If something happens with my flatmates, I feel intense guilt and shame. I guess intense guilt and shame- these are two feelings that are occupying mist spaces in my life, making it very difficult for me to sustain relationships. However, the guilt and shame come from my own acts in the past. I have done somethings that I'm not proud of- stole some money as a college student and once also as a student in school from some people around me. I got caught. Each time. And that led to a lot of public shame. I still carry it and get super anxious whenever anything small also happens in my life. I'd request you all to be kind to me as I'm going through a very vulnerable/fragile state of mind. But, does anyone have any solutions?\n\nGoing on a walk somewhere (safe) I haven't been before\n\nA lex interview with Joscha Bach. It gave me a lot of coping mechanisms.\n\nGym &amp; tennis\n\nDoing something absolutely new. \n\nWhen I had some bad times (due to a breakup) I decided to try everything (this is mostly escapism btw. Trying new things to take my mind off of the bad stuff). A few random examples:\n\n1. I saw a few YouTube videos on cooking. Immediately ordered an apron and started cooking. I wasn‚Äôt really good at it. But I still did it. Just wearing that apron changed my personality and mood\n\n2. Got a 1000 piece puzzle and solved it (I was never into puzzles)\n\n3. Went rock climbing (at a bouldering gym nearby)\n\n4. Started sketching (I absolutely suck at it. But watched enough YouTube videos to get started and tried my hand at it)\n\n5. Played badminton at a nearby court with internet friends (I realised when you invite an acquaintance for something fun like a game, they generally don‚Äôt say no)\n\n6. Read books which are known to be un-put-downable (Like the Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir)\n\n\nBasically I made sure my mind is always occupied (obviously I cried a lot too. I went through the bad emotions too. But whenever possible, I kept myself busy doing random stuff)\n\nJournaling. I don‚Äôt do it everyday, just when I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm drowning in my own thoughts and I can‚Äôt make sense of them. I‚Äôve found typing out everything makes it easier to sort out my brain and rationalize everything.\n\nhttps://teach.mindfulnessexercises.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Using-Sounds-as-the-Object-of-Your-Awareness-Guided-Meditation-Script-MindfulnessExercises.com_.pdf\n\nThis exercise is really helpful, best to do it once a day to get the best results. Hard to explain but it‚Äôs like a knot is untangled after you finish it\n\nwhen it‚Äôs really bad, get new sheets on the bed, have a bath, grab some snacks and watch twilight. \n\nOtherwise flicking a rubber band on my wrist helps me ground in reality\n\nVideo games and prayer\n\nSelf deprecating humor.  Fly Fishing.  Walking through the woods.\n\nNow, enjoying time with my granddaughter.\n\nyoga helps me *a lot* as does any kind of exercise or movement, even if it‚Äôs just cleaning/organizing something in the house.  i‚Äôm also trying to ask for help more - mostly in the form of talking to my partner about things.\n\nDistraction, over here. I have all kinds of logic games on my phone, including puzzles that I have to focus on. Braving games too. Gets me out of my head consistently and pretty quickly. I also have lots of apps on my phone that pertain to my career and will look stuff up when I start feeling anxed.\n\ncrochet!\n\nSome of mine are reading, watching shows I love, etc. however I‚Äôd also recommend writing down the situation. That has always helped me the best, and it lets me write down my feelings and perspectives on what happened/is happening. I usually read it over once or twice after and it helps give me a lot more clarity and understanding, along with helping me realize that not everything is in my control and that everything happens for a reason. It may not be the best for everyone, however it helps me a bunch to realize what the situation looks like and why it may not be healthy/good.\nMore coping skills I‚Äôd recommend: spend time in nature, with friends &amp; family, with your pets, music, RELAXING video games (Stardew Valley, Unpacking, A Little To The Left, Slime Rancher, etc.), poetry, cleaning, just getting yourself busy overall.\n\nI hope this helps and that things sort out soon! ü©∑ü´Ç\n\nTattoos.\n\nsex"

    "all_comment_text": "I was putting my baby to bed. Could feel it coming. Barely managed to get him into his crib before I spilled out of his room and onto the floor of my hallway. I felt like I was gonna pass out or have a heart attack. Stayed there for a good 30 mins before I was able to collect myself. It was horrible. \n\nSending you hugs.\n\nIt‚Äôs so much harder when you have a little one too\n\nSending you hugs\n\nSomething similar happened to me though I was also sick at the time a couple months ago. Woke up in the middle of the night to change my son‚Äôs diaper and take a piss, then when I sat down in his bed it all started happening and I panicked hard and ran across the hallway to tell my wife as I thought I was having a heart attack and essentially fainted into the room with my head going through the window (luckily it was open so I only ran through the screen door). My blood pressure dipped low and the pulsing in my body gave me an anxiety attack. Paramedics took me to a hospital I wasn‚Äôt covered at and now I‚Äôm out 800 bucks\n\nOmg once I was so burnout and overstimulated and had so much anxiety and there was a point where my baby‚Äôs cry really stressed me out and I straight up passed out for a few seconds once when he started crying because it stressed me out that muchüòÖI just hit the floor lmao\n\nI feel that. The first month or so we had our baby home, I'd have a panic attack before my night shift with him. It was awful.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI had almost the exact same experience. Laying in bed, my mom holding my hand while it's happening, thinking this is the last time I'll see her before I die. On the ambulance ride over they gave me a shot of liquid gravol which helped calm me down. Wouldn't wish that feeling on anyone though, I honestly think the whole episode left me with some PTSD.\n\nNearly exactly what I went through but they didn't give me any drugs :/ was just sent home\n\nHad this exact thing happen, except they didn‚Äôt give me anything. I couldn‚Äôt walk, couldn‚Äôt lift my arms, could barely breathe. Fully convinced I was having a stroke, in the ER they did a TON of tests only to tell me ‚Äúyour white blood cell count is a little high so you probably have a bug, take some NyQuil and take it easy.‚Äù ü´†\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry the medical gaslighting is unreal for anxiety\n\nYep same thing happened to me, panic attack lasted 4 hours everything was so bright I was scared out of my mind laying in my mom's lap felt like I was just waiting for my heart to stop all my limbs going numb. The thing is I have panic disorder so my mom knew not to take me to a hospital or anything but those 4 hours I begged her that this was different and I was really dying. It makes it even scarier when you can't get any help and you just know, wow this may be it for me. But anyway for like 2 weeks after that panic attack I was freaking drained like my body physically hurt and I was exhausted as hell\n\nThe same happened to me when I was done with a very hard exam in college. I thought I was going to lose my mind and die from a stroke, which accelerated my anxiety even more. I went to the people in reception and told them to call an ambulance as I became very pale and couldn‚Äôt breathe. Later I was taken by an ambulance to the hospital, my arms were numb and I was given the same pill. A couple of times I fainted as well in the past because of vasovagal syncope.\n\nSame thing happened to me. It was like 10 PM and I was suddenly aware of my own heart beat and felt like my thoughts were drifting away. I made my wife drive me to the hospital thinking I was having a heart attack. A staff member came up to me and was trying to get insurance information while I was hyperventilating, it was awful.\n\nI had a panic attack in the shower while I was home alone and the whole neighborhood saw me screaming on the front lawn. I got taken away by the ambulance. I was administered haldol and still couldn‚Äôt function. I was in a group home/ hospital over 100 days. I bought my first house a year earlier and that night was the start of the end. We lost our house because I could never hold the job I lost again. Hard to talk about. My life has never been the same since then üòî.. that was over 5 years ago\n\nEdit: the strange part, before this day I never had anxiety attacks. It seems everyone has that ‚Äúmoment‚Äù where life changed and it‚Äôs hard to get their old life back.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you\n\nThat‚Äôs horrible!\n\nI'm so sorry about this ! Everything you worked for as well. Well what's important here is your physical and mental health really.\n\nMy first. I didn‚Äôt know what they were then and was terrified.\n\nSame here man, it caused me to have a complete mental breakdown. I had to pretty much learn to ‚Äúwalk‚Äù again. I know that might sound a little dramatic, but I promise you I literally had to learn how to do everything again because I was suddenly terrified of the world and doing even menial tasks. \n\nPeople without anxiety just don‚Äôt understand how traumatizing it is to suddenly become aware of this ominous force in your life that could pop up at any second and make you feel miserable and like the world is about to end\n\nI literally was just at a small work dinner‚Ä¶ with several friends, low key, and all of a sudden I had to get out of there‚Ä¶ made an excuse, took 1/2 Xanax and barely could drive home because of the anxiety‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so tired of others having fun and I‚Äôm a mess\n\nSorry, man, that sounds awful. But the more you run away from the anxiety the worst it will get. Next time, take the Xanax, chill for a bit and you‚Äôll be fine.\n\nAre you on anything else other than Xanax? Sounds like you might need an SSRI or something else\n\nSame happened to me and then it sent me into a year long depression.\n\nI second this I thought I was having a heart attack.\n\nI actually went to the ER because I was sure it was a heart attack. Thankfully, it wasn't\n\nSame here :( glad it wasn‚Äôt heart issues for you either!\n\nAlso thought I was having a heart attack or severe respiratory distress. Went to a free standing ER and they were garbage, zero help identifying it as a panic attack.   I figured it out later\n\nSame! My now-spouse had to call my mom as I was chatting with her online and the panic attack came on and I was describing the symptoms to her - we were both convinced I was having a heart attack as I had the left arm numbness, short of breath, heavy compressing feeling on my chest, etc. I tried to walk to my mom's room to wake her and fell straight to the floor - about time my now-spouse made the call to wake her. My mom freaked also figuring I was having a heart attack and called an ambulance. The EMT's seemed to think so as they started a line in my wrist immediately. I felt really stupid once we got to the ER and it was just a panic attack.\n\nNever feel stupid about your health. You know your body better than anyone.\n\nSame. I got to my office at 8:30 for the first day back ‚Äúafter‚Äù COVID and I was anxious but fine. I started feeling warm and just off but drinking water and chewing gum helped. My vp came in and made a weird joking comment about how me and my colleague looked miserable and we were both like ??? cause we were just sitting at our desks catching up.\n\nHad department check in meeting and I felt anxious but fine. Went back to desk and felt off but kept going. Walked across the street with my colleague to get lunch and I felt so anxious my hands were shaking when I went to order my food and I felt short of breath and had to sit down. We walked around the block before heading back and the breeze helped a little. Went back and closed my door, tried to eat a bit.\n\nMy hands wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking and I felt like someone was sitting on my chest and I texted my colleague and asked if she could walk me to the parking garage next to our building and I just sat in my car for like 15 minutes. I started feeling fine as soon as I left the building. I went home and felt absolutely exhausted and just sat in a chair for a while and took a nap. \n\nEnded up getting an accommodation to stay remote but I did come in a few times and do some remote site visits. Eventually I was basically having panic attacks every morning and could mostly work through them but I ended up losing some hair and was prescribed beta blockers.\n\nI held out another like 6 months at my job and then left for this reason and a couple others. Haven‚Äôt had a panic attack since.\n\nIt‚Äôs actually a proven fact that Covid, especially the earlier strains, have severe negative impact on mental health. I don‚Äôt just mean in the sense of the experience being traumatizing. The inflammation that it causes to the brain literally gives people mental illness. Look it up they‚Äôve had to open psychological centers to further study Covid and the long-term psychological effects.\n\nI fully believe this since I went through it myself. I‚Äôve had anxiety and panic attacks before, but not often. After I got covid a couple years ago, I had a a sudden panic attack. Little did I know that was just the beginning. It got so bad with the number of panic attacks I got on a daily basis after that first time. I became completely housebound which led to severe depression. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why this suddenly started happening and all my blood tests came back normal. I had read about the possibility of brain inflammation. I‚Äôve read stories of redditors on here who also started having sudden panic attacks after recovering from covid..many who can‚Äôt even say they had general anxiety before it. They can‚Äôt all be a coincidence.\n\nYes, same thing happened to my friend who is a guy and he never experienced panic attacks then he got Covid and had a panic attack and call the ambulance thought it was a heart attack. It sucks but what can you really do. I wish there was an answer for the brain inflammation thing.\n\nThe first one. I smoked some bad pot apparently (or wrong strain), never had one in my life before. Felt like I was dying, impending doom and the works. Shivered for 4 hours, my heart wanted to explode out of my chest, had to remind myself to breathe even tho I couldn‚Äôt. Couldn‚Äôt lay down, stand up or sit, nothing worked. Turned the light on and off every 5 minutes to calm myself. Was sweating my ass off, even though I was so cold. Bf tried to hold me, counted his heartbeats and calmed down ‚Ä¶ fell asleep. Woke up completely different and detached, like I was not in my body, just an observer. Calmed down eventually. Today is 3 days after it, and I am still not myself, recovering ever so slowly. Every now and then I get the feeling it‚Äôs coming back, but I won‚Äôt let it. \n\nThis is to healing, you‚Äôll be okay. I was too. It seems like it won‚Äôt ever end, and that you won‚Äôt survive, but you will, and you‚Äôll heal and recover. Best wishes &lt;3\n\nI am so sorry this happened to you. It sounds like my first serious attack, except I let it keep affecting me because I was unfamiliar with that detached feeling. I felt like I was not the same.\n\nOh love, i wish i could take it away from you. I am far from being mentally stable, although i‚Äôve fought against it my whole life. I will say for myself that i am pretty good at making myself believe it‚Äôs just my brain trying to play the worst scenarios for me, and I fight to accept it. I tell myself it‚Äôs just silly thoughts, and that I am fine, and it works‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs complicated psychology, but i believe it will get better, even for you!\n\nThat is amazing you don‚Äôt let your thoughts take over! I‚Äôm still in that process and I‚Äôve been dealing with it for years. You are strong\n\nThis was my exact situation about six months ago (weed-induced panic attacks and dissociation). I thought it would never pass, but it did. It took a long time, but it did. You will get through it and come out stronger.¬†\n\nThank you! I am taking it day by day, figured out I can‚Äôt smoke sativa, in about 2 weeks time i‚Äôll try indica again. Hopefully i can continue my use - I can‚Äôt be without it as I had a traumatic experience at 12 and can‚Äôt sleep because of nightmares, it helped me overcome big issues‚Ä¶ but now it seems that the thing that helped me the most actually ruined me more. Thank you so much for your reply, you‚Äôve given me hope. I always say ‚Äúthis too, shall pass.‚Äù And it will. I am already much better, recovering and resting.\n\nI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre doing better. I know it‚Äôs hard, especially scared and alone.Traumatic incidents in my past have played a huge role in panic attacks for me for several years now, when being faced with new triggers, unexpected problems, after moving, which was supposed to be a good thing for me, but turned out very differently, and I‚Äôve had little to no control over. \n\nI feel myself getting overwhelmed, too often, with good reason to be, and try telling myself that it‚Äôll be okay and I‚Äôll be alright, and I‚Äôve been through this before, many times, but over different things, different traumas. \n\nTrying to tell myself that my fears are not all the same as it was before, and that I have to keep telling myself to be compassionate with myself helps, but not nearly soon enough, when your chest is pounding and I‚Äôve got no one in my life whatsoever, but am very thankful for my dog, who‚Äôs perfect for me, and with me. \n\nTry to keep believing in yourself, if you can. If not yet, keep trying, because when everything is said and done, it‚Äôs you that‚Äôs made it through it and you‚Äôll have the strength if and when there‚Äôs a next time, and can maybe talk yourself through it, will  always help when it‚Äôs over and you can relax and breathe. \n\nSending you lots of love and reminding you that you‚Äôre stronger than you think ;)\n\nI was a heavy daily weed user for 10+years and weed just almost always makes me dissociate and even have panic attacks now, I barely smoke now but haven‚Äôt given up completely I stick to one or 2 tokes around bed time every few days. \n\nUsed to to through an 8th in 2 days now an 8th lasts me 2 weeks or more lol. Just be careful and most importantly when you do smoke again start slow and don‚Äôt over think it it‚Äôs like the second you think about panic/anxiety you open a door and it‚Äôs hard to close it but we learn to accept it and deal with it eventually.  Best of luck to you ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\ngive us an update after you tried the indica again pls! had the same experience with some (probably punched) haze i got from a random dealer. i took a couple hits and it sent me to hell, never was so nauseous and so terrified in my life. i‚Äòve developed ptsd late last year, so i don‚Äôt know if the strain caused this reaction or just my circumstances that i consumed it in, but ever since the feeling of the bad trip comes back with intense panic attacks. i‚Äòve had panic disorder and ocd since childhood, often have \"episodes\" where i will have multiple attacks for a couple months, and then none for like 6 months. ever since the weed my ocd obsession of \"what if i am psychotic?\" or \"what if the weed messed up my brain chemistry\" became stronger than ever. it sucks.\n\nI think that people with elevated anxiety (or panic) levels, react differently to sativa or regular ‚Äúanxiety suppressors‚Äù, as sativas are usually uplifting and give you a rush, we interpret that as a fight or flight and send ourselves into panic mode. I figured it‚Äôs not a persons mind, but literally our chemical compounds (inside the brain), mixing and registering at a wrong level. I will for sure give an update, i‚Äôll start with microdoses tho. Hopefully I don‚Äôt forget.\n\nOooh I had one of these. My dad had this weed chocolate, offered me some, and I took off a SINGLE square. Utterly incapacitated me for HOURS. I don‚Äôt even know how long it was I was sitting there rocking back and forth. The room was spinning, I felt hot, and I literally imagined a different reality for like two hours or so because I couldn‚Äôt even move or speak (which is literally my worst nightmare btw, I‚Äôve had many a dream about being in a state like that) I kept from freaking out for a long time because I was just repeating in my head ‚Äúdon‚Äôt freak out, don‚Äôt freak out‚Äù but ultimately I did end up getting really scared because I didn‚Äôt know how long it was going to last and at some point it got to where I couldn‚Äôt even MENTALLY finish a sentence. I cried for a while, and I was so dizzy I vomited at some point, which helped a lot. Fell asleep on the way home, went to bed immediately once I got there, slept 12 hours and was STILL a little high when I woke up. I don‚Äôt know how much was in those nasty ass chocolates from hell but that single square was like the hydrogen bomb to my coughing baby.\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine having a panic attack from an EDIBLE, because edibles, unlike somking last alot longer and creep up, and up‚Ä¶ and up. And it just doesn‚Äôt stop, suddenly you‚Äôre higher and higher and you can‚Äôt come down or put it to an end. With a joint it‚Äôs easy, once you stop smoking it stops creeping up. You‚Äôre brave, and I know exactly how you‚Äôve felt. I don‚Äôt wish this upon anyone, tbh, it‚Äôs the scariest shit ever, that feeling of impending doom and death.. freaked me out for sure. \n\nHow are you feeling now though after some time has passed? Are you back to normal/healed? Or did something stay with you for the rest of it?\n\nI had this happen to me about 10 years ago. I had a strain that was supposed to be great for anxiety. Don't know what I was thinking. It was called God's gift. I hit it out of a bong and it was something straight out of the devil's cookbook. I had a 5-hour long panic attack and I'll never forget how terrifying it was\n\nHey just want to let you know that the ‚Äúdetached‚Äù feeling is probably Derealization. It‚Äôs super common for someone who‚Äôs anxious and smokes weed. I‚Äôm just telling you because when this happened to me I felt so alone. Hugs x\n\nYes, I feel detached to my body. I don't know if my body is functioning properly because I can't feel it. The next day I get up and I am surprised that everything is working properly in my body. Just have some tightness around my head. I hear meditation music lying down and leave my mind and body as loose as I can. Just engulf myself into that healing process.\n\nNot the attack itself but the context - working at an understaffed help desk at a retail store with a long ass line of impatient customers. Functioning is impossible during a real panic attack.\n\nOooh, definitely the time I hid under a desk due to possible PTSD/extreme stress. For context; a really bad event at home involving alcohol, had to call the police on Mom. 7 months later (this happened in December) I had a flashback and got so stressed I hid under a desk, curled in a ball. I found it hard to breathe, I was crying, overheating, and my heart was going a million miles an hour. I kept saying: \n\"No! No! Make it stop!\" As I tucked my head into my chest. I wasn't screaming, it was more of me talking to myself and reliving the moment. He found me under the desk, since a very nice classmate (and friend of mine) tipped it to him. He got me to get out from under the desk (not forcefully, but very gently) and led me through breathing exercises at my own pace, he'd demonstrate it, and I'd follow his lead. He even told me that \"you're safe, everything is okay\" and got me to repeat it a few times. Then we went outside and he offered to let me speak to someone. While yes, a happy ending, it wasn't fun..\n\nI feel for you dude. The flashbacks are NO joke.\n\nMhm. They are intense. It's either a 5 or a 10. Almost no in-between. I also have periods of time where I have nightmares for weeks on end, I'm trying to get into a nighttime routine to maybe help me with it, since I'm going through one of those periods right now. I'm also going to talk to our pediatrician about it, since I have an appointment coming up. I do want help, living like this is no fun.\n\nIce pack on the chest may help alleviate the anxiousness. Your vagus nerve runs through your chest all the way to your butt. It‚Äôs in charge of the physical effects of anxiety, so using a cold compress on the chest will soothe you.\n\nThis might be why I put a yoga sandbag on this area when I want to sleep. Interesting info cheers\n\nThere are no words for itü§£ but the worst type of symptoms are when I can‚Äôt move my body properly and start full body trembling and the dropping sensation like I‚Äôm about to fall down\n\nI got an intrusive thought while running and it won and I kept running faster trying to outrun it but I couldn‚Äôt. It made me dissociate from life\n\nFor me, the dissociation is scarier than physical symptoms of heart\n\nI don‚Äôt like my heart racing unless it‚Äôs exercise or by eating spicy food. Mind induced heart racing sucks\n\nSending a big hug to you. My worst was in college, I crawled underneath my bed and hid behind my suitcases. I was wailing. I felt like I was never gonna get relief.\n\nI‚Äôve had some pretty terrible ones but the one that sticks out in my mind was the one where EMTs had to literally pry my hands off the steering wheel and carry me bc my whole body went stiff.\n\nIt was in 9th grade during my social studies class. The seating was in pairs of two and in rows. I was sat at the very front/center of the class next to this other kid. The teacher put on a historical film and all of a sudden my anxiety started to crescendo into a panic attack (I didn't know what was happening at the time). I think it was triggered by the fact that everyone would be looking exactly at where I was sitting. It got so severe and I was freaking out. I thought that If I moved even a cm, I would die, so I sat extremely still with my head resting on my left hand and my right hand down on my paper doodling. If I stopped doodling, I thought I'd lose control as well. So I sat there, freaking out, doing this for about an hour until the class ended. It was a fucking nightmare.\n\nWow, this reminds me so much of myself during freshman year its crazy.\n\nI remember in 9th grade, my Intro to Film class was 95% upperclassmen, which terrified me and gave me a panic attack on the first day. It slowly got better but I remember one day I was on the verge of a panic attack and the only way to stop it was to repeat \"it's okay\" nonstop in my head. It was horrible.\n\nbro fuck panic attacks dawg, my heart goes out to u\n\nI had a very bad while in an MRI machine. I was trying ti stick it iut and the tech kept saying if i moved or got out for a break we'd have to start over and they were trying to rule out something potentially life threatening. When i finally got out of the machine i tried to stand up and fell down. my legs were dead from all the hyperventilating and my blood pressure was dangerously low from the valium or whatever. They rushed in a bunch of people and were pulling out emergency life saving allergy medication because they were unsure of what was happening and thought it was a reaction to the dye. An ambulance was called and they were like you're having a panic attack it's okay\n\nI literally got pulled out of an mri machine yesterday‚Ä¶. I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to handle the rest and I‚Äôve had lots of mri‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs always a crap shoot whether I can handle\nIt or not\n\nugh wish there was an easier way to get imaging\n\n[removed]\n\nTwo different times my panic attack was so severe I thought I was about to have a seizure or something, and they both came out of nowhere. I wasn‚Äôt even anxious about anything, nothing was happening. First time I got hot, sweaty and confused and I just passed out. I felt like that was about to happen again the second time, I was so scared. Either pass out or have a seizure I thought would happen.\n\nMy first panic attack I woke up my dad (it had woken me up in the middle of the night) and told him he needed to drive me to the hospital bc I was having a seizure\n\nIt‚Äôs so scary! I‚Äôve never even had a seizure but I convince myself that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm feeling??\n\nYeah same here never actually had a seizure nor do I know anyone who has had one. I guess it‚Äôs like the feeling of tunnel vision and loss of balance/depersonalization feels like a brain breaking issue\n\nDepersonalization is the absolute worst but I hope you‚Äôre doing okay\n\nI have learned to manage and they have lessened over time so I‚Äôm doing well all things considered! Plus having an emergency valium on me at all times now has done wonders. Just knowing I can exit the ride if it gets crazy has kept them from happening\n\nThis is exactly what it is. My brain is breaking and I feel I‚Äôm going insane. It terrifies me and then I get the DP\n\nHad one on the middle of an escalator while going to a gym. I honestly though it was my last day :(\n\nI had a panic attack like episode with my ex boyfriend where I was just liking, sobbing and apologizing?  I completely blacked out for most of it and I used to think people were just making it up when they said that.  I had no control over myself and it was scary.\n\nThe second worst I had was the first one I ever had, because I didn‚Äôt know what it was, and I was very sick with my eating disorder at the time so I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack and dying.  Therapy is very helpful.\n\nI've had a lit of bad ones (mostly in school) but here are a couple which stick out\nHad one in school once in which I passed out and woke up with a throbbing head against the door, with my maths class staring disconcertingly at me, and my maths teacher kneeling next to me. Turns out I hadn't made it out of the classroom and my entire maths class saw me fall. It was a weird mix of painful and awkward. \nOnce had one at school when a teacher literally yelled at me whilst I was in the middle of it bc i was going to be late to my lesson.\nOnce had one on a residential trip in which I was put in the female teachers' room as one was having a shower, who then came out of the bathroom (in a towel) to check on me.\nPlus many more...\n\ni was 13 i think? had to get an endoscopy because i was having trouble swallowing. the idea of anesthesia scared me so bad for some reason, i think it was just the concept of being awake one second and completely out the next. i was in the waiting room and felt it coming on, so i rushed to the bathroom, panicked a little and then ended up passing out on the floor for a few seconds. my mom was there to help me and i ended up having the best nap of my life with the anesthesia so i panicked for nothing LOL i definitely have panic attacks where i feel like im gonna pass out still but i know how to better manage them now and havent done so since.\n\nMy feet felt like cell phone vibrating. My hands clamped up and was stiff. i was sweating and was extremely cold. My chest was so filled and tight. I couldn't speak proberly and everything went haywire. Aftermath was lots of shakiness and teeth shivers.\n\nI was sick, I was running a high fever and I generally was feeling very ill. I started having a panic attack, I was crying, hyperventilating I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I was naked trying to get into the shower and my boyfriend at the time had to keep me from falling down. The hyperventilating was making me lightheaded.\n\nI was sitting outside with my family when suddenly I felt my heart tighten and I felt extremely dizzy, so much so that I fell on my hands and knees. I felt like I was going to die from the lack of air and my heart being tightened. Of course, I started hyperventilating, which didn't help. \nI cried for 3 hours that I was dying and suffocating, I was so scared that I could barely hear what others were saying to me. I also felt terrifying numbness in both my face and limbs. I really was convinced I was dying. Only when I managed to calm my breathing (probably because I was tired) did everything slowly go away. \nI will not forget this until the end of my days. But when you have a panic attack, remember to breathe! Slowly, even if you feel like you're choking\n\nMy first ‚Äòproper‚Äô one, I‚Äôve known about them all my life because my mum suffers with them but until I had my first full blown one I never knew how crippling they could be, luckily for me I was in a therapists place and one saw me distressed and took me to an empty room and started walking me through how to calm down with looking at things I can see, touch, smell etc. but it was absolutely terrifying the first time and I‚Äôm not ashamed to say I cried into my mums arms like a baby as a fully grown man.\n\nMy first big one where I passed out. I really tried to push through it and it taught me mind over matter could only take me so far with my condition. That was the wake up call to go seek professional help.\n\nHad to pull over driving home from work. Shortness of breath and tunnel vision.\nStarted in the morning that day and it slowly built up until I left work early at lunch that day.\nScary. I pulled into someone‚Äôs driveway and sat there for a good half hour before being able to drive again confidently.\n\nWhen I had a nocturnal panic attack. Never even knew it was a thing. I woke up unable to breathe and basically thought I was having a stroke.\n\nSending you all the positive energy I can. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nMy first one, I hit a laced THC cart and was like paralyzed with my whole body twitching. 1.5 hours.\n\nIt was a few days after I got my iud put in. I was getting really bad anxiety for days but it started to subside. \n\nWhile I was getting ready for work and doing my makeup, my face went numb out of nowhere. I didn‚Äôt even feel anxious. My left arm hurt and my heart was pounding so fast. I stood up and toppled over. I started getting really scared thinking I was having a heart attack so my mom called the paramedics and told my work I couldn‚Äôt come in. \n\nWhile I was there I was sobbing because I was scared and the hyperventilating began. They ended up putting me in a room and took all of my belongings and stripped me down to a robe and nothing else. Said I could have my boyfriend in the room either. Nurse lied and said I told her I wanted to kill myself. This made me panic more. Eventually a different Dr stepped in and gave me my stuff back and let my boyfriend come in. They did an ekg and it was normal. They concluded it was a severe panic attack and gave me diazepam which helped a lot. \n\nI concluded it was the IUD causing the severe symptoms due to hormones and they refused to remove it. I got it removed at the OBGYN a week after having it inserted after fighting them for a while. Felt better within a few days. \n\nI‚Äôve had many panic attacks but that one was on a whole other level. It was terrifying and I refuse to try any form of birth control ever again‚Ä¶\n\nI was at work, I started feel dizzy and I had depersonalization. I had a strong tachycardia and I could barely breathing. Asked my collegue to take me to a pharmacy nearby. My parameters were normal, just a little high blood pressure because of the stressful situation. I called my mum crying, begging to take me away. What a nightmare!\n\nOh, definitely the first one. I live alone, so I was stressed about work and personal stuff. Suddenly, I felt pain in my chest and my heart began to race as if I had done some intense cardio. I remember leaning on the kitchen sink thinking I was about to die. It's really difficult to explain for people who never had a panic attack before, but I felt as if my soul was leaving my body, nothing felt real.\n\nI gathered my strengths and called the landlord, who lived in the same building then. I said I thought I was having a heart attack. He came with the janitor to find me shriveling on the couch, shaking.\n\nThey called an ambulance, my blood pressure was super high. They took me to the ER and did some tests.\n\nIt was just a panic attack, fortunately. They gave me some medicine and I was able to calm down.\n\nSince then I had a few other scares like that, but I've been medicated and it's more manageable now.\n\nmy first one, which i had during my mom‚Äôs funeral. At the time my mind was revisiting the memories we had, all the way to the point where i watched her slowly die from cancer, hearing her cry in pain as it slowly took her away from me. I still have these flashbacks, but minus the panic attacks\n\nWoke up, walked downstairs to go to a concert in key west. Was trying to slap a decal on my car when I got the Apple alert on my watch that said my heart rate was high for the movement I was doing. That spiked my anxiety. Tried to power through but couldn‚Äôt breathe, tingles, all over my body. Checked Apple Watch and I was sitting at 165bpm driving my car. Whipped a U-turn and drove to the hospital and thought I was dying. Took months and a few more scary incidents but I ended up figuring out it was panic attacks.\n\nHonorable mention: feeling like I was gonna die in the shower because I was standing up and not resting my heart. Shit sucked\n\nIt lasted for an hour or two. I was eating at a restaurant with my friends, and then I noticed my hands started shaking. I ran off to the bathroom to wash my face, and when I looked in the mirror, my pupils were dilated like dinner plates.\n\nMy partner called the emergency services because I didn't know I was having a panic attack, I actually thought I was dying. The emergency responder instructed him to check my pulse and count it. He did and she sent an ambulance out, which freaked me out even more.\n\nI ran out of the restaurant pacing up and down the street because I believed if I stopped moving, my body would shut down and I'd die. It seriously felt like I was on drugs or something. The workers at the restaurant were staring at me like I was crazy.\n\nThe paramedics were super lovely and tried their best to get me to relax, I can't tell you how relieved I felt when I saw them pulling up. My friends inside packed the rest of my food and gave it to me before I got in the ambulance, including a surprise dessert. I certainly enjoyed that when I felt like eating again lol.\n\nI feel the exact way right now. like someone‚Äôs standing on my chest\n\nEver have any stomach issues? I notice a lot of people that get these panic attacks of chest pain usually have digestive issues in some form or another. Not saying you do just a thought.\n\nNot so much anymore since I gave up fast food and started making all my own meals\n\nGotcha. Even making your own meals can some times still have stuff that aggravates your stomach which can in turn irritate your vagus nerve causing adrenaline dumps and or trigger the brain you‚Äôre in danger causing the body to freak out and result in a panic attack. I‚Äôve dealt with this and the chest pain plus panic is a nightmare. I hope you feel better and get better at controlling them as they come on.\n\nThat‚Äôs so true. I used to feel nauseous after every time I ate, and that has improved since cutting out the junk, but it‚Äôs highly possible that some of my symptoms that I‚Äôm still experiencing are related to my diet. Do you think it‚Äôs inflammatory foods that are the culprit? Or maybe it‚Äôs different for everyone, especially if there are unknown intolerances like gluten or dairy etc\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to say. I‚Äôve had days where I eat like crap and am fine and days where I eat like crap and it really hits me. I will say it‚Äôs always a good idea to aim for anti inflammatory options as well as making yourself chew food more thoroughly than you might already do as well as eating slower. Not sure how old you are but the older we get the more temperamental our digestive system and bodies react I feel like.\n\nToday was the worst one I ever had. I was on a freeway that was going pretty fast downhill with nowhere to pull over as all of the sides were blocked off with construction rails. My heart was beating so fast, I had tunnel vision, I was incredibly dizzy, and my body was numb from all the adrenaline flowing through me. I thought I was going to pass out from the pure dread and terror that I was feeling, scared for my life. It was one of the scariest moments I've ever had. I feel lucky to be alive.\n\nIt's between my first one, and i didn't know what it was and a recent one where i took an edible, and i freaked out\n\nMy worst ones would cause me to v* ALOT and have a lot of d*. On top of that I would be sweating like crazy and have the shakes really bad\n\nMy first and biggest panic attack came the day I found of the sex of my child üò∞ the whole reality sank in was playing overwatch got a bit irritated next thing i know my left arm goes numb and my skin turned white I told my wife to call 911, literally thought I was dying ambulance came hooked me up, said I was okay but decided to pass on the Incredibly expensive taxi to the hospital, it went away whew was real bad one, the whole rest of the year would have attacks and went to the hospital, haven‚Äôt had a bad one in a long time thankfully, hope your doing better\n\nMy first true panic attack. Face and fingers were numb, limbs were tingling, lightheaded, felt really claustrophobic. Didn‚Äôt know what was going on and thought I was dying.  Didn‚Äôt help that I was at work at a newish job where I didn‚Äôt know anyone well. Had to call my mom to drive an hour to pick me up and take me to the ER because i was way too embarrassed to call an ambulance. They chalked it up to dehydration (I had a cold at the time too??). Didn‚Äôt realize what it actually was until the same thing happened a few weeks later and I was able to calm it down with deep breathing. Wouldn‚Äôt wish that feeling on anyone.\n\ni had a nocturnal panic attack when i was 15 that not only caused me to throw up but was also so traumatic that i developed a fear of throwing up for a few years.\n\ni sincerely hope you feel better. therapy helped me a lot.\n\nThis past weekend I had a rough one, full on hyperventilating. I've been under a lot of stress lately with some health concerns. My mom was talking to me trying to make me feel better and lighten up about things and I did that thing where you start out laughing and then end up sobbing. I was fully convinced that my organs were shutting down and all of my cells were dying and that I was about to suffocate. I was half on the couch, half on the floor, sobbing and shrieking. An ice pack from the freezer helped a little.\n\nI went to urgent care about an hour later (was planning on doing this before the panic attack because of my health worries) and I felt calmer but my heart rate was still about 134.\n\nI got out the shower and proceeded to do usual tasks, grab towel...almost started to dry myself when...my heart started beating out my chest and the room was spinning. Wrapped myself up like a cocoon until it passed. Naked and afraid I tell ya.\n\nthe worst I had was probably bc of my emetophobia. 1st and only time i was drinking while in town. 2 friends and I were on our way out of the bar when I threw up and went into a total panic. I lay down on a bench and started crying, repeating the same words over and over again \"I can't get up\". the panic attack lasted around 2-3 hours until my parents came to get me (i was 19 back then)\n\nFelt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, couldn‚Äôt walk, couldn‚Äôt speak, dizzy, sobbing crying to the point of hyperventilating, almost went to the ER but thought about the medical bill for virtually no help and that made me wait it out. Was a very tough night\n\ni was taking a shower when my chest got extremely tight &amp; heavy, then my breathing got super labored and short. i started panicking cause i thought my breathing was going to come to a complete stop. i was hyperventilating to the max and literally jumping around, grabbing stuff to gasp for air. left the shower on, grabbed a towel, and told my family i couldn‚Äôt breathe. my dad rushed me to the hospital where they checked my vitals and boom, everything was fine. they gave me ativan and i was chillen within an hour.\n\nMy panic attacks are so mental. It feels like my brain is firing on every cylinder and I lose touch with my surroundings. I feel completely out of control and I get terrified that I won‚Äôt be able to calm down and go back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I got my first in the shower so now the shower is a trigger.\n\nMy son was choking on his food and over exaggerated it. Even on my meds I had one of the worst attacks, was over the toilet sweating and vomiting almost instantly after it happened. I accepted death and thought that was it, of course didn‚Äôt let me son see me in the bathroom. \nI had to ask my new female roommate to check my pulse to reinsure that I was ok.  \n\nAlso Once had a bad attack and had an ambulance pick me up in tonapah Nevada at a truck stop and they had to drive me all the way to a hospital in bishop California. The hospital did nothing for me and kicked me out to the street alone in a place I did not know. Couldn‚Äôt get a hold of anyone since my cell phone was dead. Luckily was able to make a call at a local hotel and a friend drove from Reno to bishop to drive me back to my car in tonapah. \n\nI‚Äôm ok now and still have minor attacks from time to time. Stopped drinking alcohol because I couldn‚Äôt handle the hangovers. But on a boatload of pharmaceuticals. \n\nLife is a trip.\n\nOut of town (visiting Santa Rosa) with wife and our infant (at the time). Got up to pee in the middle of the night in our hotel bathroom. Must have locked my knees while peeing, started passing out and yelling for help. A woman I did not recognize (it was my wife,) came in to help me. I was completely out of it and thought I was having a heart attack or stroke. Sat on the floor crying and hyperventilating for 3 hours. Took an Ativan, it did almost nothing. \n\nLuckily I didn't wake up my kid. Best explanation is I had a syncope event (near feinting) and then a panic attack right after. I've never had one that bad. I usually just dry heave or maybe vomit at worst.\n\nI now measure all panic attacks by that one. I'll tell the wife that I'm at a 0.6 Santa Rosa and she'll immediately understand.\n\nHand to God, thought I was dying.\n\nHonestly.. my first one was the absolute worst. I was dead asleep, woke up feeling weird. My baby (at the time) wasn‚Äôt crying, house is dead quiet, but I feel extremely weird.. almost outer body. I get up to get a glass of water and BOOM! Impending doom hits me like a tone of bricks. I stumble to my medicine cabinet to get an emergency xanax. I chew the mother fucker because I feel like ‚Äòthis is it.‚Äô Stumble back to my room and shake my fianc√© awake saying ‚Äúbabes.. I think I‚Äôm having a panic attack. With in seconds I fall on the floor. My heart POUNDING, my breathing all over the place, the fear and impending doom cranked up to 11. I literally feel like I‚Äôm dying, I am absolutely having a heart attack.\n \nMy legs, feet, hands, arms go tingly and numb. I fade in and out of reality. I remember saying ‚Äúplease god‚Äù as I squirmed on the floor trying to keep myself stable. Suddenly I feel a hand on my back and someone saying ‚Äúno no no no‚Äù my fianc√© starts rubbing my back and coaches my breathing. Telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing great, you are breathing perfect, it will be over soon‚Äù what seemed like 8 Hours was 30 mins of pure hell. I will never forget that night for as long as I live. I‚Äôve had panic attacks since then. But that one straight up traumatized me. I am forever terrified to go back to that dark place.\n\nOne day, I was at work at a restaurant in the kitchen. It the dinner shift and it was very busy and a little stressful at the time. I started getting dizzy all of the sudden while I was cutting vegetables. The dizziness triggered a panic attack and I ran to the restroom where I started dry heaving. I splashed some water on my face and used my breathing app to calm myself down. I was probably in the bathroom for what felt like 10 minutes. When I thought I was well enough to get back to work, I returned to the kitchen but then I started getting tunnel vision, my chest started feeling tight, my heart was racing, and I started feeling very nauseous. At this point, I was panicking even more. I tried being rational as this wasn‚Äôt my first panic attack (it was definitely the worst though) so I quickly told my coworker to take care of my order because I wasn‚Äôt feeling well. I stepped outside through the back door and laid down in the parking lot as I shivered, even though it was a hot summer night. I felt extremely tired and weak. I could barely move and drool running down my face but I managed to get a few deep breaths and a few sips of water. I called my brother to come pick me up from work and he had to help me up off the ground and take me home. I laid in bed all night with ice packs on my head and chest.\n\nJust here rn having a separation anxiety attack and got myself out the hole by taking med nd a lil puff nd cry. But to the question asked....\nThis happened back when I was working. For context I was in the midst of separation with my S.O , arrive to work and I thought everything was fine. I had the panick attack otw to work bc we were arguing 9n the phone over the separation. We have kids tg. Young. I got to work and was trying to set up and my mind was racing so fast I couldn't calm myself at this point and passed out. Came too in the er.\n\n12+ hour panic attack from acid trip. Left me with depersonalization and derealization\n\nI was walking in the hallway of my house when all of the sudden both of my arms siezed up straight up and so did my hands. I couldn‚Äôt close them or do anything. But I was somehow able to unlock my phone and get ahold of my partner. It took them 25 mins to get to me and my arms were like that the whole time. Along with feeling like I was going to faint and slurring my speech. \nDidn‚Äôt stop for almost 40 mins.\n\nOne night I had a feeling I still dont know how to describe other than my blood slowly turning into ice. There suddenly weren't enough blankets in the world to keep me warm. My heart was pounding like it was going to stop any moment, I was in doom mode were I was positive I will die soon and every so often I would have to make a mad dash to the bathroom where it would all spill out of me like i was an open faucet.\n\nWould not reccomend reading medical articles before bed. Or any other time if you have health anxiety\n\nSitting in the corner at work shaking because co-workers wouldn‚Äôt help me, despite me begging and I was dealing with customers all alone, when I finally broke down they just walked by saying ‚Äúshe‚Äôll be okay, just give her a minute‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt okay, but I knew I had to keep working. That moment has stayed with me and it‚Äôs been a year.. the customers who saw this happen were apologetic and told me to take my time ‚ù§Ô∏èü•≤\n\nI was getting bad ones for months, it‚Äôs finally calming down. I would feel like I couldn‚Äôt breath, my lips and hands would get tingly, I literally thought I was dying almost every single day. Sometimes more than once. Got heart scans and everything, everything was normal. Just gotta ride it out, and know you‚Äôll come out okay\n\nI was at work. Working the registers and a customer was yelling/screaming at me calling me a bitch and other derogatory words, and I just lost it. I left the registers immediately with tears coming down my face and not being able to breathe. I went to the back room and just tried to calm down. Never work registers again after that.\n\nI'm here from your post asking about goodwill two years ago. I also struggle with anxiety and cash registers - where did you end up working? Did you ever find work that didn't cause you too much anxiety?\n\nI ended up working in the back room of TJMAXX so I don‚Äôt have to deal with customers or the registers. Sometimes I‚Äôll do cleaning there as well.\n\nLast week I was hoping for a phone call that we were overstaffed and I could have the day off.  The longer I waited the worst my anxiety became.  By the time I got to work I was crying and shaking and had to sit in my car until I could collect myself.  I just needed a mental health day, I should have called in sick.\n\nI got a bad one like a year or two ago in a shopping mall. This one had me genuinely believe I was dying. Not exaggerating. I'd think \"I'm dying\" in other panic attacks but it wasn't 100% genuine. This one was. I was dizzy and my lungs just went offline. Actually don't remember much aside from that.\n\nCaused me to have to pull over because it happened while driving and was so intense that my vision washed out completely white, my body went numb to the point that I couldn't feel the gas pedal, and my abdomen was spasming so hard from the numbness that I couldn't sit up to look over the steering wheel.\n\nAfter this, I had one of the worst dissociative episodes ever where I spent a month basically disembodied and floating above + behind my \"meat suit\" and felt like I was perpetually stoned (not in a good way) despite not smoking back then; Stuck just watching the body run completely on autopilot. Every day, I would wake up feeling normal, but the second I sat up my \"awareness\" would shoot up and out of my body, and the body would just robotically sit up and do its thing. It was such a strange experience.\n\n This happened about 6 months ago but my mind was completely racing and i couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone i couldn‚Äôt concentrate or do anything it was horrible my thoughts were racing a millions miles an hour I thought i lost my mind it took about 5 mins to settle but felt like a life time my heart was beating fast also I had to go on medication in the end to deal with this I also suffer from anxiousness and that just made things worse.\n\nOne time I woke up scream crying and I went into my parents room (I was younger) and they literally could not get me to talk or calm down or anything. They almost called an ambulance but I was able to get out of it before they did. Have no idea what caused it.\n\nMy worst panic attack was right after a brain procedure. When I found out I was going to be stuck with this implant forever, I panicked. For the next 12hrs, I felt like my soul was trying to escape my body. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own skin. Trying to sleep was foreign to me. I couldn‚Äôt handle the anxiety, I started thinking suicidal thoughts to escape the pain. \n\nFor some odd reason, I told myself, if I were to off myself, at least dance one more time to music. I did that and magically the anxiety went away. I felt my soul steadily going back to my body.\n\nMy first attack was in middle school when I was getting bullied at the small-town school that I transferred to. The teacher seemed to be trying to test my knowledge in front of everyone and I stared at the classroom, most of them were already laughing before I could respond. My heart felt like it would burst, I couldn't breathe, and I just started crying until the teacher slowly escorted me out of the classroom. \n\nMy last big attack was when I found out my spouse was cheating while I was dealing with postpartum depression. I hope you all find ways to cope/heal from those attacks.\n\nThe one I had tonight is up there. Arm pain, chest pain, some numbness and tingling, couldn‚Äôt breathe. I had to leave work early. Now I‚Äôm home and slightly better but I‚Äôm still pretty anxious and have a headache. \n\nBest wishes to you.\n\nI was in an ambulance - forced mental health check. En route from the ER to a mental health facility. My blood pressure was so high (freaking out over the horrible reality check that this was really happening) that the EMTs worried I was about to have a heart attack. I was 32, fit, super depressed ‚Äî and have a medical history of low and normal blood pressure. I couldn‚Äôt see. Pains in my chest and arm. It was horrible. (I didn‚Äôt need to be placed, by the way, thankfully my cousin was visiting - is a lawyer, and got me out after 2 days - they were trying to keep me for several weeks).\n\nTook LSD while sleep deprived. It gave me an affect that was not LSD anymore. I lost the ability to speak and form thoughts and just became so unhinged. Delirium or psychosis to conclude but in that moment it‚Äôs like I knew that I am stuck this way for life and I will never be able to think again and will have to be put in a mental home. \n\nIn that moment all my dreams shattered I couldent even speak to anyone normally they wud all know I lost my mind or something because I could no longer speak I was forgetting shit every second. It was a different type of scared it‚Äôs comparable to being chased by a guy with a gun not knowing anytime when ur life will end. A fate worse then death being so mentally disabled you can‚Äôt do anything but are aware your mentally disabled. \n\nIf I was still in that state I would not be able to write this and wud legit be in a mental home. But it‚Äôs the scared I been I went to the hospital so they cud help which after so many hours it did\n\nI‚Äôve had a lot of bad panic attacks, but the absolute worst ones? Is when I‚Äôd panic so badly, I‚Äôd end up violently throwing up several times in a row. My body would shake so hard, I couldn‚Äôt stand up, and I‚Äôd have to lay down wherever I was. Sometimes I would faint during those episodes. \n\nThe second worst ones, are waking up into a serious panic attack during the night. Those are really bad ones. You wake up so confused, lost, shaking violently and shivering from cold sweat.\n\nI‚Äôve had two that were horrendous. For context, my panic attacks make my muscles tighten up and my hands go into claw/fist mode, my eyelids are twitching, my face muscles are cramping, literally everything. It‚Äôs like when you get a cramp exercising but literally my entire body. On top of that I can't breathe, I feel like I'm gonna throw up, etc. It is HORRID. It happens to some people when they‚Äôre not breathing properly. \n\nThe first one I had in 5th grade. Amusement park field trip at school. Everyone thought I was dying and I sat in the medical unit for 3 hours. \n\nThe second worst was when I was 16 and flying across the country, when the plane landed there was turbulence and I lost it and could not sit back in my seat. They couldn't land the plane for an extra 20 minutes and I made a scene (': NOT FUN and now as a precaution I take a xanax before the flight even takes off LMAO\n\none day i was at work &amp; i suddenly felt really dizzy &amp; my heart was racing. i started to panic and literally thought i was dying because i felt like i was out of my body.\n\ni've never been so scared in my life. then for about 6 months after that i had daily panic attacks\n\ni didn't know it was a panic attack bc i wasn't hyperventilating or crying and thought i was going to die of a heart attack, which caused me to spiral\n\nI was on a road trip with an ex about 17 hours from home and I had a panic attack in the middle of a remote desert. Just awful. I considered pulling over walking into the desert and ending my life right there, I had a gun in the trunk of the car. If it wasn‚Äôt for her being there I very well might now be alive. I ended up driving home deep breathing for 17 hours. \n\nHang in there, I pulled myself out of my own hell that day and lived. It will get better and life will throw you some good stuff here and there and before you know it you‚Äôll be satisfied with life.\n\nI have had so many bad experiences‚Ä¶ has anyone had it to so bad that you can‚Äôt breath , heart attack symptoms, but then your hands stiffen like claws??? ( there‚Äôs a name for the claw thing)  i ended up in the hospital‚Ä¶ this was years  ago yet I still have ptsd from it‚Ä¶.  I‚Äôve tried all sorts of meds such as Zoloft, Lexapro etc, but nothing has really helped‚Ä¶ Xanax will help with immediate relief sometimes, but how do we get\nTo the root and stop this madness?!?!!!\n\ni was on 200MG of seroquel for a year. throughout december i didn‚Äôt feel fully in my head, like i didn‚Äôt feel real, it was intense depersonalization but i didn‚Äôt know what to do so i ignored it. on new year‚Äôs day (1/1/24) i was about to go to sleep. i was having some breathing issues but i tried to ignore it. i closed my eyes and felt a weird sensation going from left to right in my chest area. then i felt a sharp pain in my heart, i got up and gasped, my mouth felt super dry, basically cotton mouth, my vision was blurry and when i stumbled to the bathroom to look at myself i was pale. i was begging my brother to call the ambulance. they eventually came and my heart rate was up to 150. which was the highest it‚Äôs ever been (it used to go up to 130) my brother drove me to the ER because AZ hospitals suck. and while i was in the waiting room i was trying to produce saliva, my brain felt like it was shutting off. i was screaming in the waiting room begging for help cause i thought i was dying. i eventually got checked out and they gave me ativan. saliva started producing in my mouth again, EKGs were fine, we went back home, i was tired so i texted my bf at 2am telling him that i loved him and im thankful for him, i was convinced that i was going to die still, i was so tired so i just basically wanted to let it happen. luckily i woke up the next day and texted my boyfriend cuz he was worried. everything felt off still but i felt in my head again. i lowered my seroquel instantly to 100 then 50, then 25 then quit over the months. scariest moment of my life. i have medication anxiety cause of it. i‚Äôm a hypochondriac so i fear one day it‚Äôll happen again. im always looking at myself, and checking myself to make sure it doesn‚Äôt. there‚Äôs no success stories on quitting seroquel, people feel like shit so they get back on it but god forbid i do that again. it used to help me until i mixed it with SSRIs. never again.\n\nI'm sorry you had to go through this please take care of yourself and remember you're not alone.\nWell... I couldn't cry for almost 5 years ago but recently I thought I had an ugly cry until I realized I wasn't crying anymore.. after I cried the whole river the only thing stopped was the tears streaming down my face but my breathing was getting worse and worse and I never thought my heart would humanly beat this fast like a thousand bpm and also it was literally aching... I couldn't see properly just colors with no shapes and I couldn't even take a breath anymore and I thought \"so I'll die like this huh?\".. I couldn't move or call for anyone cuz I didn't want to anyone see my last moments as fragile and weak... but since I didn't die then it means that I was just panicking because of how intense my crying was obviously.. but I don't know how long it lasted because I guess I lost the sense of time and never really looked through my phone that day. And by thinking of it this was my first one cuz I couldn't recognize it at first.. I just hope no one go through this even for my worst enemy.\n\nFirst (and last) time I ever took an edible. Had me praying to God on my bed not to die and lasted for 45 minutes.\n\nHad a pretty massive one earlier today. We went to the bike park and were on the lift and it stopped, very high up, for a couple min and I started having an attack. Managed to calm myself down and slow my breathing but holy shit that was scary.\n\nI've had them my whole life so I thought I was kind of used to control them. Until that one day, during my daily meditation. I went too deep. \n\nAt one point I was walking down a black corridor with 5 years-old me holding my hand and guiding me. We arrived in front of 3 doors and she told me \"open that one, you have to open that one!\". Behind that door was some strongly denied childhood trauma I assume, because I felt terrified and started to panic, cry and scream. I managed to get back to my senses but the panic attack was full-on by now and I couldn't get up or calm down for the life of me.\n\n2 hours later, I was exhausted and ready to die. Thankfully my neighbor heard and came to check on me. He held me and reassured me until I finally fell asleep. He came back later with a plate of food. Awesome guy. Needless to say, I don't meditate anymore. \n\nAnother one was at the dentist, when she started ripping out my 8 temporary front teeth without warning. I was choking from the saliva, between the pain and fact that I felt like drowning, it was hell. I was on 2mg of Ativan but the whole neighborhood still heard me scream and cry for my life.\n\nMy ex told me they needed to talk to me otp the following day. 16 hours of knowing they were going to dump me and I realized I was so lonely. I am so lonely. I felt like I was drowning, I can‚Äôt remember ever feeling like this except when I was young and couldn‚Äôt stop crying and it hurt and I couldn‚Äôt breath. Therapy will help. If they continue, you will want a referral to a psych for an as needed med. The day they dumped me I did need to take a Xanax for the first time in years\n\nLast summer. I had many in one week. I was walking by myself around the neighborhood that week to try to take my mind off things and I went into a panic attack, my Apple Watch recorded 195 beats per minute. I thought for sure I was going to die then and there.\n\nFirst one I had. I was at work and genuinely thought I was dying. Left work to go to the doctor but it got better so I made an appointment instead of going to the ER. Doctor was like dude that‚Äôs a panic attack.\n\nHeart was racing but also just the feeling of absolute dread, like this is it, death is imminent. Not fun!\n\nI had a panic attack so bad watching my daughter born that I began to have bad palpitations and i went downstairs to emergency that night. My heart would not stop doing that thing where it feels like it beats hard randomly out of nowhere. Except it was doing it constantly. I was mess.\n\nI genuinely want to know the difference between a panic attack and a an anxiety attack\n\nI had anxiety growing up but never panic attacks, so my first one was the worst &amp; scariest. I truly believed I was having a heart attack. My hands, feet and face went numb tingling. My entire body was shaking uncontrollably. The scariest part for me was realizing I had no control or trigger for the panic attack. It just happened and the feeling of the symptoms made me spiral into it more. I never understood them until I experienced firsthand\n\nThis past weekend. I had just got back from traveling overseas and thought I had met a guy with tons of potential (I‚Äôm planning on moving to his country soon). He was the kindest, most accommodating, interesting man. I even extended my trip to stay with him. Toward the end of my trip he started acting cold and condescending toward me and said it was coz he was a depressed person and low on his social battery.\n\nWhen we parted ways I didn‚Äôt really hear from him, and when I did I found if I said anything he didn‚Äôt like he would flip out on me and stonewall me. I tried to talk to him about it and he gaslit the shit out of me. I spoke to my therapist about it and she said he was showing early signs of a domestic abuser and to stay away from him.\n\nI tried to message him one last time on Saturday just to gain clarity and talk things out and he was straight up mean to me and gaslit me like crazy. I‚Äôve never experienced anything like it. He didn‚Äôt respond to my last text and I completely spiraled. I was so desperate that I texted my ex who said he would always be there for me in an emergency. He responded, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help you, sorry‚Äù. And blocked me. My anxiety was so bad that my chest was hurting and I was sobbing and couldn‚Äôt breathe. I was considering calling an ambulance because it was 2am and I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. I didn‚Äôt sleep the entire night. \n\nI just couldn‚Äôt (and still can‚Äôt) wrap my head around how a guy who was telling me he wanted to travel with me, how he had never met anyone like me and how special I was a mere few weeks ago could suddenly be so cold and horrible to me.\n\nMy worst panic attack was my first panic attack. I was working, building box trucks as an 18 year old woman.  I got too in my head about my grandmothers upcoming death and suddenly couldn‚Äôt breathe. The world was spinning around me and going outside for a breath didn‚Äôt help. I felt light headed, dizzy and nauseous. I hyperventilated until paramedics got there and took me to the hospital after drugging me up. I had no idea what was happening to me.. the paramedic who got me calmed down was really nice and told me that most of time it‚Äôs people in their 30s who have these episodes.. not fresh out of high school trades workers. Since then I‚Äôve gotten them under control and they‚Äôre usually silent.  I‚Äôm 27 now\n\nIn the middle of a class in college. I felt like my desk and chair were sinking in the floor and I was going with them. Time slowed and I panicked so bad I started seeing blurry. My teacher gave us a break and went to check in on me. It was so nice of her, I don‚Äôt know what would have happened had she not reached out to me.\n\nWhen I was weaning myself off of pot, I got a delta 8 edible from my usual spot. It was a cookie. Tasted great. Said the serving size was the whole thing. Boy was that serving suggestion wrong.\n\nAt first I felt great. Was enjoying my night. Went to go to sleep, and the next thing I knew my mind was racing. I kept thinking to myself ‚Äúomg I‚Äôm too high‚Äù and then, completely not of my own will, sprung straight up in bed. My heart felt like it stopped beating and I started to hyperventilate. \n\nI truly thought I was having a heart attack. I was doing everything I could to get my bearings but just could not. I forced myself to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom sink to drink some water. Every step felt like cement and I was so disoriented I‚Äôm surprised I managed to turn the faucet on. I took one swig of water straight from the sink, managed to turn it off, and then collapsed on the floor half way outside the bathroom door.\n\nIt took everything in me to not pass out. I kept telling myself I didn‚Äôt want to traumatize my roommate from finding me dead on the floor. At that point I *still* thought I was having a heart attack, even though my breathing started to slow. \n\nThen that massive wave of relief that you get after having an intense panic attack came. Literally, it felt like a wave. I finally had some sense of what happened, and was covered in sweat. I managed to get myself up off the floor and walk myself back to my room. \n\nI haven‚Äôt had a cookie edible since, and I‚Äôve been off weed for over a year.\n\nI was on a 3rd date with someone and we were both pretty into each other. As we sat there in conversation I felt it coming on out of no where, lose of appetite, narrowing vision, zero ability to pay attention more than saying ‚Äúoh no way, that‚Äôs crazy, wow!‚Äù \n\nI tried everything I could to keep it together. Pounded like 6 glasses of water (I don‚Äôt drink alcohol), and when the food finally came I had to tell her I had a bit of an upset stomach and couldn‚Äôt eat any of it. I went to the bathroom and nearly passed out on the floor.\n\nI some how held it together enough to walk her home, thankfully she lived right by the restaurant. She invited me to hangout longer but I told her I just wasn‚Äôt feeling the greatest. As soon as she departed I blacked out out. Don‚Äôt remember walking myself home other than a couple snapshots for familiar story windows. Came to on my bathroom floor feeling sick and disoriented. Messaged my roommate to check on me when he got home and then tried to pass out but every time I closed my eyes I would hallucinate.\n\nI was trying out a medication for depression at the time that I think was a pretty large factor in shaking things up.  Got off it shortly after with some crazy effects. From there I doubled down on mediation, therapy and journaling, my spirituality and started micro dosing a bit. It‚Äôs been a long road but all the work has been the best investment I‚Äôve ever made.\n\nI was in class and suddenly I started crying horribly. I was making a lot of noise because I was having a lot of trouble breathing. The teacher had to take me to the nurse and calm me a bit. Luckily there was a friend with me that stayed with me when the teacher had to go back to class\n\nI had been dumped. I was driving to my parents house and had to pull over because my limbs started to go numb, and I felt like I was going to pass out from how hard my heart was racing. I have had that sort of panic attack before but that was absolutely the worst, my literal blood flow was disrupted.\n\nI got on the train heading to work and started to get extremely hot to the point that I had to take my dress shirt off and just stood on the train with my undershirt. I thought something was really bad but not bad enough to not keep going to work so I went into work and immediately to the bathroom and threw up. I went home. The company I was working for told me to take a few days off but the pressure was so intense, I stressed taking days off. Worst part of it all is I think my job was stressful but it was really rooted in my family drama and I am just learning that over the last few months. It was back in 2017.\n\nI‚Äôve started having them almost daily and they‚Äôre getting worse.   I know it‚Äôs because of the amount of stress from every part of my life that is hitting all at once, but this is the worst I‚Äôve felt in fifteen years.\n\nThe one where I convinced myself I was hearing voices telling me to kill myself. At least I stopped the drug use after that so kind of a win?! Been sober 11 years now.\n\nCongratulations!!\n\nHad a couple that really sent me. One was when I had a stomach bug and couldn‚Äôt stop vomiting. I‚Äôm a type 1 diabetic, so I really need to be able to eat or drink some carbs if my blood sugar goes low, which I can‚Äôt do when I‚Äôm puking. So my intrusive thoughts kick in, making me think I‚Äôm going to die of a low blood sugar. I start to fret with my hands, and then the first wave of actual fear hits me and I start saying ‚Äúoh my god oh my god‚Äù over and over. I start pacing and breathing quickly, feeling ever more anxious as I do. Fianc√© tries to calm me down but the intrusive thoughts tell me that I‚Äôm actually going to die and I deserve this. \n\nWe go to the hospital (it very frequently is a real medical emergency when a type one diabetic can‚Äôt stop vomiting), and the wait is about two hours. This whole time I‚Äôm intermittently puking and panicking. Very shortly after one attack stopped, the next would start. Eventually got me into a room and got Zofran and Ativan into my system, which made my stomach cease hurting, and the Ativan made me very even and leveled out. That attack was one of the worst ones I‚Äôve ever had.\n\nI was sick and took DayQuil then went out with friends and got drunk. Good fucking lord I woke up in legitimate hell and ended up in the ER. I don‚Äôt touch cold meds especially ones that contain dextromethorphan or phenylephrine anymore I‚Äôve always been sensitive to them (anxiety, blown out pupils etc) but the alcohol combo added some extra spice. I developed panic disorder right after this experience. The first time I ever had a panic attack was after taking lexapro though so I don‚Äôt really touch any meds anymore otc or not. I healed myself naturally and haven‚Äôt had a panic attack in a long time. Another doozy was after driving 14 hours with barely no sleep I was up until 5am sweating and sick from panic in an unfamiliar bed. Terrible. That whole year of panic was like that though, I was stuck in fight or flight but not being in your own bed to sweat it out sucks a lot more. Check out the podcast ‚ÄòThe anxious truth‚Äù sheds a lot of light on actually healing. I‚Äôve come a long way. I felt like I lost myself entirely and was living in constant panic and found my way out, you can too.\n\n[removed]\n\nI literally had a panic attack that lasted an entire week. Didn't stop. I have no idea what triggered it or why it wouldn't end. I couldn't eat or sleep. My heart rate was insanely high and I was shaking and nauseous constantly. I just laid in bed or in the shower or on the bathroom floor, all day. \n\nThat's what prompted me to start taking medication for the first time in my life - they were the only thing that made it stop, and they worked so quickly too. I took them for 2 years and have been off of them for about a year now....\n\nI haven't had a panic attack that bad, or anywhere close, other than that time.\n\nWhen I was swamped at work and the mere thought of the amount of work I still had to do made me breathe heavily and my chest tight.\n\n\nWhen the started flashing and the band started playing I‚Äôm pretty sure I died for a few seconds at the QOTSA show last summer.\n\nThe first. I was 12 and ended up in the hospital. Not knowing what it was and actually thinking I was dying was terrifying at that age.\n\nI had a few bad ones.  Went to the ER a few times because of them.  Heart felt it was going to explode out of my chest, couldn‚Äôt breathe, both shoulders and neck went numb, nausea, sweating.  I really thought I was having heart attack each time.\n\nThe worst two I have had I actually passed out both times. My entire body went numb and I just fell.\n\nNot really one panic attack but I had a string of them that lasted for 2 months before I sought help from a psychiatrist. I would wake up and be thrown into one from the state change, and then I would spend about as much time in them as out of them throughout the day if I was sober. Eventually it got me really good at hiding panic attacks while I was in them.\n\nThey put me on 3x/d Xanax to try to get them under control.\n\nDon‚Äôt pre judge me for this. I had anxiety my whole life and made a poor decision to do cocaine with some bad friends at the time. Did way too much and my Heart rate spike to 175 bpm. I literally had no control over my thoughts or breathing and was freaking the fuck out. It took me a good 20 mins of meditating to get myself under control, I was so close to calling an ambulance though because I was absolutely terrified. Don‚Äôt sleep for like 3 days after. Not fun.\n\nWas walking back to the office from lunch and almost felt drunk.  Not longer after I had to leave work.  On my way home I was feeling more and more off and I stopped at the ER as my chest was feeling tight.  I walked into the ER and got about half way through how I was feeling and next thing I knew they had me in a wheel chair, in a room, and connected to monitors watching my body.  Found out I had all signs of a heart attack.  Thankfully it was just a panic attack.  I did not realize what I was feeling in the past was smaller panic attacks.  It was eye opening for me.\n\nTook medical cannabis in the hopes it would help my OCD. I'm one of those unlucky ones where it does the exact opposite. Ended up with a panic attack so horrific and all encompassing that it felt like I was dying. I just remember the panic coming in endless waves with the worst dissociation I have ever felt. I ended up going to the ER sure I was having a seizure or something but all they did was give me an Ativan and told me it will pass. It did after about four or five hours. But I got horrible flashback panic attacks with dissociation for months afterward, with the same endless waves of panic for hours. At first multiple times a day, then a few times a week, then about once a month, and finally (thanks to therapy and a new medication regimen) rare. I know cannabis can be helpful for many when it comes to anxiety, but I will never take it again in case it triggers something like that or worse.\n\nMy first one, i woke up and i felt odd, like a floaty feeling, never felt that feeling before, anyway i thought I‚Äôll just make some breakfast and itll pass, made breaky, sat down, took one mouthful, and i had this weird sensation wash over me, my heart started beating out my chest‚Ä¶ i was getting petrified at this point‚Ä¶ i honestly didnt even know what a panic attack was‚Ä¶\n\nI started breathing really fast, i felt like i couldn‚Äôt breathe at all, i was hyperventilating, my hands locked up, my legs went numb‚Ä¶ it was just me at home with my kids, i was thinking in my head (im dying, whos going to care for my kids) i called for the ambulance, i felt like i was going to drop dead. \nMy hands were twisted in, i couldnt move them.\n\nThis day will haunt me forever, i truly thought it was my last day here :(\n\nLast year I pulled over on the side of the road to offer an elderly woman a ride because it was pouring rain &amp; flash flooding in my hometown, and she was ankle deep in water and didn‚Äôt even have an umbrella. She screamed at me in a foreign language and spit in my face. Nothing like that had ever happened to me before and I literally had the worst panic attack, to the point where I called my work and told them I wasn‚Äôt coming in (I had been on my lunch break) and they asked if they needed to call an ambulance for me. All I can say is thank god for my Xanax prescription that day üòî\n\nTwo of many come to mind.\n\nSenior choir recital in college. Couldn't breathe, crying, forgot all the words. All of them! And I thought I was dying!\n\nFirst day of graduate school. Got lost, hyperventilating, threw up in a random trash can, reaaaaally bad GI issues. Still early to class, though lol\n\nThe last one I had a month or so ago. I hadn't been feeling good, we had just moved, and it caused an autoimmune disorder flare up that I am now going through the process of diagnosing. I had also had a trigger or two come up through the last day or two leading up to it. \n\nI was restless that night and felt it coming on so I went to the kitchen and completely broke down. I couldn't breathe. My chest was so tight and hurt. I literally just fell apart. It took me over an hour to calm down and then I was up most of the night recouping from it.\n\nWelp, I invested all of my money into one company and they filed for bankruptcy. I lost 70% in a day. As I‚Äôm explaining it to my girlfriend I ran to the bathroom to throw up twice and for about 5 days was living in a haze. \n\nTook months for it to wear off. \n\n-99.97%\n\nWas at the gym when my face started to tingle (probably from breathing hard). It got worse and worse so I started to panic and thought I was going to die. Friend drove me to the hospital as every part of me started to go numb and tingly. Told my mom I loved her. Doctor told me I was just hyperventilating. Haven't had a panic attack since lmao.\n\nThis was right after an accidental overdose on an ssri. Couldn‚Äôt stand up for 2 days straight, my body was in a constant fight or flight stance and it felt like my heart would explode and I convinced myself I‚Äôd be crippled my whole life. I know this was symptoms of panic and not the overdose itself because beforehand I was fine going to the er just for the STUDENT doctor to tell me I couldn‚Äôt possibly overdose on an ssri and instead had a pulmonary embolism then when I called him dumb and refused his cat scan with contrast he said I was going to die because I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt listen to the professionals‚Äù everything immediately calmed down for me once I got my ekg result saying everything was normal. Just had tachycardia from the meds. Went to a different er and they cleared me with perfect health and reiterated that the other doctor was a moron,. Hope he leaves the profession before he kills someone, I could have died if I had taken more than what I did.\n\nThe only time I was about to call 911 because I thought I was going through serotonin syndrome.  I couldn't get my pupils to contract, so I was seriously going to call an ambulance, but I waited and the panic attack passed, eyes went back to normal.\n\nIt was just embarrassing. It was in Highschool, senior year, after a big marching band competition. I had gotten home at 12, and after a shower and food, I wasn't in bed till 1:30. Then, they wanted us back at school at 7 to put stuff up. It was already a super long week of band and school.\n\nI was putting up a marimba, when my knees just buckled and I started crying, until the crying turned into hyperventilating and I couldn't breathe. I was surrounded by so many band members, who thought I was having a heart attack or something üò≠. The band directors were all freaking out, and it was just a lot. \n\nThough I will say, one of the directors took me into his office, and he really made me feel a lot better, despite how embarrassing the whole thing was. Up to this point, all mental health issues I had kept private, so it was a lot, but he helped.\n\nI was working downtown Chicago. Going home I had to cross Madison St bridge by Mercantile building at rush hour. I started crossing and all of a sudden my heart started beating super fast, then I started sweating and feeling engulfed by people. I had to turn around and lean against a pillar. I calmed down and guessed that I had a panic attack. Was really freaky. That was over 20 years ago. Never had another one that bad! A few lesser ones. I‚Äôm glad it was only that once that bad!\n\nSounds like a good idea missed last week and am definitely feeling it!\n\nAt work. I felt it brew slowly and was frozen in place until I started hyperventilating. I stood up to go get help and made it a few aisles down when I saw my coworkers and when I tried to ask for help I passed out instead. Woke up had to lay down for a while. Went to the doctor. \n\nHonestly afterwards was some of the most at peace I‚Äôve felt. I‚Äôve not passed out again but I‚Äôve gotten close. One thing that helped was having a stuffed animal I could press against my chest when the pressure became too much. I felt so much weight and pressure on my chest all the time that weight and pressure applies by me physically helped to keep me steadier.\n\nHonestly, WORST was on a really high dose of a psychedelic. What was supposed to be a good time turned immediately to raw confusion and panic that i was going to die, and i immediately curled up in the shower and took 1mg of xanax.\n\nAside from that one, i once was going to go buy ciggies with my grandma. We were driving down the road as it started to snow, and then the snow came down harder and harder and i just full panicked. I couldnt breathe, couldnt think, had to call mom and just head home instead without a new pack of cigs, and i curled up on my bed while i calmed down."

    "all_comment_text": "Well rested nights, less alcohol, easily achievable lists, exercise, CBT therapy, breathing exercises, and nature. Not to mention the right circle of friends and partners that don‚Äôt cause more anxiety.\n\n100% this. I'm nearing 50 years old and I finally feel like I have a handle on my anxiety thanks to basically what AuntRen just said. Particularly CBT and staying away from alcohol. I have used antidepressants in the past but nothing really ever stuck with me until I started actually doing the work to get better with weekly therapy, journaling, and some lifestyle changes.\n\nI was genuinely surprised at how effective nature is to mental health treatment. It‚Äôs genuinely the world‚Äôs most effective medicine. \n\nI recommend reading a book named ‚ÄúThe Nature Fix‚Äù\n\nI've gotten myself in this hamster wheel of using alcohol to cope with anxiety. I don't want to be an alcoholic but I feel like I'm already there. It sucks,  I drink alcohol to help anxiety in the moment, but the next day, it worsens it, so I drink more to cope. It's terrible\n\n[deleted]\n\nAlcohol is a depressant. It will also mess with your sleep. You should do your best to replace that with a good habit. Lots of us have spiraled trying to cope with alcohol. You‚Äôre not the only one. Try tea - I know it sounds lame but it will do more for your nerves and hydrate you rather than make you feel like a raisin LOL\n\nI was in that same cycle every day for 3+ years until the anxiety became so vicious, I‚Äôd panic even while drunk. I‚Äôm now 13 months alcohol free and still struggle with anxiety but only if I don‚Äôt get enough exercise or sleep. Sobriety is a life changer for anxiety\n\nI did this. Dont do this lol. Only i was doing opioids also. You feel great while ur high you think. Oh yeah idk what was wrong with me tomorrow im gona be like, feelin gewwd‚òùüèºü•¥and u wake up on the brink of a panic attack and hate everybodyüòÇü§£\n\nIt‚Äôs a never ending loop. The alcohol causes the anxiety to begin with, but we only know how to deal with anxiety through alcohol consumption instead other healthier ways.\n\nCBT made me want to unalive myself. Although helpful for many, it's definitely not the right type of therapy for everyone... DBT saved my life.\n\nI‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt give up and found a better method. We‚Äôre all Goldilocks in the game of life with anxiety. Some porridge is just ick.\n\n[removed]\n\nbreathing exercises and meditation help me a lot. i didn't believe in that before.\n\nMantras are also excellent. Like meditating while repeating a vibrational mantra like ‚ÄòKaruna Hum ‚Äú I think that‚Äôs how to spell it\n\nBut I would add that CBT is by far the most effective in terms of clinical results. So if someone could only do one of those things, CBT would be at the top of that list.\n\nas for exercise I started weightlifting again and that seems to really have helped my anxiety and depression‚Ä¶ although I am still in the three week ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù phase I suspect\n\nI think a lot of this is learning how to really truly recognize triggers of anxiety and identify physical symptoms, so you can properly know when and why you're feeling anxious (or depressed, or whatever).\n\nThen you can work to avoiding triggers like alcohol, doom scrolling, being sedentary, rumination, catastrophizing, etc. (easier said than done, but like all things, practice and time is required).   \n  \nAnd you can learn to address symptoms, knowing when you need to exercise, meditate, do some yoga, call a friend (and know who to call), make plans, clean and organize your room, etc. \n\nI think of it like this: If you are hungry, but you have no concept of hunger, then really all you are feeling is discomfort and pain, and you don't know how to address it. Once you recognize that discomfort as hunger, you have a way to fix it: eat! \n\nIt's hard to identify all the causes of anxiety, but with patience and practice, it is absolutely something you can learn to do. It never goes away, just as hunger never goes away, but it becomes something normal and mundane that is manageable and that you can plan for (just like hunger).\n\nFor me, (and I imagine most people), it means exactly the things you listed!\n\nOh so I'm doing barely any of these lol\n\nI tried CBT but it was just painful and very unpleasant\n\nAgree. I also read books and cross-stitch. Cross stitching requires counting on stitches, which keeps my mind busy from overthinking, and I actually get a huge relief. Plus, choosing bright colors increases mood, like art therapy.\n\nThis is a very good reply. I would add a lot of self talk, meditation (find free in person meditation retreats often offered by Buddhist organizations around), and exposure therapy.\n\nI loved working out, but now I feel panicky when I try to workout, fearing I might run out of air or worse. Have had nasty hard to describe symptoms in the chest area that make it even worse. I want to workout in peace again.\n\nseconded. I get freaked out by the heart rate increase. I just wanna lift without worry :(\n\n&gt;Well rested nights, less alcohol, easily achievable lists, exercise, CBT therapy, breathing exercises, and nature. Not to mention the right circle of friends and partners that don‚Äôt cause more anxiety.\n\nTHIS 100% ALL OF THIS.   \n\n\nI know not all can be achieved at once, but small changes lead to big rewards.\n\nthis is bs\n\nI should start drinking so I can stop drinking and maybe then I will get better\n\n100000%\n\nWell said. I honestly wish I was less stubborn so that CBT would be more effective for me. \n\nNot sure about everyone else?\n\nI highly recomend DBT as well.  Especially if CBT hasn't worked for someone, it may be because they need skills they can learn in DBT in order for CBT to be effective. I was one of those people. My anxiety is still bad but at least I have some understanding and control now so I can (and have) improve.\n\nCock and ball torture?\n\nThis is perfect! Would add yoga, baths, l theanine or St. John‚Äôs wort but otherwise this nails it!\n\nI‚Äôm on the same boat! What are your health anxiety symptoms? My never ending episode started three months ago. I have eye floaters, feel lightheaded all the time, blurry vision, and the MOST ANNOYING one is twitching! I started twitching two months ago. It was in my eye and then moved to cheek and lips. Now I have it in my wrist, legs, hands, stomach. \nI‚Äôve started taking magnesium, b12 and vit d. It‚Äôs only been a couple days so let‚Äôs see. I‚Äôm drowning.\n\nTwitching hell yeah. In my right eyelid. Driving me nuts. Head pressure, fatigue, moodiness, stomach pain and reflux.\n\nI feel all of these and can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm sick have an infection or is this just how I feel all the time.\n\nWhy do we feel head pressure. Is it stomach bloat and gas?\n\nI was under the impression that it is tension from your neck &amp; shoulder muscles, but I‚Äôm curious too\n\nYup. Anyone, please explain?\n I even checked my BP. It wasnt tht high in anxiety, only 140-90. So is it muscles stiffness or gas. As i tried to bend forward it increased a lot.\n\nI get my head pressure at the back left side of my head. It‚Äôs just a tension headache caused from stress\n\ni get really bad head pressure from constantly clenching my neck/jaw without realizing! it got so bad i was clenching in sleep and started getting the worst teeth/jaw pain.\n\nIs your reflux constant 24/7? I have lpr reflux and after all the tests northing found, still suffer 24/7. Can health anxiety really do this???\n\nMy floaters have been driving me insane recently. Idk if it's a new one or if I just noticed it but it's always there now, a little black dot. Made my health anxiety wild, my doctor shrugged it off. And they never go away, it's so annoying. But that's just one small piece of all my health anxiety.\n\nI am also twitching like hell at this moment. A couple of weeks, annoying indeed. My eye floaters skyrocketed in the pandemic and persist.\n\nYes, the twitch isn‚Äôt common for me, but I get the shakes, hard time breathing, pressure in my chest, lightheaded, stomach pain or constipation , hives and itchiness, lack of appetite, dry mouth, headache, blurry vision , slow reactions\n\nHave you checked Ellio Overton s protocol with thiamine?\n\nMy anxiety isn‚Äôt health related but have very similar symptoms! I‚Äôve been accused of being on drugs multiple times when having bad anxiety\n\nYou're telling me that my eye floaters might be because of my anxiety? Well, that sucks\n\nWhen you get twitches like that it's a good sign of magnesium deficiency\n\nI had the most insane tremor in my hands until I started magnesium, now it‚Äôs mostly gone\n\nBananas allegedly help with this!\n\nMake sure your partner is not causing more anxiety!\n\nWhat if it‚Äôs the case ? How do you deal with that ?\n\nYou try to talk it out, if that doesn't work you leave, I guess.\n\nAll I know is good sleep health is the foundation of almost ANYTHING.¬†\n\nWhen I don't get sleep, my anxiety and mood are trash fr\n\nGym. Lift as heavy as you can. Lay off the caffeine or just limit yourself to a couple of coffees a day. I find I get extra anxious if I go over three cups a day. \n\nAlso keep a diary for about a fortnight and log how long your anxiety attacks last. Mine are usually about 10-15 minutes and I know now I can usually ride them out as they‚Äôre pretty short lived. \n\nStop procrastinating as well, this is a huge trigger for me as I‚Äôll cherry pick my work and then panic when something is almost due. I‚Äôve learned to just get it done now.\n\nlexapro, working out, good diet, and time\n\nThis. There isn‚Äôt a one size fits all solution unfortunately. Everyone‚Äôs different, and it‚Äôs not an easy thing to manage‚Ä¶ I tried so many things. Eventually I went to my doctor, tried explaining to him what my day-to-day life was like, and eventually ended up crying near the end. I was prescribed Ativan for panic attacks, and Duloxetine to help manage my everyday anxiety. \n\nI decided on my own that my diet needed an overhaul and started going to the gym 5-6 days a week. Who I was three years ago to who I am today are two very different guys. I‚Äôm glad I did what I did.\n\nIt all depends on what subreddit you ask:\n\nr/psychiatry - medication\n\nr/trees - marijuana \n\nr/exercise - exercise\n\nr/vegan - the vegan diet\n\nWhatever answer you want - you just gotta find the right subreddit.\n\nLüëèEüëèXüëèAüëèPüëèRüëèO\n\n(And all the stuff above - minus going vegan)\n\nTherapy and medication, if needed.\n\n[deleted]\n\nlol the last one for sure\n\nlol\n\nThis is such a subjective question imo. Not one thing works for everyone. For some therapy alone can work, for others, medication is needed. In some cases, antidepressants and therapy is enough. For others, the addition of benzodiazepines is absolutely necessary. Before everyone crucifies me for mentioning some people need benzodiazepines, let me explain. There are some people who absolutely NEED a daily dose of some sort of benzodiazepine daily. Are benzodiazepines dangerous? YES, they have adverse side effects and huge dependency problems. Let‚Äôs address the adverse side effects. The worst of them? Early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs. Now I know Alzheimer‚Äôs is nothing to make short of. But let‚Äôs assume for a moment you‚Äôve tried every last resort and nothing but benzos work for you. You can live a decently ‚Äúlong‚Äù life feeling normal and being able to be a part of society going out and whatnot until one day you get dementia. Let‚Äôs say benzos gave you 30-40 GOOD normal years. The alternative is, if you‚Äôre lucky, you live to 80, and your life has been a living hell crippled with anxiety and never getting to enjoy life‚Äôs best things. I don‚Äôt think I need to elaborate. Next, dependency. This one I find particularly hypocritical. Doctors have absolutely NO qualms with you being on antidepressants until the day you die. So why the hell do they even bring up the issue of dependency? The adverse side effects? See above.\n\nAfter an accident, i started having severe, debilitating panic attacks, and I went on benzos for about 2 years. It was just enough to get my brain to a state where the cognitive behavioral therapy was able to sink in, and I weened myself off of them over the course of 2 months. I can't imagine being on that level of medication for upwards of 30 years, but I agree that everyone is different and what works for some may not work for others. I do believe that benzos should be a last resort though. They are no joke.\n\nADHD medication because ADD seems to be at the root of my anxiety and depression problems\n\nI'm only diagnosed ADHD and my Psychiatrist from the get go told me the disease seems to present as everything else esp with high functioning individuals hence a lot of late diagnoses for those of us who are internally hyper.\n\nCutting out caffeine HELPS (the withdrawal increase anxiety, depression, and irritability!) when you can get past the shitty withdrawals your body creates the energy that is MADE for it and it‚Äôs the purest energy and it fixed my anxiety much of my depression and lots of my procrastination DISAPPEARED it was awesome\n\n(Unless u have ADHD)\n\nGentle exposure to what makes you anxious and slowly realizing that what you fear isn‚Äôt a threat.\n\nSir with it. Embrace it. Sit in discomfort train your brain to realize that it can‚Äôt hurt or kill yoy and eventually you‚Äôre brain ignores it and you go back to living life\n\nHas this ever worked on anyone ?\n\nYes I read the dare book and It really taught me a lot it has helped me to realize you just have to go with it.\n\nWhat book is that? I googled it and the only one I found was an ‚Äòerotic novel‚Äô\n\nIt‚Äôs called dare\n\nThank you I‚Äôll see if I find online version and check it out\n\nI cured myself from daily and nightly panic attacks using ‚Äòacceptance‚Äô in a few days\n\nExactly! Those words like ‚Äúembrace it‚Äù has never work. Avoid stressful environments like type of work places, relationships, follow your medications, exercise, etc to have a better control over it.\n\nJust wanted to say that avoidance is not a good way to overcome anxiety, it reinforces the anxiety. Obviously stressful situations are different but those of us who suffer with anxiety find everything stressful sometimes and avoiding basic and normal things is a big no no. That's how I became agoraphobic. Now I'm going on 3 years panic attack free.\n\nSeeing as I cured myself from daily and nightly panic attacks from embracing the anxiety, fear, and panic, I‚Äôd beg to differ!\n\nIt‚Äôs literally the highest proven remedy for anxiety. Go read my latest 2 post in r/Anxiety and r/AnxietyHelp\n\nThat was actually very helpful and it did give me hope, thank you so much I will try to apply it till I get used to it, God bless you\n\nSure did for me. I embrace the impending doom and make peace üíÄ\n\nYes, it has!\n\nYes!! It‚Äôs like your own exposure therapy. I tried this, I talk back to my anxiety, I feel it, I embrace it, I know it‚Äôs temporary, and I am not nearly as afraid anymore\n\nIs that the same as exposure therapy?\n\nExposure is part of it. But it‚Äôs mainly about changing how you feel about anxiety. ¬†\n\nLearning about it on a chemical level really helped me. Just knowing the ins and outs of it really was a game changer.\n\nWhenever I try to do this my symptoms become way worse\n\nGotta embrace the suck! It‚Äôs SO HARD at first but it gets better trust me\n\nYou really think so?\n\nThis. Therapy can help a ton to understand yourself better and accept the feelings as just feelings. Doing one thing a day that scares you helps your body get used to that just because you have those fight or flight feelings, doesn‚Äôt mean you need to do anything with them and that most the time nothing bad happens despite the feeling. \n\nThat plus exercise, nutrition, and being in a supportive environment help lesson the feelings.\n\nMedication and supplements can work but they unfortunately can be crutches that your body adapts to.\n\nThis. Works for me. Not that it cured me forever, I have to keep applying it and sometimes it's almost impossible, but it is so far the most effective strategy.\n\nThis morning I had a panic attack, and almost couldn't go to work. I got on the couch and focused only on what I'm feeling: really, just feeling. So no attention to scary thoughts ('I'm dying!!) or judgment ('I'm such a loser'): only to feelings and physical sensations. 10 mins later I was ready to go to work (but shaky and tired though ;-) \n\nAnd no, I cannot always do this, but if I can, it works like a charm!\n\nSleep and exercise.\n\nI guess exercise and a good lifestyle is still the most effective thing for anxiety. Good sleep, good diet and staying active. My anxiety is ruining my life, my vision and I'm obsessed over my health. I'll try to make a big change in my lifestyle and we'll see\n\nYes staying active and sweating outside helps me a lot too. Raining days stuck inside are the worst. \n\nBest of luck to you.\n\nEnough sleep, sunny house, nature, medicine, writing, hobby,\n\nFor me I take Zoloft and it helps tremendously\n\nI felt like a zombie on it of course I only gave it a week.\n\nA week is nowhere near enough to see how you respond to an antidepressant. You should at least try it for 1-2 months to see results.\n\nMy first month on Sertraline (Zoloft) was HORRIBLE. All of my symptoms sky-rocketed. After the first month, it gradually got so much better. I don‚Äôt even have attacks anymore.\n\nAny side effects at all?\n\nI had lots of mild side effects in the first month - increased anxiety, jaw clenching etc. Now I don‚Äôt really have any left, except for slightly lower libido. But it‚Äôs nowhere near how Prozac made me completely lose the ability to be aroused.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy, exposure therapy and exercise\n\nMusic!!\n\nCBT gave me my life back and EMDR was just the cherry on top. I agree with so many others. Good group of supportive friends and/or family. List of good quality sleep. Less caffeine and less alcohol.\n\nZoloft!\n\nEveryone is different but for me, a combination of very gentle exposure therapy plus self-acceptance really helps.¬†\n\n\nAnxiety makes me very avoidant, and periodically that snowballs into housekeeping trouble (bills unpaid because I can't bear to look at them; no more contact lenses because I am avoiding thr eye doctor; etc).¬†\n\n\nStaying on top of all that stuff makes me anxious, but falling behind on it is even worse for my mental health. So I have to keep up as best as I can, without beating myself up or getting overwhelmed.\n\n\nSimilarly, I often have to force myself to socialize with new people, go to new places, and do other things that scare me, because my anxiety gets much worse when I let myself hide away.\n\nLess alcohol did wonders for me.\n\nPropranolol for me. But also im taking mirtazapine at night.\n\nPropranolol has been doing wonders for me, even just at 10mg.\n\nHow‚Äôs Mirtazapine working for you? The doctor recently increased the dosage to 30mg and I‚Äôve felt worse ever since. I‚Äôm guessing I need to give it time?\n\nYes Mirt takes time to build up, so id give it more time...i only take 7.5mg of Mirtazapine to help me with sleep because i have hard time sleeping on my anticonvulsant.\n\nPreventative maintenance\n\nExercise, mindfulness, therapy and medicine when it was worst.\n\nNow I keep it at a tolerable level with exercise and mindfulness. Exercise just keeps a balance in my body. When my mental and physical energy levels doesn't match it gives me bad anxiety (and also makes my depression show it's face).\n\nMindfulness for me is being aware and kind to myself when I'm starting to have anxiety thoughts and when my physical symptoms shows up. I acknowledge my thoughts are happening, but I don't let them control my actions because I'm aware that they are irational. I can't control my physical reactions, so again it's an acknowledgement of how my body is feeling but mindfully focusing on not letting it affect my concious thoughts. So it is all a focus on not letting my anxiety control me and acting on my anxiety. Because doing that will teach your body and brain that anxiety over an irational thing is valid. I had really bad social anxiety, I couldn't leave my appartment. Shopping was done last minute before the store would close as the pressure of having to do shopping before the shop closed was the only thing that could get me out. Now I just have average social anxiety, I worry about tons of stuff and can sometimes have a hard time getting out of the door to new things, but I almost always go and actually have fun.\n\nThe biggest one for me that has made the most impact in my day to day, has been caffeine. Apparently I‚Äôm just super sensitive to it (as well as to medicines, etc.) and significantly decreasing my intake has been a real eye opener for me.\n\nFor me it was a change of my medication (Lexapro to Zoloft) and beginning therapy with a psychologist. The Zoloft was slowly increased from 25mg to my current 100mg (which I just started) and I've noticed with each increase once it takes effect the breakthrough anxiety I sometimes get is less intense and doesn't last as long. \n\nAnd my psychologist has given me some good tools for managing the anxiety when it does happen.\n\nEating one L-theanine pill before bed everyday for two months\n\nSSRI\n\nXanax\n\nGood question. Regarding me, wich I'm pretty sure I have a mild to severe anxiety - a forever present feeling of discomfort, wich skyrockets wherever I'm confronting the main trigger : social activities, mainly speaking to several people at the same time, dating, speaking with someone I have a crush on... although I've never had a serious attack, a few episodes maybe in all my life, mainly in the last years, more accurately the last 3 months, because I fell in love... lol \n\nAnyway, exercise and a good diet are incredible tools, but speaking for me, they didn't change or halt the never ending anxiety wich has plagued my life since I was a child. I refuse taking medication, due to the fear of becoming ever-dependent of meds, with the structural causes of my anxiety not becoming adressed. \n\nSo probably I would say CBT might be the best chance of someone who doesn't want meds, but want an effective and long lasting change. This anxiety level is just crippling.\n\nFor me personally CBT wasn‚Äôt the best. I done hypno therapy and i have to say it was the best thing i have ever done, expensive in the UK but helped me out with anxiety/panic! It certainly runs a lot deeper than i thought!\n\nI could go on and on about all of the things I do! Right now what‚Äôs working for me is taking care of my body and identifying my anxiety symptoms when they come on. Routine during my day is super important and I realize that not everyday is a win. I also suffer from crippling health OCD and it is no joke - especially since I have POTS and MCAS which are real health issues. Yesterday I sat in the bathtub having horrible panic attack after panic attack, and today I had an amazing anxiety-free day üòÖ I‚Äôm going to appreciate today and use yesterday as a learning moment. Healing has been a process for me and NOT linear at all, but I‚Äôm getting through. We are seriously badasses for getting through this. It is NOT for the weak!\n\nIt might behoove you to look into gut microbiome health. MCAS, POTS, and mental health conditions have been shown by new research to have a causal role in these conditions. I developed them after screwing up my gut health, and am slowly digging myself out of that hole.\n\nDo you think the MCAS could be triggering the anxiety?\n\nI don‚Äôt think it is the main cause of my anxiety, but it definitely triggers it. My MCAS only flares up when I‚Äôm stressed/anxious\n\nHot baths give me panic attacks (have pots) as it causes vasodilation\n\nGood question but I know exercise &amp; keeping busy enough to not think about it too much gets me through the day.\n\nI sit with it i accept it and talk to it, it‚Äôs a scared little me how had a life of traumatic experiences, this explains why most of us have different forms of anxieties. Let it be don‚Äôt engage with it anxiety love attention if you ignore it while doing the work of course it‚Äôs not going to be gone because we all need anxiety in our life  it save me more time then i can count  specially with addiction. The thing we focus on always gets bigger\n\nL-theonine helps as did stopping my coffee caffeine intake.\n\nLexapro. Well the knock off version escitalopram. I feel much better overall. The constant running scenarios in my head finally shut up. Also suggest a multi vit. It's hard to eat properly sometimes and get all our nutrition.\n\nFor health anxiety, exposure non-response is probably the best treatment for most people. A mental health professional can help you plan this, but the Anxious Truth has a great YouTube channel and Facebook group covering the basics for free. \n\nExercise is also great because it is generally good for your mind but also it brings about bodily sensations that people with health anxiety are usually nervous about. So it doubles as exposure nonresponse. \n\nDon‚Äôt google symptoms\n\nI want to double on this about Google. For fhe love of all that's holy, DON'T Google symptoms especially if you have health anxiety as is. I learned this the very hard way\n\nYes! It‚Äôs the first thing most therapists will tell you. \n\nIt‚Äôs a form of checking behavior, which is awful with mental health.\n\nSleep and exercise. \n\nI hate this answer so much but it's the only thing that works.\n\nOh, and less caffeine, good luck with that one.\n\nFor me, I feel like good diet/exercise/deep breathing really works (and that seems pretty universal). I do 10 minutes morning and evening of deep breathing and it‚Äôs a bit like meditating. Exercise (cardio) seems to help the most. When I‚Äôm at my natural weight and don‚Äôt have bloating and sugar rushes I definitely feel like a less anxious person. No coffee/alcohol/tobacco, obviously.\n\nFor me personally, lexapro has been a blessing. I just rarely feel anxious now. It truly has made my day to day life much much more comfortable and less anxious. The other thing is booze. Drinking a little to moderate amount doesn‚Äôt matter. Drinking to the point that I‚Äôll have a hangover can still bring me down, but not even close to hangovers before lexapro.\n\nLexapro. ++++++ best long term treatment for anxiety \nMagn√©sium, Om√©ga 3, Vit C and D\nValerian root and lemon balm and chamomile \nExercise +++++ - Sunlight - Walking on the beach- Reconnecting with loved ones, SOMATIC RELEASE exercise ‚Ä¶ I was so anxious before I wished to die. Now white all of this i‚Äôm happier than ever\n\nHonestly for me it would be good physical health. With that you can be happy no matter what, no matter how much you earn. And the occasional sadness or grief or worry, will remain occasional and pass. Of course I would add onto that spirituality and your connection with God, but that's a whole another thing.\n\nPain Reprocessing Therapy - check out the pain psychology center website about this - they‚Äôre in California, but therapists in various states can get certified\n\ni stopped alcohol, smoking weed. i started keeping a clean room, healthy sleep schedule, a daytime schedule, and LOTS of self reassurance. some of this may be hard (such as keeping a clean room) if you depression but just try your best!! and don‚Äôt sleep with anything in your bed! just your blankets and pillows\n\nedit to add: also medication and therapy!!!! i HATED the idea of starting anxiety medication but my life is so much more manageable with it! it genuinely saved my life. therapy isn‚Äôt a good fit for everyone but DEFINITELY worth a try. i hope everything improves for you&lt;3 i know how draining it can be. so so proud of you for reaching out for help.\n\nCitalopram (Celexa). Zoloft didn‚Äôt work for me but citalopram is and it‚Äôs wonderful. I still have work to do but proper medication has been key for me.\n\nFor me it was: Iron infusions (if low iron deficiency can cause anxiety, but iron is one of those things you can only take if you are deficient), b12, magnesium, herbs (work with herbalist). Lots of deficiencies can cause anxiety or make it much worse. \n\nAlso- Acupuncture (only if you go consistently- price is low if you live in a city and there is a school nearby with a student clinic, or there might be a sliding scale community clinic). Lots of exercise (very effective). Good sleep (when you can- no pressure on yourself when you can‚Äôt). Lots of time outside and in nature. And in general doing things you find fun. Doing things that you feel you have to and don‚Äôt want to, including seeing people, going to events, etc- make it worse. Try to avoid that as much as you are able. Get comfortable with saying no, when asked and also at the last minute if you‚Äôre not feeling it. \n\nIn addition, EMDR therapy for trauma, talk therapy for becoming honest with self, including about what life changes you need to make to create a world that you feel yourself fit into. Including people- make sure you only have good good people around your inner circle (and hopefully all your circles, but if you can‚Äôt control those, the inside one is the most important)- cut out those that you don‚Äôt feel good around. Trust your body and anxiety response about people- be around those you nourish and uplift you- not those you feel you have be put on fronts or prove yourself around. \n\nFor me anxiety was a lot to do with deficiencies and health issues, and another part with life/lifestyle that I wasn‚Äôt happy with. Dealing with those two really helped me. I started thinking of it as a symptom of living a life that didn‚Äôt work for me- like it was there because I was living out of balance with myself and that the path to resolving it would be to make the changes I need to make. That helped me. Finding a way to conceptualize why it is there that works for you, is also is very powerful. People can be very pushy about their views of what it is, but take that one and make it your own. They can think what they think, you think what you do. Feeling empowered is also very healing.\n\nI stopped vaping stopped coffee/most caffeine make sure all vitamins and minerals are up to par and storing well in your body! And after all of that I take Zoloft to knock the rest of the edges off it helps a ton for me everyone is different though! It makes my brain feel calm and quiet but not in a spaced out way and doesn‚Äôt make me feel like a zombie like most meds.\n\nExercise \n\nRegular sleep, and enough of it \n\nGood diet \n\nCutting out stimulants (coffee, nicotine) \n\nNo alcohol and no drugs. \n\nMost people that struggle with anxiety, have problems with the five points mentioned above, and are not willing to fix them\n\nMartial arts and hiit training has saved me from\nSevere generalized anxiety! Med free for 7 years noq.\n\nGet plenty of sleep, eat well, and take time to think about your anxiety. Think about the physical world around you and try to identify what from it your brain might see as a threat. If you can't identify anything, it's probably just in your head, and you can try to talk yourself down from there. Also recognize that nutrition can have an effect. I recently realized that sugar can increase anxiety (something to do with a drop in blood sugar). I have a sugar problem, and I am now able to recognize that if my anxiety is really bad in the morning it‚Äôs because I ate too much sugar the night before. Rationalizing anxiety can help a lot, as well as medication and/or therapy.\n\nExercise, sleep, diet, purpose.\n\nA good work-life balance. I literally‚Äîcannot stress this enough. I just left a toxic workplace and my heartburn and insomnia are almost totally gone. I don‚Äôt think I could ever do 4, 8 hour shifts a week in service industry again. It just doesn‚Äôt allow me enough time for myself. It‚Äôs like I would be drained at the end of my shift and stay drained throughout the week‚Äînever replenishing. Sleep, therapy, and going outside are also helpful. Having financial stability is probably the best for anxiety though.\n\nCombination of medication and CBT. Good diet and exercise for me, although it didn't fix my anxiety, did help a significant amount as well\n\nMedically speaking it's a combination of sertraline and CBT therapy according to my doctor. Otherwise sleep, proper diet, exercise and not too many stimulants like alcohol etc. \n\nI've had a severy case of health anxiety this year. Sertraline and cbt did wonders, now i'm trying to incorporate a more healthy lifestyle.\n\nMedication\n\nQuetiapine 25mg at night works almost too well.\n\nBreathing techniques do wonders!\n\nSsri and cbt\n\nGetting out in nature, journaling to find out what‚Äôs causing anxiety and what your triggers are\n\nIf you cant muster a lifestyle overhaul or access good therapy at this juncture, Zoloft was annoyingly effective in treating my anxiety. I discontinued after a year because of sexual side effects but I fondly remember not being worried about having undiagnosed MS or a plane crashing into my house. Good times.\n\nI feel for all of you......my severe health and generalized anxiety on top of atrial fibrillation.....fast and irregular heart beat.....not fun at all ....gassy, bloaty , hyperventilating.....on meds...I have had 2 ablations....so even though this isn't a Afib forum, it's part of my anxiety.....üò≥üò≥üò≥üòßüòßüòß\n\nWeed, sleep, support system, self-care, nature\n\nTherapy + medication.  Medication can help quickly, and there is some evidence that SSRIs allow the brain to be more plastic and more easily accept the learnings and changes good therapy can provide. Therapy can produce long lasting effects through changing thought patterns as well as learning coping techniques, whereas unless anxiety is caused by an acutely stressful situation that is short lived, any positive impacts of medication alone will evaporate once the meds are stopped.\n\nSecond to that, consistent lifestyle changes can be very impactful including getting enough quality sleep, avoiding caffeine, alcohol &amp; other drugs, exercise &amp; outdoor time, and having a supportive network of family/friends and satisfying social interactions.\n\nMagnesium Glycinate has helped me so much. It took a month or two to see the benefits, but I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack in like 4 months now. I was having them weekly before. It‚Äôs helped tone down my nervous system and ability to handle stress.\n\nLifestyle - nutrition, exercise, sleep, meditation, coping strategies, etc. Sucks - I feel like I have to work so much harder than everyone else to stay sane.\n\nFasting is the only cure for my anxiety, whenever I am back to normal eating habit , anxiety will follow right after\n\nTherapy and meds. Heavy on the therapy!!!\n\nso i will tell you as mental health provider and health anxiety sufferer. whatever you choose please stick to it. you will feel its killing you or you are having every side effects or your anxiety is worse and believe me it will get better and one day you will be like \" Wow, it was so crazy how anxious i was\"\n\nI would recommend Prozac 10000% best medicine ever\n\nGetting to the root cause and supporting the patient until you can do that\n\nBreathing, mindfulness, radical acceptance, exposure therapy.  I guess that's somewhat to address the long term trauma associated with anxiety.\n\nRunning x\n\nI'm on medication which helps but every so often I'll have a day where I'm more anxious than usual and taking 200-300mg of shrooms helps a ton. Keep in mind this is ever so slightly more than a microdose but I have a high tolerance because of my meds.\n\nMy personal fix was to choose a belief system that addresses the fears, and to aggressively face everything head on. \n\nI passed out during a blood draw for real, then kept feeling like it would happen again. I was freaked out, but decided to say fuck that, I‚Äôm not adding a new thing to this. \n\nI run often, but I kept stopping and sitting down because I was scared I was gonna faint and hit my head. I said out loud ‚Äúno, I‚Äôll die before I give into fear anymore. I will finish this run or I‚Äôll crack my skull on the concrete and die trying. ‚Äú \n\nThere was a point during the run where I was certain that was it, I was going down. My blood ran cold and vision got fuzzy. I said out loud, probably looking like a psycho ‚ÄúDO IT. IM READY.‚Äù.  The feeling melted away. I finished the run. Have never felt faint since. \n\nThen I applied that all my existing triggers and they just all went away.\n\nFor me it‚Äôs 8 hours of sleep each night, working out (running outside or swimming), eating regularly &amp; Prozac\n\nProzac for me. Never felt better\n\nRelaxation training, exposure desensitization therapy, stress reduction, problem solving, cognitive therapy, trauma reprocessing.\n\nSleep, Challenging the thoughts you have, often times what we feel is out of our control is actually able to be rationalized naturally. pen and paper :)\n\nSleep and exercise and structuring the day in a way that makes you comfortable I suppose \n\nPersonally I wouldn‚Äôt be here without my meds but that‚Äôs just me\n\nThe top 3:\n\nSertraline (an SSRI) made life manageable and bearable for me when I simply could not handle the day to day. \n\nCounselling and therapy (CBT/ACT) honestly wasn't that great for me. My work paid for a breathwork and qi gong course which really helped. \n\nThe biggest thing for me was exercise, specifically running and yoga. I feel so much more balanced for doing both regularly.\n\nTreating B12 deficiency or vitamin d deficiency. For me I have both in my anxiety was much worse now that I've treated both it's still pretty bad but it is definitely better and my depression is also not as bad. Also like others have said make sure that you're getting adequate nutrition, plenty of sleep and doing things that make you feel good whether it be a cup of tea or movies or what not. And I know it sounds cliche but try to think positive thoughts and imagine good things happening to you. I've also had to reduce my coffee intake because it was making me have panic attacks\n\nI have severe anxiety regardless of alcohol and it causes me so many stomach issues that I couldn't drink much even if I wanted to. It has significantly interfered with my career and been debilitating at times. Breathing exercises and meditation helped a lot at one point but not so much lately. I'm always looking for new tools. The Headspace meditation series on Netflix and podcasts like Chasing Life, The Anxious Achiever, and Fail Better have helped me quite a bit. It's nice to finally have a place to share with others who understand.\n\nI completely relate to you! My anxiety is also usually health based! I haven‚Äôt found exactly the most agreed upon treatment bc I‚Äôm still suffering. However, my anxiety meds have helped me greatly, so much so that my INTRUSIVE suicidal thoughts disappeared and my panic attacks have been slightly less. I‚Äôm on a medication called Zoloft. But I also think good sleep/rest also helps and trying to eat on a healthy ‚Äúdiet‚Äù.\n\nExercise and prioritizing sleep 10000%. NOT googling everything. Not drinking to excess. Accepting that some people add to it and putting up boundaries. Self-awareness is key. Or so the case has been for me. Also, write that shit down.\n\nWillingness is key, otherwise it can be a uphill battle.\n\nTake a break from whatever is addicting. In most cases, social media &amp; technology. Track it for 3 months &amp; see how you feel.\n\nThe unwinding anxiety app I got a lot out of\n\nCbt therapy\n\nCBT I do a version called REBT I also incorporate existential therapy or logotherapy and mindfulness\n\nhydroxyzine, my beloved. 99% of my anxiety attacks are just physical symptoms without anything making me consciously anxious behind them, so therapy doesn‚Äôt do a whole lot for me there because the only problem to solve is biological (I‚Äôm still in therapy to deal with other aspects of my mental health though, don‚Äôt come for me). hydroxyzine is a godsend for me when my heart rate spikes, I can‚Äôt sleep, I feel jittery, etc. Plus the other stuff people have said like getting good sleep, that‚Äôs huge!\n\nWhat worked best for me are breathing techniques and stuff. If noise or crowds sets you off, try earplugs. They make great reusable earplugs designed for neurodivergence now, and they can be worn indefinitely with no loss of comfort or function.\n\nMy anxiety has more of a medical cause, so I also have a low dose beta blocker to essentially prevent my heart rate from getting high to begin with.\n\nBut removing yourself from stressful relationships and situations certainly helps.\n\nI have health anxiety. Lexapro and CBT is the only thing that helped."

It's my brain's way of coping when my body isn't adjusting to my anxiety. It actually really helps.\n\nI've started paying attention to this. i disassociated A LOT A when I was a kid. i guess it more or less stopped up until recently. it does help, but i feel like it's an overall negative behavior for myself. i don't know, I need to learn more about it I guess.\n\nYeah I used to live in pretty much constant dissociation as a teenager. It was awful. Then one day it stopped. Now I only get it when my anxiety is bad.\n\nI dissociate mid conversation aswell\n\nI also have this problem now and didn‚Äôt make the connection that it may be my anxiety. Thanks for pinpointing. The scary thing is I look engaged to the other person and I might even be making eye contact, nodding as if I‚Äôm listening‚Ä¶ and then I have to ask awkwardly, ‚Äúerm excuse me can you repeat from where you said‚Ä¶.‚Äù üò™\n\nBetter than me friend, I can't maintain eye contact to save my life.¬† My anxiety actually makes me overcompensate and make a lot of mistakes.\n\nUgh this happens to me alllll the time and I‚Äôm so socially awkward because of it\n\nHow do you get past the shaking and like time moving really fast?\n\nI don't get shaking and time moving fast with mine. I just feel like I'm not here if you get what I mean. That I'm watching myself from the outside.\n\nOkay for me its like i feel numb but really shakey and its like i dont care anymore but im focused sorta but its like im still moving really slow like im underwater or sonething\n\nI guess it's different for everyone. That sounds scary though.\n\nOh wow. I kinda figured it was the same for everone but yeah i was shaking at work so bad and i couldnt move any faster than i was and it felt like my chest was going to explode or something and i powered through but i was dead tired and just didnt care anymore afterwards\n\nAre you a member of the \"Dissociated Alumni\"?\n\nI prefer the Dissociation Association\n\nI don't feel like I am alive 95% of the time for many years. How am I functioning is a mystery.\n\nALL THE TIME\n\nWhat does dissociate mean here please?\n\nLife feels like a dream. Like dejav√∫. Scary honestly\n\nHow does dissociation feel like?\n\nI get anxiety spikes, where i become both irritated and anxious. Alcohol calms me down, but recently i have been drinking way too much. My doc does not pescribe me benzos (probably because i tried to kill myself 3 times) and insists that i keep taking abilify.\n\nAlcohol calms my anxiety too, then I wake up the next day and it hits like a mac truck\n\nThat's the process im going through now of NOT dealing with the mac truck... oh shit, that's called alcoholism...\n\nAlcohol is one of the most brutal double edged swords for mental health. Be well friend, we all got our battles.\n\nThats why i had to quit treating my anxiety.with alcohol. The rebound anxiety, gross feeling and depressio n from it was just not working for me\n\nRecovering alcoholic here. One of my favorite quotes:\n\n\n\"Drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow\"¬†\n\n\nHangovers are awful and they get worse and worse.¬†\n\nAlcohol calms me down too but makes my anxiety 1000 percent worse the next day. Currently, I‚Äôll have an antihistamine. Makes me drowsy but takes the anxiety away.\n\n[removed]\n\nYes, one time they gave me a hydroxizine at the hospital. It‚Äôs basically an allergy pill. They do help.\n\nPlease stop drinking. Alcohol is a anaesthesia to panic and anxiety but they come later and harder back to the surface. I invite you to read Reddit\n\nr/stopdrinking\n\nWeed was the only thing to help with my anxiety.\n\nAbilify is so far the only drug that did elevate my mood but it also put a ceiling on it. I was baseline happier than without, but couldn‚Äôt really feel any real joy. \n\nDid nothing at all for my anxiety. \n\nUltimately discontinued due to joylessness and insomnia.\n\nIt barely helps with my anxiety spikes too. My emotions are blunted, feel like zombie while on it. Same can be said about other antipsychotics that i tried.\n\nHave you had your thyroid, checked? Or, tested for MTHFR gene (folate deficiency with inability to process folic acid to folate causing a build up of folic acid)? Also, have you been tested for nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, amino acids,  deficiencies, or excess)? Off the top of my head, I know these are some issues that can bring about symptoms of and cause mental illness as well as pseudo mental illness such as anxiety, suicidal ideation, nervous system challenges, e.g. \n\nA quick search of various deficiencies of various nutrients relative to anxiety and / or suicidal ideation can cause can be found. You may  need to include search the term comprehensive list of_________ that can cause A, B, C.\n\nSomething else to consider that can cause various symptoms of mental illness, and depression, includes regular vitamin B6. Bioavailble form of Vitamin B6 / P-5-P is needed by many unable to metabolize the non  bioactive form, which can also cause symptoms of depression.\n\nI've had em all checked.    And I thought it was a b12 deficiency.   Everything in my blood and mris and anything I get are green light.  Folate was good too.  So the question is how did I make it to age 37 and have a panic attack so bad that here in 2024 I'm not even able to work.   I'm completely devastated and lost about this.   Of course all the people I see say is.. mehh typical person needs ssris or whatever.   When they don't even give two shits I've lost 80 pounds in 6 months recently because I couldn't even eat for days and I am literally in fesr of everything.\n\nFuck abilify. Honestly been there.. two weeks ago I ended up in the ER for 1.5 days off a 32 gram bender and a razor blade in my jugular.\n\nFuck antipsychotics in general. I want my emotions and metabolism back.\n\nfuck, me too.\n\nEvery day, sometimes multiple times per hour, usually at least once per hour.\n\nmy kinda guy, same bro. fuck, sucks don't it?\n\nOh big time! And this is after a long and successful stint of CBT. I'd hate to see what I'd be like without that! \nWhile it's still basically ALL THE DAMN TIME, I feel so much more well equipped to deal with it. 1 day at a time.\n\ndamn, how was the CBT?.. I waited two years to get into a program but I had switched jobs and worked fulltime in a factory, couldn't make the meetings, so they kicked me out. Now I'm on a 2 year waitlist, to get back ONTO the waitlist ( 2 years)\n\nThat's ridiculous! \nIt was the best thing I ever did. Even my wife says so. She noticed a difference after the first 5 or 6 weeks. It's not that it \"fixes\" you. It gives you the tools to better understand YOU and why you have the anxiety and why it does what it does. It teaches you the techniques you need to combat it and stop it from completely taking over.\n\nVery interesting, that's awesome though, great to hear!\n\nI wish you similar success if not more üôè\n\n[deleted]\n\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\n\nI have anxiety 24/7 365\n\n366 on leap years!\n\nI say that exact phrase every time someone asks me if i get breaks from my anxiety. Lol\n\nwelcome to the club brother\n\nTo the point of depersonalization\n\nConstant overthinking/paranoia about my constant overthinking/paranoia!!!\n\nit never ends.\n\nDo you have a job dealing with people a lot? I have anxiety and find it very hard to interact with others now.\n\nI thankfully work from home and only need to type to other people.. other than 3 short meetings a week.\n\nSo much so that it caused me to drop from 170lbs to 110 lbs in 5 months and I couldn‚Äôt leave my home without sobbing so hard I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Multiple 30mjn-1 hour panic attacks a day. No fight only flight.\n\n:( Hugs\n\nhugssss\n\nI don‚Äôt even know how I am alive at this point\n\ni empathize with this ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nMine varies, sometimes it will be under control pretty good for a year or so. Right now it's a mess and I'm scared or at least worrying about 95% of the time I'm awake.¬†\n\nI feel you man, I unfortunetly have been the on and off type.. its been a spinning cyclone of nightmares for 17 years. but I'm sorry you're going through that, hugggggsssssssss\n\nHow much anxiety do you have?\n\nEnough\n\nToo. Damn. Much. On a good day, I won‚Äôt be spiraling every 5 minutes and it‚Äôs maybe every 10. Jump from one disaster or perceived catastrophe to the next.\n\nI feel that hard\n\nI swear it‚Äôs like I figure one thing out and then I‚Äôm hit in the face with the hundreds of other anxious thoughts that are waiting to fucken play\n\nThe older I got the less anxious I was, the past year I‚Äôve been anxiety free. I spent over a decade going to therapy weekly, right up until my therapist retired at 85 years of age. Therapy and mindfulness are what I credit with freeing myself from anxiety. I didn‚Äôt want my anxiety to become neurotic suffering, that‚Äôs the trap many people have fallen into: identifying with their anxiety and it becoming their identity. Once anxiety is who you are then veering away from it is veering away from your identity and very difficult to do. You tend to wallow in all of the various ways to control or manage anxiety versus finding a way to eliminate anxiety as an identity. It is hard work, can take a long time and the only way to truly see the results is retrospectively so the glacial pace of change can be discouraging. There are no shortcuts and YOU have to take every painful step yourself. Or not. You can just stay where you are, it‚Äôs your choice.\n\nAt this point anxiety has me\n\nOof, I feel this!\n\nI‚Äôm constantly worried every day \\:)\n\nA lot of days I don‚Äôt feel real either. Like everything around me is just out of reach. Like in a film.\n\n3 anxieties\n\nvaries with life events for sho\n\nAll of them\n\nI constantly feel like a prey animal being chased by an apex predator and have had to manually breathe for days on end a few times\n\nI have the bad comedown with my ADHD meds, lack of sleep also gives me the blues, Alcohol as well. I am not sure I have anxiety outside of this &amp; complex grief. \n\nJust too many things going wrong, work stress etc. All I know is that pre-COVID I was a very confident over achiever. Which is when all this things started. I couldn't even go back to work full time, cause I went into a few weeks coma &amp; had a few seizures. Non of it ever explained even after 24 hour monitoring. \n\nI thing I am more scared than anxious of the would‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôm currently overthinking on how to answer your question.

I scheduled a meeting tomorrow.\" Wish me luck y'all\n\nIt's terrible. I'm talking about anxiety that gives you physical symptoms for 24/7. Also I tend to disconnect from reality a lot. A lot of dissociation, constantly feeling on edge, exhaustion, body aches, paranoia, impending doom. List goes on...\n\nI constantly have a feeling like something terrible is about to happen. Just wake up? It's there. Doing a calming activity? It's there. The threat is always there waiting to blow up my little world.\n\nsafari is probably my most used app. i‚Äôm a pro googler. going to a restaurant? i‚Äôm googling the menu. my neck hurts? googling meningitis. about to use a big word? googling to make sure i‚Äôm using it right.\n\nhow do I rate it\n\nEnough\n\nUp and down and derealization that sucked so bad in the past.\n\nDepends on the day, some are better, some aren't.

My mailbox gets close to overflowing.  I imagine that it is a bill that I can‚Äôt pay.  I especially hate mail from the government.  It could be a bill from my municipality.  I tend to castrophize my problems.  My worries are usually harmless.  I am negative most of the time when I am anxious.  I misplace items like my keys and wallets which makes my anxiety spike.  I also doubt that I have turned off the stove, etc.  So I have to go back home to check that everything is okay.  I also have to count up to eight as a ritual to ensure that I locked my door.  I have OCD as well.  No wonder that OCD is nicknamed the ‚Äúdoubting disease.‚Äù  In other words, you can‚Äôt trust yourself and your memories.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10,  11.\n\nAlways\n\nI‚Äôm in class rn scared to eat because I can hear my chewing inside my head, every single noise my mouth/body makes and the package of the food is sososo loud to me\n\nOn a scale of 1-10... 7.89... üòã\n\nAll of it.\n\nToo much üòÖ\n\nI worry if i have too much anxiety or if im just faking it all.\n\nI have it constantly.

It takes 4 or 5 times of standing up off the couch before my brain lets me move.\n\nAll day every day.¬†\n\nmostly all of it. lol.\n\nAll of it.\n\nToo much.\n\nPretty bad. I'm on antidepressants (Trintillex), and 2mg clonazepam and 2mg Ativan daily. But I also have breast cancer so I think my anxiety is justified, lol. But I have always been anxious, since I was a kid. Only now at 30 did I get on meds.\n\nSometimes at the evening from loneliness, so just sleep it over or drown it in beer.\n\nI can‚Äôt relax regardless of how many sedative medications I take.\n\nI get anxious if I realise I‚Äôm not anxious\n\nAll of it\n\nIt makes attempting to socialize and be a normal human very difficult. My anxiety is very \"neurological\" as apposed to thought patterns so its very difficult to be present in any situation especially socially. Its ruined my life, my love life and happiness.\n\nHow much anxiety can a person have?¬† I'm all in,¬† regardless.¬†¬†\n\nI have an ocean of anxiety\n\nThiiiiiiiiiiiis much. ü´∏                                        ü´∑\n\nIt used to be like a 9 now it‚Äôs a like a 6\n\nJust now im holdin ice while the feeling of numb tongue is all over me lol.\n\nI have panic attacks about certain mundane scenarios or times because I had a panic attack once during it, and now my brain associates that time with panic attack time, and now I get panic attacks because  I‚Äôm scared of having panic attacks‚Ä¶\n\nOverflowing right now.

Yep. That‚Äôs how much anxiety I have. A fuck ton.\n\nThere is no best answer to that it keeps getting worse sometimes i cant even eat properly sometimes it‚Äôs just headache sometimes my stomach hurts a little sometimes i just break down crying and the hardest part is ti pretend that you‚Äôre okay to fake a smile so that other people don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre going through its been getting a lot worse this days i don‚Äôt even feel like pretending anymore but I don‚Äôt have any other options\n\nSo anxious right now üòû\n\nNot exactly sure but i also have panic disorder and depression it's verry hard to deal with constantly\n\n‚ôæÔ∏è\n\nSo much that it decided to bring along its friend agoraphobia for the ride n now I‚Äôm not going for a ride we‚Äôre staying home\n\nAll of it.\n\nSo many.\n\nAt least 5\n\nAbout thiiiiiiiis much\n\nA lot\n\nenough to where even a benzo doesn‚Äôt work 100%\n\nYes\n\nall of it\n\nAt least 5 and a half\n\nEnough to get medicated üòûüö¨\n\nHow much time do you have?\n\nMhm.

Some days worse than others.\n\nwhen i first started taking my anxiety meds, i had a little to no anxiety most of the days, so that made me even more anxious and i stopped taking my meds..\n\nI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶. A lot sometimes? \n\n\nI don‚Äôt really have a barometer for this kind of thing.\n\nA lot as well as depression, mania, and paranoia\n\nAll of it\n\nAt least 100.\n\nTremendous\n\nI'm normally an anxious and depressed wreck.¬† The only time I feel comfortable is when drinking and smoking.\n\n\nIt's gotten so bad I actually have fits of crying, I simply can't handle people or my life.¬† Seeing someone from the state who prescribes drugs, but is there any advice on what I should tell him so I don't talk myself into a mismatched prescription?\n\n\nFor reference I've suffered from social anxiety since I was a kid, simply talking to people terrify's me, and the depression aspect comes from reflecting on my failures due to anxiety.¬†¬†\n\n\nHydroxyzine is something I tried, it results is more tears.\n\nAll of them\n\nWhen I'm sending an important email, even though I've checked it ten times already, I go back and panic check after it sends to make sure I didn't send it to the wrong person. The same goes for when I send a gossipy message or something secret to someone; my first thought every time is, \"oh god, I just sent that to the person I was talking crap about\".\n\nAll of it. I have all of the anxiety.\n\nAll of it.\n\nI have so much anxiety I feel like alphabet soup with all the disorders I‚Äôve been diagnosed with.¬†\n\nThis week my therapist diagnosed me with PTSD and I don‚Äôt know how to feel about that one. I didn‚Äôt even tell my husband yet and this happened Monday.¬†\n\nI was diagnosed with anxiety and social anxiety disorder in the 2000's after years of struggling with it. Sometimes I would cancel appointments unless friends or family went with me, sometimes I would even avoid calling to cancel and just not show up. \n\nI've been on Buspirone for some time now, but occasionally, depending on how busy my day is, I find it tough to do everything. I guess I should mention that I'm disabled with cerebral palsy and Fibromyalgia, so a lot of my anxiety is from that. \n\nI've not worked in 14 years, so most days are simple enough, but visitors to the house can throw me off, even planned visits.\n\nSome days a lot. Some days a little. It‚Äôs still always there though.\n\nThis many\n\nI have at least 1000 Elephants of anxiety\n\nAll of it\n\nSpiraling is a past time. \n\n(Oh, and I started overthinking and typed, deleted, and re-typed this comment.

    "all_comment_text": "I‚Äôve been on both sides of this - the unsupportive partner who couldn‚Äôt help and so they became irritated, and the anxious wreck who needed support but was met with frustration. Feels bad on both sides and there is no win, anxiety is just a burden sometimes.\n\nYou deserve to be supported, but I don‚Äôt think we can expect support 100% of the time from our partners. It is challenging. There is no quick fix and no real cure, just learning to adapt and manage better over time with the right support and care.\n\nTalk to your partner, let them know how those words made you feel, and hear them out on how they feel. Working together is the best thing you can do, imo.\n\nI think that with partners, especially spouses, you sign up for the hard stuff. It‚Äôs not fun and yeah it‚Äôs hard to support someone especially when you are going through your own stuff, but this is supposed to be someone you love and want to help.\n\nMy husband has never said something like this to me and I know my anxiety/depression can be a lot to handle. His anxiety/depression is hard for me to deal with at times, so we of course have boundaries and say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk about this right now, but can we talk about this at [insert time].‚Äù Even then it can be hard, but we are there for each other.\n\nObviously your partner can‚Äôt be EVERYTHING to you, but it should be a priority conversation if you are planning on being with someone for the long haul, before it gets really messy with legal documents and assets. If emotional support is a key feature you are looking for in a relationship, that needs to be expressed. And couples counseling is helpful, even if you aren‚Äôt completely on the rocks, it‚Äôs important to keep the lines of communication open and understand where each person is coming from.\n\nPersonally I can relate to people who are upset with OPs partner. It‚Äôs ok to be angry/irritated with your partner, but it‚Äôs not ok to take it out on OP (thank you Reddit for allowing venting to the void). Exploding on their partner shows a lack of emotional control on their part, which really needs to be considered if that is remotely acceptable in the relationship. For me it wouldn‚Äôt be, that would be a huge conversation and possibly a deal breaker if they stuck by it. Have boundaries, and also have empathy for your partner. I‚Äôve also been with my spouse for over 20 years now. It‚Äôs all about communication and understanding where the other person is at.\n\nThank you for sharing your experience. I will keep what you've said in mind üòä\n\nThis. The \"your spouse is a jerk, dump that person\" comments are unhelpful and dangerous but also unsurprising for reddit. Mental health struggles are extremely difficult and exhausting for everyone involved. Any human relationship with one or more individuals dealing with MH issues is doomed if you don't begin with that fundamental acknowledgment.\n\nOP asked for advice on what to do now. As someone who suffers from anxiety and was also in a relationship with a person with severe mental illness, I'd say there's two things to do: communicate and set boundaries.\n\nBoundaries are important. What is it within your ability to do, in terms of supporting your partner? What can you not do? What do you need for your own mental health? What regular routines can you set up in your lives to avoid the situation where you feel you're being your partner's therapist? Both individuals need to ask these questions of themselves and be really honest about the answers.\n\nThanks for your input and advice üòä I will give this a try üòä\n\nThanks for your comment and advice. Much appreciated üíú I have spoken with him and it's a bit better, although I feel a little reluctant to share anything now.\n\nMy spouse has been pretty compassionate throughout the two decades we‚Äôve been together, but compassion fatigue is a real thing and it doesn‚Äôt necessarily make the partner a bad person by itself. Just makes them human, and feeling ill-equipped to know how to handle the situation in an effective way. So then they can blow up in their own meltdown of sorts. I tell myself it‚Äôs not fair for me to expect my spouse to know exactly what to say, do and feel 24/7 because if the shoe was on the other foot if I‚Äôm being honest with myself I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sustain a perfect performance forever either.\n\nI unfortunately feel this way with my SO. Im not as mean about it but I just dont have the know how or relatable experience to properly help but she refuses to get therapy. I try as hard as I can but I just dont have the capacity to help how she needs it. all I can give is an attempt to comfort. I came from a very wealthy upbringing and she came from the exact opposite. I came from a very big and tight knit family who was well off, no divorces, no scandals, no money problems, little to no family drama and if there was any it was stupid and small and was solved very quick. She comes from a family with alot of issues, not as big or tight knit, not wealthy, divorces and family drama all over. I just sometimes feel like I cant relate at all so its hard for me to pass on words of comfort or wisdom that actually help or mean something.\n\nYeah. I feel like I was always you, I didn't get it until I did. Long story, but I hope you never do. I still have my family dynamic, only that I get it now... I broke. Everything is still intact, but I broke &amp; I don't know how to put myself back together again.¬†\n\n\nI take it for you to know her background so intimately you must have been together for a while. So what was the long term plan? If I may ask. It's okay to say I bit off more than I can chew bit let's not make people feel less than. That is never necessary. Her background is not something to throw in her face please.¬†\n\nNo I never throw it in her face. Its more of like I just dont know what to say or do like I feel useless.\n\nI hear you. But do you feel like you under-estimated the task or she just broke suddenly like some of us?¬†\n\n\nWhatever the case, please tell her how you are feeling before you burst like OP's partner. Words are a MF but this is how it starts with thoughts. Next thing you have said the worst thing you can possibly say to a person...¬†\n\nLol are you my husband?\n\nwow i‚Äôm sorry to hear that :( we won‚Äôt be sick of your anxiety!! safe place\n\nThank you stranger on the Internet! It's nice to know there are people out there who understand\n\nI understand both where I'm guessing where you're coming from, but also probably where she's coming from.\n\nI've learned something as a paraplegic man with anxiety.\n\nI can share a limited amount, a **very** limited amount with women in my life, and I can never let a partner become a caregiver.\n\nI absolutely must try to do almost everything by myself or get help from paid caregivers. Physical limitations are dealt with by medical staff, and psychiatric issues wait for the psychiatrist.\n\nI accept help when offered with politeness and grace, but never complain much to outside individuals.\n\nIf a woman get's the \"**ick**\" it's the beginning of the end, and no amount of heart-to-heart talks can solve that. It is what it is.\n\nYup, as a woman with chronic health issues including anxiety, I make sure my spouse doesn't become my caregiver.\n\nFor short term things it's absolutely fine - you look after each other when you have the flu etc - but when it becomes long term, they start to see you as a patient not as a partner, and then that's the end of your relationship.\n\nI can tell him if I feel particularly bad and would like a hug/nice mug of tea/box of painkillers brought to me, but I don't make him my therapist.\n\nI mean. I get it. Your anxieties are her anxieties. Her anxieties are your anxieties. It‚Äôs all just one giant game of anxiety. She‚Äôs probably just frustrated. Who isn‚Äôt?\n\nI think your spouse might feel overwhelmed and doesn‚Äôt know how to help you with the anxiety you are experiencing. \n\nRemember not to take that personally. We all live in our own worlds and it‚Äôs difficult for us to truly understand what others are going through. This outburst is a reflection of how he is feeling‚Äîin other words not having a solution hence feeling ‚Äúsick of‚Äù it.\n\nDon‚Äôt worry about how he feels. For now, just focus on ways you can cope with your anxiety. We have to accept we are anxious people and that is okay. We worry, we care, we empathize and it affects us. Some people don‚Äôt., because they live in their worlds, while we live in ours. \n\nI don‚Äôt know much about your relationship, but to bypass the eggshell feeling try to show some strength around your spouse and don‚Äôt discuss your anxiety. I don‚Äôt and it helps me power through the day and not burden my partner with my stuff. He doesn‚Äôt burden me with his either and it seems to be working for us. \n\nI‚Äôm proud of you for doing the therapy and work. \n\nThings will get better, I promise.\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean it was ok for op to be spoken to like that though.\n\n‚òùÔ∏è\n\nThis!! Exactly.\n\nThank you so much for your thorough and kind response üíú\n\nHow do you manage to hide your anxiety from your partner?\n\nI don't think hiding should be the goal here. \n\nI think the goal should look more like sitting down with your partner to explain that while you're working on therapy and recovery, comments like that do not make a safe space and set you back \n\nIf you're having to hide your anxiety from your partner, you're feeding the anxiety 5 fold.\n\nDon't hide your anxiety, that's never going to work well. I think what the commenter meant was that ultimately it's your partner's job to *support* you but it's not their job to deal with your anxiety for you. I don't know much about your relationship, but as someone with anxiety and a partner who has anxiety I know how both sides of this can feel. \n\nSometimes being the partner to someone with anxiety can be exhausting. You really care about them because you love them, and seeing them in pain causes you to feel pain. You might feel inadequate because you're unable to actually \"fix\" their anxiety, or you might feel overwhelmed because you are carrying the mental burdens of two people instead of one. And all of this is balanced with a desire to help even when it's impossible because you don't want the person you love to be in pain. But that being said, there's a reason being a therapist is a profession that requires years of training. Most people aren't equipped to give you the help that you need, and relationships with mental illness involved can often cause one or both partners to feel like more of a caretaker than a lover. \n\nMy partner deals with pretty severe depression on top of their anxiety, and for a while I felt way too overburdened with the amount of responsibility I was taking in our relationship. I didn't want to make their problems worse so I would allow them to forget about chores or taking care of themselves without saying anything. I'd cook and clean every night because they were so tired from being depressed and anxious all day. And I'd tell myself that this was the right thing to do because that's what good partners do. \n\nAnd you know what? I was wrong. It was completely unsustainable for both of us and it was letting my partner fall deeper into their depression hole. Eventually I had to tell them that I felt like I was taking on too much. I gave them a very concrete list of things I felt like I needed more support with, and they were extremely receptive to that. It's motivated them to work on their mental health issues more and they've come so far since we started talking more about stuff like this. Obviously they aren't perfect and they falter sometimes, but the fact that they're aware of my needs and trying to fulfill them is more than enough. I finally feel like I'm not carrying all of the logistical weight in our relationship, and I feel like we're both closer as a result. \n\nI think your partner probably owes you an apology for framing what they are feeling in such a frank and thoughtless way. Their feelings of stress are absolutely valid and warranted but they should've expressed those feelings in a more constructive way. But I also think you both need to have a frank conversation about what specific things are elevating your partner's stress in the relationship. Your anxiety isn't going to go away, the only thing you can change is how you deal with it. So figure out what anxiety responses are too much for your partner and try to find healthy ways to stop having those responses, or at least have them in a way that is less burdensome to your partner. \n\nSince I know that's kind of vague, I'll give an example. I really struggle with bottling up my feelings when I get anxious. It's a terrible habit and it's also not really successful since it's usually pretty apparent to the people around me that something is wrong. My partner eventually had to sit me down and tell me that I was treating them completely unfairly when something was weighing on me. I'd get snippy and snarky at them and project whatever issues I was bottling up onto them. This was completely not okay of me, and as soon as they connected the dots for me I realized how important it was to find healthier ways of venting my anxiety. I started practicing ways of talking about my anxious feelings in the moment, or finding healthy routines to calm myself down. I've been trying to learn better compartmentalization techniques so that I can push through the anxiety in the moment but still process the feeling at a later time instead of suppressing then entirely. \n\nHaving frank and constructive conversations about what behaviors are causing harm and what you can do to fix them is so important. Relationships are unfortunately just more work when you have a mental illness, but if you're both willing to put in that work I know you can come to a happier place together ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nNot really hiding, just it‚Äôs my problem not his.\n\nThe biggest trigger for my anxiety is being a burden to others. So, in a way this trigger allows me to avoid these kind of scenarios but I also don‚Äôt hide it. I just minimise the outward presentation while still dying on the inside ü´†\n\nAnxiety is unfortunately our burden to bear, but it shouldn‚Äôt be something we outwardly push into others. Especially as a coping mechanism. Use your support systems to help you with the coping mechanisms but never use them as one. \nMy husband knows what I need when it‚Äôs really bad and often for me that is alone time to switch on the CBT process. If he is involved, my anxiety will get worse because I feel like I‚Äôm a burden. However he does know that if I approach him, that means I need a silent super tight hug for an unprecedented amount of time. So essentially I never hide it from him (he can always tell) but because I have found and discussed my coping mechanisms he knows what to do. Find your coping mechanisms and build up your CBT techniques. Then tell your spouse so that they also dont feel helpless and know what to do to help. \n\nIt can take so long to build this mindset, but it will really help further relationships as you reduce the burden\n\nWhat‚Äôs weird is people in our lives will say this stuff to us and then wonder why we always say ‚Äúnothing‚Äù when they ask what‚Äôs wrong or if we want to talk about it.\n\nIKR\n\nDamn I came to this sub just now to post about my spouse. She didn't say anything blunt like this. But I just had an episode (still going through it but it's starting to subside) and she just could not have been any colder during it. We were just trying to go to the store and I could already feel it coming on, which I informed her of. And instead of showing any support, she bombarded with me questions of what's the plan now, are we going to the store or not, what are we doing... and I've told her before I just need her to relax and maybe hold my hand, rub my back, tell me it's going to be okay, etc. But she never does. \n\nAnd not only that, I feel like I'm graded on my performance under pressure. Like if I showed any irritation, then she's under no obligation to help me through it. I'm trying to explain this to her right now (taking a little break from the argument because it was getting heated) and it's still not sinking in. I'm trying to tell her it isn't that an anxiety attack is a problem to be solved right now, I just need to be comforted and reassured that it'll pass and everything will be okay. \n\nCheers to you my friend. I do hope things get better for you.\n\nSorry you're going through a similar thing. I hope things get better for you too\n\nBoth my husband and I suffer from GAD, we both are on medication but it‚Äôs hard sometimes if the other is having a bad day. It seems like we both go to the extreme but we haven‚Äôt ever said mean things to each other about it. We are each other‚Äôs therapist and we like it that way. Sounds like your spouse is just being mean and doesn‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre going through. There are books on how to love someone with anxiety etc. they are super helpful.\n\nGlad you and your husband are able to support each other. The books on loving someone with anxiety might be a good idea. Is there one in particular you would recommend? üòä Thanks for your advice!\n\nMy ex had depression and I remember feeling emotionally drained and like a carer so I get it.\n\nI have anxiety and often vocalise my fears. My partner also said it‚Äôs draining him. I did get upset because despite understanding the feeling, I felt like he could have kept it to himself because now I had relationship concerns on top of everything else. \n\nHowever, it‚Äôs a good reminder to try some CBT workbooks or distract yourself with plenty of activities etc. \n\nSometimes those from the outside see better the hole we are in than we see it ourselves.\n\nThanks for your comment and advice üòä\n\ni don't have any advice, but you have my sympathies. i cannot stand people who make *your* mental health issues about *them*-- like damn, if you think that's bad, try living in my head for a day üôÑ\n\nMy favorite kind of comment. Like you‚Äôre sick of my anxiety? How do you think I feel? I just love going through life assuming the worst about everything because my brain only has one hormone setting and that‚Äôs FULL SPEED AHEAD\n\nExactly :(\n\nAnxiety is really fucking hard to treat and manage. I‚Äôm so sorry your spouse lashed out at you. Has this happened before? ü´Ç\n\nIt has happened twice before, but that was quite some time ago :/\n\nLiterally just happened to me. Makes me wonder if this was the right relationship. So much to ‚Äútil death do us part‚Äù\n\nSorry you're going through this too. It's such a horrible feeling :( I hope things get better for you and your partner.\n\nSmh .. how awful now you probably feel like you need to hide it when you‚Äôre having anxiety\n\nThat's exactly it :( I feel completely trapped where I am.\n\nThat‚Äôs the most worst thing for your anxiety too feeling trapped im so sorry I‚Äôm here if you need to talk I won‚Äôt ever make you feel guilty for the way you‚Äôre feeling\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat's good advice, I will do that. Thank you!\n\nBut it's your brain telling you you are trapped when you are not. There are actions you can take to figure out another outlet that is not your partner. Even if it's just for the short term. I know it sounds like the same advice everyone gives, but find something that can be an outlet whether it is running, talking to a friend, cooking, listening to podcasrs about mental health (depresh mode reallt helped me when I was in a similar situation and couldnt talk to my partner about it). it just has to be something that works for you.\n\nThanks for this. I will give the podcast a try! üòä\n\nIt is really good!! When I first found it I binged a ton of episodes at once when I was feeling mentally unwell. For me it helps to hear from people going through something similar.\n\nI'm the same, so hopefully it will help me too! Thanks for recommending it üòä\n\nI feel for you. Mine left me cause of it lol\n\nMine too... it really messed me up honestly. It made me really fearful of dealing with my anxiety within a relationship. My current husband just saw one of my worst episodes I've had, and he was definitely struggling to handle it. I think bad anxiety is difficult even for the most patient people to handle... especially if it's something they haven't experienced themselves. The rejection upsets me...but also I can understand it.\n\nI get it just sucks after being together so long.. but what can you do just makes me feel indont deserve to be with anyone\n\nI feel this in my core. I try to remember how hard it is for them too. It‚Äôs constant for both of us.\n\nMy husband said something similar once but it led to a long discussion and a lot he didn‚Äôt really grasp in my diagnosis. He‚Äôs now seen and been much more supportive. I hope your situation gets better it can be hard not to be able to be open with your struggles with loved ones.\n\nI'm sorry you went through this too, but I'm glad your situation got better. Hopefully mine will too.\n\nTalk to your therapist about how to proceed.\n\nI live on eggshells everyday with my spouse. I just stopped telling him anything and everything. Now he wonders why I barely talk but guess what... I'm not getting those stupid responses anymore. It totally sucks but if that's what it takes to not hear him talk shit - so be it. He should be there to support you as a spouse should.\n\nI totally get that. I am so sorry that you are going through this too :(\n\nI had someone say this to me a few years ago. It‚Äôs one of the worst things to say to someone, or to have said to you. It sticks with you in the future, and makes me feel like I‚Äôll never have someone that cares about my issues. \nBut people do. I‚Äôm so sorry your spouse said this to you. You are loved and you are worth your anxiety.\n\nThank you üíô Sorry you have been through this too. I hope things will get better for you.\n\nI don‚Äôt know your situation in your relationship, but i had been in relationships previous to my now husband. I was very transparent about my anxiety from the beginning and had made it clear to him that it comes with me as a package because I have been through therapy (still actively in it) and i have tried every med and I am still anxious about the world. If he EVER said that to me, that he was sick of my anxiety, that would be it for me right there. Simply because I have had this level of anxiety my entire life, yes it‚Äôs inconvenient and inconsistent, yes sometimes it ruins the vibe/days/weeks because of me being anxious, and yes sometimes plans we are very excited for fall through. But every single time his reaction is ‚Äúits okay we will try again another day!‚Äù.\nIm not saying this to compare relationships at all, again i know nothing about your situation. Maybe this was a fluke and they were simply frustrated? Maybe this happens always? Im not sure. What i do know is, if you are an anxious person, you deserve to be loved AS an anxious person. Your spouse should be someone you can let your walls down with and supports you. Having a therapist is DEFINITELY beneficial and helps with the weight, but i know theres nights i come home overstimulated and stressed from the day i have had and all i want is to confide in my husband, and EVERYONE deserves that. \nIf you are married/longterm relationship have you thought of counselling for the two of you? Sometimes that can help to better understand anxiety and other problems.\n\nThe best advice without knowing the full situation is to evaluate your relationship. Is it going to get better/do you see them eventually understanding or making strides to understand? If not then you need to evaluate whether or not staying in the relationship is beneficial for either of you or not. You CAN love someone and not be the right fit, especially when complex mental health comes into play. I‚Äôve been in this situation and I wish it upon no one. Please do not hide/try to repress your anxiety for love it just makes it worse ‚ù§Ô∏è I wish you all the best and hope everything works out for you. Good luck on your therapy journey\n\nThanks for sharing your experience and advice üíô\n\nYep I have the same, every argument they bring up ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of feeling like your mum!‚Äù Well either don‚Äôt be with me then or accept and support me! Trust me I wish I wasn‚Äôt like this just as much as they do\n\nSorry you have this too, it is a horrible feeling :(\n\nWhat a lovely spouse /sarcasm\n\n2 days ago. I saw this clip on TikTok. The guy simply said, it's tine to do way with words like trauma dumping. There is no need, if someone's trauma is too much for you find a kind way to say it.\n\n\nAnd until then I hadn't realized that m, that is basically how I talk to myself. Hence sometimes I get scared that I am the type to just one day be done. No note. Nothing. Cause the voice in my head was bullying me.\n\n\nSo I now understand that in as much as I get that some people even refuse therapy, reject family, friends &amp; want to lean on the one person. The question that has always nagged me is, did you just up &amp; get tired after 5-10 years or did the person do a 180 on you? What happened?¬†\n\n\nWhat he said was unkind &amp; I refuse to try &amp; excuse it.¬†\n\nThis is exactly why I'm getting divorced. My wife doesn't understand my anxiety and cant relate to me. She refuses to understand. So frustrating.\n\nSorry to hear this :(\n\nYou don‚Äôt deserve to hear things like that and seeing someone you love go through something like depression and anxiety can be overwhelming. It can really be taxing on the mind and cause lots of friction and it can make them feel awful if their support is showing no results. Communication is key.\n\nI don‚Äôt like to make firm judgements because I don‚Äôt know your relationship. I always take the malice wasn‚Äôt intended route until they show otherwise. But do defend yourself instead of walking on eggshells. Tell him to find a better way to say something like that to you and discuss what you can do to help each other. He might be feeling overwhelmed, but you‚Äôll never know until you talk.\n\nWhen it comes to people, in general, I‚Äôve found that some people are the listeners, others are the problem solvers, others are the distraction or take action kind. If you approach a problem solver with anxiety, they‚Äôre going to want to find a solution, but that might not be what you need. Approach a ‚Äútake action‚Äù person hoping they‚Äôll listen won‚Äôt get you want you need either and so on.\n\nYou can lean on these strengths as you heal, and may even find that some people overlap between them, or switch between them depending on how they‚Äôre feeling.\n\nThanks for such a well thought out response. I think you are probably right üòä\n\nI am told this every other week by my mother. But I get where they are coming from. For us, it's a new problem everytime but for others its the same song and dance so one can't blame them for being frustrated. Being understanding is different from actually understanding what anxiety is.\n\nThat's true I guess\n\nOuch. My spouse gets frustrated at times for sure, but at the end of the day she is still there with all the support I need. I'm sorry you have to deal with that on top of everything else too.\n\nWe love you and are here for you! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThank you Internet stranger! üíô Likewise üòä\n\nIt isn't fair to expect someone else to shoulder your burdens day after day with no complaints. They are going through life to the best of their ability just like you, it's not fair to give them more stress just because it comforts you. Obviously you can share these things to a degree, but there's a point where if you are relying on sharing your feelings with them to just feel alright, it's unfair to them.\n\nMy partner of 14 years left me because of this/other things people have mentioned in comments, we have a child, I'm a stay at home Mom - got nothing to fall back on because instead of focusing solely on myself I focused on my kid and partner, I was drowning and needed support, he was and is sick of it. All I can say is, don't hide. It won't help. Build a support network outside of your relationship, whether it's friends and family, or a professional. Focus on you. Just be calm and assertive about things you need, and take care of yourself. Evidently if you are \"too much\" it won't matter what you do, they will leave or be upset. You need to be healthy and the rest will come. Be patient. Love yourself. We can't guarantee anyone will stay, but we are always with ourselves. Does that make sense? The right person will stay and be kind. That may not be your partner and that's okay.\n\nSorry to hear that you've been through this too :( I hope things get better for you. \n\nYou've shared some good advice. I'm not sure how yet, but I'm definitely going to try to focus on myself a bit more.\n\nRecently, I learnt how important it is to share mental health while dating. The hard truth is anxiety affects the person as well as the family. Not everyone has the capacity and understanding and it can cause a strain. In this scenario both you and partner should be in therapy. Have some patience as well with him.\n\nMy wife and I both have terrible anxiety, we both have therapists and always joke about our anxiety with each other. It is nice having someone who understands. I hope your spouse will understand and be more supportive!\n\nGlad you have a supportive wife! I hope things will  change for my situation too! üòä\n\nUmm kind of concerned for the amount of people justifying this type of behaviour from your spouse as ‚Äúbeing overwhelmed‚Äù. I‚Äôm sorry but no, anyone who is outwardly crude and mean like this is not someone worth staying with. This is a flat out cruel way of talking to you. I had an ex like this. When something really catastrophically bad actually happened to me, he told me he was ‚Äúsick of me fucking crying‚Äù. I left, and my life has only gotten better.\n\nYou‚Äôre right!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ if you view the situation from a purely emotional viewpoint and ignore all logic and nuance.\n\nremember you are not needy, you just need to find people who are happy to meet those needs.\n\nThank you üíô\n\nWould it be possible for your partner to join you during a therapy session?  Maybe they can gain a different perspective as a result.\n\nI've started therapy for different issues three times in my adult life, and every time I asked my spouse to join me for the first session so she could have an idea what I felt the issues were and what I'd be trying to correct.\n\nGood idea, I'll see if I can make that happen. Thank you so much!\n\nFuck them, you deserve better\n\nThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying\n\ni‚Äôm so sorry :( a supportive partner is so important during this. you need a safe place to go to when needed. at least you know nobody here will ever judge you or get mad üíó\n\nThank you üíô\n\ni was with a man like this. it was always ‚Äútalk to me‚Äù then when i would, he‚Äôd end up throwing my mental in my face as soon as we would argue smh.\n\nhe became the biggest trigger for my anxiety and i was constantly walking on eggshells around him and he used to be someone who brought me comfort. it sucked.\n\neven after putting me through all of that, he still thinks we‚Äôre going to get back together and get married and have kids and have this ‚Äúperfect‚Äù life .. so disgusted by him.\n\nSorry you've been through this too. I hope your life is getting better now that you've decided to move on!\n\nPlease leave this person üòû a partner is supposed to be supportive, and compassionate . Anxiety is exhausting but they‚Äôre supposed to be your rock to lean on in times of need. \nYou shouldn‚Äôt feel like you have to be a certain way or act a certain way to be loved. You can be loved ALONG with your anxiety. A spouse made a vow, in sickness and in health. This isn‚Äôt how a spouse is supposed to treat you. It‚Äôs minimizing, belittling, and toxic\n\nOP posted five sentences.  There are two sides to a story.  There's nothing to go on that says this is anywhere near the best course of action.  Leaving a spouse will likely destabilize OP's situation even more.  There's a lot to consider before suggesting this, and we don't have the information.\n\nThat‚Äôs fair. \nHowever, it is the wrong approach. And OP should at least try to have a discussion with their spouse about how it made them feel and go from there\n\nI agree 100%, they need communication.  I just disagree with the suggestion to dump the spouse based on what little we know.  Spouse could've had a bad day.  Spouse has needs as well.  This is a two-way street.\n\nHow will you be able to deal with anxiety if your spouse treats you like that?\n\nThat's what I want to know:/\n\nTell him ‚Äúoh and I am really happy I have it lol, if ur tired, imagine me having to go through it everyday alone‚Äù \nü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è do people ever say ‚Äúomg I‚Äôm so tired of your pneumonia, I‚Äôm not ur doctor‚Äù, nooo they don‚Äôt. Idk why they‚Äôd say it to someone w anxiety disorder\n\nIKR\n\nI‚Äôve realized that you can‚Äôt use your friends and family for therapy. I know you feel like you‚Äôre just sharing your worries and doubts but it‚Äôs incredibly overwhelming and annoying for people to listen to 24/7 especially when they do not understand what you‚Äôre going through. \n\nI know it‚Äôs hard but only talk to paid professionals about your problems with anxiety, depression, or anything else that may overwhelm you. People don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to be our therapists. It will ultimately push people away and you‚Äôll destroy relationships. \n\nI used to think people weren‚Äôt empathetic but to have true empathy is to have experienced something similar. If your spouse hasn‚Äôt experienced anything like this, it sounds ridiculous and they‚Äôre sick of hearing about it. \n\nFind other outlets or you‚Äôll end up alone. Not trying to scare you but just sharing what I‚Äôve experienced in my own life.\n\nThank you for your honesty. I appreciate the comment üíô\n\nThis is horrible advice.\n\n\nI get what you mean, but this makes it seem like all or nothing, like we are burdening our loved ones by being transparent with our disorders.\n\n\nI agree to not use them as your only source of support, but to avoid being vulnrable all together?¬†\n\n\nNo.\n\nFriends and family can truly only listen so much. If you keep bringing up problems with no solutions, it gets very very draining for most people especially loved ones.\n\nWell I tried this approach, which only caused more relationship problems.\n\n If you only talk to professionals about your mental health struggles, people around you are going to be very confused when you start showing symptoms, yet refuse to tell them about your issues.\n\nYou need balance and self awareness. But in order to develop close and meaningful relationships, you need to be vulnerable with people. \n\nI just wouldn't encourage people to reserve their deeper struggles for therapists only. It creates a feeling of shame surrounding your conditions/emotions.\n\nI feel like my bf wants to say this, but wont :(\n\nOoof I feel you. My partner has very specific work anxiety while I have very generalized all the time anxiety and she gets really frustrated with me. My therapist told me to try and practice empathy but also be open to dissolving the relationship if it would help my anxiety\n\nSorry to hear this. I hope things improve for you soon.\n\nToxic to both of you they feel like they have to be anything like a therapist if they can't handle it. The point here is avoiding stress, so doing something like that is actively counterproductive, especially with therapy already applied.¬†\n\nScrew the spouse.  Why marry someone like that?\n\nThe most important thing to do is to talk about it together. The anxiety is a problem that you share, just like any other illness or disability. If that conversation sounds scary, try a couples therapist or at least a third party who can be impartial.\n\nDoes your partner have someone else they can vent to about it? I've always had a hard time complaining about my partner to other people‚Äîit feels disloyal‚Äîbut it's an important release valve. A support group, a therapist, or even just a good friend (though maybe it's better if they're not your friend too). Talk with them about what would make you both feel comfortable.\n\nAnd similarly, if you can find other friends/relatives who can share the burden of your anxiety, that can help too. Therapy is good but sometimes you need someone you can reach out to more than once a week (or whatever).\n\nGood luck.\n\nThanks for your advice! üòä\n\nThat's such a hard thing to say and I'm sorry you've been told that. I know that anxiety can be quite overwhelming for people close to us but it's not something you can totally control and you shouldn't feel like you have to hide it by fear of hearing that kind of comments. Have you talked about it to your therapist?\n\nNot yet, but I will do in my next session.\n\nGoing to therapy is a plus. Hopefully that helps somewhat.\n\nMy ex was the same way--she got burnt out real quick after some major health anxiety episodes. You're gonna have to seriously consider how much you want to fight, and how willing your spouse is to support you. I'd recommend getting a couples counselor.\n\nBeing anxietics, we have some severe blindness to just how much and how often our anxiety affects our loved ones. I hate to give you more anxiety, but the fact that you have to walk on eggshells around your spouse is not good. That you are going to therapy is good, but it might not be enough. Really listen to your wife.\n\nIf you haven't been there it's hard to understand. Until I had it start and I couldn't help it I thought I could handle it in my own. It's hard I know im trying just starting meds getting off another one and struggling on the inside. Thoughts for you, you can't help it sometimes it just comes.¬†\n\nDitch the dud. Get someone who is supportive. I would never accept that in a significant other\n\nIt s unfair to expect your spouse to deal with your anxiety especially if it is accute. I had anxiety for 3 years and I could see the toll it was taking on her so much so that she developped √† little bit of anxiety too. I wouldn't even wish anxiety on my worst enemy as it can paralyse your life.\n\nI‚Äôm in this same position but with a family member. I‚Äôve completely shut down from saying anything now. Our spouses and family are supposed to be part of our support system. It‚Äôs one of the first things taught in therapy. Build your support system of family and friends. When those numbers are limited to choose from it gets tricky.\n\nI hope your situation gets better ü´Ç\n\nHave definitely been there with my spouse and while I've felt hurt by these kinds of comments he is allowed to be over capacity for what he is able to handle. I also snap at him and have a low threshold when I'm feeling really anxious so I can't expect him to always be the calm rock. It wears a person down. \n\nMy solution was honestly to up my therapy to more than once a week, go to yoga more often, and make a point of seeing my own friends more often or at least call friends so I feel like I have someone else to talk to and it isn't all on my husband. Basically to figure out another outlet. \n\nI am super privileged to be able to do these things though. I have noticed that over time he was able to recover and be there for me again. It doesn't mean he's a bad person.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience with something similar. I'm glad it got better for you!\n\nIt is a continual work in progress both with my anxiety and with my marriage!\n\nAnxiety is difficult for us and those around us.\n\nWhy do you feel you are walking on eggshells? Back story?\n\nWell, I think that needs to go the other way, as well. Your spouse is your partner for a reason.\n\nThis is really tough and I feel you.  \n  \nI feel like throughout my life people can be very kind and compassionate with my mental issues until they aren't. But I also understand: \\*I\\* am frustrated with my own damn self, it's not fair to ask others to be saints, even though in the moment it can feel very alienating. \n\nWhen my partner gets overwhelmed with me we usually fight but talk it out after. Sometimes we just have to give each other some space and then come back to the situation and our feelings with some distance. I am also sure to express my gratitiude/appreciation of her and try to do little nice things throughout the day as I can, it's also about intentionally supporting \\*her\\* too. \n\nHoping the best for you.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience. Hoping the best for you too!\n\nDo you have other social supports? And do you try to work through your anxiety solo sometimes? Severe anxiety can be tough to deal with even being in the same house as a person, but if your spouse is ‚Äúfeeling like your therapist‚Äù I wonder if you‚Äôre leaning on them for support more than they can take. And if you are, if it would be feasible to make a point of leaning a little less.\n\nAll this is assuming they actually are typically supportive and not just kind of a dick. IMO the key to this, both for their sake and your anxiety, is to talk openly about it. No accusations, not in the heat of the moment, but when there‚Äôs a calm/quiet moment to address it and try to work on a solution as a team.\n\nI‚Äôve never been with anyone but I can promise you that we won‚Äôt get sick of your anxiety. We are all here because we are dealing with anxiety one way or another. This is probably the safest place to talk about it as there will be someone in this community that understands your particular situation.\n\nThank you ü´Ç\n\nDivorce.\n\nPersonally, it is so okay to be scared, ashamed, angry or whatever you're feeling and give yourself the kindness and space to process that first!\n\nI think of my mental health issues like physical illnesses, and that helps. While listening and talking look like normal spouse behavior, sometimes it's true that what's necessary and what's being asked for is actual therapy in those situations. Like someone else said, compassion fatigue is definitely a thing, and people need breaks and should feel safe to communicate that healthily.\n\nI liken it to if I had a wound, to expect my partner to do the wound dressing/treatment of it with whatever frequency. This is a little easier to empathise with, because when you're in crisis mode it's hard to see outside your own head (esp if the anxiety never really goes away). Although I want my partner to care about and for me, when it comes to actual medical treatment, I wouldnt expect my partner to do it all for me and the balance between talking and treatment becomes a bit more clear.\n\nIn terms of what to do now, take some time to see how you truly feel about it, and try to genuinely understand things from their perspective. then if you can find a balancing point between interacting with them and therapy-like work on your partner's behalf, say you understand what they mean, sorry for exhausting them, thank you for listening (if you genuinely mean any of these things) and say you want a healthier balance plus a healthy communication system so that you don't feel like you don't matter to your spouse/are loved, and so they don't feel like they're being pushed to provide more care than they feel capable of.\n\nif they're not understanding of your anxiety at all... honestly, talk to your therapist about it, but I'm very very sorry :((\n\nThanks for your advice on this. I think you're probably right üòä\n\n[deleted]\n\nThank you üíô\n\nThank you to everyone who has commented and/or offered advice. What a lovely community on reddit this is! üíô\n\nTbh I see and understand both sides\n\nI was dumped because of my anxiety - any thoughts or opinions i'd appreciate\n\n  \nThis is coming from an anxiously attached/rj.. I'm looking to understand my ex's reasons for leaving me...please be kind to me, I'm heartbroken. I should mention my ex is 'secure' attachment.\n\nNo one in my life gets it. I was with my boyfriend for 13months. Wonderful man, beyond my dreams. He really saw me for me. This is my first everything I am 37(f). I have anxiety, he knew this from day 1. He said he was patient and could handle it. I was always stuck in his past (retroactive jeslousy) and always fishing as he called it. We were om the same page in regards to goals and timelines. After month 10 I moved in. In the 4mths we lived together I couldn't stop fishing. I constantly sought reassurance I wanted him to say specific things at specific times. I didn't see it as control, but love but understand how it looks. He always said things on his own and asked me everyday to pls just be in the present moment that let things happen as they will. He reassured me saying things like I'm not going anywhere, I was the one. I had a great relationship w his family they all said I take care of him so well and I look at him like no one ever has. With the exception of my anxiety I was a great gf. His needs were all met as I could tell and he always said I took good care of him. He was in hospital 1 mth ago and I didn't even think twice about getting him better. I cooked, cleaned, shopped I got up early so he didn't have to make his lunches for work. We truly had something magical. As my anxiety got worse I decided ok I need therapy before I lose him. I had one session(finances and scheduling got in the way). I was dedicated I said I will get better. I tried to go to him less, I tried to self soothe but I didn't have the coping mechanisms so I kept going to him. He is very mild mannered, never raise his voice, kind to everyone. In the past 3mths he yelled at me 3 times. He said he couldnt take the getting angry anymore. We had a fight I apologized bc it was the same thing: went to dinner w his bro and sis in law they were asking direct questions about our future to which I was answering and he wasn't saying a word so I got in my head in a loop and on the way home he asked if I was mad. I said yes I was immature i said I was hurt and I said why don't you want to talk about our future. He got mad and said he was done. He asked me to leave our apartment ( he pd the rent I paid flr everything else) my name wasn't on rent etc but I said no one is leaving I wanna talk it out. He warned me from day 1 he never goes back to an ex, once the relationship ends it ends for a reason. But I thought I was different bc he said I was the one, he never lived w anyone, his family loved me. He said i wasn't the person he fell in love with anymore that I became my anxieyy and I crushed us. He said while he's loved me the most out of anyone he didn't like the person he was becoming (angry, having to constantly reassure me). I don't feel this is valid enough to leave over. If I was that special and different give me time to get more therapy and get the skills to.stop doing what I'm doing to hurt you. I would never leave. I don't get how you loved me, promised me you weren't going anywhere he saod this daily and then the night of the breaking up said he LOVED me past tense...how is he okay without me, how is our future gone bc you don't like who you are when youre annoyed sometimes...isn't the good stuff far out weighing the bad. I begged, pleaded I said I'd do therapy 5x a week, I'd stay w my parents so we can work on it. He said no, he's never coming back and that I had opportunities to improve the last few months. He said he no longer had to justify staying. I hope he didn't mean it when he said he wasted the last year with me, i wasn't his problem anymore and he'd rather be alone than with me. I need help, I've been calling texting since it happened and no response. He says I cant accept the breakup, to grow up and move on but I cant I truly felt he was the great love of my life. Everything else was wonderful. Why couldn't he stay. why didnt the good outweigh the bad for him\n\nI truly don't understand why you chose to breakup instead of fight for us. He said I was the one, that he loved me the most out of anyone he's ever loved; my anxiety and need for constant reassurance made him lose all his patience for me and he ended it after a fight about the same issue - i wish fishing for him to say something (which was stupid bc i know he felt it) i was just in a anxious loop and needed him. I dont get why you give up especially when i had just started therapy. I begged, pleaded, cried, i did everything i could while in the relationship (he said he was 99% happy and he wasnt going anywhere almost daily). Why if all of that was good, throw us away for the 1 bad %...\n\nHe will not talk to me...i finally stopped trying to reach out, but i wish he'd listen...He has a rule that he doesnt go back to any exes, but i thought i would be different since i lived w him and we had plans that he never did with anyone else\n\nYou have a therapist for a reason, he or she is a trained person into bot veung i fluenced by what you share, your husband lives this differently! Give him his space, he also might need help, and maybe having a session with your therapist on how to manage your anxiety when together, what to do what to say and what not to do will help you both having tools to manage it\n\nSometimes that attitude can be quite helpful.  A person that coddles the anxiety sufferer only adds to the problem.  The way to get over anxiety is to go on with your life like it‚Äôs not there, to truly not give a shit and it loses its power.  I‚Äôm sure your spouse is frustrated and probably didn‚Äôt use the best approach but honestly it can be helpful if you let it.\n\nThanks for putting things in a different light. I will keep that in mind üòä\n\nAs your partner, it is his job to support you in taking care of yourself. It's not his job to regulate your emotions for you. It's not his job to teach you how to use coping mechanisms. If the only way that you have to calm your anxiety is to dump your stress on him, then you're being emotionally abusive. \n\nNow, maybe that's not what's happening and he actually is just incredibly unsympathetic and callous. But it would probably help your relationship quite a bit to make sure that you look at your own actions. You need to be able to self-soothe at least some of the time and not expect him to co-regulate with you every single time you're upset. \n\nThis is advice that I have received from a licensed therapist so I'm passing it on to you.\n\nI wonder how long until he cheats¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm really not hating, i wish you all the best and a lot of growth in understanding life, humans, and maturity. \n\nYou sound very young honestly. So no bad intentions at all. What you said here, however, is the worst opinion on human relations ive ever seen. Please never take your own advice (the one you posted here)\n\nIm sure you believe what you said so I'm not gonna invest much time into any convincing. However:\n\nHumans are beautiful, unique and flawed.\n\nWe are not generalized automatons for all of us to have the same approach to life or wants and needs.\n\nIf your partner male or female has trouble loving you because some base primal unconscious part of themselves is taking them over like a zombie in need of some strong masculine protective brains and is making them feel like you're weak for living your own life to the best of your abilities and even talking about it in an attempt to handle it even better than on your own - then that partner is an immature child and just plain horrible. \nNEVER ACCEPT PEOPLE LIKE THAT. its not you, its them. That person is not right for anything or anyone else except another immature superficial child. (And trust me it wont last - even people like that will need more at some point)\n\nTALKING ALWAYS HELPS.\n\nSharing means you're strong and will make you even stronger. Its what we're put on this earth to do as humans. \n\nTake care üôè"

    "body": "I‚Äôm just curious what people with anxiety do for work. I cannot stay in one job for more than 1 year as the anxiety that comes with the expectations of being an established employee is too much for me, and I find all aspects of work incredibly anxiety inducing. I‚Äôve had 4 different full time roles since graduating and all of them have triggered panic attacks, restless nights, crying through my evenings etc.\n\nI am honestly starting to worry that I‚Äôll never be able to work anxiety free, so wondering what others do and how they cope.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for all your responses!

    "all_comment_text": "I worked full-time from 17 to 40 and absolutely destroyed my brain. Took medical leave after a breakdown and couldn't go back. Tried to return to the workforce a few years ago, and it's been nothing but chaos. This is my life now, and everyday I go to work I can feel my longevity slipping further away.  Stress kills. Work is stressful. Can't afford living without a job, and it appears the only jobs I can do are the high stress ones. \n\nI wish you luck in finding a solution that allows you to remain gainfully employed, healthily.\n\nIt's almost ironic that the only jobs I can do (as you said) are high-stress. It's like my body has  been naturalized. I've worked in child protection (both emergency/night-work and day) and that was the job I found easiest versus ones that are supposed to be easy.\n\nI think the question people need to ask themselves is whether the job is high stress or whether your anxiety makes you feel as though its stressful. I work in what i call high stress employment, but there are people around me who do not feel that way. They take it as it comes, roll with the punches, and dont worry about the what ifs. \n\nI feel like people with anxiety need structured jobs with clear workflow and expectations. Its the jobs that have grey areas in all of the above that stress us out. Because we ruminate on the what ifs. \n\nControl what you can, delegate what you can to increase control, and if you cant control it, let it go. \n\nIve had so many discussions with managers where i come in and im freaking out, or am open and honest about how i feel im doing. \n\nTheir reaction is always that i need to stop worrying and that im doing a great job. Theyd tell me if i wasnt. \n\nContextualize your what ifs, do what you can, and then let that stuff go. \n\nAnd when youre home, the work phone is off, you dont talk about work, and you focus on family.\n\nI agree with this. The more busy a workplace is the less I have time to even think about my anxiety. I teach preschool haha\n\nI‚Äôm so intrigued by this? I worked in probation/parole so lots of safeguarding, child protection and working with the worst level of sex offenders u could imagine‚Ä¶it absolutely destroyed me after a few years. Are u completely desensitised to the work? As I know that can happen it did for me at points but ultimately it made me an anxious wreck and I walked away\n\nI walked away from it. I was almost completely desensitized/numb to it, but still had the awareness that it wasn't healthy for my body.\n\nCan I ask what you do now? Did u completely change career paths?\n\nI have anxiety and working in healthcare is a high stress environment. Constant chaos but it doesn‚Äôt give me time to get stuck in my thoughts or anxious because I‚Äôm thrown in before I have time to think. Plus‚Ä¶ working with sick people is better than working with healthy people. Healthy people are harder to please.\n\nThis is where I currently am. I provide supports for adults with disabilities. So kinda healthcare, kinda paperwork. But the chaos is there and very real. No two days are the same and it‚Äôs often very fast paced, so I don‚Äôt have much time to think about certain issues. ‚Ä¶until I come home and can‚Äôt sleep because of something that was done or said earlier that day.¬†\n\nThis sounds exactly like my story. 18-37 then it started, moved jobs every six months and then finally hit my mental breaking point in high stress high performance work environments in 2023. Now I work at a little shop on the weekends selling comics and collectibles. That really destroyed me too.\n\nI have a new part time job cleaning a big company building. I‚Äôm mostly by myself doing my own thing with my headphones in and it‚Äôs really early in the morning so I don‚Äôt have to be around customers. It‚Äôs been great. I plan to get a second part time job when I‚Äôm ready.¬†\n\nThis is what I do too. Housekeeper for commercial buildings. Just get it done at my pace and left alone.\n\nI have a cleaning business and I employ many people with Anxiety Disorders. I too have anxiety so I can relate.\n\nI work from home - I have been for the last 3 1/2 years and I really think it saved my life.\n\nThis is me too. I got horrible panic and anxiety from my last office job. Was terrified to go back into the workforce but I have a WFH job and it really saved me, my livelihood and mental health\n\nI‚Äôm trying to get one right now, I‚Äôm in school for cyber security, but also need a work at home job that way I can truly balance stuff myself. \nIdk what online jobs are good for me tho, I‚Äôm trying to do remote IT work right now I‚Äôm very technical and know how things work without them even being explained to me,\n\nI worked as a fleet manager of 120+ vehicles and I‚Äôm telling you I can relate with a lot of fellas in here stress. Fucking. Kills. I thought the term ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt make diamonds without pressure‚Äù applied to me. It did for a short while. But even diamonds can get crushed. It sucks.\n\nI work as a cybersecurity analyst for a really small company (the only one actually) and I really think the only way I could enjoy this job to the fullest would be most of my days being work from home. From what you say, a lot of managers should like you, being able to read documentations first then asking questions later is something that my boss appreciates a lot. \n\nI think WFH is the only we that we can truly hit our full potential, away from the feel of corporate and being able to concentrate better tbh\n\nThis is me, unfortunately I currently live in a not ideal home - family are great but really needed to have a separate working room or office as some of my family members unfortunately couldn't really properly grasp the idea of working from home so it stresses me out more (not from the job).\n\nUgh.  I wish I could do this.  90% of my job could be done at home.\n\nIT and WFH for 3 years. It's a blessing to be able to cry at home when I'm stressed and not add to the stress of being in an office where I'd have to hide it.\n\nI have health anxiety yet I became a nurse. Maybe not a sound decision.\n\nI‚Äôm pre nursing , I got my bachelors in something else and I have health anxiety as well as GAD and I think it brings me comfort that if something happens to me I‚Äôll have medical professionals all around me lol\n\nThat would be reassuring. Myself I work in remote regions of Canada. Usually it‚Äôs just me! Perhaps it‚Äôs time to change locations. Move a bit south.\n\nI'm in a similar situation, have bachelor's but went back to school for nursing, currently in year 2 of 4. I have bad social anxiety and also general anxiety.\n\nI‚Äôm a nurse too! However I don‚Äôt have much health anxiety, and the health anxiety I *do* feel only started a couple years ago following the diagnosis of a rare neurological issue, and my anxiety is directly related to that. I have anxiety about OTHER peoples‚Äô health. Five years ago would have said I didn‚Äôt have anxiety until I was an adult, however after being a little more open with my struggles the last few years plus therapy in the last year has led me to see that that‚Äôs not true and I‚Äôve always been very anxious, even as a child.\n\nI believe I‚Äôm going through something very similar. Going through neurological tests at the moment and was told ive had anxiety for a long time I just masked it in certain ways.\n\nOmg, nurse with severe anxiety here, too! I found my niche in pacu bc the patients are asleep half their stay and likely won‚Äôt remember me. The social interactions are quick, not like a desk job.\n\nNursing student with bad soci anxiety here, making a note about pacu..\n\nI'm a nurse too, and never had health anxiety, until I started getting worried about htings like having a stroke! (Sorry: TW) I've been going to a therapist, and never thought I had anxiety and my therapist was like, \"yeah, you definitely have anxiety,\" and now I can see it. I just thought my racing thoughts were normal. Do you take any meds for it?\n\nI do not. Actually a walk through the bush for me works wonders. But I go through spells where the anxiety is severe. Seems to be more situational for me.\n\nI‚Äôm a nurse too. At work I can focus my anxiety. It‚Äôs not crazy to get a bandage and a second bandage and some quick clot and a tourniquet. Thinking for what could be wrong is a help\n\nI have severe health anxiety specific to my heart. And in nursing school. Did i make a bad choice ü•≤\n\nIt is less about the work I do and more about the environment. I work from home 100% and I am a one -woman show at work aka I don‚Äôt have to work with coworkers or bosses on my day to day tasks. I am never micromanaged. I have a handful of Zoom meetings a week but otherwise all of the communication is done via email. I can sleep when I need a nap, work late or early, have the TV or music on in the background, etc. I don‚Äôt have to listen to phones ring or get interrupted by needy coworkers lol. \n\nWorking in an office or any traditional retail jobs was so bad for my anxiety that I developed agoraphobia. Work from home with a good company is a dream for me.\n\nSame for me! One woman show working from home. Low interaction. Most meetings I am present for and don‚Äôt have to contribute much. I love it.\n\nSimilar situation for me! I do love it but it can be lonely sometimes and I miss having a team that I interact with on a regular basis but that‚Äôs just my preference. My anxiety still seeps through because the job expectations for me are perpetually ambiguous and subject to organizational politics and change. Good times.\n\nThis is the dream that I want. I like the field I am in but going into the office and having people constantly walking by my office makes me dread working in office\n\nI work full time as a developer in the Gaming industry. There‚Äòs rarely a day without anxiety. I found that playing the drums Helms me to cope\n\nI first read that as playing the helms deep drums.\n\nI‚Äôm a therapist. No matter what job I would have it would give me a lot of anxiety, but I think being a therapist is my best option compared to any other job,  I‚Äôm passionate about my job and enjoy it. I like seeing one person at a time and that I build a relationship with them. Definitely am anxious every time I go to work though ü•≤\n\nDo you ever share with your clients that you are anxious? I am client facing and always wish I could share because it would take pressure off, but I‚Äôm too scared to do so.\n\nYeah I do, not that I reveal the severity of it or anything. don‚Äôt want to take the attention off of the client. More just to normalize anxiety and that even me, a therapist who can seem like I have everything together, has experiences with anxiety.\n\nHow do they respond? Pretty good yeah? I feel like I‚Äôd really relate if I know my therapist has been through what I‚Äôm going through.\n\nYep! Sometimes I mention I see a therapist, and that makes the kids i see really surprised. I think for kids especially, it feels like adults have their shit together! That‚Äôs how I felt anyways as a kid. It‚Äôs nice to know it isn‚Äôt just you :)\n\nI‚Äôve considered going into mental health work when I‚Äôm better because I love this part of work. I work in education but as support staff so I often am helping students regulate and I share that I go to therapy, have mental health tattoos etc. it‚Äôs a great way to connect.\n\nI‚Äôm an EMT. The only thing that calms my anxiety is very extreme life or death situations. \n\n15 year old girl in cardiac arrest? No problem, cool as can be. \n\nWorking with a new partner for the first time? Silent panic attack for hours.\n\nSales.  Anxiety pushes me and my commissions to one of the highest in my company.  However it‚Äôs a double edged sword and I‚Äôm never satisfied\n\nYooooooo this is me and it‚Äôs wild to think about‚Äî it‚Äôs a bit of an addiction\n\nAbsolutely it is.  It‚Äôs a blessing and a curse because I‚Äôll never be content.\n\nHow do you convince yourself that your customers and coworkers don‚Äôt all hate you?\n\nlol I don‚Äôt\n\nI tried getting in sales and I'm honestly too anxious to do it - I was going to do door to door sales for a telecommunication company and just backed out cause I can't go knock on random peoples door.\n\nSame for cold calls, tried it and I just cannot do it... even if its automated, I just freeze\n\nI work in an insanely busy retail store and it‚Äôs probably the worst place ever for anxiety lol.  But my therapy is free ü´†\n\nI have worse anxiety about starting a new role than being established for a year.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm anxious about getting to know new coworkers, being trained on a new system. The worst is having to answer phone calls when you don‚Äôt know what questions the person on the other end is going to ask you. Then the customer sometimes gives you grief over not knowing the answer because ‚Äúisn‚Äôt that your job‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôd much rather be established. It‚Äôs part of the reason I‚Äôm still at my job that I don‚Äôt like.¬†\n\nHave you tried pushing through and staying?? You‚Äôve already made it through the part most people struggle with (in my opinion)\n\nFor me it‚Äôs the exact opposite - I‚Äôm fine at the beginning and learning a job because there are no expectations, people don‚Äôt mind if you‚Äôre rubbish. Once you‚Äôve been there a while you‚Äôre supposed to know what to do and not make any mistakes and that‚Äôs when my anxiety kicks in full force.\n\nI guess for me after it‚Äôs been a while I‚Äôm not anxious because I DO know what I‚Äôm doing. I still make mistakes but I just own up to them. I also don‚Äôt work in an industry where a mistake is costing the Company money. That would definitely be very scary.¬†\n\nMy mindset is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm human, I can‚Äôt be 100% perfect‚Äù¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs quite literally impossible to never make a mistake EVER. Think of all the forms you have to sign before surgery because even they make mistakes.¬†\n\nAnd tbh, no mistake I could ever make would be as bad as a surgeon making a mistake while operating on a patient¬†\n\nIn theory I understand that, but in action my anxious brain won‚Äôt let me relax. It has to be perfect!!!!!\n\nHonestly it‚Äôs the complete opposite for me. I can ask as many questions as I want when I start a new job, I pick things up quickly enough to make a good impression but there‚Äôs no expectation to do things completely independently - once you‚Äôve been there a while you can‚Äôt keep asking questions or for your manager to check something for you, and there‚Äôs an expectation that you‚Äôll socialise with your team members more because you‚Äôre no longer new. I work in an area where mistakes have the potential to cost the organisation a lot of time and money and this is a real struggle for me. I also get a little confidence kick in getting offered a job which sustains me for a while - once you‚Äôre in a role it seems you almost never get that level of reassurance again.\n\nI have a nightmare of a job in logistics. Non-stop emails, calls, texts on call 24 hours a day. I work 6 days a week but over time I've managed to come to terms with my situation. No one is holding a gun to my head it's just all about perspective and what's important to you. I'm thankful for what I have.\n\nSuffer and languish basically. The world simply doesn't accommodate people with anxiety properly at all and there's no way out.\n\nI work with dogs. They don't care if you're antisocial or freaking out. They just want love and to help you through it.  More than once I've had a bad attack at work and dogs just come up and lean on me or hug me or keep other rowdy dogs back so I can recover. It's one of the best things I've done for my anxiety!!\n\nI actually think a large driver of my anxiety is because of what I do for work. What I do is a boring, tedious, and mundane computer desk job. It gives me more ability to think about things and worry. I wish I had a job where I used my hands and got a good sweat. I think I‚Äôd be better off that way, from an anxiety standpoint.\n\nThis is so good for me to see. I used to be a teacher, currently delivering pizzas and have been planning out my next ‚Äúreal job‚Äù move. I am a bit torn between getting into an IT field or getting an apprenticeship with the electricians union. I‚Äôm leaning more towards the second for the exact reasons you are talking about here. I can‚Äôt see myself being happy sitting still for most of the day and looking at a screen.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm also considering going back for a short job training program to become a land surveyor.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI am a teacher, I struggle a lot with anxiety but I don't have social anxiety so this job is not hard for me to do. I love teaching.\n\nFor me it was the grading and lesson planning.  The actual teaching was easy.\n\nSame...the executive function stuff is hard (adhd) and then I get behind on it and my anxiety kicks into high gear and makes me avoid it, which puts me further behind.\n\nI'm a teacher, too. \n\nWhat about the informal pop ins?\n\nThose can send a teachers mind racing\n\nI'm a wedding photographer... god help me.\n\nNightshift care work in a guys house I just sit by myself all night and watch TV, it's great\n\nI had to be on disability for a couple of years because my panic attacks were preventing me from getting any work done. When not on disability I work with dogs (daycare, boarding, grooming)- it's way less scary than working with humans, lol\n\nYou will never work anxiety free.  You are right.  You adjust.  You plow through crap so that the load to do isn‚Äôt overwhelming.  You take medicine.  You make lists and make plans.  It sucks but that‚Äôs how work is at this point.  I work as a PM for govt.\n\nI work in food service.  I find that it actually helps my anxiety because I am constantly moving around and I am preoccupied.  I don't have the time to think about what's making me feel anxious.  Everyone is different though!\n\nWorking with the public keeps my anxiety high as social anxiety is part of my general anxiety yet I manage an entire convenience store including hiring and letting employees go as well as dealing with angry customers. Makes a lot of sense to me. Been doing this for about 10 years now.\n\nI hae GAD and health anxiety, and yet decided to become a licensed mortician. Ive recently realized my job is having a negative effect on my mental health lol. But I've dedicated a lot of time to becoming licensed and honestly I'm really good at it, so I guess I'll just keep up my weekly therapy lol.\n\nI just became a high school principal. Don‚Äôt ever let anyone tell you that anxiety will make it impossible to have a career. Some days I suffer through, but I just put one foot in front of the other. My anxiety has never hurt me or made me say anything crazy.\n\nI‚Äôm a teacher. Do you think your anxiety makes you more empathetic with parents, teachers, etc?\n\nHonestly, it‚Äôs hard. I‚Äôm a lawyer and got diagnosed with anxiety two years ago. I don‚Äôt want to quit my career but some times it‚Äôs unbearable and I have ‚Äòemergency‚Äô meds just in case it gets really bad.\n\nLawyer here too and also struggle mightily with my anxiety.\n\nI for some reason have picked the most anxiety inducing careers. Child care and now health care. I think I might be a masochist.\n\nI manage the calendar for a mid-sized law firm. I keep my headphones on all day, my dept is just me and I communicate with people mostly via email. The only thing that could make it better is removing the phone call aspect (I hate making calls but I just have to call the same state hotline several times a day so the routine makes it less anxiety inducing) and if the job was fully remote.\n\nTeaching - the kids give me the feel of a second chance at childhood. I promised to become the teacher I never had.\n\nI am a litigation/trial attorney and it is rough, lol. On a lot of medications.\n\nI‚Äôve been a lawyer for over 20 years and my anxiety is finally interfering with work and making me rethink my path.\n\nI do dishwashing, sweeping, mopping and other janitorial stuff for my university‚Äôs culinary center part time. It‚Äôs the least anxiety inducing job I‚Äôve had in my life, and the highest paying one too. I‚Äôm 22 with a high school diploma\n\nI‚Äôm a vet hospital receptionist. I get to sit down all day (I have POTS), I am constantly busy, I feel fulfilled and I just do well when my brain is kept occupied. I don‚Äôt work bad hours either, but I got lucky there. Plus, Zoloft helps.\n\nWork from home. Software Dev\n\nI work in advertising. It‚Äôs an industry full anxious individuals unfortunately.¬†\n\nI work retail.  It‚Äôs not ideal, but I make, what I see as, good money.  I recently got a job that pays almost double what my last one did every two weeks.  The joy of not having financial stress every week is unbelievable.\n\nI take medication, and try my best to manage my anxiety the best I can.  I grew up being told that unless you were dying‚Ä¶you goto work.  So even in the face of anxiety attacks, I just persevere.\n\nI give my full attention and ability to the job everyday.  That‚Äôs all anyone can ask of me.\n\nI work as a sommelier.¬†\n\nI make perfume\n\nI have anxiety on top of a never ending foggy fatigued high kinda head feeling. Its all day everyday. Work is tough for 2 yrs. Running low on savings\n\nI left work, and now offer house cleaning, so I can choose when and how often I want to work. It helps forcing myself to get out of the house\n\nI work at a sandwich shop and have about two panic attacks here a week :)\n\nI work in a call center and this has destroyed my mental health. I‚Äôm constantly having nightmares, going to the hospital to get ekgs cause my panic attacks are SO bad i think it‚Äôs a heart attack and etc. it‚Äôs absolutely hell.\n\nI work from home. Senior admin assistant for a government contracting company.\n\nI'm a cashier/stocker at a small shop. I'm the only employee during the week there. Most of the customers don't speak English so I just show them the screen, they pay and they leave.\n\nYou get the occasional Karen but nothing too bad.\n\nBoss shows up every once in a blue moon to drop off merch.\n\nIf it's not busy and everything is in order I can read or just play on my phone.\n\nIt's a pretty chill job.\n\nI work in healthcare administration, I do the background work. Although I was a teller while I finished my bachelors, direct customer service is a big anxiety factor for me.\n\nA good, suitable job will reduce your anxiety and not provoke it. Most people are miserable at their job and to others because it stresses them, when it really shouldn't.\n\nIt prevented me from getting a job as an attorney\n\nI am still working on it. I had 4-7 jobs in a year, year and half span one time. Something that has semi worked for me is pet sitting. I set my own hours and I get to choose who to be around. It can also be stressful and overwhelming if I work a lot though.  The pay just isn‚Äôt enough to the hours I put in. I hate loud noises. I hate being away from home overnight. Thinking about trying to transition to only cat sitting. \n\nBut I am working on working with the public again. I don‚Äôt think I could do 40 hours though. So I am going to try 1-2 days, 8-16 hours and see how that goes. \n\nI would love a work home from job but most of those seem to deal with people. I don‚Äôt want that.\n\nI work as a paralegal in commercial real estate at a law firm that represents private banks. In a day to day way, I answer emails, make loan documents, have a small team that answers to me, and a really great boss that I answer to. The only time I actually interact with people, who aren't my coworkers, is when I have to call someone or take a call, which is really not often. Calls used to be extremely intimidating, but now that I've been here for almost 5 years, I'm more or less used to it. I started out here where my job was solely helping the \"closers\" here make documents, making $20/hr. As I kept just drilling away, I got some more info and naturally learned more. I've been promoted a few times since, and my new official title is \"Senior Closing Paralegal\" and there's only 2 others with that title in the company. So that's p cool. I get a substantial bonus every year, and with my next raise, I'm on track to reach 100k, bonus included. I don't hate it, I don't love it, I get weekends off, and I usually don't have to work when I get home. Could be worse!\n\nI have panic disorder/GAD and I work in a library as an archivist position. I'm not the head of our department and I'd say my job is 75% working with materials, 25% working with the public. Some days are really hard because patrons can be overwhelming, but for the most part it's chill and I do a lot of research. I've also cried in my boss' office a few times and it hasn't affected my job in any way.\n\nI‚Äôm struggling with that. I‚Äôve discovered that I can‚Äôt work face to face with other coworkers, and the fact that I struggle with communication is very painful for me. I was very extroverted as a child, even now, most of my friends and relatives think that I‚Äôm very sociable but it‚Äôs not true. So, if there‚Äôs any recommendations how‚Äôs it possible to stop being anxious around other people, I‚Äôd be glad to hear them.\n\nCybersecurity. Don‚Äôt recommend. Guess I‚Äôm a glutton for punishment.\n\nFor the *exact* reasons you mentioned, I work as a substitute teacher and I love it. No/low pressure, autonomy, and I get to decide each day where (and *if*) I want to work. I do my job for that day and go home. If it was a bad day, I never have to go back! After 20 years of trying permanent jobs and then going back to subbing, I've finally realized that subbing is the best fit for me and my anxiety.\n\nI've been considering getting into subbing for the reasons you mentioned.\n\nGo to work with anxiety üòÖ\n\nI‚Äôm a journalist but I work from home which helps!\n\nI manage a car dealership and have 42 staff to look after.  Tests the old GAD sometimes for sure.\n\nI've mostly worked customer service jobs which can be absolute hell but the customer love me because my anxiety makes me such a people pleaser. I also worked for dog kennels and that was really great except for the management I dealt with, I tried 3 separate places and the management drove me away every time, typically because of them being irresponsible and ending with me having a panic attack because the dogs were in danger, but if you like animals and have experience with them, jobs like that are awesome, especially if you can find a solid place that isn't trying to cut ever corner possible for extra profit. One of the places I was even hired on as a manager because of my experience and was comfortable taking calls and setting up dog accounts on the computer and giving meds because once I got through all that I got to de-stress with the dogs. \n\nCurrently, I'm fortunate to be married and have my husband's income, so I only work a couple days a week at a gas station, even that can be taxing, but I don't feel so all consumed by it and the owner is so great, I love him and the supervisor to pieces. They always make a point to pull me aside and tell me how great I'm doing. His son has severe anxiety and I think he recognized it in me and does what he can to support me! I think at the end of the day, that's really what it's all about. I'm almost 30 and I've had horrible bosses in the past and they always made my anxiety 100x worse. Find good people and things get better, which I know very well is easier said than done, but don't feel bad about leaving because the boss is toxic because that's the only way you'll find somewhere that doesn't completely wear you down.\n\nI‚Äôm a trial lawyer. I, for some reason, have always gravitated toward high stress careers. If I wasn‚Äôt a lawyer, I‚Äôd have tried to become a homicide detective despite having vasovagal syncope triggered by blood and guts.\n\nI worked in a schizophrenic mental health care home for 7 years. It really took a drain on me and I never really suffered anxiety physically until 6 years in. It changed me massively and seemed to have sprung out of nowhere. It made me very ill. That's when I realised I need to change my life. I moved into basically compiling complaint data for Barclays. I literally work from home, and some days I don't even speak to a single person. I'm only a few months in, but so far it was one of the best decisions I made. \nAnxiety sucks, and it was scary to me how much it took over my body. Which in turn obviously made it worse. \nHope you all stay safe out there. Never be afraid of making tough decisions to benefit yourself.\n\nThis sounds interesting. What‚Äôs your job title to do work like that? Did you need a data analysis background or is it just a case of gathering things together?\n\nI only ask because I‚Äôve always thought data analysis where I barely talked to anyone and just get to look at huge data sets all day would suit me, but I don‚Äôt have any education or experience in that\n\nI deliver for spark. Before that DoorDash and Grubhub. Because I‚Äôm able to take off when I mentally and/or physically can‚Äôt do it. Thankfully I have a very supportive husband.\n\nYou can find anxiety across all fields.  I never cease to be amazed at how people can do so e jobs with high anxiety.\n\n\"Anxiety that comes with the expectations of being an established employee\" woooooow you hit the nail on the head for me! This has been most of my life. I was always so anxious to be in a job because I was terrified I'd be in that position forever. I had an interview at Old Navy once and they were saying have fast you can become a manager and work your way up and that scared me off. I had many one-day jobs where I left after a day because I couldn't handle this pressure I felt. Because of my anxiety towards jobs I am in my mid-30's with no 401K or anything for my future yet.  It took me a long time to have a steady job and I actually fell into childcare/nannying. This has been nice because although I have the pressure of caring for children, I'm pretty much in charge. But even this job has incredibly high stressors. I recently got my master's degree and I'm now struggling with anxiety about getting a job in THAT field even though it is a dream career, as I have never worked with adults before. \n\nI don't know if this helped you but I understand your struggle and wish you the best. &lt;3\n\nI‚Äôm in PR and while I think my anxiety really pushed me to be successful, it also impacts me in various other ways, like IBS, breaking into hives, etc.\n\nI ended up having to get support from family so that I could work fewer hours at a less demanding job. It sucks not being self sufficient but it's better than losing my mind.\n\nI‚Äôm a speech therapist. I needed something low stress but high paying. I‚Äôm happy with it.\n\nI‚Äôm a PM and am really good at pointing out how projects will/could fail. I‚Äôve reframed my anxiety as a superpower ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I‚Äôm also more than 20 years in my career and have learned to create better professional and personal boundaries. I must have time to rest and recover‚Ä¶ yes, this means I don‚Äôt socialize as much but I only do as much as I can. I forgive myself for the things I can‚Äôt do and accept my limitations.\n\nFWIW, I think Morra Aarons-Mele‚Äôs work on mental health, specifically anxiety, in the workplace is very interesting. Her book and podcast The Anxious Achiever have been really enlightening for me: https://morraam.com/books\n\nIronically had to quit my job in mental health because I had too much anxiety running groups. I now clean houses.\n\nfor some reason, something that is busy and mentally demanding.\n\nif it makes me use a lot of thinking and it's stressful then to me my anxiety kinda hides in the corner\n\nI work in healthcare (my anxiety isn‚Äôt social so it‚Äôs different). But working with sick people calms my anxiety, I‚Äôm constantly moving and completing tasks I don‚Äôt have time to get stuck in my thoughts. I could NEVER do a desk job, stuck in meetings, conferences, project due dates, presentations etc. I get to work, get my list of things to do and complete them. Every day is different and every day is new.\n\ni‚Äôm a vet nurse. do not recommend for people with anxiety. lol\n\nIf I could make a deal with you, I‚Äôd ask you to work 1 year as a 911 dispatcher. No this isn‚Äôt a joke, and I‚Äôm not being snarky. I no longer work as a dispatcher but forever thankful for what it taught me. 1: I learned what I‚Äôm really capable of. I handled situations I never that I‚Äôd be able to. This was not because I suddenly overcame my anxiety, but actually understood it. 2: when you hear the persons voice on the other end of the phone, a switch is flipped inside of you. Almost calming. You realize that this person (in a legitimate call) is having the literal worst day of their life and you are quite literally their lifeline. You hear actual life or death panic in their voice. You lock in, knowing that this single conversation is more important than your fears. After processing much of that experience I‚Äôve realized most of my anxiety comes from my own expectations of myself. I still have anxiety, don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs a natural emotion of wanting to do better. However, I‚Äôm able to live with it. I only give you this example, to express to you that you have this capability. You‚Äôre stronger than you think. I don‚Äôt know you, but I understand how you may feel and many others do too. I wholeheartedly hope this helps even in the slightest. You still get to choose how you live your life.\n\nim a nail tech who‚Äôs going back to school soon for the full cosmo license. making my own schedule is the only thing thats allowed me to escape the crushing burnout and eventual quitting that every other job has led to for me. i find when i know no one is watching me like a hawk and LITERALLY in charge of my livelihood, anxiety dampens quite a lot. i totally know what ur going thru OP. it sucks\n\nI have literally one of the worst jobs for someone living with an anxiety disorder, which is retail. I desperately want out and desperately fail at interviews for better jobs due to said anxiety. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Though I understand in a community of others struggling there may not be the time or energy for that.\n\nFull time personal shopper at Walmart, October will be 2 years.  I basically get paid to work out.  It's been great for my mental health to drink a ton of water and I get to listen to music all day.\n\nI also take much better care of myself as opposed to a few years ago when I was doing a ton of bad things.  Eating well, taking my meds, and great sleep have helped me tremendously.\n\nIts a stress free job....of course I have to meet metrics but I do that w/o any issues.  I have a ton of freedom and hardly ever hear anything from my managers.   No deadlines, no emails to check or vm's to return.  I just go in, do the job, go home.\n\nEngineering\n\nThe total opposite of what someone who stereotypically has anxiety would do - I run a business and regularly perform on stage. \n\nFor me in these roles I feel comfortable, so the anxiety is generally limited. I‚Äôve always thought it‚Äôs interesting that I can be a performer but also have crippling anxiety when I come home. It‚Äôs hard to explain tbh, but maybe I just feel more free in these roles? So there‚Äôs less to be anxious about ironically, idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nI found exactly the same thing. When I worked as a performer, I could control my anxiety ‚Äì I think it even helped ‚Äì and I ended up doing mostly improv! When I had to leave the performing arts behind and climb the corporate ladder, the anxiety became debilitating again .\n\nCustomer Service. I have the flavor of anxiety that gets bad when I'm alone and not talking to people.\n\nSame, lost every job due to it as well.i do e  commerce and it actually is super lucrative and non stressful.very easy to get into, if you would like an in I would happily set you up!\n\nI am interested. Should I DM?\n\nHR\n\nReservations coordinator at a hotel. It pays terribly but I can get the job done\n\ni work as an eyewear consultant (sales) currently. i‚Äôve also been a receptionist (x3), a budtender, and switchboard operator. i‚Äôm hoping to get my foot in the door working in a lab so i won‚Äôt have a patient/people facing position. i feel like working with people (esp upset people) burns me out and makes me a lot more prone to anxiety.\n\nI work in mental health care as an administrator. In a director level role and my anxiety helps me not make mistakes but has been taking a toll. I was able to stop medication but recently had to go back to using it again as well as returning to therapy. But it‚Äôs worth it.\n\nIm a teacher...it's not easy on days where I just want to hide in a hole. I have to be energetic, happy, and \"on\" ALL the time. But at the same time the structure and routine are very good for my anxiety.\n\nI work in Produce at a Grocery Store. Working towards an Assistant Manager job. Produce is the best part of a grocery store to me.\n\nI‚Äôm a medical assistant.\n\nWhat do we do? Suffer. I have severe anxiety and I just have to deal with it.\n\nWork in mental health full time doing mental health and substance use disorder assessments and diagnosis.\n\nCurrently unemployed due to emigrating to a country that doesn't allow the medication that helped control the GAD, panic disorder, insomnia, and PTSD, so trying to figure out life coming off these meds. The panic from this is possibly worse than the past few years ‚Äì I worked in communications management, content management, marketing, online learning, editing, and writing for high-stress companies with, generally, extremely long hours as I climbed the corporate ladder. But that seems to be the norm for my skillset. \n\nBefore that, I worked as a performer and I made and sold jewellery. That allowed me to keep the stress and anxiety mostly under control and so I had a higher quality of life.\n\nI'm a software engineer (for 15 years now) and I started having panic attacks during meetings a couple years in. I have a therapist and I'm on anti-depressants and that helps a lot. For a while I self medicated with stimulants and alcohol and it was not a good idea. I've also been working remotely since COVID which makes it a lot easier to find space and take a breather if I find it too overwhelming.\n\nAnxiety is a disability, if you have a job that can be done remotely you might be able to get an allowance for remote work. I was in the process of doing so at my current job before the workforce went 100% remote, and I just got a full-time remote working allowance during that time (moving out of state helped there). If you're trying to go at it alone and you don't have support from a doctor or a therapist or from your company it's going to be difficult.\n\nI let them promote me too high up. But I enjoyed being a instructional designer. \n\nSomehow I became a college administrator. Think assistant provost. I can't get them to demote me, and if I apply to jobs I want they view me as over qualified.\n\nI do tech work remotely from home.\n\nFunny timing for this question‚Ä¶15 minutes ago, I had to really really make an effort to fight off a panic attack at work because I thought $6k of equipment went missing on my watch. I found  the equipment, but a side of me that had been dormant for 6+ months showed up. It was disturbing and the only thing I could do was separate myself and emotionally purge it out. Probably not a lot of help.\n\nHave you tried medication or therapy? I take medication and work in IT as an apps analyst.\n\nI‚Äôm in therapy, which is great and I can address immediate concerns but it doesn‚Äôt seem to address the underlying general anxiety. Maybe I need to try medication\n\nI work in a job that causes anxiety.\n\nThe post office!\n\nNaturally, I work in an extremely stressful finance role.\n\ni have pots and anxiety and i‚Äôm unemployed. i‚Äôm in college to get my degree in psychology and become a counselor how ironic\n\nClinical lab worker in a hospital  with extreme health anxiety.\n\nFabricator for a very very small company\n\nI work with kids / teens in a summer camp. Oddly enough they actually keep my mind busy because there‚Äôs so much going on all the time\n\nI work in research, biotech\n\nWelder / fabricator at a company that‚Äôs very lenient and understanding about mental health\n\nProject management. Its such a stressful and difficult role Im surprised im good at it.\n\nI do security. I am lucky enough I work at an empty building, no co workers no micromanaging. The only downside is I work 16 hours days and all by myself my mind can spiral easily (I have really bad health anxiety).\n\naircraft maintenance in the military, it's super high tempo when im at work so i just stay too busy for my mind to wander lol, plus free therapy\n\nwork from home\n\nMy anxiety keeps me from looking for better work. Bern at the same company almost 7 years now.\n\nI've been freelancing as a graphic designer and motion designer for the past 4 years but honestly the uncertainty, the lack of structure in my days, the lack of colleagues/peers to talk to and the long hours grinding on my computer in hyperfocus haven't been great for my anxiety. Applied for a fulltime job again and starting in September, I believe it's going to be a lot better.\n\nI‚Äôm a teacher.. lol I asked for this\n\nI only work some Wednesdays and sundays due to other health issues but I work with kids as a crafting attendant at our local library. They do crafts and I have to help, I can present crafts I want to do with them to my boss and can take 5 minutes whenever I need. It‚Äôs a very loose environment because the kids are super sweet!\n\nYou‚Äôre not going to believe this but I work at Trader Joe‚Äôs. The crazy part is I take meds for my ADHD twice a day which sometimes causes anxiety and then I take Xanax in low doses once or twice a day to help with my anxiety. Not the best job for anxiety but I‚Äôm way happier than I have ever been (I had a toxic work environment at my last job if 6 years where I felt stuck and experienced ‚Äúfull burnout‚Äù).\n\nI managed to land a very unstable job in a very stable organization and as a result I constantly have anxiety about getting laid off and people constantly try to comfort me by saying it‚Äôll never happen. I‚Äôm trying to transition to a more stable job but can‚Äôt seem to get my foot in anywhere.\n\nGetting a work from home healthcare job was a sanity saver for me. Some people think it‚Äôs bonkers I stay in my house for days, but if you love your home, why feel that way? LOL\n\nThe only thing I hate about it is when people assume it‚Äôs all fun &amp; games or I have no expenses. No, I‚Äôm very much focused &amp; in work mode in a designated area. And being that it‚Äôs a 1099 (paying all my taxes OOP vs. them being taken out by my employer), I pay for everything needed for this job. The upside is it‚Äôs all tax deductible, including my internet &amp; phones.\n\nI became a therapist lol\n\nI was a derivatives trader in 1980‚Äôs /1990 my stomachs gets knotted just thinking about it. At first I loved it- then to me it was everyday like walking through a mine field : is this the day I loose everything, every single day!!\n\nI'm a teacher. I used to teach at multiple schools at once but I ended up leaving due to anxiety and depression. Now I work part time as a trainee teacher (I haven't graduated from college yet). Different responsibilities and less workload. I used to be on meds and that helped for a while. I don't take anxiety medication anymore cause I can't afford them. I'm terrified of becoming a full-time teacher again. Yay.\n\nI‚Äôm a certified Medical Administration Assistant, however I had to start off doing Intake at an ER at a hospital, working nights for 12 hours‚Ä¶I just couldn‚Äôt handle working the night shift. So, then I was doing intake at a Women‚Äôs clinic last year and then was ‚Äúlet go‚Äù out of the blue (they played favorites and there was one lady that  had been there for 8 years and didn‚Äôt like me, was very rude to fellow co-workers and patients and she was also best friends with one of the HR ladies) I was never given a reason for being let go, but I know it was her call. Anyway, I‚Äôve been working full time animal care like Dog-Boarding, Doggy Day Care, Dog Walks, etc. and I‚Äôm much more happy doing this!\n\nI own my own sports recovery business down town. \n\nI only have to be at work an hour- 2 hours a day. I do take off every other day. \n\nI did set myself up for this tho. \nI‚Äôm 26. Plan on building/ creating quite a bit more for the future. \n\nMy drive came from places I didn‚Äôt want to be in any longer. \nLong story. \nI‚Äôm not medicated. Went through quite a bit of trauma. Came out the other side with many gifts. Life is beautiful.\n\nI‚Äôm a retired teacher and it was an extremely stressful job. Due to the lack of substitutes I was back at work a week after my own husband‚Äôs death. I needed the money, so my anxiety was never nm something that I could even consider as a reason to not work. I just had to get up and go to work anyway. I was finally able to retire, but once I did I lost my daughter 6 months in. Stress is there anyway . Now I‚Äôve decided to go back to work as a sub because of some medical bills and trying to make ends meet. I‚Äôve learned that there is stress in life no matter if I‚Äôm working or not it. I‚Äôve had to just learn to deal with it and move on. I have anxiety whether I‚Äôm working or not. It‚Äôs even more stressful to have to worry financially, so I choose to work. And the only work I know how to do is teaching. It‚Äôs a vicious circle.\n\nInvestment supervision. I have times when the anxiety is overwhelming because I have to interact with certain financial advisors regarding difficult issues -this is not often, but it does happen. Overall the anxiety makes me a superior supervisor since I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I am highly regarded and have a history of promotions, bonuses and raises. The benefits have far outweighed the times when I'm crying and frustrated. I think I would cry anywhere I worked, but at least this job has good comp and benefits. I do not have a bachelor's, but I did have to independently study for and pass multiple securities industry licensing tests.\n\nI am a nurse but anxiety just happens before I go to work. Once I'm busy and things go fast, adrenaline kicks in and I thrive.\n\nI work from home\n\nI work from home for medical reasons it was extremely hard when I had to go into the office before I got sick.\n\nMy official title is ‚ÄòSales Manager and Marketing Assistant‚Äô which is a bunch of hogwash meaning that I am a cashier in a small business who helps with the online marketing presence for shop. The job is quite stress-free and I‚Äôve come to really love it. When it is quiet in the shop, my coworkers and I just gossip until someone comes in asking if we sell so-and-so. \n\nIt‚Äôs taken me a while to get to a pay that can provide a comfortable life but now that I‚Äôm at that point it is one of the best things ever. No high expectations, no panic attacks, just some OCD related hyper fixation on presentation of stock. Not much social anxiety either because the average interaction with a customer is:\n\n‚ÄúHiya. Do you want a 10p carrier bag? Ok. That‚Äôs ¬£10.48 altogether. Cash or card? Yep that‚Äôs all good, thank you :)‚Äù \n\nWhich isn‚Äôt that anxiety inducing. \n\nI only took this job because my perfectionism and anxiety was causing me to break down and I hope to move to something with a bit higher pay in a more specialised area. I‚Äôve always wanted to become a criminal barrister and need to complete my law degree but I took a gap year for mental health. It‚Äôs a good job and I‚Äôm happy right now.\n\nI‚Äôm a Civil Engineer who specializes in heavy utility construction and water resource management. Office life is hard to handle, I overthink all the dialogue. In the field, I love the guys. Construction folk are blunt, and straight to the point honest. I find I console with that as it helps keep the overthinking to a minimum. Brutal honesty is the only way I think it‚Äôs true\n\nEdit: My anxiety keeps me deadline oriented I will say. That is the only plus. I have to give myself breaks though, I overwork myself.. my PMs love me!\n\nI work in broadcast television. Luckily I have a good work environment so it doesn't trigger my anxiety much. I enjoy my job and tend to lose track of time/my head because I'm focused on work. The Lexapro also helps. I work in an extremely large building so if I feel anxiety coming on, I'll usually go take a walk on a familiar route. I'm also often standing so I like to sway side to side and helps keep things at bay.\n\nI‚Äôm a professor. The work is fulfilling and I have somewhat flexible hours.\n\nI‚Äôm a program director at a museum/tourist destination. There are days it‚Äôs really hard, but I‚Äôm 40 now and have had anxiety since I was 14, so I‚Äôve really dove deep into developing good coping skills. It helps that I love my job and it‚Äôs hectic, so I don‚Äôt actually have time to consider being anxious. I just have to go, go, go!\n\nPlus, I have coworkers who understand and support me when needed. We were headed to a lunch meeting one day and I suddenly couldn‚Äôt breathe at the thought of riding in someone else‚Äôs car, so I told them I needed to drive myself. One coworker asked if I wanted to be alone or if I wanted company. He‚Äôs the chillest human on the planet, so he rode with me and just chatted the whole way. I was breathing normally again by the time we arrived.\n\nI‚Äôm a full time supervisor at a theme park. Summer season has increased my anxiety but I‚Äôve been able to ground myself. I bring my hydroxide with me, smoke cigars on my breaks when I need and take mental health days when I feel the need. Just remember you don‚Äôt owe anyone anything and your mental health matters above all. The feelings are temporary and jobs have protocol for events like this (paid sick leave, extended leave, etc)\n\nI have a regular 9-5. You just gotta get thru it\n\nI developed GAD and still have no clue why but i work as a Biomed technician.\n\nAccountant. Granted it's a small business and I'm constantly pushed out of my comfort zone. But most of the time I'm left to do what I do and I enjoy critical thinking and problem solving. It is a great fit for social anxiety and being in a small tight company is good because it makes me incredibly valuable because no one else can really do what I do. In turn, It's a lot of pressure, but the pros outweigh the cons by 98%.\n\nI work in a corporate job.\n\nI‚Äôm lucky to work hybrid and only have to go in 1-2 times a week so that‚Äôs my saving grace. For me it‚Äôs more of being in a fairly consistent level of stress when being in the office that builds. \n\nI‚Äôve never disclosed this too my work as they aren‚Äôt too overbearing, but it helps that I feel comfortable that I could if I needed too.\n\nI work full time as a daycare co-teacher. It‚Äôs not an easy job but it‚Äôs never a dull moment and all my anxiety goes away having fun with my little friends\n\nOne of my favorite jobs I had was a stocker in a restaurant that also had some convenience grab and go stuff. (Disney resort) It was high stress in someways making sure we had enough of everything for the night. But it was not guest facing. I was completely behind the scenes and it was low enough stakes that if I made a mistake I could fix it fairly easily by going to the main restaurant hub for the resort and filling the order myself. I liked that job a lot because it kept me busy and the time flew by. Physical jobs can be challenging but sometimes they can really take your mind off of things! \n\nI‚Äôve heard kind of the same thing from stressed out teachers leaving their job and working at Costco and absolutely loving it. \nBut I get anxiety when working with large groups so Costco would be hard for me. \nRight now I am a freelance researcher and it has been absolutely fantastic. I work primarily with a small team. But this is only possibly because my income is just a support at this point and not what we rely on.\n\nI'm a high school teacher. I shan't elaborate.\n\nI work part time as a novel translator.\n\nI work a full time high stress job in law enforcement support. Anxiety is at the highest at work naturally. I have to keep reminding myself it‚Äôs the just anxiety and when it gets too much I have emergency meds available. (Judge me if you want). I love my job but I do take days off more now. My boss knows my condition and is very understanding and works with me since this started."

    "body": "So with the recent election results in the US, I know I'm going to be constantly surrounded with the most soul crushing news every single day. I remember the 2016 election cycle, and the next four years after that, I was deep in my doomscrolling and it seemed like every time I refreshed or opened an app, some new ridiculous, dangerous, ugly thing was being reported.\n\nIt affected my mental health so much and drove me into having panic attacks, aggression, nihilism, and even suicidal thoughts once in a while. I know this time will not be any different, and in fact, will probably be *much* worse.\n\nI told my wife as soon as the results were out that it's a great idea to get off of social media as much as possible, as it's only going to make things worse. So I advise you all, for the sake of your mental health, limit your screen time. Go outside, read, exercise, play music, hang with friends, do what you gotta do to escape this reality and do what's best for you.\n\nWe live once, and things like this are usually outside of our control, so it's best to focus on you and the people you love and care about. I love you guys, good luck to you all out there, and take care of yourselves and each other.\n",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Anxiety) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nI deleted all social media years ago. I only use Reddit. For me, it wasn't because of politics because I'm not the least bit interested, but it's because social media is filled with a lot of negativity\n\nThe comments on instagram, Facebook, and Twitter are the stupidest words ever typed in the history of humanity.\n\nWhat a wonderful message and as we are in our 70s, we know we must take this approach or we‚Äôll be damaging our health. We‚Äôre still in a state of grief and shock,but after seeing best friends today for lunch I felt better. My husband raked leaves and it was a beautiful Fall day in CO. I‚Äôm starting to question my directing so much of my anger at my TX Maga family, although for my own mental health, emotional distancing from them should have happened a while ago. Struggling with all that.\n\nWeirdly at least when it was first announced, social media helped me feel better. Felt less alone as lots of people were feeling the same as me. I‚Äôm also the type that likes learning about things to feel more prepared and there‚Äôs been a decent amount of helpful information that I found enlightening about the whole thing. \n\nBut yeah at the same time I get where you‚Äôre coming from. I definitely have to take breaks sometimes and have had moments where seeing something sets off anxiety, sadness, anger, and the like.\n\nI kinda needed to hear that in the exact way you put it. 2016 to 2020 was exactly like that for me, I needed someone to remind me.\n\nI deleted Twitter today and am unfollowing a lot of non real friends on IG. Keeping Reddit.\n\nThis is such an important reminder. It‚Äôs tough, but taking breaks from the constant stream of news can help restore some balance. Take care of yourself and those around you.\n\nI stayed on reddit only because it‚Äôs got topics that aren‚Äôt related to politics. But you‚Äôre right.¬†\n\nGreat advice!\n\nI‚Äôve taken a break from Facebook. I didn‚Äôt ever use it for much anyways. It‚Äôs been four days, and I have fifty notifications. I guarantee you 47 of them are Facebook trying to get me to engage.\n\nBetter yet teach the algorithms to work for you and not against you. R/optimistsunite has been helping me get more positive information out of reddit for instance. Less doom and gloom and more silver linings and education.\n\nYall! Seriously, I deleted all socials earlier this year and it sucked for maybe like two weeks but one day I just decided I was never turning back. Its so nice to live in my own bubble, granted it didnt fix everything of course. But it really helped me not get stuck in a doom scroll, or comparing myself and my life. Especially with the election, I was able to make it a good amount of time through the day without knowing the results, and I found out on my own time because I decided, not my phone! Its game changing, 10/10 recommend\n\nA wise advice, not only for people with mental issues. Websites based around people not interests/issues are utter trash\n\nThis is really a helpful and essential suggestion. My life truly gets better without social media which brings amount of anxiety\n\nStop reading news helped me a lot. I haven't been following any political news for years. Best decision ever.\n\nAgree \nAnd stop watching the FAKE NEWS\n\nOh mah lord‚Ä¶ Everything is gonna be fine üòÇ\n\nIt‚Äôs good to do that no matter who wins. Both sides just do name calling and the ‚Äúnews‚Äù networks are just opinions now. \n\nPodcasts are the real news now where people actually discuss their differences. What a concept.\n\nYou need to realize statistic show  about 15% of the left and right are radical and the majority of Americans agree on most issues. The media tries to tear us apart but it‚Äôs never as bad as the vocal minority make it out to be on Twitter\n\nI‚Äôm in the polls and stats business.\n\nPodcasts are not in any way shape or form a dependable source of news my man. Any fucking idiot can have one, and some of the most popular ones are run by people who have no idea what they are talking about.\n\nWell, there are millions of podcasts, so im obviously talking about a few of the good ones. The news one I listen to is one of the most popular ones with a man and a women, and they discuss the daily news, shes a liberal and hes conversative and they talk about pros and cons of each. Thats normal. I watched all stations the day of the election and all MSNBC panel did was call Trump a racist and Nazi and that Harris was going to win. Is that news or opinion? Explain to me how thats news? \n\nAlso statistics show podcasts are the future. Like I said, MSNBC and CNN are a thing of the past and have awful ratings. Meanwhile news podcasts have 10x the listeners and thats where all the talent is going."

    "all_comment_text": "I think it‚Äôs called anticipation anxiety\n\nIt‚Äôs an ADHD trait of mine\n\n[removed]\n\nI also do the alarm thing, but it only helps so much, because then I start anticipating the alarm itself lol\n\nI do this as well. And yep, the alarm only makes me anxious for the alarm to go off. I keep looking at it just to make sure I didn‚Äôt set it wrong. My fear is that it won‚Äôt go off. Ugh!!!üò©\n\nThank you for explaining my life I get crazy anticipation anxiety even if I'm waiting for a friend to come over\n\ni had no idea this was an adhd thing!\n\nThanks for the clarification! I have a question, I started having anxiety attacks about 7 years ago, luckily, it's more handled now, but I was having the appointment focus issue years before that. Should I speak to my doctor and get tested for ADAD? Tbh,I really don't think I have it, but it's possible I have other symptoms and just don't realize it! Any suggestions, really appreciated!\n\nWaiting mode can be a form of anticipatory anxiety, and is not necessarily indicative of someone having ADHD. I‚Äôd encourage you to research how ADHD presents in adults and see if any of that aligns with your experience. If it does, you‚Äôll want to find a psychiatrist who does ADHD assessments for a diagnosis. Struggling with task initiation and focus, sensitivity to noise, my all or nothing mentality, overall forgetfulness, and how much I struggle with basic routines/chores like cleaning, cooking etc are all just a handful of the symptoms that led me to seek out an assessment. There are a few subreddits that have a ton of great info and guides that you could look at too.\n\nThank you! If ever I get past my procrastination, I'll do more research üôÉ/s. \n*I'm going to look through the subs now, thx!*\n\nI call it adhd!\n\ni got my adhd diagnosis as a full grown adult about two years ago and each day i‚Äôm learning how much weird quirks or difficulties, habits i‚Äôve had throughout my entire life have been adhd related. it makes my world make sense and it‚Äôs very validating\n\nI‚Äôm in the same boat and agree about how validating this journey is. Sending hugs your way!\n\nawh you too :) thank you!\n\nI do not have ADHD. I have GAD and OCD and I know exactly what you are describing. It absolutely is anticipation anxiety and I believe it is more prevalent if you have OCD. When I have had an appointment, someone coming over to do something, a phone call that I'm waiting for, a letter I'm expecting, even a pill I may have to take, anything at all that is not in my normal routine, I feel anxiety. It almost feels like doom and until the event is over, I cannot relax. I have to do major preparation before the event takes place, in order to somewhat deal with the anxiety it produces. All of my focus is on this one event.\n\nI feel this even when I just have a shift for work later in the day, I can‚Äôt do anything before my shift whatsoever\n\nThank god this does not happen to me with pills\n\nYou are lucky, because when I have had to take any medication, the anxiety is the same as waiting for an appointment. I have severe OCD. Routine is king for me.\n\nI wouldn't go as far as to think I have OCD, but I do get angry when something sudden comes up like \"we have to go and do this today or tomorrow\", it makes me grumpy.\n\n1000%\n\nAs someone with both ADHD and anxiety, I wouldn‚Äôt immediately jump to ‚Äúthis must be ADHD!!‚Äù like all these comments seem to be. Anticipation anxiety is common with any anxiety disorder and in no way means you have adhd.\n\nOf course, if you research into it and it turns out you fit a lot of adhd symptoms, maybe you do have it. But everyone jumping to adhd as a conclusion with such little information is pretty silly when it could easily be because of anxiety.\n\nüíØ. I'm diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  and experience  anticipated anxiety.  I was actually evaluated for ADHD because I've had focus/ concentration issues.  It turned out I don't have it.  But I do  have C-PTSD (Complex-Post-traumatic Stress Disorder) and  GAD.  According to my therapist,  both  C-PTSD and ADHD can cause focus  and concentration issues.\n\nYup. I also struggle with executive dysfunction, but only have ASD, depression and GAD, not ADHD. My ASD symptoms were present my whole life, but got more obvious and noticeable after a mental breakdown, whereas i only began struggling with executive dysfunction following that mental breakdown.\n\nCan you describe your symptoms and what your ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù was like?\n\nI burned out really badly and became severely depressed and anxious. Had a few explosive breakdowns (meltdowns? Idk) within a short period, coupled with worsening sleep quality and very rapid loss of ability to function in day to day life. I was tired all the time and oversleeping, spending most of my time in bed. I couldn‚Äôt focus in class or while studying, which I used to excel at, could barely complete assignments (particularly with regard to task initiation), and had severe brain fog. Struggled with getting out of bed, brushing teeth, showering, getting my own food and water etc. let alone attending work or school. Almost didn‚Äôt graduate high school bc my attendance plummeted. \n\nHad lots of flurried, highly negative thought spirals. Was very easily overwhelmed by stress - any tiny pressure or demand would send me spiralling. Even the thought of having to go for a short walk every day seemed like too much. Cried a lot, too. Sensory issues got worse, although I didn‚Äôt realise at the time. Social anxiety got a lot worse as well, as I couldn‚Äôt muster the energy to mask my autistic and depressive symptoms, nor did I have the energy to socialise and maintain my friendships.\n\nSeveral years later now, I still have a lot trouble with task initiation and time management. I‚Äôve never been particularly great with time management, but it‚Äôs absolutely abysmal now. My memory is also a lot worse. I have trouble maintaining focus with study or administrative tasks - it feels like my brain is trying to hide/run away from it - but can easily spend many hours uninterrupted engaging in other tasks/media (watching movies/tv shows/youtube, gaming or solving puzzles). My anxiety is a lot less because now it feels like my body/brain just completely shuts down when I start getting stressed. Instead of getting actively distressed like I used to, I now lose all focus and motivation and feel very apathetic.\n\nI had a very similar thing happen to me, my symptoms are almost exactly like yours. I didn‚Äôt have a mental breakdown per se, as I believe that‚Äôs defined by having psychotic episodes - which I did not. It was more like constant panic attacks over nothing that sent my body into a 24/7 fight or flight response. Happened to me post Covid. Aside from that, identical symptoms.¬†\n\nWere you diagnosed autistic before this happened? I am wondering if you‚Äôre seeing any link at all there, as again, my symptoms and story are almost exact - but I am in no way autistic.\n\nI think the same, I have to look deeper into it, but just from the basic information I have about ADHD, I never thought I had it\n\nI have adhd and anxiety too and I agree with you. I admit I thought it was adhd thing because from what I've seen the adhd community always says it is, but I haven't heard any doctor or psychologist actually say it is. Anxiety is common in people with adhd, so it could be people are just confusing it as a symptom of adhd and not anxiety. \n\nI have the same issue as OP and I think for me it's due to the anticipation anxiety and the anxiety of being late, so I can't do anything else but scroll on the internet while checking the clock and have an alarm on my phone every hour before I need to go somewhere. It could also be ocd symptom too.\n\nty for speaking up. I have this behavior but never considered ADHD but I wonder now lol\n\nI didn‚Äôt know this was an actual named thing. I have to have a structured routine and when I have something come up that‚Äôs out of my routine it throws me all out of wack.\n\nSame. And it's why I aim to schedule all my appointments as early as I can. Often if I am scheduling an appointment and they offer one after 10:00 a.m. I won't take it. I want it in between 8:00 and 9:00. If their next opening at those times aren't for another few weeks I'll gladly wait a few weeks to be seen to get the time I want unless it's something urgent. Sooner the appointment is over sooner I can get back in my routine.\n\nNothing worse than waiting almost all day to deal with something, I totally get it.\n\nThis!\n\nI call it normal because I have always been that way\n\nOof... Felt that...\n\nI think that's a manifestation of executive dysfunction brought on by ADHD\n\nI'm sorry, I think I didn't explain myself properly, what I mean by this is, for example, I'm on my free day today, and normally I like to play videogames during my free days, however, I'll have a person come and fix something in my house at 5 pm. If I'm awake since 8 am, I am incapable of doing anything like playing videogames, watching a movie, going out or even relaxing a little bit before the time of the appointment and I'm just sitting there, waiting all day\n\nI do exactly what you're describing and also have adhd.\n\nYes because you're afraid of being caught off guard or spacing on the time and feeling rushed. ADHD.\n\nI see, I searched for executive dysfunction and didn't seem to fit the description, but now that you explain it that way...\n\nQuestion: Do you have the anxiety because you often experience \"time blindness\" where you start a task expecting it to be done in a certain time, but by the time you're finished it's much, much later than you expected?\n\nFor instance: You think a shower will take 20 minutes, but it actually takes 30 and you end up being late to your appointment/engagement/event?\n\nI don't, if anything, I'm always looking at the clock, always aware of the time. I've never been late to anything in my life if I'm not depending on anyone else. In fact, I'd say I'm the complete opposite of what you said. I fear the possibility of losing track of time so much, that I've never been late to anything, ever since I was a child\n\nProbably GAD then. I do both. Time blindness makes me late to something important and then my anxiety kicks in the next time and I watch the clock like a hawk and end up leaving way earlier than I need to just in case, then my anxiety burns me out and I revert back to not paying close attention and the cycle starts over.\n\nMental health is exhausting.\n\nMan... That sucks even more than my situation. At least in my case I can see this anxiety as kind of an \"advantage\" of sorts since I never get late to things because of it\n\nYeah. It‚Äôs def an adhd thing. My life is run by a shit executive functioning system.\n\nIts 'waiting mode' in ADHD terms\n\nNot everything is adhd. Can y‚Äôall stop???\n\nI have this exact feeling. I try to game but I can‚Äôt really relax or focus on it. And feel like I need to just have the appointment over then I can switch off and game or watch TV. \n\nIt‚Äôs like an anticipation anxiety.\n\nWhat makes this go from being just anxiety, to anxiety+ADHD? I don't quite get what justifies bringing in adhd\n\nI have the same thing where if I have something coming up it's hard to relax and I don't feel like playing games/watching movies because I know I won't be able to enjoy them fully while this is on my mind. But I always thought it was just my anxiety\n\nAnything is possible outside the confines of the opinions of strangers on the internet.\n\nI experience a similar feeling.  It's just anxiety.  I don't see the connection with ADHD.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt happens to me all the time I have something to do during the day, and I hate it because any minimal thing stops my whole day completely\n\nI do not have adhd but def have anticipation anxiety. I try to always make my appointments for in the morning. When they aren‚Äôt it‚Äôs torture.\n\nIt‚Äôs anticipation anxiety. Letting go of the ‚Äúfear of the future‚Äù and the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù helps a lot\n\nif you‚Äôve never thought you had adhd before you probably don‚Äôt have it. it may happen to people with adhd but it can also be a symptom of anxiety.\n\nWhat are the specific symptoms of ADHD anyway?\n\nYou should probably search those on the internet, but not on tiktok tho, it's full of misinfo and they're trying to make every symptom into adhd thing (same with the adhd women subreddit sometimes). \n\nJust find a real medical site and if you feel like you might have adhd try to get evaluated. Keep in mind that for it to be adhd you need to have had symptoms of it since childhood, if you've had adhd symptoms only recently its something else. \n\nMain symptoms are inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity and they can show up in different ways. There is also three different types of adhd that are predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive and combined. The inattentive type was previously called ADD but it's not separated from ADHD nowadays if I remember correctly. \n\nI hope my text makes sense, I'm really tired atm and english is not my native language.\n\nYeah, that's what I am thinking. It could be part of any number of things.This is something I experience as part of social anxiety disorder. The more I am worried about the social interaction involved the worse the anticipatory anxiety is and the less I am able to do anything productive beforehand.\n\nI get this too. (GAD) and panic disorder.  I hate appointments that are late cuz i sit and stew all day and it ruins the whole day. Like a thorn in ur foot til its over\n\nI have this problem too! Its like an anticipation thing, I can‚Äôt relax or do anything else until my appointment/work/whatever is on my schedule is done\n\nUgh same problem so bad. My whole day is shot every time I have an \"appointment\" of any kind. Even if it's not for me. My daughters appointments do it to me too. It's one reason I prefer to take care of business first thing in the morning. Of course that's not always possible.\n\nDw dawg you jus locking in \n(This comment is intended to lighten the mood, you will get through this)\n\nThanks! Thankfully this particular symptom of anxiety does not bother as much as other stuff\n\nPlease look into inner child work. There's good videos on youtube explaining it. I've had this exact anxiety and inner child work led me to being nervous before my tyrant parent came home. You visualize the scene and then go in as an adult and rescue yourself. Getting to the root of your anxieties is key. Noticing when you're anxious, and figuring out the memory tied to that trigger. GOOD LUCK. You can get rid of this anxiety!\n\nSounds like ADHD paralysis, aka executive dysfunction\n\nOmg this happens the nights I have work, I can‚Äôt do ANYTHING. I sleep and that‚Äôs it, yes it‚Äôs a night job but it‚Äôs only 3 hour shifts 3x days a week I also just had a month off and am going  back tonight and I know I‚Äôll be in bed allday today and have been so far. It‚Äôs so strange and annoying. Never heard of anticipation anxiety till reading these comments üòÖ.\n\nI do not have ADHD, In my case, the two are entirely unrelated. \n\nFrom what I‚Äôm aware, this is participation anxiety and it can get pretty bad sometimes (to the point where I can‚Äôt sleep the night prior) but the moment the ‚Äúthing which is causing it‚Äù ends, so does the anxiety. \n\nIt sucks but your body has perceived ‚Äúthis thing‚Äù as a threat, probably based on past experience. The only way to really break it is constant exposure (which is easier said than done)\n\nI‚Äôm late for everything, so to be on time for something important I have to take a whole day to do nothing but wait. Nobody gets it, except you all!!\n\nAnticipation Anxiety and starts the night before or even nights before where you may get insomnia.\n\nI have adhd and do this.\n\nTbh I never considered the possibility that I might have ADHD, but maybe I do\n\nThat is called anticipated anxiety mixed with if I could procrastinate? I might. I am the same way.  I will be dreading / anxious for an appointment a week and a half before it's even time.\n\nNo idea but I have this too, really badly\n\nI have this exact thing right now except I‚Äôm waiting for my new balance shoes.\n\nYes I hate this because I just want to live my life. I have GAD, bipolar 1, and cPTSD.\n\nI have ADHD and this was a major symptom. I call it ‚Äòwaiting mode‚Äô\n\ni call it ‚Äúwaiting mode‚Äù\n\nAdhd\n\nYes, it's called anticipatory anxiety or Pathological Demand Avoidance. I have it too - diagnosed with CPTSD, AvPD (avoidant personality disorder), and GAD.\n\nIt's called a little piece of hell\n\nI do the same thing. In my job, I have to make appointments to see people, and the lead up to those is dreadful. I am fine afterward, I just hate the anticipation of them.\n\nI call this ‚Äúwaiting mode‚Äù. I have severe ADHD so that doesn‚Äôt help my case. I have never figured out a way to manage it properly.\n\nAnticipatory anxiety\n\nThis is a common symptom of ADHD.  ADHD and anxiety are really connected, but of course it could also just be anxiety.  Do some reading about ADHD and see if it sounds like you.  It's actually a lot different than the stereotypical hyper little boys that couldn't sit still idea that they sold it as when I was a teenager (in the 90s).\n\nThis is called adhd. Go check out some adhd subs out there ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nfor me it‚Äôs ADHD lol.\n\nI have this sooooo bad\n\nI always experience this -- whether it's a meeting with friends, a doctor's appointment, going out with family. The appointment is always terrifying until it happens. And then it isn't. But I don't relax until it's all over. I didn't know this was anxiety.\n\nLmao I just call it adhd\n\nfor me that‚Äôs my ADHD! very common\n\nThis sounds like 'anticipatory anxiety': https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/anxiety-type/anticipatory-anxiety/ and maybe a touch of social anxiety too?\n\nI get it (but not always) and it's super frustrating so I know the feeling. I wouldn't listen to all the people trying to insist you have ADHD based on one symptom that lots of us without ADHD also get.  Instead you can look at techniques to deal with it.\n\nADHD baby. Didn‚Äôt realize this wasn‚Äôt a normal thing until I got diagnosed. Now that I‚Äôm medicated I can get ready for work, go to the gym, tidy up a bit and do other things before I have to leave. Relieves so much stress‚Ä¶\n\nThese comments are seriously so disheartening and exactly why diagnosis needs to be left to professionals. Just because this presents in ADHD does not mean any singular person who feels it has ADHD. I really just ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nMy adhd makes me do this I think.\n\nSounds like ADHD to me!\n\nI did this all the time and didn't have a name to it until I was diagnosed at 38 with ADHD. Talking it over with my therapist helps. I still have anticipation anxiety, but at least I can recognize it and try to do something about it.\n\nMy partner has ADHD and this is a known issue associated with it.\n\nYour partner should look into CPTSD. Similar symptoms as ADHD. Inner child work helps this.\n\nOk thanks, I will let him know.  He has had an ADHD diagnosis since childhood so had many years of issues, but we will have a look into it anyway.\n\nI have the same issue. I assumed it was just part of one of my diagnoses, probably GAD.\n\nI don‚Äôt know but I have it too. My therapist says it‚Äôs due to my combined anxiety and ADHD, and that it‚Äôs related to my time blindness. Scheduling EVERYTHING thru google calendar has helped me a bit.\n\nI‚Äôve read magnesium supplements help anxiety and the cause could be parasites. Who knows.\n\nMe. That kind of anxiety is called me.\n\nThat is a very common symptom of ADHD. I assume it occurs with other things like anxiety too but I don't know details or know for sure. I call it waiting mode.\n\nYea I get this. Sometimes I'll have to present a meeting at work, if it's 3pm there ain't no other work getting done in the day, because I'll spend all that time being anxious and prepping for the meeting. \n\nSo if I can I try and get these meetings set up for the morning (like 10am or 11am) that way I at least won't waste my whole day.\n\nI never realized this was a thing until just now.  I usually schedule things for as early in the morning as possible to avoid it.  That does not always happen though, and things like having someone come to the house for a repair or something like that is the absolute worst for me.  I am constantly looking out the window, can't relax, antsy.\n\nAlways make morning appts. But not before 9 or you may cancel. I find 9:15-10:00 appt time is my sweet spot\n\nI do the same thing,it's so annoying ugh\n\nDo you get more anxious closer to the time of appointment if so this is me for all appointments or going places that can make me nervous, it builds closer to time then after it's like 2 tons lifted the worry alone is enough to freak me out in my head running how they will go in head and it never ends well in my scenarios, I'm always expecting the worst case is going to happen from worsening of stress to increasing epilepsy.  \nHad extreme seizures less than a week ago they stop and start or used to since that day I'm getting flash doom auras over 20 in mornings.  \n  \n\n(A doom aura is the feeling of death knowing you're about to go through something bad and can't stop it, I compare it to the final destination movies that death look and his feelings would be exactly how I'd feel now hitting me over 20x a day mild epilepsy but is every day now and I can't get out of bed just feeling like death fractured nose road rash face hospital pics in profile it's messed up man I went straight to face on ashfault because why not fml.)\n\nI HAVE THIS!\n\nSorry this doesn‚Äôt answer your question just wanted to share with you or anyone dealing with this type of anxiety of my experience how I dealt with it.\n\nI used to get that sometimes to man.., meditating has alleviated some and help me control my anxiety you should definitely incorporate it in your daily routine. First time I meditated my mind wander non stop realizing it was the root of my anxiety. I consciously never paid attention to my mind &amp; thoughts now knowing that, it has help me get a grip of my anxiety being able to notice a wandering thought and acknowledge it and dismiss it helps cleared my mind from anxiety I definitely feel more in control these days.\n\nanticipation anxiety!!\n\nOmg I have this when I used to work nights serving . My shift would start at 4 pm and I would be frozen . Thankfully I only work breakfast now! I hated that feeling so much...\n\nAnticipatory anxiety i believe?\n\nThis is adhd\n\nWhat makes this not just regular anxiety?\n\nI think it IS part of regular anxiety, but it has a particular name\n\nWhat are other symptoms of ADHD? I don't feel like it's hard for me to pay attention to things, at least not more than normal\n\nNo it's not.\n\nADHD\n\nIt‚Äôs an ADHD thing called waiting mode"

    "all_comment_text": "Yes, idk if its normal. But I feel the same. I can barely even think about food because stomach just hurts so bad and I feel so nauseous and anxious\n\nI feel like the acidity is killing me in those moments\n\nYes totally normally. As a life long overweight eater even I get too sick to eat when overly anxious.\n\nMe too. I felt that way when my twin sister had emergency surgery in 2020 and again when my dad had a triple coronary bypass on my birthday last year in 2023. My twin sister Amber also felt that way when dad had heart surgery last year.\n\nThis week I have not been eating. It wasn't just the outcome. Sat &amp; Sunday we buried my aunt whom I was very close to. And was stopped my a trooper. I bought a new car and\napparently I returned my old plates late. Now I have a court date. 3 major triggers in 4days has put me over the edge. I can't eat, sleep, concentrate and constant butterflies in my stomach I'm crying off and on.\nI feel frozen in place. I'm seeing my Dr. Tomorrow to up my dose a bit. I hope he does. (I low dose Klonopin) as far as addiction. I'd rather be addicted to a pill that I'll be taking for life, then being addicted to my bed. I sincerely wish everyone wellness.¬†\n\nI‚Äôve been dealing with this since high school. Something to keep in mind that my doctor told me: the nausea comes from your stomach acid. When you have an empty stomach, it gets worse because there is more acid with nothing to break down. Low blood sugar (caused by not eating) can also exacerbate anxiety.\nI have learned that hunger can trigger my anxiety really easily, so when I start feeling that panic come on, I try to remember the last time I ate. \nI also keep small, bland snacks on hand just to get something in my stomach when I have an anxious belly, and the feeling usually passes after a while.\n\nThisüëç\n\nI don‚Äôt know how normal it is, as anxiety is very new to me, but I definitely lose my appetite and have to force myself to eat. Sometimes all I can do is drink, so I‚Äôve started keeping drinkable yogurts and shakes in the fridge for such occasions.\n\ni will preface this but saying that i do not recommend this to anyone, this is just what has helped and worked for me with appetite during anxiety. i live in a legal state so i use medical marijuana and it actually helps with my anxiety personally but i am fully aware that thc and cbd cause anxiety in a lot of people, which is why i am not recommending this at all. just sharing what works for me. \n\ntry your best to stay hydrated. it‚Äôs definitely not uncommon and i‚Äôm sorry you know what all of this is like :(\n\nSame, it's the only thing that uas consistently helped over the years. I even had marinol prescribed with no luck.\n\nmarijuana can be a slippery slope, so definitely be careful if you use it to treat anxiety. in my case it made it worse, and weed withdrawal is a very real and scary thing that can even heighten anxiety in my experience.\n\ni‚Äôve been using it for a long time and i‚Äôve never had a bad reaction. not to say i couldn‚Äôt have one in the future but it helps so i‚Äôm not worried about that right now. i‚Äôm on 3 meds though- one being for anxiety specifically, so i don‚Äôt use marijuana to treat it\n\nExtreme anxiety makes me just lock up tbh. That means me not wanting to eat.\n\nMy favourite small snacks are apples and made good breakfast bars :) sometimes my anxiety makes me averse to textures and taste as well\n\nIt‚Äôs a good way to deal with it, eating something smooth\n\nI'm glad I read this, things I normally love taste so eurghh at the moment!\n\nYep. When I started my new job in September I could hardly eat anything especially in the morning before my shifts as I was so anxious\n\nYup I've had a very bad week with anxiety, lost 6lbs in a week.\n\nOn really bad weeks I don't have an appetite at all. And when I do have a bit of an appetite, shortly after I eat, it sends me in to a panic\n\n[deleted]\n\nToday was a better day thank you :) best wishes to you as well\n\nIt happens to me too, but I'm not sure if it is normal. I can't eat because the food feels stuck in my throat when I try to eat plus the acid is too much for me to handle when I'm anxious.\n\nMe me me!!!!! it‚Äôs the worst kind of anxiety, it‚Äôs like even if I try to hide my anxiety I can‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt eat and feel more weak over that and spiral even more lol\n\nYep\n\nEvery day\n\n[deleted]\n\nI don‚Äôt eat at all or much because the anxiety gets my stomach going and if I eat I get sick. So I want to eat because it makes me hungry but i don‚Äôt to avoid the other consequences.\n\nI get hungry but I eat and am then immediately full lmao\n\n[deleted]\n\nYup. That‚Äôs typical. When the body is in stress mode and prepares to potentially fight or flight, it doesn‚Äôt want a stomach full of food.\n\nYesss currently!\n\nWhen mine is the most severe i can barely eat at all but my mom tries her best to order me something i like or make me something i like just so i can eat. My main reason is that i get super nauseous when im anxious and i WILL throw up anything i end up eating if it's too bad. So i've definitely had a few days of not eating anything at all, or barely eating. This is super new to me though, it only started in september for me. But it seems like a common thing associated with anxiety, something that helped me a lot when it first happened and i really needed to get something in my stomach was the core power protein shakes (specifically the chocolate ones because they literally just taste like chocolate milk) and they helped me feel full but i definitely woke up with some crazy acid reflux one day after drinking one before i fell asleep üò≠\n\n[deleted]\n\nhaha I just realized i replied to both of your posts, i stalk the hell out of the sub sometimes when nothing else will distract me from my anxiety lol. It's okay, I'm slowly getting better but I definitely have my days of not having an appetite. I honestly recommend just slowly starting to eat comfort foods again too, even if it's junk food or fast food. I remember when my appetite slowly started to come back I DEVOURED 2 party size bags of lightly salted lays lol but it helped me eat again. I'm wishing you the best of luck as well, and my dms are open if you ever need to talk :)\n\n[deleted]\n\nme currently ü´† it sucks because i have so much good food to eat right now but my body just doesn‚Äôt want it üò´\n\nthis is happening to me too, but i have 2 phases, sometime i donot eat at all, or sometimes i eat more than i have to, it‚Äôs 2 different extremes i suffer with\n\n[deleted]\n\nyep. developed an ED because of this about 5 years ago. im at a healthy weight now and i think im having the opposite problem (eating toooo much, idk when to stop but i still barely eat whenever i have anxiety). but back then, i was in an abusive relationship. constantly anxious. it was like walking on eggshells doing anything. since i had anxiety 25/8, i couldn‚Äôt bring myself to ever really eat. long story short, my doctor told me i had an eating disorder, leading to anorexia. she honestly scared me so bad telling me what could happen next so it encouraged me to try and push myself eat a little more. not a fun time. just be careful, take vitamins, &amp; glad to see you stay hydrated at least. ü´∂üèº\n\nYep.. have been in constant fight or flight for days, haven't slept and haven't eaten in 4 days. This is all very new for me but it is happening\n\nyes . i legit suffered from a eating disorder due to anxiety . i was all skin and bones .\n\nYes! I feel the same way as you do! If i go through something bad, I have no appetite whatsoever and I don't eat for 3 or 4 days. You aren't alone! I hope you are okay and you are awesome too! üòä\n\nYes...i lose my appetite but not for a long period. I dont have severe anxiety though\n\nAm anxious rn and can‚Äôt even think about food!\n\nIt‚Äôs like an immediate feeling of nausea.\n\nI‚Äôve felt that way all day today\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes, boost 500 calories vanilla sold on amazon are my friend during anxious times.\n\nYes anxiety and eating a very much connected. I have an ed but before that started i would be so anxious i couldnt eat . Felt sick to my stomach. That has improved but i started a new medication and one of the side effects is anxiety :,)so i often dont end up estimg much because i feel sick\n\nYep. Sometimes I literally can't eat unless it's comfort food. I fucking hate it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYep it happens to me often and sometimes when the anxiety is so high i may vomit\n\nYes, so much so that I was hospitalized for 5 days from essentially giving myself gastritis and becoming very underweight. It used to be really really bad. Now, I will not eat like all day from anxiety and then my body almost reaches a threshold from stress and I shut down, dissociate and become ravenous and finally eat. It‚Äôs weird but it‚Äôs changed a bit over the DECADES ü´†\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes, I find it near impossible to swallow when extremely anxious, and more often than not, it can be accompanied by a constant stomach ache, to the point where I'm too grossed out to eat anything. It's a horrible feeling, especially since I love to eat\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf I‚Äôm a little bit stressed or anxious I‚Äôll overeat. If it‚Äôs oppressive dread and spiraling anxiety then my appetite vanishes. I have to force myself to eat. I can usually only manage small bites here and there.\n\nI have no appetite when I'm anxious. I used to weigh myself at least every week when I can tell I've been stressed to make sure I didn't lose too much weight. I'm down 10 pounds from September from election stress but today I've been constantly hungry and I can tell the anxiety is gone.\n\nGlad to hear you're recovering, I think election seasons cause overwhelming anxiety\n\nYup. I haven't eaten at all yesterday. Still not hungry. I'm drinking water well though. Not even able to force myself to eat.\n\nfew weeks back i had a nervewrecking moment and was extremely tense and anxious for few hours straight, hit lunch time and I couldnt even think about food, let alone water. basically i might threw up anything i put past my mouth. once the wait ended, all those feelings just gone and lifted off of my body. only then i can eat ü•≤\n\nbut yeah generally i dont think i stress eat that much either.\n\nI can't eat at all when I am anxious. And I feel like throwing up whatever I ate in the past few hours. My appetite has been so low for the past 2 years. Maintaining my weight is becoming difficult and eating in a calorie surplus has become necessary now.\n\nYeah it‚Äôs a weird feeling\n\nI recently had a week long practically nervous breakdown where I couldn't really eat anything. Then I went to urgent care because I was also worried about what my worrying was doing to my health. On more mildly anxious days I usually can't eat lunch.\n\nI think when I‚Äôm anxious, I get hungry, and when I‚Äôm stressed, I lose my appetite.\n\nYup, you can tell how I'm doing mentally based on my weight. I've lost 35 pounds this year.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThanks. Trying my best :)\n\nLifelong overweight and compulsive eater, during the pandemic was my first ever experience with inappetence lost weight in a bad way, a lot of muscle mass\n\n[deleted]\n\nThanks, bro, doing much better, feeling some dread about the election results but I‚Äôm processing it better than the Pandy\n\nHi! When anxious or depressed I have no appetite. I've had weeks where I was happy if I managed to eat an apple and a piece of bread a day. Went to the doc 2 times for help because I started feeling weak and dizzy.\n\nDefinitely doesn't help with the mood and I really try to force myself to eat then but it's really incredibly hard sometimes!\n\nMe too,, I only feel like eating when im relaxed or comfortable¬†\n\nI can barely eat without throwing up or feeling nauseous on bad days, on not so bad days my appetite is low but I can still eat normal amounts\n\nYes. It‚Äôs really bad when it lasts for days. It‚Äôs like my appetite just dissipates\n\nI absolutely cannot eat when I'm severely anxious. The nausea hits so hard\n\nI dont even want to look at food\n\nEven my favourite meal is a no-go\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes. I can tell what my anxiety levels are based on my appetite. If I‚Äôm not hungry, it‚Äôs gonna be a long day mentally.\n\nYes, absolutely, when I'm under a lot of stress I have NO appetite and I never think about food.\n\nI go on a liquid diet and have very little appetite. I try to make sure to down a few protein shakes. Eat a little in the evening.\n\nI always feel like the odd one out because anxiety doesn‚Äôt seem to affect my appetite really‚Ä¶\n\n[deleted]\n\nAll day Tuesday I had ravenous hunger.  I know it‚Äôs referred to as stress or emotional eating but for me it‚Äôs anxiety hunger!  My stomach just won‚Äôt stop growling.  It also happens on days when I‚Äôm flying.  Which is another major source of anxiety for me!\n\nNah I‚Äôm the opposite\n\n[deleted]\n\nYep, been in a state of anxiety and depression the last 3 days have lost nearly a stone\n\nI can go whole day without eating, not feeling hunger, but I feel stomach pain which I address to some illness instead of hunger. It's either overeating when you start eating or no appetite at all.\n\nI‚Äôm so scared of getting sick I eat 4 hours before my shift. So in the end I  go 8 hours without eating‚Ä¶ only water ü´†\n\nhey there fellow anxious pal, i've been dealing with this the past week. it's been absolutely horrible, barely getting through each day on just a few bites of something that i have to force :( trying my best to stay hydrated but even that is hard at times. but it will pass i promise, and it is very normal. adrenaline takes your appetite and every good feeling away. i've had many bad episodes just like the one i'm currently experiencing, and even though it feels like there is no way out, there is. and it will get better sooner than we know. try your best to stick to something you can handle, anything, even just a very small snack. the more you try, the more your body gets used to it again and then feels okay to eat more. sending you hugs, you're not alone ‚ô°\n\nYup. Once my mind fills with anxious thoughts the last thing I have an appetite for is food.\n\nLost 4 pounds last week because I went through an extremely anxiety inducing period\n\nyep, ever since I can remember it's been like this for me, sometimes I go through periods of weight loss because of it\n\nI lost 20 lbs in two weeks when my anxiety really ramped up and started affecting me. I stopped eating. Eating itself would cause me anxiety. The only things that would help me were fruits, veggies, and granola bars. \n\nI was like yay I lost weight cuz I needed to, but my doctors were like no this is pathological lol\n\nHello üëã name twin ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n[deleted]\n\nI haven‚Äôt eaten in like 4 days :(\n\n[deleted]\n\nMe too. If I get nervous, stressed, or anxious- my appetite goes.\n\nI don‚Äôt eat nearly as much as should and I usually wait till it‚Äôs after midnight because I‚Äôm overweight due to my anxiety, and I‚Äôve had people comment on my body. I hate that I‚Äôve been on several different psych meds that resulted in weight gain and I‚Äôve yet to lose the weight I gained from them.\n\nThe descriptions are triggering, just a heads up.\n\n&gt;!Spoiler Text!&lt; It feels like my anxiety makes me forget my hunger or maybe it‚Äôs my ADHD having me hyper-focusing on so many things that I‚Äôm too distracted to eat?&gt;!Spoiler Text!&lt;Anyways, when I inevitably do get hungry during the day, I tend to suppress my hunger until my body can‚Äôt handle the stomach pains anymore or I end up getting something small to hold me off. &gt;!Spoiler Text!&lt;\n\nI really shouldn‚Äôt be doing this, &gt;!Spoiler Text!&lt;I‚Äôm harming my body,&gt;!Spoiler Text!&lt;but idk what else to do to handle my food anxiety.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBefore I took my Escitalopram I felt the same way. Very nauseous about food and I was wondering why and how people spent money on restaurants lol.\n\nSame‚Ä¶ I started drinking boost drinks in the mornings because I have a hard time eating in the morning and if I don‚Äôt eat in the morning seems like my anxiety is worse and I don‚Äôt want to eat the rest of the day and my anxiety gets worse. Then a couple days go by and I feel weak and shakey but it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve barely ate. I find the boost drinks help a lot with my appetite and my anxiety.\n\nI have crippling anxiety and panic attacks from cptsd and it‚Äôs very rare I get hungry, I have to force myself to eat so I totally understand.\n\nI believe I have a mild form of contamination OCD and my anxiety presents itself very physically for me. When I get anxious I get nauseous and when I get nauseous I get anxious. I have a terrible fear of throwing up so to combat that I completely lose my appetite when I‚Äôm nervous or anxious and will not eat. Over the summer I was having an episode and almost completely stopped eating because I developed a fear of food and my fear of vomiting was the worst it‚Äôs ever been. Throwing up was quite literally all I thought about. Eating and looking at food freaked me tf out and made me nauseous and the cycle continued.\n\nNothing stops me from eating. Illness, depression‚Ä¶I‚Äôll eat my way through it all. I love food.\n\nAnxiety is totally different. It‚Äôs the ONLY thing that makes me completely lose my appetite and be unable to eat.\n\nYup, my weight is plummeting due to stress. I have some to lose, so it‚Äôs fine and won‚Äôt last long hopefully.\n\n[deleted]\n\nCan't eat and everything tastes off\n\nI feel the exact same way!! The second I get anxious, my appetite disappears. I have to force myself to drink water. Even if I was about to eat something, I can no longer eat it the second I get anxious.\n\nIt happens with me dude, Even thinking about eating makes me more anxious, All I do is constantly overthink and make myself more anxious that time, Idk if that‚Äôs a main reason but my stomach hasn‚Äôt been the best since the past 1-2 years now\n\nThat's my partner.  I'm the opposite.  I eat with any and every emotion.\n\nMy anxiety has gone for now but on bad days I couldn‚Äôt eat at all. I‚Äôd go days without food. I was nauseous &amp; throwing up. Just drank lots of water. My partner would get me to drink milk &amp; tomato juice, yoghurt is good too. Eventually it would pass &amp; back to normal appetite.\n\nIv lost 10 lbs in 2 months I'm a bigger guy\n\nThey wonder how I'm doing it well I walk over 10 miles a day and never eat\n\nYes‚Ä¶ previously led to anorexia for me. Luckily my meds have my anxiety under control now\n\ntrying to eat clean as much as possible but when im incredibly anxious i dont even feel  like cooking because i feel so nauseous. so i turn towards quick food and its never healthy. i dont like the fact that im losing weight (im already petite) 5'3\" 114lbs and i am trying to gain but this last week i ended up in the ER twice with what i can only assume was a panic or anxiety attack. i thought i was losing my mind and wanted to crawl out of my skin. love these suggestions for food!\n\nwhen my anxiety was the worst i didn't eat a meal for 5 weeks. the thing that helped me the most was drinking my calories. literally for 5 weeks i was on a liquid diet of smoothiesüòÇone thing id recommend is even tho its not healthy, adding stuff like ice cream to smoothies purely just to get some more calories in. also adding yogurt and even an avocado (u can't taste it)\n\nMe too. Nothing sounds appetizing except for sipping on ice cold soda\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah I have no appetite. None. Even drinking water is hard rn. Sometimes I eat and feel ok sometimes eating makes me dizzy and I get panic symptoms like feel like I can‚Äôt breathe as well it‚Äôs horrible so I‚Äôve just avoided eating. I have lost quite a bit of weight and I am starting to get concerned. Ensure helps me. I try and drink one a day especially if I‚Äôve eaten nothing.\n\nThere was a point in time where I couldn‚Äôt eat when I was first having panic attacks. I would think myself nauseous at the thought of eating. I had to go to urgent care to get meds to help that.\n\nMe too. I lost so much weight the doctors were concerned.\n\nLiterally the thought of food makes me want to throw up when I‚Äôm experiencing high levels of anxiety or depression\n\nI lose my appetite when my anxiety flares up. Can‚Äôt bear to eat, I live on sparkling water.¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nAll the time, even if i try to force myself to eat I gag the entire time its so awful. When i‚Äôm anxious food is just a no no and i feel super nauseous.\n\n[deleted]\n\nLol I feel this! I don't get hungry and then just forget about eating, then when I'm winding down later I get ravenous. It's awful.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm dealing with it now. I was great for 2 weeks, now everything is terrible. We ordered pizza, and I had to force a slice. I'm not interested, yet I can feel my health failing because of the lack of food. I usually eat yogurt, pineapple, or bananas, but I don't feel like any of those. \n\nFor today's like these I keep a few Ensures.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI go through this too. When you‚Äôre in fight or flight, your body pulls blood away from your gut to your extremities, which is what produces the nauseous feeling.\n\nYes, my theory is that when your anxious your body is in fight or flight more and it‚Äôs just worrying about survival. The body is not thinking about food, just survival. \n\nAlso when you do try to eat it‚Äôs like you just chew forever because your body is not producing saliva to break down the food in your mouth because of stress/fight or flight. \n\nJust my personal opinion.\n\nWhen I get panic attacks I don't eat. Usually I will try to drink a shake, but it's hard.\n\nWhen I‚Äôm stressed, I tend to want to eat. For me, stressed means super busy or just feeling behind on my work. True anxiety makes me complete lose my appetite though.\n\nI lost 60 pounds in 3 months from anxiety. There was only 2-3 foods I could eat and I had to use my medical card to stomach anything. It took being on multiple anxiety medications to start getting an appetite back\n\nOmg yes! It‚Äôs the worst. Add add on top of the forgetting to eat and I can never tell if I‚Äôm sick from not eating or if eating something will make me more sick.\n\nI lose my appetite and feel physically ill when I'm extremely anxious\n\nStruggled with anxiety since 9, and have felt the exact same way towards food since that age honestly. Like someone else said, Marijuana was great for getting me hungry and keeping me level enough to eat. Although, it did eventually begin increasing my anxiety or exacerbating it so I'm in the process of cutting back. I also have IBS (anxiety and ibs are like this ü§û) so if I'm not too anxious to eat, then I'm in too much pain to. I recently did some digging and found a condition that personally hits most my symptoms on the head, ideopathic postprandial syndrome. No treatment, common with most chronic digestive disorders, besides changing your diet to no large meals and instead having a small meal/snack every 3 hours. Even if you don't have IPS, that pattern of eating will still get you the calories and nutrients you need in a day if you do a lil planning. I've only just started giving the method a try, but I lost 30 pounds in 3 months to not eating and my blood tests are showing signs of malnutrion. So, I'm quite desperate for anything to work.¬†\nI noticed that Ensures helped to kick start my hunger in the morning or if I drank them a couple hours before a meal. That's completely anecdotal though, but absolutely worth trying if you need to just get something in you! Just know that meal replacement can be a slippery slope for some, don't let them actually replace your meals, but instead add meals onto them later or treat them as a side.\nBest of luck, and even from my shitty dark hole im currently in, I can still say it absolutely does get better and it will not always be like this. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you have to deal with this too! For me, when my anxiety is high enough, I can lose my appetite to the point that even the smell of food makes me nauseous. I'll still force myself to eat just to get some nutrition in, but it can be tough sometimes.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYep me\n\nYes, I hate it. Cooking is one of my stress relieving activities, so it kind of messes that up too. \n\nI made a really delicious Pad Thai on election day, and half of it went to waste because my anxiety and appetite were so bad afterward.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI am actually feeling this right now, reading your post and the comments has kicked me in the chest. I‚Äôm a chubbier girl and I love to eat, I do it to comfort myself however this anxiety is something different. I can‚Äôt eat or think about food in a positive way right now. I‚Äôve realised I have a crush and it‚Äôs kind of taken over my life for no reason but I also have ADHD so what do I expect. Anyways, hope you‚Äôre doing better now angel. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíì\n\nHi OP! I know this is a few months old, but I came here looking for these exact comments. I‚Äôve been really struggling with my anxiety the past few months and my appetite has been non existent. It will hit me out of nowhere too. I‚Äôve lost weight unintentionally in the past few months and it‚Äôs not great for my health. I‚Äôm working on eating smaller more frequent meals, but I still have quite a ways to go. You‚Äôre not alone. Anxiety is such a bitch sometimes."

    "all_comment_text": "Most definitely. I get very very dark thoughts and very panicky feelings\n\nHave you looked into PMDD? I have anxiety and PMDD and PMDD puts me in a really dark place during my luteal phase.\n\nYeah I have!! I just haven‚Äôt received a diagnosis of it . I wouldn‚Äôt take meds for it anyway (OCD FML) so I just deal with it üò´\n\nThere‚Äôs a PMDD subreddit that taught me so much! And there‚Äôs other ways to treat it that could work for you! But definitely consult your doctor first :) it might be helpful to get a diagnosis if you‚Äôre willing to!\n\nWhat's the treatment for pmdd?\n\nBirth contol. I started low dose ( lo lo estrin) and it has completely turned me around. I was looking into getting back on antidepressants ( not that they are bad, I just about killed myself getting off the devil of antidepressants and don't want back on them personally ever again).\n\nThere‚Äôs often birth control that‚Äôs prescribed! But also there are many doctors who prescribe an SSRI (antidepressant) to use only when you‚Äôre in your luteal phase and your symptoms are bad. I highly recommend looking at the PMDD subreddit! It‚Äôs been an amazing resource for me since I was diagnosed. There‚Äôs plenty of other people that have found success with various supplements too. But always consult your doctor first! :)\n\nUsing SSRIs as needed? Don‚Äôt they have to build up to a level in your body and stay at that level to have any benefit? I‚Äôve never heard of them being used in that manner.\n\nI thought the same thing! But there‚Äôs quite a few studies out on Pub Med about the intermittent use of SSRIs for PMDD symptoms. It‚Äôs something to discuss with a doctor. Currently, I take Wellbutrin cause I‚Äôve got general anxiety and take that daily. And I take 25mg of Zoloft only during my luteal phase and you won‚Äôt experience withdrawals.\n\nAwesome! The more you know! That‚Äôs super interesting. Thanks for letting me know. I‚Äôll have to look into some research journals about it. You feel like it does actually help when you take the Zoloft only during that phase?\n\nI really feel it‚Äôs made a massive difference for me! I normally have insane mood swings and rage during luteal and it was so scary. Zoloft has helped mellow me out a ton. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I get irritated etc, but it‚Äôs nothing like before üòÖ\n\nOn the PMDD subreddit, I‚Äôve seen other people have used various other SSRIs for intermittent use too. You should definitely do your research and talk to your doctor about options :) my OBGYN was the one who prescribed me the Zoloft. And then I did my own research too before I started taking it! Best of luck to you!\n\nI read about it a while ago, but it always seems unreal until you find someone with the same issue! I am still questioning myself. Even though about being bipolar but it seems too extreme... So this is a real thing, ha\n\nPmdd is very real! There‚Äôs much more medical research on it now and studies as well. I highly recommend you look at the Pmdd subreddit and also consult your doctor if you can relate to the most common symptoms. :) I think the stat I saw was like 1 in 4 women have it or something like that. It‚Äôs much more common than I realized!\n\nSame crying and thinking about kms send help\n\nPlease reach out to a crisis number if you need it!!! It will pass!!! I promise!!!!\n\nI‚Äôm currently dealing with this.\n\nSameüòû\n\nMy anxiety shoots up 10x 3-4 days before I get my period. But as soon as I get it, my brain becomes so calm. Then the weird depression starts lol\n\n[removed]\n\nSame! I always have the reverse realization where I‚Äôm like ‚Äúomg why I am I so sad and why do I feel endless amounts of hopeless dread?‚Äù And I check my period tracker to see that my period is usually around the corner üò≠\n\nSame!! And oddly enough taking painkillers (extra strength advil liqidgels) actually helps my mood a bit.\n\nOmg yes!!! Panic before and depression after üôÑ\n\nSimilar. It's few days to a week before my period.  It's the only time I have gotten full on anxiety attacks.  I'm 44 and just realized this connection the past year, so hopefully younger ladies are reading this and taking note so they can figure it out much earlier than I did!\n\nI have an anxiety disorder but few days before my period, I start dissociating hard, feel super panicky and on edge. I only realised the relationship a year ago lol\n\nMe too and I'm the same age. And I'm wondering if perimenopause is contributing.¬†\n\nsame sis\n\nSame. I hardly ever notice the weird depression, but now that you mention it... I think since I've always been anemic I just expect to be sluggish around that time.\n\nI know it‚Äôs been months but this is me too. I call that calmness my ‚Äúzen phase‚Äù when I feel total peace with the world. Unfortunately it ends so fast‚Ä¶\n\nThis is soooo much mine starts on the 22nd next week &amp; today and yesterday (15-16) I‚Äôve been paranoid and anxious gut feelings too.\n\nOf course, it happens with every single cycle. It seemed to ramp up when I crossed into my 30s. For the 1-2 weeks leading up to my period, my anxiety skyrockets and I just feel on edge all the time. I get major imposter syndrome at work, and I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôll suddenly be fired (hasn‚Äôt happened). It sucks! My mind just seems to race, thinking of all the worst ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios. \n\nThen my period starts and the anxiety dials itself way down. For that week, I‚Äôm just exhausted. Then I‚Äôll have a solid good week where I feel pretty decent. Rinse and repeat.\n\nYep, ovulation until period is the worst, and then period and the week after aren't bad. Mine started at 29.\nI was pregnant most of my 30 year, now 31 and 6 months post partum, so added post partum anxiety is been rough\n\nAgreed, this got so much worse when I entered my 30s. Cramping/physical symptoms decreased throughout my 20s, but now the emotional &amp; anxiety impact sucks!\n\nI‚Äôve been sad week after my period it‚Äôs called post menstrual syndrome I only get a good 2-3 days a month where I feel amazing this sucks ‚òπÔ∏èüòû\n\nThis is me exactly. I get like, one week of \"normal\" anxiety, 2 weeks of hell and a few days to a week of exhaustion. üò≠\n\nUgh this is me! My 30s are doing me dirty. I‚Äôm only 31 and I feel like my body and everything is changing so much and I‚Äôm not able to handle emotions like I did before.\n\nAbsolutely\n\nOh heck yeah! I get so anxious and negative. And then a week before I go through a ‚Äúeveryone hates me and I wanna quit my job‚Äù phase every month üíÄüíÄ\n\nOmggg me too LOL\n\n(32 years old) \n\nWow this is a god sent post. \n\nCurrently on mine and last week (week before)  and this week (currently) my mental health has been so poor. My head is so floaty I even called 911. I have been nervous to take my beta blockers but the past three days I have. This morning I tried not to and it was a freaking mess! I hope one day this passes and I need no medicine\n\nStay strong &lt;33 Take the medicine!! If it even gives you a little bit of relief, do it. I hope one day you can have peace with no medicine xx\n\nTry birth control. Low dose. It's helped me a ton.\n\nUgh girl same. I always swear I‚Äôm dying\n\nI do beta blockers too. I‚Äôd also recommend Calm Aid. You can get it on Amazon. This has helped me immensely and you can take it during the day without any drowsiness.\n\nDo you take the beta blocker everyday? Even now I woke up and I have the feeling of float in my head. I‚Äôm trying to just ignore it\n\nI don‚Äôt actually, I was told from my psych they are take as needed so this is okay. I mainly take them when I go to social events, honestly. Do you think that feeling is from having taken it last night? Or did you take it this AM?\n\nI‚Äôve been using the calm aid (lavender) daily, and just got a script from my psych for viibryd that I‚Äôm trying to get brave enough to start. lol.\n\nsorry this thread is old but I just purchased calm aid a few days ago, did you notice a difference?\n\nyes!!!!! my anxiety has been sky high during my cycle and my meds aren‚Äôt helping during it without having to take an extra dose\n\nDo you get physical symptoms from anxiety?\n\nYesss and even the week before. My anxiety and overthinking is sky high\n\nYep it‚Äôs happening to me right now and it‚Äôs been stressing me out with so many intrusive thoughts\n\nStay safe!\n\nYes - PMDD is so much fun\n\nGoing through my bad week rn and why the fuck am I such a crazy bitch ughhhgheudbdheisjdvdv\n\nYes. I have POTS where my heart rate goes crazy. When the period hits, I feel like I'm on the verge of death. Gives me insane anxiety. I'm on new meds now and I'm unsure how I'm going to feel soon...\n\nWhich meds are you on?\n\nYES! A lot of my anxiety is health anxiety, so feeling \"off\"-- even if it's just my period-- makes my anxiety go crazy. I also get so paranoid and unsure of myself. It's an exhausting monthly ordeal.\n\nDo you more chest pain and that anxiety feeling like you can‚Äôt breathe? Always seems the worst before period starts and first day or two once it starts.\n\nGenerally, I don't tend to get chest pains or shortness of breath with my anxiety unless I'm actively having a really awful panic attack. Most of my anxiety comes through in nausea. That said, working out even like a day before my period is always so much more difficult for some reason. I get awful shortness of breath and chest pains then, but Idk if that has to do with my period or just pms.\n\nThis is me\n\nTHISSSSSSS !!!!! ALL OF THIS !!!!!!!! üíØüíØ\n\nYes! My heart rate tends to rest high. I am also anemic so I got to make sure I am taking care of myself with iron levels. Eating lots of spinach, brocoli and oranges. Lots of protein. \n\nMan it's just a job to be on the menses.\n\nYessss. Left work early last week and went straight to the hospital because I felt like my chest was so tight, amd everything was spinning. First panic attack in over a decade with very dark thoughts.\n\n Period showed up the next day, a week early in my cycle. ü§®üôÑ\n\nDude. Yes. 1000 times over.\n\nThe week or a few days before are the worst emotionally\n\nYes and during ovulation as well\n\nYes and get soooo overheated that makes it worse. Clothes bother me also and I feel like a whale\n\nmaybe this explains why i had my first 3am panic attack in a month ü§£ forgot periods can increase anxiety\n\n100% yes and sometimes take Tums to help the acid reflux too.\n\nOne of the ways i know my period is around the corner is my paranoid thoughts and overthinking in general go through the roof\n\nI usually end up cancelling all my plans because I feel like I can't leave the house, it's a real thing\n\nYes it‚Äôs ramped up to the max around a week before and whilst on my period.\n\nI skip it every month so I don‚Äôt have to üò©\n\nYep, I almost always know when it‚Äôs that time bc my heart gets weird. Like a clenched feeling with almost palpitation sensations.\n\nYes definitely! I have just gone through a really bad patch. Full on panic attacks, convinced I was dying, the whole works. Period starts and day two it all melts away (well almost completely anyway).\n\n10 days before my period i get panicky\n\nI didn't really notice until the last few months because my period is so regular that I never really think about it being that time of the month, but I've been paying more attention lately and my elevated anxiety and depression levels do always seen to come around my period or the week before.\n\nPMS anxiety is absolutely awful...it's about a week of hell. And then as soon as my period starts I feel a relief, even the tension in my legs gives out a little bit.\n\nYes. Me currently. Even made a post about it a few days ago on this sub! Does birth control help with the PMS anxiety/panic attacks?\n\nI've had panic attacks and severe anxiety\n\n100%. I‚Äôm agender but I‚Äôm AFAB, I get really bad body dysmorphia and wish I wasn‚Äôt born this way and get a lot of dark thoughts lol\n\nWhat‚Äôs all that?\n\nAgender means having no gender/being gender neutral\n\nAfab means assigned female at birth (I don‚Äôt identify as a woman and I use they/them pronouns which is why I put that i‚Äôm afab)\n\nBody dysmorphia isn‚Äôt strictly something queer/lgbtq+ people feel but it‚Äôs like heavily disliking the way your body looks or the way it is, I can‚Äôt really describe it since it only gets really bad for me when I‚Äôm on my cycle but I like want to rip out my uterus and I begin convinving myself I should get a hysterectomy when I do feel that way\n\nAwesome! Thank you\n\nSorry you have to go through that.\nIs taking birth control an option for you?\nYou can take the pill continuously (without getting a period). I did it for years without any problems. Maybe that's also the case with other birth control methods, but I'm not really sure.\n\n100 percent.\n\nI feel anxious likenan entire week before and during.\n\nYes! So true! These last 2 menstrual cycles my anxiety has been through the roof. If something is bothering, my anxiety will go through the roof. With periods it messes with your hormones.\n\nDepression and anxiety yes it‚Äôs severe\n\nEvery cycle!\n\nOh, very much. Very anxious, very depressed, it's a whole thing.\n\nIt feels like it‚Äôs usually the worst around a week before my period starts, almost to a crippling degree.\n\nYes. 100%\n\nI‚Äôm like a balloon. Builds up then I pop. Then the next day I‚Äôm happy as a clam.\n\nFor sure.\n\nYes\n\nYes. This is pretty normal. It‚Äôs because of the change in hormones. Same reason we might get more emotional or more irritable.\n\nAnd women are still not allowed to apply for sick days every month if needed in most places\n\nDefinitely yes!  If it helps, mine (like a lot of women) is tied to the drop in estrogen and serotonin, which act as mood regulators, in the second half of our cycles.\n\nBig time! For a few days before, during and then a few days after, too. Haven‚Äôt found anything to combat it really, but knowing that it‚Äôs just something that always happens kinda helps I guess? \n\nI mean it still feels terrible, but I‚Äôve learnt to take a modicum of ‚Äòcalm‚Äô - calm really is too strong a word here‚Ä¶can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt remotely calm lol - from knowing that it‚Äôs just my hormones or sth else period related.\n\n5000% yes\n\nBIG YES!\n\nYes 100%\n\nYes! I'm watching now because I'm having an even worse time around ovulation.  So, basically, I get 1 good week out of the month. ü´£\n\n110%\n\nABSOLUTELY\n\nYes! My ovulation is BRUTAL now, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs bc I‚Äôm approaching 40 and all my hormone junk is changing more or what but my anxiety is awful during ovulation and PMS. it used to be more depression type feelings but now it‚Äôs switched over to anxiety full speed ahead 100x worse then my normal.\n\nI have irregular periods, so I never know exactly when I am going to get it. Every 3 weeks? Every 5 weeks? Who knows! My only warning is about 3 days before I get my period, my anxiety shoots way up. I usually have a moment where I am sitting thinking \"why do I feel like this!\" and then I go \"ohhhhh I know why\"\n\nExtremely omg\n\nYeah but I have PMDD so that‚Äôs why\n\nYes\n\nFor me, I feel it 3-10 days before my period. It gets wayyyy worse then it's gone once I get it. Weird.\n\nYes the week before, during, and a few days after. It‚Äôs exhausting feeling this way.\n\nAre you regular? Cause that would mean just +- 1 normal week in every cycle. Holy cow.\n\nThat doesnt make her feel better plz be sensitive!¬†\n\nI hate being a women. It‚Äôs a curse. Relate to all the comments.\n\nOh my gosh yessssss. My boobs started to hurt today and I bought chocolate at the store. I told my husband I apologize in advance for any potentially rude comments. I constantly am like \"ARE YOU SURE YOU LOVE ME?!\" Then the thoughts of like being a terrible mom and friend and wife and daughter and the crying.\n\nNo, not at all. I am lucky to have an unproblematic period. But the only time I ever cry is the day before or the first two days of my period.\n\nMy panic attacks increase 2 weeks before my period but I have PMDD\n\nyes my anxiety &amp; depression goes through the roof\n\n10000%!\n\nMy boyfriend knows when my period is coming. Not just when I tell him I started my placebo week from my birth control, but he says I get more anxious and I question my looks and body more. My anxiety is through the roof and it‚Äôs followed by depression and snacking\n\nüíØ\n\nYes, it's really awful....\n\nYes\n\nUgh yesss . Already have anxiety as it is. Sooo fun during and before shark week comes. ü§£ü¶à\n\n1111100000000%\n\nPMS yes, my period is actually a relief\n\nYes!!! Anxious! Insimniac, depressed, no energy.\n\nGOD YES!!!!\n\nfor me its the week after the flow has stopped that my anxiety is worse.\n\nTo all the ladies, answering this question. \nIs there any way a person can comfort you during your PMS, without irritating you more?\n\nNow that I think about it, yes. I had a sudden bout of anxiety maybe a day or two before my period started. I thought my body was messing with me because it's summer, and the exam/quiz anxieties were hitting (I am a uni student), but it very well might have been period-related instead. It has happened before, too, I think. Doesn't help that I'm in an environment that is really bad for my mental health.\n\nEdit: added a bit more context\n\nPeriod? Not really. The first day I tend to get fatigue and that makes already-existing anxiety worse. But if I‚Äôm not anxious that day period does not cause anxiety.\n\nPMS can be HELL. I get couple problematic symptoms every month. Sometimes one of them is extra anxiety. If I also get insomnia, I become dysfunctional. Just a sleep deprived, anxious mess. \n\nFunny that when I was a teenager it was the other way around. My periods were painful and symptomic. PMS was smooth. It changed around the age of 25 and continues for over a decade.\n\nYes\n\nYES\n\nYup was having suicidal thoughts daily last week and crying but now I feel as happy as ever. It‚Äôs really insane\n\nYes a few days before my period i get so anxious i get weird thoughts like what if someone breaks in or what if my mom died. Not fun\n\nYes, that's normal for us gals with anxiety disorders\n\nYes, and it‚Äôs awful!\n\nI have horrendous anxiety days before and sometimes just in the beginning. It is some of the worst anxiety I get\n\nyes and its hell\n\nOpposite for me.   The lead up to ovulation, until my period, is when I feel wackadoodle.\n\nI don't know because no one ever really studied womens body and proved that pms is real.\n\nDefinitely!!!!! I feel like im going crazy.\n\nVery much so. I think everyone hates me (More than usual) and I always end up apologizing so much because I feel like because I'm out of it and being an inconvenience\n\nYes !!!!\n\nDefinitely!! I use this to predict when my period is going to come since I have irregular periods.\n\nüíØ\n\nEugh yeah üò≠ the few days before it starts im more anxious and panicky abt things than usual, and then once it starts im back to my usual levels of anxiety. My friends always know when im abt to start because of it, since i even panic abt the same damn things every month\n\nAbsolutely, to the point that I was under the impression that I‚Äôve PMDD, but anxiety does make your PMS worse\n\n100%. I start panicking about everything, feeling very overwhelmed and get extremely depressed. And then I look at my calendar and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh üôÑ‚Äù\n\nI've been tracking my period for the last months for other health reasons and have noted an increase in panic attacks, self-loathing, and SI (the latter of which I don't often have except around this time) 3 days-a week before my period starts, then tends to lighten or disappear about 3 days into my period. So I'm almost positive I have PMDD/PME (PME is where you have an existing mental condition that your cycle exacerbates rather than being the sole cause of like PMDD...I'm pretty sure I just have GAD proper and my cycle takes it to a much darker place).\n\nWent to a doc about PMDD/PME and she sort of shrugged me off about B.C. (which I'm not on), and suggested she's had more success with PMDD patients on Prozac. I'm on lexapro now and tapering off very slowly w/ my doc's help because it didn't do anything for me for the years I tried it. Unsure if I'll go on prozac or another SSRI after.\n\nYes all the damn time. I literally just cried myself a bit this morning cause I felt super lonely out of nowhere.\n\nYeppppp. The past 3-4 years have been making me feel more anxious and even thinking negatively whenever I‚Äôm about to have it and during.\n\nYep, except it presents itself as irritability for me. Especially at work where my anxiety is already dialed up to 100 (retail). So I‚Äôm just more snappy and jittery\n\nI did - usually I had those issues (anxiety, depression) 7 days prior to my period. Then during bleeding it was better. Then I lost weight and took supplements and now I am ‚Äûonly‚Äú a depressed and emotional wreck 1-2 days before and 1-2 days during my period. But like really bad haha I cry for every bird poop in front of anybody. Afterwards I am pissed at myself for not controlling my emotions better. You cannot imagine how bad I wish that work life could be planned in the same pattern as the menstrual cycle. (Damn feminism - periods actually are the historical reason why only men used to work and go to war haha - please don‚Äôt come at me pro feminists, I also understand your side of the coin lol)\n\nYessss. The intrusive thoughts come out and play when my hormone levels are wacky\n\nYes! It's different every month but sometimes i just have a complete breakdown and other times im fine.  I hate it so much lol\n\nYES!!!\nI started journaling my cycle 1,5 month ago because of this, where everyday I describe my mood with a smiley, rate my anxiety from 0-10 and note the day of my cycle, and then write about my day as in a normal journal. \nSo far my anxiety reaches 10/10 during my period and is at the lowest point between ovulation and my period. I've been told by my therapist to avoid overstimulation in the days up to, and during my period, so I'm gonna try that!\n\nYes yes and yes.\n\nMe right now.\n\nOmg, I‚Äôm grateful when I figure out I‚Äôm PMSing because it explains all my heightened anxiety. It sucks but my brain just likes to be extra silly during that time where my hormones want to rave. Totally normal!\n\n100% that‚Äôs how I know that bitch comin üíÄüòÇ\n\nEverytime ü•∫\n\nHm, definitely overwhelmed which is basically anxious.\n\nWithout a doubt. For like a week and a half I‚Äôm struggling mentally with everything. A little before, during and after :/\n\nYes!!!\n\nOh yea. It‚Äôs bad I hate it\n\nOh wait till Peri and menopause. üòî\n\nI've never felt any change, and it's always made me think there is something wrong with me.\n\n100% my anxiety doubles.\n\nYes, definitely.  I was also recently diagnosed with PMDD.  My anxiety and irritability have been increasing a lot before my period in the last couple of years.  May be perimenopause related, too.  My mood was just all over the place.  Grumpy then crying for no apparent reason.  I was prescribed gabapentin 100mg as needed and take it for the week before my period, and then the first couple of days of it.  Has helped me tremendously.  It‚Äôs not for everyone though, because I‚Äôve heard mixed results.  I take up to two a day, which is still a very low dose, and feel little to no anxiety.  I‚Äôm also on an SSRI.  Only drawback is I feel a tad bit sleepy, and you‚Äôre not supposed to drive on it.  I‚Äôve heard it is prescribed off-label for anxiety as well.\n\nI have incredibly dark and scary thoughts that I won‚Äôt go into here during PMS. I‚Äôve been on an antidepressant for 9 years (not for PMDD, I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with it) and I still get these thoughts. There‚Äôs nothing I can do about it because I don‚Äôt tolerate hormonal birth control\n\nYup. And I am one of those people who have never even had cramps. But about 2-3 days before my period, I can't sleep and everything pisses me off.¬†\n\n\nSome lady on TikTok made a video and asked, \"I wonder how many women we've lost to this\" cause until it starts, either you don't remember or it's of no comfort no matter how precise or how closely you monitor your cycle. The video has so many comments, duets and stitches... It's scary.\n\n\nI hear some people feel it from the minute ovulation kicks in.¬†\n\nI‚Äôve found my people. I get anxious and lots of shortness of breathe. Every month now. I‚Äôve been lookin up natural and holistic ways to cope with this. Day 3 of no sugar, gluten, and dairy. Ordered magnesium and l-theanine. It seems like the meds doctors prescribe lead from one side effect to another. Just started my period today and anxiety came down. But I‚Äôll keep this lifestyle and hopefully some change down the road. Hope yall find some relief in some way. I‚Äôm exhausted with these up and down anxiety/panic attacks. üò©\n\nwhat did we do to deserve thisüò≠\n\nyes! my period is due in 4 days and for the last 4 days, I've been feeling so anxious and panicky about every small thing. my mind and feelings feel so out of control. today I had a little argument with my manager and I could not shake the anxiousness off all day. i feel like I'm just shit at my work. and I KNOW that ill get my period and immediately I will be calm. the switch just flips and it is unbelievable how it happens. \n\nthis used to not happen earlier. my pms is def worse post 25.\n\nliterally reading the comments has made me tear up\n\nAm currently a week to my period and have been feeling shaky and antsy since yesterday. It always happens and, when it does, it feels like my anti-anxiety meds aren't working. üò≠\n\ni cant track my period bc iud but my anxiety peaks monthly. its been geeking me out trying to figure out why im like this,,, probably just my womb :/\n\n[removed]\n\nThis content has been removed. All studies must be vetted by the mod team. Please send us a message via modmail and we will provide further instructions.\n\nall along the month I'm trying to live my best life, doing my job correctly, be the best version of me and then suddenly PMS comes to make me the horrible person I dont even recognise!\n\nMine starts few days before but some months itll linger throughout and its HELL. My anxiety is through the roof and i cant sleep or eat üòî\nRumination on 1000000\n\nThis is me right now. All week leading up to my period I‚Äôve been extremely anxious, and having random panic attacks. This morning I was dead asleep, and woke up to my heart racing. I started feeling extremely dizzy, sick to my stomach, hot, and shaking uncontrollably. I got up to go to the restroom (felt like I had to throw up), and I noticed I started my period. \nIt has been awful. I came back to bed, but I‚Äôm still having uncontrollable shaking, heart palpitations, etc. On top of this period pain..it just feels awful!\n\noh my god my anxiety SKYROCKETS.but it‚Äôs more so starting the week before my period starts\n\nYes before and sometimes during\n\nI‚Äôm going through this, but I think it‚Äôs due to GAD. But I found a video and this is what they told me to use and I feel like I‚Äôve been able to manage the second month of this. Get iodine. (specifically sea kelp), vitamin D (10,000 IU or higher), and DIM. I also have Bruspsr just in case but I haven‚Äôt taken it in a while and I‚Äôm not trying to.\n\nThis is a new symptom for me. Im usually anxious but recently during my bleed, Im almost constantly anxious, like fighting through anxiety attacks.\n\nI had an awful case of the jitters today, which made eating fun. I couldn't pick up the carton with the fries in, I dropped it. I felt like a massive tit.¬†\n\n\nJesus, it seems like my anxiety is more heightened than it normally is when I wake up with the vibrating feeling in my legs. Which I have put down as a panic attack.\n\nYeah I'm due on now and I'm so anxious. Happens every month when I'm due to come on. My cycles shit as well it's usually every 20-23 days but this month it's got to day 26 so it's taking ages to actually start so my anxiety has lasted longer. I'm actually waiting on test results for my estrogen as it's been low for a while and if it is low I may have to go on the combined pill (I'm 39). But I've definitely got PMDD for sure. I only get like 1 week in my cycle where I feel my anxiety is much more manageable which must be mid cycle when estrogen is at its highest. It's ruined my life for the last year. I never had this issue prior to last year. The joys of getting older lol\n\nit wasnt me it was you\n\nYES. Sorry for the delay‚Äîjust came across this after googling it üòÖ both on and off anxiety meds I feel like hell mentally the week before my period starts."

Hang in there! ü´°\n\nI'm one of the lucky ones who are terrified and can't feel anything at the same time lol\n\n[removed]\n\nI hate that it messes with the head so much that it becomes physical.\n\nMine did last time. I trembled, had a headache and my upper back ached from tensing my shoulder muscles\n\nI‚Äôve got the 'so depressed they can‚Äôt feel anything' AND the 'terrified by dumb stuff' lol\n\nYa I'm there with you. I'm plagued with health anxiety. Literally is ruining my life and has basically turned me into agoraphobic it's sucks\n\nYeah me too.. it‚Äôs not to the point of panic attacks but I spiral and worry when it‚Äôs bad‚Ä¶ cutting caffeine completely helped me a great deal¬†\n\nI literally had to cut coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol. Only stimulant I miss is cigarettes\n\nHow long has it been since you smoked?\n\nSince January. Trust me I want one right now lol\n\nI just fought my ass off, made it two months, and started again. That stuff is so addicting that people on oxygen tanks keep smoking them. You should be proud of yourself. I'm proud of you. You'd be a fool to ever go back to it. This is one rare situation where your anxiety might add 10-20 years to your life. You've gone almost a year without that garbage, that's awesome.\n\nAnd thanks so much for the congrats. It means a whole lot\n\nI look at it this way, my dad is one of those people who still smoke on oxygen and he refuses to try and give it up. But I gave it up because it was starting to give me heart palps. Didn't want to deal with it. I'd rather have my heart beat right than not\n\nI smoked for two decades. I've now not smoked for two decades since quitting. Every once a year or so I'll even bum a smoke just for fun chatting outside a bar or concert, and I have no desire to buy a pack. \n\nThe odd thing that did it for me was being on a super low carb diet. My spouse quit doing the same thing. People's bodies react differently, so not intended to preach a solution. But in my case I found out sugar impacted my smoking, alcohol and diet so much that dramatically cutting it out helped me fix all of it.\n\nI'm so sorry you go through thisüò¢\nI am with you on the health anxiety stuff, I deal with it too. It definitely blows the big one!!¬†\n\n\nSomething that helps me: I ask myself how many times have the health fears I've had actually come true? Then I have my answer. You've got to trick your mind. I totally get it that it doesn't always work. I can't relate completely with the agoraphobic thing; but I can tell you that even with anxiety, it tends to help to get out and distract yourself and do something that makes you happy. I hope you are able to get through this. I know it's much easier said than done\n\nYa thats the thing. I've been plagued with a severe pain that causes me to think cancer when I've been tested and the doctors are even stumped. They know it's not a made up pain but I still have it and nothing makes it go away\n\nI used to have this a lot. Any slight variation in my body would lead me to think I am dying. I mean I am actually currently going to go get something in my neck checked out because I think I might have throat cancer. Who knows if I do or if it is just anxiety again. But the piece that is different now vs then is that I have found my peace with it. I have spent the last decade resolving deep issues I had with direct family members. I am not in a relationship so no one besides my immediate family to leave behind. And my dog. Ultimately I have come to terms with my mortality. I am not in control of where the boat goes. No matter how hard I try to make it go one way it just goes another. So what if I die before I'm 35? Millions of people before me died at 15-18 in wars. Kids die of cancer. Life expectancy used to be extraordinary short. Then you have the people who do live long lives. Some of even many filled with misery and depression. This world is beautiful. But it is also its own inescapable hell. It isn't and never has been fair. And I have no control over it. Don't misread this. I am not depressed. I certainly don't want to die. I am actually quite content with my life. But making peace with your mortality is in my opinion the only thing one should focus on in life. It is paramount. Otherwise everything else is just a distraction from the inevitable. Finding this peace is about letting go of our need for control. The anxiety of death is rooted in fear. Explore that fear deeply. It isn't easy and will take a lot of time. Philosophy and religion seem to be the most obvious places that this way of thinking brings you to. But once you find your peace death just becomes your turn to move on. There is no perfect life to live. Be glad with what you did even if it wasn't as perfect as you imagined. All that to say you are probably fine. But this is just the current position of someone who has been obsessively anxious about death for over a decade or more. Good luck to you.\n\nI'm not OP but thank you. I have obsessed over death all my life and this was one of the first actually comforting things I've read about it. I'm going to remember this forever I think.\n\nSame here. I'm actually crying.\n\nThat‚Äôs the best way to view it. We cannot control anything, we shouldn‚Äôt be afraid. I see it as, if there is something wrong and I don‚Äôt live any longer, that‚Äôs just how my life was supposed to be and we may have to enjoy every moment of it.\n\nUpdate us on how getting your current issue checked out went. I struggle with extreme health anxiety and I think I worry more about suffering than dying.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING: Suicide, Murder\n\nWow. This struck me with some light and I appreciate you for sharing your thoughts.\n\nI guess for some people (including me), it's not about the the fear of death itself. But the manner of dying? I don't believe that you can die peacefully. You die because you either have an illness (detected or undetected), got caught in a fatal accident, someone kills you or you kill yourself. No one dies peacefully and painless after struggling with cancer or getting hit by a car. No one dies peacefully after getting stabbed or hanging themselves.\n\nI guess it's really the fear of the physical pain and agony that comes before death. So damn frightening.\n\nI would like to respond to this because this absolutely is a different element of death that I really don't touch on in the first post. As i alluded to in the first post philosophy and religion seem to be the most pertinent next steps and even potential solutions to this deep fear. I understand reddit is largely secular and has no interest in anything religion which is why I did not touch on this end in my first post. However what you are discussing is certainly something I have only been able to truly deal with due to my religion. Because of this I am going to create two responses. One from a religious perspective and one from a secular one. Ultimately though nothing can truly resolve the fear of pain and suffering. It will be hard and even a change in mindset cannot absolve that issue. \n\n\nNon Religious: I am starting with this so you can ignore the latter if you choose to. I do not intend to convert. Only to give my perspective. I was not always a Christian and before becoming one I honestly was only alive because the guilt of leaving my family behind was too great. It was very hard for me to find any sort of meaning in life. Nihilism was truth.  Everyone says it is for the betterment of the human species but we are the cause of much of the suffering we end up having to solve. And we haven't charged in all of recorded human history. We always end with war and violence. And in general with wrath towards those we disagree with. Suffering seems to come in two ways. Human created. And natural. Human created suffering was the primary reason I could not sit comfortably on what my purposed solution is. Natural suffering was resolved by saying well that's just the way the world is. So my only obtainable solution from a secular view to human created suffering or perhaps suffering in general is to try and view it from the perspective of a shared human consciousness. Think of all the people in war dying. Truly think about their pain. Their lost limbs. The sting of a bullet. Think about the kids who are starving to death. Imagine how their stomachs churn with no end. Imagine the fear of those that lose their minds slowly to dementia and are helplessly trapped in their own deteriorating mind. Then imagine all those that lived before us. The billions of souls that are gone. Each with their own story of suffering. Some worse than others. When it is your turn. Whatever shade of suffering it is. Take heart in knowing you are not the first to feel it. And you will not be the last. We are united in our mortality and in our suffering. Focus on the greater human spirit rather than your own individual plight. Again this was not satisfactory for me for a myriad of reasons which is why I over much time was brought to find God. And how that shapes a new perspective below. \n\nReligious: I am a Christian after many years of being agnostic. Ever since finding God I have read through all of the new testament and some of the old. Between this and my prayer life I have come to understand God's character most distinctly seen in his choice to send a part of himself (Jesus) to give us a path away from the one we are all on. The most notable thing within the story of Jesus is his crucifixion. Even Jesus feared his death beforehand calling out to the father. Jesus walked knowingly and bravely into what is to this day to be considered the most agonizing method of torture and death ever devised. The Bible and the over arching character of God makes it clear that suffering is not in vain. Emotional suffering can lead to character and strength. Physical suffering is honestly the prerequisite for good things like gaining muscle or even just discovering issues with your body. God makes it clear that when we suffer Jesus suffers with us. He promises that our suffering will be short lived in the perspective of eternity. I am petrified of torture. And even more so in some diseases. Ultimately these forms of suffering are hard to understand how to view them positively. But for me the purpose of that suffering if I was in that situation would be to rely on God and remain firm in my faith regardless of my \"unfair\" situation. God has a greater plan so far outside of my ability to see that it is important and honestly freeing to let go and trust. Instead of wallowing in self pity. I let go of controlling the river. But more than that I believe God made that river I am on deliberately and specifically. And I will ride its waves until the end. Even if that end is into a waterfall of rocks. I am not in control. God is. And I yield even my suffering to him. \n\nGood luck to you.\n\n[removed]\n\nThis content has been automatically removed.

Dignitas where the drug cocktail knocks you out before you pass. \n\nThere are other methods which don't cause pain (or alarm) but I won't post them for obvious reasons.\n\nI haven't heard about Dignitas. This is new information.\n\nI only worry about dying before my daughter turns 18. Im a single mom and her bio is a total loser who hasn‚Äôt seen her since she was 1. Im terrified of the chance she may have to live with him if I kick the bucket. She is almost 16. I‚Äôll worry less once she is 18.\n\nI'm guilty of this one.. my daughters 3. My wife is amazing and I know she'd be okay without me if I were to die, but I just don't wanna miss everything. I imagine being at her school graduations and her wedding and her kid announcements possibly one day. I don't want to miss anything and always feel like I'm going to die and she'll just get a new dad and I'll just be a distant memory\n\nThis is exactly me. My daughter is 10 and my son is 7. I live like I am on a clock. I want them to be independent before it is my time to go. I suffer from this idea I don‚Äôt have much time left, and having chronic illnesses also makes it feel far more real. I want to trust that my wife could manage both of them in her own, but the guilt I would feel from traumatizing them haunts me. I saw my dad go from his usual self to a husk of a human in under a year ‚Äî I would never want to subject my kids to that at any age, but especially when they are young and in their formative years\n\nI know that feeling. Don't let the stress win, we've got thisüí™üèΩ just gotta take it one day at a time\n\nI'm anxious every morning and have head symptoms nonstop everyday mainly dizzyness all since June. Doctors still have no idea what's wrong with me an that makes me wonder that if I'm gonna drop dead soon but that's why it's important to always live life like you were dying. Simply make the best of it and try not to stress over what cannot be controlled\n\nI've had EEG, MRI, CT scan so far and all came back clear. I was stuck in bed for 2 months with little to no sleep. Constantly waking to confusion. Beginning of October I developed a blood clot in my leg from what I can only suspect was from laying in bed all that time an not moving enough. It was hell to the point I was ready to leave this world but I pushed through it but it felt it was going to bed endless so happy to say I've improved somewhat since then to where I can do things again an go back to work. I'll just be going on with life with this head pressure and dizzyness every single day until doctors find whats going on or if it decides to go away on its own. If something is hiding and can't be corrected then I suppose it's my time as anyone's. Not gonna stress over what can't be controlled cause what kinda life is that?\n\nGod, my head symptoms drive me insane. I was actually sent for a brain MRI that I had last Monday. Still waiting on the results it‚Äôs driving me insane\n\nI had similar symptoms for 6 months. Also a hypochondriac so it didn‚Äôt help. Got put on anxiety medications almost stopped immediately. I was also super dehydrated which didn‚Äôt help\n\nOmgg me everyday.\n\nSince when?\n\nAlso anyone welcome to pm me about this stuff. It's Comforting to know I'm not the only one fighting this every day\n\ni'm in the same boat with head symptoms :( my head never feels just \"right\" and it's driving me kinda insane. worst part is that sometimes there's just no pain but i just don't feel \"right\" i'm honestly tired and lonely. at least knowing other people have it too makes me feel a little relieved.\n\nWell my pms always open if you wanna talk any time. I chat with some others going through similar symptoms and we been supportive of each other in ways to help get through this crap\n\nYou can maybe look into PPPD with those symptoms.\n\nYou should look into PPPD for the diziness symptoms..\n\nWhat's that?\n\nHard to explain it shortly. Look into it on reddit and the internet. Its diziness without something being structuraly wrong.\n\nYou mean like vertigo?\n\nIts not really vertigo. Read into the symptoms.. and you will see if you can find yourself there..\n\nWell I searched it but it's hit and miss with the symptoms I experience. I notice I experience it all less when I'm not focusing on it. I mostly get it when sitting down but even then when I'm still an not thinking of it, I don't even notice it\n\nI either worry about dying too soon or not soon enough. Repeat.\n\nPft same üòÇüò≠\n\n&gt;Meanwhile I get a headache and instantly have a panic attack because of course it‚Äôs a brain tumour\n\nHealth anxiety...lived with it for 30 years.  2 years free due to histamine intolerance treatment (root cause of my anxiety).  Being able to swallow pills without my throat automatically locking up is CRAZY lol\n\nWould you please elaborate on what you had to do for the treatment?¬†\n\nI don't know if links are allowed in this sub - check the pinned Table of Contents in my profile &amp; search for \"histamine\".  There's a link for symptoms I experienced &amp; the protocol I use.\n\nI can still be pushed into anxiety, but I'm 2 years free of daily anxiety on histamine treatment!\n\nI‚Äôm happy to know I‚Äôm not alone with these thoughts. I‚Äôve done to the doctors so many times because I constantly think I have a brain tumor or something wrong with my heart. It‚Äôs literally so deliberating. It sucks because I hate talking to people about my worries because they get annoyed saying ok but my brain doesn‚Äôt allow me to think I‚Äôm ok\n\nfelt\ni have panic attacks over paper cuts \nand rn, i have lower abdominal pain &amp; am terrified of appendicitis (i got a ct scan in june and my appendix appeared healthy. i think im just constipated) because those what ifs go crazyyyy\n\nI've worried about dying my entire life, even as a child. Not like most people \"oh, I'll be dead by then\", but \"I. AM. Going. To. Die. Someday\". When. How. What about my pets. What about my friends. How old will I be.\n\nThe older I get, the more I think about it, especially with everything going on in the world now.\n\nWhat really got me was when my mother passed away. She was 88, but in relatively good health. She was in a car accident. I got to the ER, and she was awake and alert. She was supposed to have surgery the next morning. The last thing she said to me was \"you'll have to take care of me\". She went into seizures that night, and was on life support for a week before we I just her go. What really got to me was when I went thru her things. The stores were just starting to put out Christmas things. I found new ornaments and Decorations. She had just got them. She was looking forward to Christmas, and she didn't make it to see it. It's been over 2 years,  and it still hits incredibly hard.\n\nSorry to hear about your mom passing that way. Don't stress over things you can't control. I know it's way easier said than done but do your best. I'm the same way as you in the fear of dying. I have a 3 year old and I get sad thinking I won't be there for her first day or middle school or maybe her wedding or what if she calls someone else dad. Don't let the stress win! We can do this. One day at a time, just think, all the times we thought we were gonna die but didn't. At this point we have a 100% rate of being wrong about death so we never know. You've got thisüí™üèΩ keep your head up and your spirits higher.\n\nI never could wrap my head around being suicidal, because I have always considered myself the exact opposite\n\nSame. I can't fathom how people get to that point but living with anxiety I also slightly understand it more.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry about your mom. That‚Äôs incredibly sad.\n\nScared of death, how my consciousness can just end, how I‚Äôll die, not being able to tell my loved ones how much I love them or cuddle my dogs one more time. I worry even more about my loved ones dying. I feel like I can‚Äôt enjoy things sometimes, like I‚Äôll make the choice to go somewhere or ignore my ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù (aka anxiety) and me and/or a loved one will die. It‚Äôs really awful.\n\nHahaha so true! You know I never realized that maybe my hypochondria was just another byproduct of my anxiety\n\nIt‚Äôs an exact product of anxiety. I feel you\n\nI always have this thought that I'm dying or I'm deathly sick and I'm always told I'm dramatic or a hypochondriac or just flat out crazy. After feeling shitty for weeks I went to the Dr and my Dr thinks I'm now diabetic or possibly have thyroid disease.. don't listen to people, go get your health checked if youre have an intuition feeling. Most people with anxiety are fine and just suffering from anxiety but some people with anxiety also have other health concerns. It's like once people find out you're an anxious person, everything you complain or worry about is just dramatic.\n\nOml I am convinced I am dying like. Everyday. I stress even more about my loved ones. I feel like we‚Äôre all too aware of life‚Äôs uncertainties and how anything could happen at any time; and it seems like neurotypical people are less in tune with that. It‚Äôd be nice to have a happy medium; where people are aware enough to really hold their loved ones close and remind them what they mean to them; but not to the point where everytime they themselves, or their loved ones walk out the door and the only thought it ‚Äúwell are they gonna make it back home?‚Äù üò≠\n\nThis may seem flippant but i don't mean it too . I have suffered like you until one day  i thought right stuff it ,if i am going to die then so be it. I just dare death to take me every night i say do your best and now i feel better it is like i have confronted my biggest fear and now im not so scarred any more . IT is a relief to be honest\n\nnah this is good. i been struggling all year and it‚Äôs gotten to the point i can‚Äôt get out of bed. what do i do?\n\nIt so hard mate i know .The fears are real the pains are real .Talking to people who traveled the same road is good .Just keep trying .To quote a famous alien Never give up never surrender keep fighting to live buddy .Good luck\n\nthank you.ü©∑ü©∑ü©∑ü©∑\n\nIts honestly so exhausting\n\nMy fear of dying was impacting my ability to enjoy life. Even doing simple things like crossing the road, or taking a shower, felt as dangerous as bungee jumping. The serenity prayer really helped me. (Grant me the serenity to accept the things I can‚Äôt change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference) I realised that there is nothing I can do to prevent it. No matter what I do one day I will die. So I decided to redirect my energy and only worry about stuff I had control over. \nIt was so freeing! The old fears and thoughts still pop up now and then, and I‚Äôm cautious about slipping in the shower and crossing the road. But if it gets overwhelming I take back control of my thoughts by reminding myself that there is nothing I can do about it. (Yeah I know how ironic that is üòÖ)\n\nNo I kindve hope it happens to me. I'm scared of being alive and suffering and deteriorating. Losing my eyesight, being in pain. Seeing people you love go. These things scare me.\n\nI got my brain MRI results back today and every apparently looks fine. I am obviously so relieved I don‚Äôt have the dreaded brain tumour I thought I did, but I‚Äôm also abit like, ok so what is causing these symptoms????\n\nWe have the same kind of thinking and tbh it's tiring to feel this way :(\n\nI literally wake myself out of rem sleep with this fear\n\nIt's very similar for me except I'm constantly worrying that in a minute I'll have a massive heart attack\n\nIm always silently monitoring everyone around me for signs of illness and it is making me lose my social life\n\noh yea after i have b12 deficiency i am struggle with health anxiety. i have to stop googling all the time. hahaha sorry you felt this way about your headache it can be tricky to tell our brain to stop worrying. i'm with you. you're not alone and let's feel better soon together\n\nI had an anxiety attack last night that left me feeling in pain physically and mentally. I twitched with a weird muscle spasm in my shoulder and upper back. My head hurt. My back hurt. I kept having intrusive thoughts.\n\nI feel terrible anxiety by the day as if I am gonna die. At night I become depressed. No time to breathe\n\nI think about it EVERY day. Because anxiety stopped me from living and all I can think is this could all be over any time and I missed out on x, y, z. \n\nThe only thing that helps in these moments is to remind myself that I‚Äôm not so special that I have some foreknowledge of when I‚Äôll die, I‚Äôm no different to absolutely everyone else alive today and anything can happen to them, too. \n\nAnd thanks to anxiety I have spent the last ten years of my life thinking I will die that day. Well here I am ten years later , I didn‚Äôt lose consciousness, I didn‚Äôt faint or collapse or whatever else I thought would happen if I went to that place for lunch with my friend or whatever, all I lost was a lot of living.\n\nI COMPLETELY relate to your headline!! I always think I am going to die of something. It's bad. I have had GAD/panic disorder since I was 8. I'm the only one in my family who struggles with itüòî\nThere are times it is crippling. While I understand the stats of how many people are actually on these things for the same or similar reasons- I still feel like I am the only one going through this stuff. When I'm out in public I feel like everyone else looks happy and normal. Does anyone else go through this feeling and what do you do to make it better?¬†\n\n\nThanks everyone. I'm glad we at least can relate to each otherü´§\n\nI used to have the same feeling. I tried a lot of different meds until I found a couple that work great. I no longer get the feeling. In fact I fear death much less. I surely don‚Äôt want to die but I no longer get those irrational feelings. Don‚Äôt give up.¬†\n\nNewsflash: you ARE dying. One day at a time. Enjoy the ride."

Im terrified. \n\nEverybody is laughing and having a great time outside and I dont want to go to the ER for the 200th time just to tell me they cant do anything for me and to call my psychiatrist. I hate this. I hate it so much. \n\n\n\n",

    "all_comment_text": "Bro take the klonipin this is why you have it I'm guessing.\n\nYeah I took .6 more mg and it helped a ton but im just a wreck rn\n\nSounds like you're not only having an anxiety attack, but you're really beating yourself up for it. Take it easy on you. üíñ\n\nI know alcohol isn‚Äôt the best idea‚Ä¶ but at a wedding‚Ä¶. lol I wouldn‚Äôt however as I‚Äôve seen now that you‚Äôve already taken a benzo. Those don‚Äôt mix\n\nGlad u took more medication‚Ä¶splash some cold water on your face and neck‚Ä¶ see if they have cold bottled water you cold out on your neck‚Ä¶.Get some fresh air‚Ä¶ breath‚Ä¶. Just know you‚Äôre probably not the only one having anxiety right now‚Ä¶\n\nThe thing is that Im the worst person in the world to deal with anxiety. Any slight rise in heart rate I panic. Also this wedding was in a vineyard and the heat was absolutely terrible. So rapid heart beat + panic + horrible heat its like instant kill for me.\n\nOmg! We are the same person!!!  My heat sensitivity is beyond horrible‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt tell u how many times I literally have had the same thing‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve posted about it several times‚Ä¶ heat../ get shaky , heart racing, complete panic‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt leave anywhere without a Xanax in my purse just in case‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so petrified of heat anymore‚Ä¶ and I live by the beach‚Ä¶ it really sucks!  But look‚Ä¶ your original post was 6 hrs ago‚Ä¶ and here you are! You made it!!!! Little bump but you did it!! Huge congrats!\n\nThanks! Yes heat is the absolute worse and in this places they dont have A/C anywhere. I literally rented a car just to have ac lmao.\n\nThis is true. Every 5 minutes that goes by, you have made it. üòÑ\n\nI have issues with heart rate worsening anxiety in a vicious cycle too. Not wanting to rely on sedatives and no anti- anxiety med seeming to help, my doctor put me in propranalol off label for my anxiety. It's a beta blocker medicine so it's purpose is to calm down the heart rate. It has worked so much better than any anti anxiety med ever has. And unlike diazepam it doesn't seem to be getting less effective.\n\nYeah I feel like clonazepam is getting less effective. I want to switch to propranalol but my fear is that it calms my heart but im still anxious af.\n\nFor me it felt like all those breathing and relaxation stuff that they teach you for anxiety actually had a chance to work when my heart rate isn't super high.\nIt's not a magic pill that gets rid of anxiety but it does calm the heart which for me just gave me the opportunity to deal with it a bit easier\n\nAlso on propranolol, and it really does wonders. Especially when I can take it in preparation for certain events\n\nSaaaame, you're not alone! Especially health anxiety.\n\nYou will be okay! ü§ç\n\nI know that feeling! My medication gives me terrible heat sensitivity. Like anything over 75 degrees and I'm a mess outside. My family thinks I'm being dramatic. ü´§\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes!! Stress sweat is a whole thing and my pits immediately get sticky when I start panicking‚Ä¶\n\nThis definitely has helped me, splashing cold water on my face and neck. Doing the notice 3-4 things around you. Lately, I've been drinking water with electrolytes powder that contains potassium and magnesium. I've never felt calmer until now. Hoping you get through this. üôè\n\nBreathe, Remember it cannot harm you and try to absorb the happiness around you remember there are thousands if not millions of other people feeling the exact way you have before and that it will all fade away with time\n\nHave you ever considered a beta blocker to slow your heart rate down when panic attacks start up?\n\nYeah I think I will ask for propranolol next time im with my psychiatrist. Bc my heart rate is the main issue almost 90% of the time.\n\nMake sure not to take too much. I got prescribed that and took 1 and was feeling great so took another. And then another lmao and my heart rate was going so slow and I usually get anxiety from health related stuff but I wasn‚Äôt freaking out so I guess it really does help with anxiety but yeah don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. I called the pharmacy and they said just wait it out.\n\nThis would be a perfect medication for you. I had the same issue, started freaking out when my heart rate started to increase and go into panic mode. My anxiety also gets exacerbated by the heat.\n\nNow I take a beta blocker regularly and I have never had a panic attack since. Years. \nI‚Äôm not knocking on benzos, because I have to take them as well, but this is a healthier and safer drug that would benefit you.\n\nWhat's a good beta blocker brand?\n\nThe medication is called Propranolol, I don‚Äôt know if it has a specific brand name. Total game-changer for my anxiety as it‚Äôs just taken as-needed to reduce physical symptoms with basically no side effects.\n\nThis ‚òùüèº\n\nI take this too, but super randomly. PRN. I‚Äôve had to travel a lot for work so anxiety will go up during those times. Do you take it once a day? I kind of want to try using it as a daily anxiety medication (the dr is okay with that)\n\nYes, I take 60 mg extended release. I also used to get occasional skipped heart beats and I haven‚Äôt had many since being on it daily.\n\nThis got me teary eyes because this happens to me as well. Happened yesterday while I was at Walgreens. And the whole ER thing I‚Äôm in the same boat. I‚Äôm so tired of this üòî now I have this new symptom, might be cervical vertigo, pinched nerve etc I‚Äôm always out of balance dizzy and feel like I‚Äôm going pass out all the time. They never find anything wrong. üòî I hope you‚Äôre feeling better. I know that feeling of watching everyone look normal and we‚Äôre just having the worst experience physically! I go through this ever single day doing my one hour walk. Why us ? Why ? Why can‚Äôt we just be normal ? We do so much to better ourselves and nothing works. Either a new symptom comes along or you think things are getting better and boom back to square one. I‚Äôm sorry brother! üòî\n\nWhy why why why? Why?\n\nIt's catastrophizing and I too used to do it all the time. I had this crazy symptom when my anxiety was at its worst; my head would start pounding like crazy and I would pull at my hair around the area where I felt this pressure and I for sure thought there was something else wrong with me - \n\nI'm a lot better now and what I'm about to say you may not belive but our brain is so so powerful that it legitimately is hurting us lol. Like it's actively being vile, but only bc it thinks this is the way we survive lol. \n\nStupid brain. \n\nBest things that have helped me. Understanding human touch.\nLooking people in the eye.\n(The above two you can start with people close to you- really, just straight up ask to do these silly intimate things with close freinds or loved ones) \n\nPhys-cadeli-cs [I know we can't talk about them on this sub but the amount of people that I see just absolutely being harrowed by this aliment makes me wonder, why?] (I was so distraught, I truly sought help and all kinds of medicine and just like its super supported to talk about pharma meds, why isn't nature's meds also talked about?) \n\nA lot. And I mean A lot of exposure therapy. - I continued to sweat bullets and be anxious for nearly a year after my aya trip. But at about 10 - 11 months. I think I'm feeling the best I've ever felt lol (atm I'm at about 14 moths scince my first aya session)\n\nThe gateway project. (Some CIA mind over matter experiments lol) \n\nStaying fit. \n\nHaving good times with good friends. \n\nBeing content with the goals I have in mind and set in motion. \n\nGood luck üëç\n\nYes. Thank you for your advice. I was in a amazing point back in 2020. I was so healthy, exercising no symptoms enjoying life. But it always come back üòû\n\nIt‚Äôs okay. You are in control of this situation. You can take breaks at any time. And don‚Äôt feel bad for using you medication. Weddings are tough, long, anxiety inducing social events. You needed that medication and the fact that you know the possibility of getting dependent proves that you are doing the best you can to manage.\n\nNext time this happens in a public place with friends or colleagues just say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mind me, I‚Äôm just having a panic attack and it will be over in a few mins. Bear with me‚Äù. \n\nI guarantee someone will relate because they have had a panic attack. Removing the burden of feeling embarrassed about a panic attack is a huge step. \n\nNo shame in panic attacks   Heck 10% of the population has them.\n\nThat‚Äôs what I do a lot of times. 9/10 times someone totally relates\n\nHow did the rest of your evening go OP? I hope it went more smoothly\n\nI gladly made it through the end. Had to leave to the car several times, disappear randomly specially after eating lol. But I feel better now.\n\nGood I‚Äôm so happy to hear it turned around!\n\nYou did it- you persisted and got through it! I'm sorry it was so difficult for you but every time you show anxiety who's boss by powering on through it, you're winning the good fight and should be proud of yourself. Hope you can have a chill day tomorrow to recover!\n\nThank you! I hope so. Also I need to rest from benzos lol.\n\nSo good that you managed to manage the panic attack and also do what you needed to do to get through it. Honestly it‚Äôs one of the biggest achievements when you manage to do that, so you should allow yourself to have that win. üî•üíú\n\nTake it in. Accept that you have anxiety and that you have all the right to feel how you feel. Don't fight it. Embrace it. Use anger if you have to. There's no shame in it. \n\nEasier said that done. I know. But this is the way.\n\nThis is correct advice. It‚Äôs the only way to end panic attacks.\n\nNot only the way to end, but also to realize that, next time, you will get through this too.\n\nI'll have a wedding in a few weeks. I'll take a tablet of diazepam half an hour before.\n\nYou're not alone. Anxiety sucks, we don't deserve this.\n\nI agree. That feeling of visceral panic is horrible.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry homie. That literally happened to me a couple of months ago. We were waiting in a foyer area that was nice and then they opened the doors to the cocktail hour. It was really sprawled out with empty spaces and not many chairs to go to or tables. Everyone grabbed the tables and chairs fast and I was just stuck looking around in the middle of the room nowhere to go. The panic started to happen and I went to the bathroom and couldn‚Äôt calm down for the entire hour.\n\nHow's are you now dude ?\n\nDude, have you tried propranolol?  It‚Äôs really good for situations like that.  Won‚Äôt knock your ass out.\n\nI know this event has passed, but just wanted to send some love. I know it feels like no one understands, but we do! +1 to other recs of ice cubes in palms or on neck\n\nThank you very much. Yes ice cubes always work to help me calm down. Tbh I tend to chew them and I kinda fucked my teeth now because of that habit.\n\nYou might need to consider going on some longer term meds like an SSRI. Helps a lot for ongoing anxiety. Plus keep in mind some people get their heart rate up to 160+ deliberately during exercise every day. Some people can legit get their heart rates over 200 and nothing happens to them. It feels like shit but it doesn‚Äôt kill you, it‚Äôs just your brain misfiring. Sometimes just remembering and accepting that a high heart rate isn‚Äôt dangerous is enough to calm you. Don‚Äôt fight it, accept it. Sit with the bad feelings and sensations for a few minutes without trying to fight them off. Let them roll over you and breathe. Eventually they‚Äôll pass, they will ALWAYS pass.\n\nIn the moment of anxiety do the exact opposite of what your anxiety is telling you. Go out in the situation you're currently in (the wedding) and engage in life. This shows anxiety you are safe. The best way to overcome is to accept and allow it to be there, without any input from you.\n\nRead your post- I hope you‚Äôre doing okay now\n\nTake the Klonopin in the moment that you need it, worry about getting off of it later when you‚Äôre not in a panicked state. I know i‚Äôm replying 10 hours later, but you got this.\n\nI think panic in social situations is more common than many of us realize. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre feeling better!\n\nMaybe look into Beta Blockers. They can be used for anxiety problems (and also heart issues) I‚Äôm on metoprolol (50 mg twice a day) and it helps prevent the physical side effects of panic attacks such as fast heart rate, shaking and hot flashes\n\nHugs my bro. I‚Äôve been there. So many times. Different bathroom, different event, different person but the exact same feeling.\n\nWhat are you afraid of?\n\nHaving pvcs bc my heart rate is fast af but that is what causes pvcs in the first place so im trapped in a vicious cycle. Also heat just makes me feel like absolute shit.\n\ntry and breath and remember this is only perceived danger, you are going to be ok.\n\nTake the klonopin and close a nostril and breathe through the one not closed\n\n[deleted]\n\nDo not listen to this persons recommendation of Kratom. It is an evil, disgusting drug that acts as an opioid and is just as addictive. If you don‚Äôt believe me, take a look at r/quittingkratom\n\nI hope you‚Äôre feeling better OP\n\nI'm starting to dislike the disdain this sub has for natural medicines. \n\nI never approached Kratom though. \n\nI had anxiety and fear of all and any person(s). I could not walk to the store without feeling so scared and out of it. \n\nI started with a cacao ceremony out of all things lol. In nyc. I re-learned about how important human touch and eye contact is /can be. \n\n3 months later I did aya/huas_ca; it really showed me all of the shame and fear I had in my body. Worst 6 hours of my life. Lol. It was complete anguish and emotional pain.  \n\nBut funnier still, I had moments of intense pride and hopefulness. (I re-learned how to walk) [I had \"forgotten\" due to some leg injuries, physically I was fine but someway somehow my brain kept walking like an injured person. \n\nIt was not an immediate overnight cure of course but it set me up to really investigate why I felt the way I did. \n\nAnyway, I could go on and on but yeah. Good luck, you got this. \n\nSome mush_/rooms can also help but I really advise to be careful with them. But remember to think about it as medicine and with intentions\n\nYou should of planned to just get wasted lol. When my anxiety was the worst I too had a wedding to attend. I indeed took advantage of the open bar lol. \n\nBut yeah dude good luck dealing with this. I'm sure you can deal with this. I'm sure you and your wife would really appreciate it if you managed to get over all the anguish and fear. \n\nMy biggest thing was shame. I began to learn to deal with it and not be so distraught by it.\n\nThe problem is that alcohol brings me heart palpitations. If not I would be wasted already.\n\nDamn that sucks. If I needed to be at a party I could at least count on some alcohol to kill the anxiety. \n\nThe next day was the worst tho. \n\nAlso, ppl did not like what I had to say. So apologies but, really. You have a WIFE you're already doing so much better than me lol. \n\nSeriously, really look into why you're so scarred. Are you ashamed or lost. Look into phy-cha-delics. As medicine, not as a miracle drug. It's not. But it definitely rescrambles your way of thinking and honestly I truly wanted to rewire my brain at my worst. \n\nI could not go to the ice cream shop bc I would sweating bullets and trying to cope with breathing exercises but my insistent fear and anxiety of anyone or anyone was truly, magnificently, powerful as it was frightening. To me and onto others. \n\nI dislike that this sub actively prohibits/inhibits talk of phys-cha--delics. It truly helped me se why I was so stuck on fear and sorrow. \n\nThen it took a couple more sessions for the following year and hard exposure therapy to rewire my brain. \n\nNow I'm pretty chill in crowds.\n\nGive your self space. Go out side get air. Tell one person you are feeling anxious and then ask them a question about themselves maybe they can help distract you. Lose your tie if you are wearing one. Tell you GF or wife. She won't get mad. People would rather you feel better. I know how you feel thought. I had a panic attack at a concert and didn't want them to miss it. I left and they stayed. Long story! Breath. It sucks but it will pass."

    "all_comment_text": "I need direction in therapy. I hate it when my therapist lets me yap about pointless shit. I avoid emotions. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm there. I need someone who is going to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad work is going well. Let‚Äôs talk about your dad‚Äù\n\nYes!! Absolutely this. A couple of \"person centred\" therapists I tried would just get me go on for a whole session, and on my way home I'd realise I'd wasted the whole session. Depressing.\n\nSo much money wasted on therapists like this\n\nReally isn't if it is done right. There is a video on YouTube of Carl Rogers and two others and they have different styles. Same woman. Carl is the person centred (style of no advice)watch it it is fascinating. Gloria is the client.\n\nDoesn‚Äôt change that every experience I‚ÄôVE personally had ended up being a waste. And I‚Äôve tried for years. \n\nI find it‚Äôs great if you just want to process something very specific and need to sort out your overwhelming thoughts on an issue. But to delve into trauma and actively work on more broader areas of your life and gain more perspective and practical insight on your experience unguided PCT isn‚Äôt a great type of therapy.\n\nOh man you completely nailed it here. Couldn‚Äôt agree more. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYes, I think I had a particularly unfortunate experience. The thing is, at another time in my life that might be the *perfect* form of therapy, it just was not appropriate for what I needed at that moment.... plus if my therapists had been as amazing as Carl Rogers I probably would have gotten more out of the experience, I'm familiar with that particular clip :)\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis shit makes me mad, I've had therapists who will be like \"Oh well if you don't want to talk we can just sit in silence\" like??? No ask me questions, bring up a topic, if you break the barrier I'll actually talk\n\nOmg this. My state really enforces the talkative therapy to see a psychiatrist. Usually for the wrong reasons.\n\nI had to deal with such a, idk, passive therapist. The amount of times I dreaded our appointments. I would just sit there in silence until she asked ‚Äú.. do you want to end the session early?‚Äù\n\nSuch a waste of time and money just to get proper medication. I honestly really need to see a psych again but I refuse to be forced into paying and losing time to see a therapist 2-4 times a month. \n\nNot all of us need to talk out our trauma. It happened and it sucked but nobody can change that. I just need help functioning as a normal human in society to pay bills and not be riddled with anxiety when a door slams. Either way talkative therapy should always be a choice. A lot of people are forced into it. It helps to have some direction or interest if your client is like me.\n\nI also agree with this! I spent so much money on a therapist that gave me zero feedback or guidance, she would just listen to me talk and write notes. I really needed at least validation or something. Found a new therapist and in two sessions she helped more than the other one ever did.\n\nI've even tried to directly ask my therapist to help direct the session, multiple times. She will take notes but won't direct to the noted point the next session unless I do. Its driving me insane! \n\nI realize that this is possibly not true, but it sometimes feels like she's just running out the clock :(\n\nSame!!\n\nSame, like please don‚Äôt let me go on about some pointless interaction or a minor annoyance at work all session! I love the sound of my own voice, so please feel free to redirect!\n\nYes, God dammit, yes. Look, I get it, I need to talk about myself and whatnot but I'm lucky I had the courage to be at this appointment in the first place. If I talk too much about my problems, I feel like I move into a \"woe is me\" behavior. \n\nI need you to tell me what to talk about Mr./Ms. Therapist\n\nThere are many styles. Choose a direct approach styled therapist next time.\n\nThey are the ones that should adapt to MY needs when I‚Äôm writing them a check every week. I don‚Äôt have the time, money, or resources available to jump from therapist to therapist to find one to meet my needs. They are the ones that need to remain adaptive.\n\nI‚Äôve had this issue with most of my therapists. I rarely, if ever, feel self-assured or confident in what I say, both in and outside of therapy. I constantly over-explain and ramble, to the point where I don‚Äôt know if what I‚Äôm saying is relevant, sensical, or even true. No matter how understanding and non-judgmental the therapist, I still feel awkward. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt know how to talk without feeling like an ingrate throwing myself a dramatic, jumbled mess of a pity party, and whoever i‚Äôm talking to is hoping I‚Äôll stfu. My current therapist suggested I practice deciding what message I want to get across before I start talking. To me it sounds like practicing how to have a conversation lol.\n\nYES YES YES BC I WILL TALK CIRCLES AROUND ANYTHING\n\nYes, this. I got tired of going to therapy because it was just talking about the inconveniences of my day, no hard hitting breakthroughs or anything like that. Felt like a waste of time.\n\nSaving so I can bring this to my therapist. Shes great! and gives me so much good feedback but Im terrible at guiding a conversation, and tend to veer off topic. Although I do appreciate when she asks about diving into a certain subject beforehand.\n\nCAME HERE TO SAY THE EXACT SAME THING!!! I‚Äôve had several therapists just let me talk and talk and talk and it does nothing for me. I need them to give me focus, draw stuff out of me, ask questions. That‚Äôs the only way I figure stuff out. I see what they‚Äôre trying to do, and it‚Äôs okay to just listen for the first little while, but eventually I need it to be a two-way street\n\nMade a post about this a while back about how much I hated rogerian/person centred therapy. I need direction and what I now know what more of a mentorship/coaching approach would be. But specifically about my mental and emotional health challenges.\n\nThe best therapist I had gave me the option at the beginning of the session to either guide the conversation myself or she can take the wheel. She was person-centred but focused on the main things I wanted to work on.\n\nI guess I‚Äôm the opposite lmao\n\nI wasted years of therapy because of lack of direction. On occasion she‚Äôd point out thinks during my yapping, or I‚Äôd bring up a problem (I happened to have an appointment with her an hour after my mom died), but 95% of our sessions were me yapping about random shit. I was a teenager, I didn‚Äôt want to talk about the hard stuff, so I wasn‚Äôt gonna be the one to bring it up.\n\nOmg yes this!\n\nseconding this!! Pretty much every therapist I‚Äôve been to just let me yap and I felt like we never accomplished anything productive. I don‚Äôt have any issues opening up, and I always felt like they assumed I did and that my endless yapping was progress- it wasn‚Äôt. I went to therapy seeking structure and never really got any.\n\nSame! What do I need to ask for to avoid it though??\n\nCame here to say this! I always have some stressful thing that happened that day or earlier that week and if we spend all that time rambling about stupid work drama, we will never talk about what I am actually here to talk about. I want some challenge to get back on topic. Obviously it‚Äôs easier to avoid the hard stuff I don‚Äôt actually want to deal with, that‚Äôs why I am there.  \n\n\nI also think I‚Äôm a pretty friendly, positive person who has taken masters degree courses in counseling myself.  I ‚Äúget‚Äù it and I‚Äôm an easy client. My last 3 or 4 therapists ended up being too friend-like. Not inappropriate per se, but I needed more challenge and less empathy.\n\nMy now therapist asked me if I would like to lead to conversation or if I would like her to do it, loved that!!  With my other therapist I was feeling my conversations were going nowhere with all my nonsense talking, I felt the pressure of having something to say as well.\n\nmy therapist ambushes me when i do that but like in a way i really need. he lets me bitch and moan about things that don‚Äôt matter and then when i go for too long he says stuff like, in so many words, ‚Äúwhy do you care?‚Äù in his therapist way of saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre valid in feeling this way but dwelling on it is a waste of your time‚Äù\n\nI absolutely hate when therapists take an awkward long pause and don‚Äôt say anything at all when I‚Äôm done talking. It makes my social anxiety so much worse. Just talking and venting to them is nice but I also like feedback or tips on coping mechanisms going forward which a lot of my therapists I‚Äôve been to haven‚Äôt been too vocal about.¬†\n\nholy crap my first therapist was like this. All she would say is ‚Äúthat must have been overwhelming right?‚Äù after everything i said. Then we would just sit there in silence because i felt so uncomfortable.  She never asked me open ended questions. I was starting to think SHE had social anxiety lmao\n\nTherapist 101 is never to ask assuming closed-ended questions like that lol\n\nWhich is *precisely* what makes therapy completely useless and unhelpful.\n\nI hate when they repeat what I just said without adding more. I know they were taught in school that good listening includes repeating what the other person said to show understanding, but come on, stop doing that all the time. It makes me feel like you are just filling words and have nothing to say.\n\nThat‚Äôs good to know. I think sometimes therapists like to leave space in case something else comes up, or you have more to say. But understandable that that would create more social anxiety!\n\nI once read that therapists use the silence bc if they‚Äôre quiet long enough the client will say something. So now whenever my therapist is quiet I feel like she is trying to trick me into revealing something. \nI‚Äôd much rather the therapist prompted or guided the conversation a bit bc this is how I end up rambling about something pointless and then feeling like the session was wasted\n\nmy last therapist did this and i didnt know how to say \"can u respond to me or im just gonna ramble nervously this whole time\"\n\nI thought that was just my therapist! Like I'd just start awkwardly nodding and staring back, and then I start feeling embarrassed for the dead silence, so I feel inclined to speak some more.\n\nWhich causes us to ramble about dumb shit just to break the silence üòÜ\n\nand then we go home, overthink everything that just happened, and be kicking ourselves in our sleep üòî\n\nThis‚Ä¶ like are you going to say anything? Then it gets weird\n\nSilence in counseling is very powerful, and it‚Äôs actually a skill they teach therapists! It can be very powerful if used correctly. Like OP said, oftentimes things come up when we give clients the space to think and process in real-time. Those periods of silence often lead to the client voicing their thoughts more freely as they try to fill in the silence.\n\nI think this works for some people who are maybe reluctant to share or can‚Äôt form their thoughts fully, but I agree, I despise this tactic.\n\nIt feels like a game. I am at the therapists because I‚Äôve thought out all my endless thoughts and I‚Äôm at a point where I need someone to step in and help me sift through them, not wait for me to have more thoughts. We will get stuck in an endless cycle of regurgitation unless you inject pointed questions or observations.\n\nSo I‚Äôd say try to understand what type of client you have and adjust accordingly.\n\nI was SO confused when I went to therapy for the first time and experienced this. I literally told her multiple times \"I want to hear what you think of this? What's your opinion?\"\n\nTherapist: *slow nodding, squinty eyes, not saying anything*\n\nIt happened so many times.... I would speak and ask her to tell me jer thoughts and just.... long awkward silence.\n\nI felt like we wasted about 30 min of the 60 min session in just dead space. Lol \n\nObviously never went back there.\n\nIf it‚Äôs something you despise, I think the therapist should definitely avoid using it. Adapting as a therapist is the most important. Everyone needs something different and people truly want different things from therapy. A good therapist will explore these topics during the initial meetings and open up for feedback about what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not. Silence is not supposed to be a tool to fall back on to fill time. It should be calculated. Personally, I would stop using silence if I notice there‚Äôs a pattern of thoughts cycling. At the same time, the goal is for the client to be able to sift on their own in the future and notice patterns then use tools learned in therapy to resolve those patterns when the therapist is no longer with the client.\n\n\"ill make you s√≥ unconfortable youll Yap out your true fears!\" Is quite the strat lol\n\nAbsolutely! A lot of folks with anxiety use chatter to drown out their internal anxious voice. Sitting with the silence can be excruciating. Not getting reassurance from an external source after speaking can be so tough. Part of coping with anxiety comes with being able to sit in it before moving through it. Silence is a huge part of that.\n\nThey could at least do people the courtesy of explaining that's what they are doing.\n\nugh i absolutely hate this and it's happened to me every single time\n\nWow, I just wanted to comment on this! But I see this is already top comment. Really glad I am not the only one. Last time when I intervened during a particularly long pause and just said anything to fill the silence she said that she noticed that these long pauses make me very uncomfortable‚Ä¶. which made me even more uncomfortable!! (she didnt mean it in a bad way, more like ‚Äûits another symptom of people pleasing‚Äú) I felt so called out :(\n\nI feel like my therapist does this to eat up more time lol\n\nMy therapist asked yesterday if I should switch meds bc I‚Äôm depressed. Yeah I‚Äôm depressed bc my husband committed. Anyone would be depressed for that. Or maybe I should stop talking about him.\n\nSending love to you ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThanks\n\nlet time do its thing ‚ù§Ô∏è meds wont be enough for this pain. Slowly start going out on sunny days.\n\nNo kidding. I don‚Äôt want to mask my issues. Also my grief.\n\nexactly i feel like meds are more for like if youre depressed for no specific reason, even then all it does it turn u into a zombie\n\nI went to a therapist once that all she would do was listen to me and give me handouts about different things. That's a lot of money for a handout, I figured I could just vent to a good trusty friend instead (a lot cheaper).\n\nlol that sounds like a waste of time and money.\n\nIt was.\n\nI have this problem currently! She makes me read lengthy documents instead of just teaching me what I need to know in her own words.\n\nSorry to hear that. You most likely are wasting your money. \n\nPersonally, I would love to go back to therapy but I refuse to pay for crap.\n\nIt‚Äôs so hard to find a good therapist that you click with. It can be discouraging. I‚Äôve been with mine for 7 or 8 months and feel like maybe I should find someone else but it‚Äôs so hard to start from ground zero with someone new.\n\nThat was my issue. I'd talk my face off without much feedback or direction.. And then they would give me work sheets or suggested books to read. Like... Ma'am. I'm already overwhelmed. Don't make me read a book lol.\n\n1: there needs to be a less awkward way to break up with a therapists. If it‚Äôs not working or I don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs being provided give me a non-confrontational way to just nope out. \n\n2: ‚Äúhow was your week‚Äù I will actually never tell\nYou. Part of why I‚Äôm in therapy is because I am really good at compartmentalizing the shit that happens day in and day out to the point where I just shove it all down inside until it erupts. I don‚Äôt want to talk about the hard stuff. I will always say it was good. Even if it was bad. Ask questions like ‚Äútell me 1 good thing, 1 bad thing, and 1 thing you are still struggling with‚Äù or something like that. \n\n3: to piggy back on number 2, I need a therapist to\nLead the discussion. If I do, I will only discuss superficial stuff and not get into the nitty gritty. Force me to confront the hard stuff!\n\nYeahhhh I wish #1 was easier also. Im guilty of not being straightforward with it- saying ‚ÄòI need a break‚Äô and then not coming back..\n\nI took a break 4 years ago from a therapist lol I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs caught on now\n\nU can just stop going no lol? I asked because im also thinking of seeking another therapist\n\nI really agree with your #1. I have so much anxiety about leaving therapy, I'm often reluctant to start at all.¬†\n\nYes! I want a trial phase. Where I can easily nope. Part of why I struggle to start is because I don‚Äôt want to have to try and break up with multiple people before I find one that works (not always the case but could happen)\n\nHate the breathing exercises, hate being told ‚Äúidk how to help you ü§™‚Äù or that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdoing really great‚Äù when I was literally suicidal every day, hate how a lot of the feedback is just ‚ÄúI can understand why you feel that way.‚Äù Like ok? Does nothing for me honestly just annoys me. Basically the fact that it doesn‚Äôt work if you already know why you do what you do but just can‚Äôt stop. They‚Äôre like ‚Äúthis is actually why you do that!‚Äù Yes. I‚Äôm aware. I‚Äôve known that since I was 5 actually\n\nThis!!! I keep bringing up that I want to not feel like I wanna die every day and she just wants to talk about my day or week. And I've gone through 8 different therapists and I'm really starting to give up bc if I want someone new it's always awkward to tell them it's not for me and then go on another 6 month wait list for someone else.\n\nI feel you girl. I gave up about 2 years ago. I‚Äòve found much more help in self-help books than anything a therapist has ever done.\n\nThis is in no way judgemental, I'm asking this as a therapist who had a client who expressed similar opinions about therapy in general but could never answer my questions. If you know what you feel, why you do the things you do, where your patterns etc come from, what exactly is it that you want from a therapist? What are you hoping the therapist can/will do?\n\nI‚Äôm looking for actual advice. I don‚Äôt want to be validated, I don‚Äôt think that my feelings are invalid at all, I just don‚Äôt know how to solve my own issues. For example, when I was younger, I kept dating abusive men. My therapist focused on how this all tied back into my dad being abusive. I already understood why I was drawn to them, but I wanted concrete advice on how to change my behavior.\n\nI've literally dropped therapists because they didn't give me solid plans of action or at least help me figure one out for myself. I'm very upfront when I get a new therapist that I'm looking to do the work to make actual change, and that includes a game plan. It's taken years and many therapists but I feel like I am actually progressing finally this last year. But that doesn't help when I feel so depressed i don't wanna exist (not suicidal, I never consider that as an option. But also just don't wanna be here sometimes LOL üòÅ)\n\nOne expects that a therapist would propose or even perform therapy. In every other field, therapy is a thing that experts propose or execute to fix or alleviate a problem they know a lot about. Only in certain forms of psychotherapy is the patient supposed to figure out the problem and then the solution. I suggest we start calling those modalities psycholistening instead of therapy.\n\nNow to answer your question: PROPOSE A SOLUTION!!! \n\nA person can know what their problem is, where their patterns come from, but doesn't know how to help themselves. That's why they came to you. For help. You're supposed to know of thousands of similar cases and how they were helped. A patient knows only their own case and doesn't know how to help themselves. \n\nIt's obvious I'm still salty about therapists that only ask questions and think I will somehow come up with a way to heal myself. I need knowledge in order to do that. Just listening to me, while validating, doesn't give me practical knowledge of how to deal with my problems. Therapist is supposed to have scientifically proven data on what works and what doesn't. Let's try those. Letting me drivel just wastes everyone's time and a lot of patient's money. And prolongs the suffering.\n\n\nUgh. My two cents.\n\nI've never been to a therapist that didn't feel like I was talking to a brain dead tech support line that is following a script.  Every time it feels like they aren't actually listening to me but listening for keywords that they have prepared responses to.  Moreover I've heard all those responses and suggestions before.  Like come on, I've done my research, I've read so many things about anxiety and its mechanisms. I know what's happening to me and have tried anything you can think of to make it stop. Give me something new or useful!\n\nOmg yes literally this\n\nI actually happen to like therapy but only because I am forced to socialize with someone that shows interest in me. It doesn‚Äôt really do shit for my anxiety. I‚Äôve found that I help my anxiety more. With exercise, outdoor time, healthy habits, social media detox, and forced exposure to my triggers.\n\nI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôve found ways to help yourself outside of therapy! A good therapist would probably help you gradually expose yourself to triggers but if you can do it yourself that‚Äôs amazing\n\nThank you!! üòä\n\nThe fact they think that you did a few breathing exercises and now they think you‚Äôre cured\n\nSeems like breathing techniques are overused in a lot of these instances:/\n\nBreathing exercises probably do have value in a lot of cases, but tbh can feel condescending especially when I‚Äôm asked to breathe right after I‚Äôve  told a really painful story.\n\nIn a therapy session recently my therapist suggested a breathing exercise. I balked and refused. She didn‚Äôt push the breathing exercise any further but she asked some really good questions which led me to the realization that I hate anyone having any influence over my bodily autonomy due to previous trauma. It was a real lightbulb moment and imo the most skillfully applied use of a breathing exercise I‚Äôve ever encountered.\n\nI can do breathing exercises on my own time.\n\nThat‚Äôs a good question. \n\nShort answer: I wish therapists did more to establish expectations for therapy over time and provided more tools for life outside therapy.\n\nLonger answer: I‚Äôve been lucky that I‚Äôve gelled okay with most of my therapists, but I never stuck with it for long because I always felt that I never got that much out of it beyond a stint on Zoloft back in college. They pretty much just listened, and I don‚Äôt recall ever having a sense that they had a plan for the long term beyond going session by session. They were nice people but I did not learn coping skills for my emotional issues. I have benefited way more from reading self-help books recently, but with that said, I am at a point in my life where I know I‚Äôd really benefit from someone‚Äôs help. Going forward, I am looking for someone who can provide more of a guiding hand where appropriate. With that said, I also need to be more cognizant of when therapy isn‚Äôt working, and meet my therapist halfway on adjusting our approach. I think that‚Äôs my big regret about my prior therapy; that I did not speak up when my therapist‚Äôs approach wasn‚Äôt clicking.\n\nWhat self-help books helped you? So far the most helpful for me has been the happiness trap\n\nActually, I am currently reading The Happiness Trap. A lot of what Harris writes clicks with me, though I‚Äôve yet to internalize the exercises. I am also chipping away at Feeling Great by David Burns. It is very useful too.\n\nFunny enough, both approaches are supposed to be contradictory ‚Äî or at least in tension with each other. I do enjoy both but have vague plans to synergize them because neither is an absolute perfect fit for me. In any case, the goal isn‚Äôt innate mastery right now, but figuring out which approach ‚Äî and types of therapists‚Äî fit my life more in the long run.\n\nThanks for the response. Yeah I‚Äôm also trying to reconcile the approaches of ‚Äúaccept the thought and move on‚Äù vs ‚Äúchallenge the thought.‚Äù I tend to be an over thinker, so The Happiness Trap kind of felt like a breath of fresh air to realize I don‚Äôt actually have to do anything (or at least,  to much) about all of the anxious thoughts my mind constantly generates\n\nI‚Äôm now in the very privileged position of (just about) being able to afford private therapy. But back when I was on NHS therapy (I‚Äôm in the UK), I was paired up with a counsellor that would have taken me about an hour to travel to in person.\n\nSo we did our sessions by Zoom instead, and she would complain every time that the therapy was compromised by not being in the same room together. It‚Äôs like, I actually agree with that, but I can‚Äôt take a three hour round trip in the middle of a workday every week, so I‚Äôm not really sure what else you want me to do.\n\nShe‚Äôd also encourage me every week to come off my antidepressants, as they ‚Äúinhibit the full spectrum of emotions‚Äù. Again, I‚Äôd love to be in a position to not have to take them, but unfortunately those drugs are what stop me from killing myself so I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm gonna have to take a pass on that!\n\nThat seems‚Ä¶sketch. My therapist was like ‚Äúhey I know you feel great right now and when people get here they usually want to get off their meds because they think they dont need them and then they crash land really hard because turns out they need meds and they‚Äôre part of what‚Äôs making them feel great‚Ä¶so just keep that in mind!‚Äù\n\nNot remembering things that I have said so many times which causes us to have to discuss them again and again and waste time. \n(I know they have many patients and it‚Äôd be so hard to remember everything, but I am talking like big details lol)\n\nI mean I went a the counsellor in my college because I was depressed about  my relationship breaking up and she told me to \"grow up\". \n\nIf she'd have been sympathetic I'd have come out to her about being trans and struggling but yeah nope. +7 years to being in the closet. \n\nI'd hope you would not do this obviously but maybe realise some people in the system have had absolutely shit  experiences with the system in the past.\n\nI've never liked therapy. It's never really helped me. I have bipolar and GAD. I once told a therapist I was going to break up with my girlfriend of 6 years (at that time) and move out, right after my mom died. He basically wished me luck.\n\nHe asked no questions, he didn't suspect I might be manic, nothing. Just \"tell me how it goes\".\n\nüò©\n\nWow. Seems borderline unethical of him to me.  \n\nMy last therapist seemed to have zero interest in me as a person. It seemed blatantly clear that she couldn't care less if we ever had another conversation or not..I know she's leaving it up to me as the client, but I have other examples of this behavior from her that is one of those you would've had to be there kinda things.\n\nIt not working mainly.¬†\n\nSrs.\n\nHaving to own up to my mistakes. I hate that in therapy I can‚Äôt blame other people for my bs /s\n\nWhen i was 18-20 years old, I had a therapist who is SFBT (solution focused) trained. I hated it whenever she started off almost every session by asking ‚Äòhow has things IMPROVE/WORKED for you‚Äù? \nLike bruh, it has not improve, if not why am I sitting infront of you. \nAnd whenever i shares a difficult problem, she always ask ‚Äúwow I wonder how did you manage that? It seems like you are coping with it‚Äù\n???! Like hi? Im sharing something negative with you now in hopes that you would empathise and process through with me, and not trying to garner hope or false positivity. \n\nAnyway I am now 25 and went back to therapy and have a trauma informed therapist! Shes the best by far! Root-Problem focused and very relational. I think to any clients, I genuinely believe therapeutic relationships is what heals, beyond the therapy methods tbh. Although it can be as crucial!\n\nI totally agree- therapeutic relationship is number one, no matter what interventions or modalities are used. I could see SFBT being really frustrating if you felt things weren‚Äôt getting better or you had no  hope.\n\nThe price and the face expressions some make while listening like i can know what you are thinking just by the expression you are making ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n\nI hate the ‚Äúwhere do you feel that in your body?‚Äù \nI understand that it‚Äôs used to identify your feelings, but then what do I do with that information??? Nothing other than an ‚Äúooooooh, good, yea, you identified that‚Äù\n\nAnd I usually never feel anything (I know I‚Äôm supposed to and maybe that‚Äôs the problem that I can‚Äôt identify it) but it just makes me want to make up stuff. ‚ÄúOH I think I felt something in my heart.‚Äù\n\nI hate when I tell them something from my past that was traumatic and they say \"well have you tried grounding techniques?\". Grounding techniques have never helped me get to the root of my childhood trauma. Also when they ask me \"how would you like to overcome that?\" I pay the therapist to help with that. If I knew how to overcome it, I wouldn't be in therapy.\n\nSo far I have only had two different therapists but the one i had from 15 to 22 yrs old (on and off at some time) was great and helped me through a lot of hard stuff including getting my panic disorder in control, but i stopped going because she started making me do weird exercises, like physical stuff and equilibrium without explaining why and what for. thats the only thing i hated lol dont know if this helps\n\nLike yoga? lol\n\nIm realy curious about physical stuff. \nplease can you explain it more ?\n\nthat sometimes I just find it kind of boring to talk about myself that much\n\nBreathing exercises and homework\n\nWhen I specifically bring something up that‚Äôs bothering me and I want feedback on it, but get nothing back. Like thanks for nothing. I still have the same problem and don‚Äôt know what to do plus more anxiety bc I can‚Äôt solve my problem.\n\nI was looking for someone to say homework. I hate when they give me something to do and then I absolutely don't do it and I have pure anxiety going to the next session knowing I'll probably lie about doing it!\n\nTrying to understand why I feel a certain way and where it comes from. \n\nLike I know why and how but this does not help me at all. I want to solve it and heal but somehow once you answered these two questions there's nothing left to do.\n\nyep. then if i ask for advice for how to deal with certain situations, or any way to cope with them, they just say, \"that will come in time ü§ì\". so, i'm essentially talking to a wall and learning nothing? good to know where i'm wasting my money.\n\nIt‚Äôs too bad that a lot of therapists are lazy. They don‚Äôt have a treatment plan including what to do with the answers to those questions! Core beliefs about the world and yourself can actually be adjusted to be more helpful, if you have a good therapist who puts in the effort with you.\n\nThis is exactly the problem I‚Äôve run into in the past as well. There‚Äôs often no solutions provided. \n\nAnd in the case of CBT, I often needed help from the therapist taking my situations and applying them to the criteria/thought records. They would often just make me do it myself without assistance, and therefore I‚Äôd identify ineffective ‚Äúalternate‚Äù thoughts or just write down what I‚Äôd think she‚Äôd want to see. Even if the ‚Äúalternate‚Äù thought was fairly believable I still wouldn‚Äôt believe it, and I was offered no other solutions after this.\n\nI fucking hate when they say ‚Äú stop thinking about it‚Äù \n‚ÄúStop living in the past‚Äù\n\nHaving PTSD and OCD it sounds very redundant and it gives  ‚Äúwtf you should know this already‚Äù\n\nI hate this, too. It‚Äôs like do they know anything about those mental illnesses at all?!\n\nNot a clue and it‚Äôs a big clue for me when seeing a new one.\n\nMostly how there was no solution, but it cost me 70 bucks each time.\n\nThey need to challenge my thinking instead of just letting me vent about shit.\n\nOne of my less positive experiences was a therapist who basically only had one tool in his toolkit. He would always try to get me to imagine my inner child and dialogue with him. I told him several times that this particular exercise didn‚Äôt really work for me. I don‚Äôt see some inner child when I close my eyes, and dialoguing with him felt forced and faked. I communicated this and he still kept trying to force that tool. I wish he would have been direct and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I have the toolset to help you, I specialize in this one kind of therapy. But I know a lot of other therapists and they might be a better fit based on what you‚Äôre sharing with me and my professional observations. I‚Äôd love to get you connected with someone whose skills might resonate more with you.‚Äù I‚Äôm a little more aware now of what I‚Äôm seeking and so I think I would do a better job advocating for myself, but my view is that therapists are there to help, and that might mean passing on collecting a fee from someone every week in order to connect them with a better resource. I guess that‚Äôs a double edged sword because there are lots of people who describe really negative experiences with therapists telling them they might not be a good fit.\n\nI absolutely hate breathing exercises makes me angry and I also hate timid therapist. I need someone to somewhat match my energy and sarcasm or I don‚Äôt feel safe or know that they know when I‚Äôm just talking bs because that‚Äôs my way of coping. I need to be challenged as well I want deeper questions not ‚Äúhow did it feel when xyz happened‚Äù it almost feels so generic like I‚Äôm not even being listened to.\n\nWith my first therapist I never really felt like we were actually getting work done on my larger issues, I felt like I was basically just there to talk about my day. I had a suicide attempt in college and was forced to go to therapy by my university as part of my recovery. I genuinely wanted to get better but it felt like a collosal waste of my time. I understand that therapy is all about actually doing work yourself, but the point of a therapist is to help guide you through that work. That therapist was the prototypical stereotype, she'd just ask me about my week, let me talk, and ask things like \"how did that make you feel\" or \"did that make you depressed?\"\n\nI stopped seeing her after I was no longer required to and years later ended up finding a therapist myself. It was like a breath of fresh air. I still had to lead the conversation but he actually would contribute when I was done talking which was really really helpful. He asked a lot of questions that were very specific and pointed and it made me feel like he was actually paying attention to the things I was talking about. He got the point where he was able to call out my thought patterns that I didn't even know I had. He introduced me to tons of coping techniques and gave me direct and actionable advice when I'd ask for it. \n\nSo yeah, I'd say the thing I've hated most is when a therapist doesn't make me feel truly listened to. I don't want to come to therapy to just vent and talk about my feelings, I want to learn how to undo unhealthy ways of thinking and build coping mechanisms for my mental illnesses. Obviously talking about your feelings is a big part of that, but it's not the only thing.\n\nI just hate therapy. I don‚Äôt think it works. Also, I hate therapists who don‚Äôt work with insurance. Paying out of pocket and submitting claims just makes me more depressed.\n\nIf your client says something doesn't work, and they've really tried it, drop it and move on. I was in therapy off and on for like 7 years. 4 different therapists. All educated, empathetic, experienced, etc. None of them believed me if I said a particular skill didn't work. Grounding exercises don't work for me. I've tried all the ones in the stupid DBT workbook in sessions, outside of sessions, on youtube, whatever - never did what they were supposed to do. I mean repeatedly. Same with breathing exercises. Past a point just starting those exercises gave me anxiety but I was always pushed to do them. Same with the opposite action thing. I was asked two years ago to make a playlist of happy music (I'm paraphrasing but if you really want details i'll add them) to play when I was feeling depressed. I did that. Guess what makes me feel depressed now? 80s/90s pop. Literally all my happy music reminds me of some of the worst times in the last two years. Same with warm showers! They were supposed to feel like warm hugs now they they feel kind of unsafe somehow. The skills (for me) didn't feel like skills at all, they felt like tricks to get my brain to suck less. Also I hate journaling the way my therapist wanted me to (gratitude list, mood tracker, etc). I did at first but then it became a burden and reminder of bad days. I burned them all a few months ago. It was the best decision ever, can't remember anything that I wrote in them now. I would open up a journal and see the corner of a page that I wrote on during a breakdown and go right back to that moment. Oh and exercise! Yes, it does help me! Absolutely!...When I can do it. When I'm not sick, when it's not too hot/cold/rainy, when I have time to walk outside during the day (I live in a bad neighborhood and have no gym money). Yoga is great but doesn't cut it for anxiety/depression, has to be cardio. It's a privilege for some to have regular access to a space to exercise like that.\n\nI guess my point is that some of those things might work for some people some of the time but none of them worked for me. And that would have been fine if any of my therapists had listened and dropped it but they wouldn't and made me feel like I wasn't trying unless I did them. I don't know what's wrong with me or my brain or why none of it helped but when I brought this up it was met with \"you aren't practicing when you feel good, you are only doing it when you feel bad\" (I have felt consistently bad for years at that point) or \"you were using the wrong skill at the wrong time\" or whatever. It really felt like at the end of the day they didn't have anything to offer but a referral for meds and these stupid skills.\n\nAlso yes, I tried several medications and those didn't help either. It's been over a year since I stopped prescription medication and therapy and I'm doing much better now.\n\nSorry if this is too harsh lol I just really really hated therapy.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add, I was in an PHP/IOP program and the group therapy was VERY helpful. Due to my particular trauma/issues I was in a women's only group and it felt very safe. Talking to others made me feel validated, less alone, and I got to practice giving compassion to others. It was very scary to be vulnerable like that but the facilitator was soooo great. I actually miss it lol Previous to that, I had a really hard time opening up to people and accepting comfort, and group really helped in that regard. I haven't found a group like that outside of the program unfortunately.\n\nI loved group therapy when was in an IOP program. It was so nice to be around a group of folks and be so honest about mental health. I really wish I can find one to go to now. It sounds like you've been working really hard to get help. I feel like that should be celebrated.\n\nThank you!! ü©µ\n\nI've been in and out of therapy for over 20 years (more in than out, and consistently in for about 5 now). I'm excruciatingly self-aware and know all most beginner and intermediate skills. When I've had to switch therapists due to moving, etc, I straight up have a list of things I tell them do not work for me. If they immediately try something off that list, I find a new one.\n\nMy current therapist is extremely judicious about her use of things like printouts (among other tools/skills) because I told her I hate those. It's only when she targets a concept that I clearly have not come across yet and will probably at least be helpful to put eyes on. I've had her for over 2 years and she's great and totally gets how I need to work through things.\n\nWhen they say, ‚Äúoh that must have been so hard for you‚Äù like‚Ä¶ yeah. I‚Äôm telling you about some of the worst times in my life and that‚Äôs all you got to say?\n\nI had one therapist literally say, \"Oh my god you've been through so much,\" and looked shaken/shocked. I knew right then that she was not the therapist for me.\n\nSuper generic advice. I struggle with a whole lot of grief after some bad events and deaths and a very heavy workload that‚Äôs likely driven (in part) by a want to avoid the grief. My therapist: ‚ÄúYou should consider taking a walk.‚Äù (I do each day) ‚ÄúYou should consider learning a new hobby.‚Äù (When? After I‚Äôve done all the other gazillion things to do?) ‚ÄúYou should consider a trip to the movies or a museum‚Äù and so on. It‚Äôs like my now-former therapist was reading from an article in Cosmo titled ‚Äú101 ways to beat the summer sads‚Äù. None of it actually addresses this grief. So I gave up.\n\nI don't just want to vent, I can do that with my friends if needed. I want an action plan. I want things I can do to progress out of the problems I experience. For instance, I have social anxiety and my social skills are not the best. Where can I go or what can I do to meet people without just cold approaching people in public that don't want to be approached. I feel like we need to round up a group of people that suffer from this same issue and put them together in a group. \n\nI don't like the join a club, go to events, and meetup sort of advice because what is available in my area is pretty lackluster and people aren't going to the county fair to chat up a stranger.\n\nWhen I talk to a therapist I usually get the impression I'm just paying another human to care about my problems and to talk to me and that makes me feel worse tbh.\n\nI‚Äôve had CBT for my GAD and low mood about 5 times in the past 10 years, sometimes it works for a bit but it‚Äôs always been fleeting. Currently trying ACT but I don‚Äôt have a very good rapport with my current therapist unfortunately\n\nThis goes for medical professionals in general, but I hate mentioning that I have an issue that is clearly impeding my ability to function in everyday life. just to be told that I can't possibly be struggling cause I got a master's degree and I'm married.\n\nI don't know the style of therapy, but I had a therapist once who never really focused on the \"why\". Instead, she really focused on my negative thought patterns. In sessions she helped me to find evidence to breakdown those patterns. I'm not sure if I'm describing it correctly. For example, I would say \"I hate myself, and I'm a loser\". Then she would make a list of accomplishments to show that I'm not a loser. But it never really fully embraced it. I worked with her for a year and a half, and nothing really stuck. \n\n  \nConversely, my therapist now focuses a lot of my interpersonal relationships, upbringing, and family. She helped me realize my mother had traits narcissist and there was a lot of emotional manipulation and criticism growing up. It's wired my brain to behave and act in particular ways and also contributed to my anxiety. Then she pointed me to a bunch of resources and articles. This has made a huge difference, and I'm finally feel like I'm doing some real healing.\n\nHow did you find your current therapist?\n\nI got crazy lucky basically. I found her on BetterHelp. My only criteria was looking for a poc therapist so I would feel comfortable talking about race and identity struggles. I matched with her right away. She‚Äôs moved away from that platform now but I‚Äôm still with her after almost 3 years.\n\nI‚Äôve heard horror stories online about the BetterHelp platform, but I was really lucky.\n\nBeing told what I already know. Especially as someone who is extremely self aware. Like I know my problems and I know how to fix it but I still can‚Äôt. Then they hit me with the usual breathing and journaling exercises because they don‚Äôt know what else to do with me\n\nI..... Have no idea what I'm doing. I need a therapist to direct me. Like. Give me FCKING directions. Give me homework. Ask me invasive questions man. Do not go to soft or we will get no where and I'll email you memes.\n\nJust listening without giving input. Its nice to be heard and vent, but some insightful advice is better\n\ntbh i‚Äôve been hesitant to go again bc i had a good therapist and then it started being kinda repetitive like ‚Äúyeah keep trying that!‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think like that‚Äù and ‚Äútry not doing that‚Äù üò≠üò≠ like bro what do u think i do?? then she stopped working at the place i would see her at and now im like fuck i have to give my entire origin story to some random person AGAIN to potentially get the same 3 responses every time\n\nWhen they deflect something that should be a red flag about mental health! I had a psychologist (I think, I was unsure of her actual title, but she was separate from my therapist she assigned me later) and I expressed to her that I loved theatre because it gave me the opportunity to not be myself, and that I enjoyed not having the expectations to be /me/ but to be a character. And her first reaction was ‚ÄúOn that‚Äôs not a very good reason to like something, what‚Äôs another reason?‚Äù and it absolutely floored me. Then she never had me talk about it again and told me not to talk to my therapist about it.\n\nTherapists not explaining the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind what they are suggesting.  I still don‚Äôt know why talking about my childhood it‚Äôs important and in general it just makes me feel like I‚Äôm wasting time.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat‚Äôs so frustrating. I don‚Äôt know why some people choose this career!!\n\nOof, it‚Äôs a small thing for me but when my therapist would run late to my session. It would make me anxious and worry me if they forgot. But also I had a specific time for my session because it worked in my schedule so sometimes I‚Äôd only get a partial session and it really would impact my mood for the rest of the day. My therapist was great overall but that part was hard for me and made me question my sessions.\n\nI hate when my therapist doubles down on something when I know they're wrong and I've told them such. I get that they think there's something there, but I'm telling them they're wrong. I hate it because it feels like gaslighting.\n\nIn my case, I dislike when the psychologist holds back information, quite literally, about the psychology of why I am feeling or reacting the way I do. Is it a faux pas to discuss this with a patient, and that‚Äôs why she holds back?\n\nI‚Äôve had good and bad therapists. The worst would spend way too much time talking and giving recommendations, trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äù stuff. I didn‚Äôt realize how much it weighed me down until my husband pointed out how I‚Äôd always cry or seem worse after sessions. I think she just didn‚Äôt click with me or understand what I needed.\n\nHowever something I realized has been detrimental overall is overdoing CBT and talk therapy. CBT and talk therapy are amazing and have helped me in so many ways, but the over focus on my thoughts has put me in the habit of intellectualizing all my feelings, which has kept me from emotionally regulating effectively. I hit a wall in therapy when I realized this and so I changed to an EMDR therapist and am now doing DBT as well. It‚Äôs been very helpful in new ways. I wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs an issue with my therapists and more with my own approach but it might be something to keep in mind.\n\nOne of my therapist shoved meditation down my throat despite me saying it doesn‚Äôt work for me and drives me up the wall. I out right told my new one do not ask me to try it I won‚Äôt do it, he luckily was like ‚Äúnoted, we won‚Äôt do that.‚Äù And the other thing is cost. Money and costs give me major anxiety but I need the therapy for everything so it‚Äôs just asking to everything else.\n\nThis was years ago, and frankly, with a horrible therapist. At the time I was dealing with so many issues my wife and I literally wanted to run away. Move to a different state, something, just to get away from the problems I was faced with at that time.\n\nAnyways, this therapist just tells me to move. Suggests that we go the next day and figuring it as we go. Don‚Äôt plan, just have a destination in mind, and go there/figure it out when you get there.  I didn‚Äôt go back to that therapist.  There are several reasons why this wasn‚Äôt really an option for my wife and I at the time, and still wouldn‚Äôt be today, but this guy wanted to talk his own past issues and how he ‚Äúmanned up‚Äù rather than dissect mine. \n\nI have seen one other therapist since, and she was very understanding and great at actually providing help, so I can confidently say they‚Äôre not all bad.\n\nI hated journaling. I didn‚Äôt need that kind of homework. I need skills for when it‚Äôs 3am and I can‚Äôt sleep because of a million terrible scenarios running through my head.\n\nI have had a couple of therapist start talking about themselves during sessions and basically get derailed on their problems and how they dealt with it. I mean, I get where they‚Äôre coming from but at the same time, I‚Äôm a different person and handle things differently. I usually drop out of therapy at that point. \n\nGive me advice and direct me, but don‚Äôt start talking about all the problems you‚Äôve had in the past and take up all the time talking about yourself.\n\nThe fact that my therapists keep changing, and I always have to explain everything over again to fill the new one in. And when it comes to shit that‚Äôs genuinely traumatic, it doesn‚Äôt really feel great.\n\nEvery therapist/doctor reccomends breathing exercises for anxiety. It the first thing out of their mouths every time. I've heard it so much. It doesn't help me and never has. Also I had one therapist who would ask specific questions about me/ my childhood and then in the next session ask the SAME questions like she wasn't listening or taking notes. Infuriating.\n\nSometimes there is an awkward silence between topics ‚Ä¶ otherwise I look forward to it. So I just over prepare every session so I don‚Äôt have those empty moments. Sometimes it becomes an obsession to avoid being uncomfortable during sessions. ‚Ä¶ hmm, I wonder what she would think about this.\n\nThis would be something to bring up! Needing to make sure every moment is filled is definitely something to work on. Social anxiety is so hard :/\n\nI hate how I‚Äôve felt my absolute worst for the last 7 months since starting therapy.\n\nNot giving any feedback ...I talk and talk and they sit there. Also, I had a therapist that wouldn't push me to speak about uncomfortable things. We would start and I would change the subject and she let me. Nothing was ever worked out and I saw her for over 3 months.\n\nI need constructive therapy. I don't just mean the \"you have bad thoughts. Challenge those\" CBT model. I like when therapists use multiple models of therapy, tbh. One therapist I loved used a psychodynamic and CBT approach. I like to understand the roots behind certain behaviors because it helps me gain clarity and a better understanding of how to handle meltdowns and triggers. \n\nAlso seconded on the long silences. I HATE THEM.\n\nOh god having them repeat your sentences back to you over and over üò´. I get that it‚Äôs a way to make sure they‚Äôre understanding correctly, and maybe it‚Äôs to make you think about what you‚Äôve said, but it comes across as so weirdly disingenuous and makes the interaction feel fake. Also being too prescriptive is annoying. I‚Äôve encountered therapists who very obviously aren‚Äôt really paying attention as well, because they forgot all sorts of stuff that I‚Äôd told them about (big things, not little details). That‚Äôs super off-putting.\n\nI don‚Äôt like continuing to talk about why I am the way I am. Talking about the past all the time. I let them know I‚Äôve already figured that out, now I need to move forward and change and be a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù person. I just haven‚Äôt received that yet from therapists but I think I need to be more direct about it from the start.\n\nThat‚Äôs a great thing to tell a therapist. I typically look for root causes and core beliefs that often stem from childhood, but if a client tells me they don‚Äôt want to go into the past, we don‚Äôt. The session should be up to you!\n\nDid talk therapy for YEARS. Did not work. The only thing that helped was EMDR. It was like night and day.\n\nthat the only feedback they ever give me is a variation of \"that must have been so difficult for you\"\n\nI had gone through a few different therapists before I found my last one. She was more spiritual than others I‚Äôd had experience with. She taught me breathing techniques and mediation that was life changing for me. I don‚Äôt go anymore, but the tools she sent me on my way with have me handling life much more easily. I have been able to quiet my mind and don‚Äôt go through life in a mildly depressed daze anymore\n\nI don‚Äôt like when a therapist tries to guess things before I say them out loud. Our couples‚Äô therapist is like this and it makes me feel like she‚Äôd rather show how good she is (which is generally true) instead of letting me answer first.\n\nI‚Äôve been to a few therapists and I really hated the kind of therapist who‚Äôs tactic was to let you talk. I don‚Äôt know if it works for other people but it doesn‚Äôt for me, it just makes me uncomfortable. I like when they ask me questions and give me smart observations, makes me feel like they're listening and they care\n\nmost therapists i have had have not helped give great advice, it is nice for someone to listen but the response of ‚Äúyeah i get it, your feelings are valid. i understand how you are feeling‚Äù like no you don‚Äôt and it is not helpful or just have given the same piece of useless advice over and some of them would just send me for an evaluation at the hospital when half of them i didn‚Äôt need, probably had over a dozen, like i just wanna talk about my problems not get locked in a psych ward for weeks where they make it worse, literally feels like being in jail. \n\nalso sitting in one spot for an hour for some reason gets me very anxious, i usually can‚Äôt sit in one spot for longer than 20-30 min i have to be moving around. ive tried virtual but it never helped, you cant connect with them through a screen. i had one therapist (which i won‚Äôt be going back to because she would drink before our sessions, still dk how she is a therapist) but instead of sitting in her office and talking, she would offer for us to go on walks for our session around town, i absolutely loved it. i wish more therapists would offer that, i probably would go back if more would.\n\nas much as i‚Äôve wanted to go and have someone to talk to about my problems and get advice from, it felt like i was never able to connect with any therapist and it never helped, haven‚Äôt gone back in a year and a half.\n\nI once had a therapist who only ever laughed at what I told her. Not in a mean way, but in a way that she thought what I said was funny. I haven't gone back to therapy because of this. She never provided me any actionable tips or advice.\n\nThe obvious answer feels like the cost. $100+/hr is insane. Especially in the modern era where you can work from home and not have to pay for an office. My life could easily change for the better with therapy but I can NOT afford it, even with sliding scales.\n\nBrought God and religion into it. Lost interest after that.\n\nThe ones that just nod when you‚Äôre talking and aren‚Äôt there to really help (at least for me). I need someone who can help me understand how things work. That‚Äôs how my brain works. I need to understand things in a logical way so I can understand the problem I‚Äôm having. Then, I need help unlearning the things that led to the problem and perpetrated the problem. I also need someone who can redirect me to topics I avoid and help me process what emotions I‚Äôm actually feeling because I have no idea most of the time!\n\nTalking about myself for x amount of time and making eye contact\n\nI tend to not like body and breathing exercises but am of the opinion that they're necessary.  Anxiety becomes a reciprocal relationship between mind and body and once the disorder sets in it can be activated by body tension just as much as worrying, so it's imperative to learn how to relax your body.\n\nMy head is loud and messy. Please lead the session so I don't feel like wasting time by just yapping around.\n\nI agree had one therapist who almost said nothing. I don‚Äôt want to drive i just want to be the passenger\n\nI had one therapist who would *just* listen. She would never talk back. If I wanted that I could've talked to a wall for free.\n\nI switched to a much better therapist after that. I was in middle school so I'm not sure how the process went, but I was able to talk to the new one after a little over a week after talking to the wall made of flesh.\n\nI saw a counselor once who acted like he didn‚Äôt understand why I was there.  The only ‚Äúhelp‚Äù he gave me was ‚Äútake deep breaths‚Äù. Yes, that detailed. Oh and he thought his son running marathons was the same life as being a professional athlete.  I did not go back.\n\nI loved my last therapist. I didn't hate anything about her except that she stopped taking my insurance lol \n\nI did not like when a previous therapist didn't act genuine. I remember she told me it hurt her to see me cry. It was only our second time meeting and i knew she didn't mean it\n\nI hate they keep insisting on trying meds when the problems at hand are deeper than needing pills to feel better. Cognitive behavioral therapy starts from within with willing choice. If you genuinely have a trigger or such with an event that involves a person or such that needs confrontation over it.\n\nThe fact there's another person in my general vicinity.\n\nI‚Äôm new to therapy and I haven‚Äôt hated anything about it, my therapist help me realize the importance of lowering my base line, when I was always hyper focused on the panic attack in the moment, and fixing it right then and there. \nI like that a therapist can point out blind spots, I like they are fully devoted to your issues. I might have gotten lucky and got a great therapist on my first go though.\n\nexamining myself too much\n\nAny therapist/counselor assuming my symptoms are caused by my gender. It doesn't matter if the therapist/counselor is a woman or man, just cause I'm a woman my symptoms get overlooked quite a bit. As well as my age, I'm 19 but carry myself alot older. People usually guess around 25.\n\nThe relatively short time frame of a session makes it hard to feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äúgetting somewhere‚Äù, especially when the therapist just lets you vent on and on. While the timeframe is understandable as a matter of practicability, I need active help with managing the time or it‚Äôs just going to be me venting to an expensive friend and then leaving feeling worse. So lack of direction/help with time management, I suppose.\n\nHad a therapist who just repeated the same general shit to me every damn visit. Requested a new one after two months\n\nI hate the suggestion that I should do yoga or go to the gym when I am already suffering from social anxiety and have depression. I feel exhausted by the act of living itself. Mindfulness is also very abstract for me. I only appreciated it when my therapist practiced it with me.\n\nToo much journaling as an answer to everything and homework to   avoid giving solid advice. That made sense in the beginning but after two years of therapy every week I feel like I'm not getting much more from our one-sided conversations.\n\nProbably something that has been said already but the long awkward pause when you don't even know what to say anymore... like do i bother my therapist ? should I add something ? this makes me even more anxious ! Also as much as it's cool to vent, sometimes I would love to have any tips to deal with some situations or at least a neutral vision from my therapist. My first one was cool and we digged some stuff from my past together but that's it.. I switched to CBT recently, but it's too early for any feedback yet :)\n\nI had to stop seeing my previous counsellor because I disclosed that I'd been feeling suicidal, and he totally glossed over that. He didn't even acknowledge it to the point that I started to doubt I'd even said it out loud!!\n\nI had chosen him off the BACP website because he said a lot about being LGBT friendly, and what he'd written really resonated with where I was in my life. \n\nUnfortunately he was more interested in being a career coach than helping me with my mental health, so it was not a good fit at all.\n\nHaving an answer to everything on session 1. If I open up on x y z problems and they come at me with confident answers about what I need to be doing to fix it, they have lost me.\n\nGo home and think about it first and we'll sort it next time. I've been thinking about these problems for years, and the chances of being told something I don't already know or haven't already thought of is slim. Even if they end up giving the same answer next week, I'd much rather have the illusion they've given it some thought.\n\nGetting out of bed and going. Lol\n\nWhen the therapist says nothing and just stares at you so you feel like you have to keep talking and do their job for them even though you've already said everything you needed to say they're just staring so you have to fill the silence somehow and end up rambling about nothing and making up problems because you'd rather fill the void than deal with that uncomfortable silence\n\nI recently had a therapist who kept trying to see if I had trauma (I don‚Äôt, not that I know of). She kept bringing up my childhood, which was normal, even after I expressed what concerns I had about myself &amp; my present life. She had me ‚Äúsit with it‚Äù when she told me I also had depression, which I already knew and was accepting of. What I needed her help with was to help me alleviate the feelings surrounding anxiety &amp; depression, not trying to find the ‚Äúreason.‚Äù She was a new therapist and I think she was grasping at straws because she didn‚Äôt know how to proceed. I ended things with her, because I felt frustrated each time we met due to the lack of help and her not actually listening to my needs."

    "body": "Anxiety easily can cause a million different symptoms. I made a near full recovery and one of the worst things I had to deal with was the symptoms. Dealing with symptoms is an endless cycle that seems to never end. When I lost the fear of 1 symptom, I had a new one the next week. Its important to understand these symptoms because it takes away the power they have over you. Here is a SHORT list of the symptoms I had.

    "all_comment_text": "omg you have no idea how much better i feel. i‚Äôve had all these feeling and i genuinely have been feeling like im going to die. i have been going to therapy and have been taking medication for about a month and i feel a lot better than i did two months ago but im still not 100% yet.\n\nMe as well. The symptoms have lessened a bit, and I have gained a bit more control on my panic attacks, but the symptoms and effects are still lingering in my everyday life. I wish the best for you. We are all in this together ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nim glad it helped somewhat. Im glad you can get this support from therapy because it makes the process smoother in my opinion. Its okay not to feel 100% fast, it really takes alot of time but at one point it gets so easy to manage, next thing you know you cant remember whens the last time you had anxiety.\n\nI totally get you and seeing others who have the exact same symptoms make me feel so much better and less frightened. Like oh I‚Äôm not going to die after all!\n\nHow long it takes these symptoms to go off especially the dizziness\n\nDM‚Äôd you\n\nCan I ask what meds ? I‚Äôm suffering bad.\n\nI am having same anxiety for 3 -4 months and everyday feels like im going to die .i am also in medication but still\n\nWhat medication?\n\nThanks for this. I experience a ton of similar symptoms as well and it‚Äôs horrible given I have severe hypochondria. Any bodily sensation that feels just a tiny bit off sets off the entire alarm system in me and I just end up spiralling.\n\nIt‚Äôs great to hear that there are others out there that feel or have the exact same symptoms. Makes the journey feel much less terrifying and alone. And I know that I‚Äôm not actually dying! Thanks for this and big hugs!\n\nI‚Äôm right there with you!\n\nOmg. One twitch i had half a day and i was sure it was some disease the doctors wont be able to find. Ive had every disease in my mind. A wierd mole? Shortness of breath? Then that flood of adrenaline comes wooshing over you like a hot blanket. And when the fire comes its beyond breathing your way out. ü§ï\n\nTell me about it! I think I deserve a medical degree cert the way I look into every possible disease and memorised symptoms and treatments just because my skin was flaky!¬†\n\nYou are not trust me. I had this in the starting and the first feeling is to get this assurance that you are not going to die. \n\nSooner or later you will get rid of it for sure. Trust the process and believe that it will pass.\n\nof course. good luck on your recovery journey.\n\nI have Hypochondria and Farmakofobia, every meds i must take is hell for me, hang in there.\n\nYo tambi√©n tengo toc de hipocondria brutal, siempre me ha dado por obsesionarme por las enfermedades f√≠sicas pero lo peor que he vivido es ahora tener miedo a la enfermedad mental, llevo 4 meses muerta en vida obsesionada pensando en las peores enfermedades mentales..esto es una c√°rcel mental.\n\nHow did you recover?\n\nWas alot of trial and error. I was also able to do it without medication thankfully. It was so bad, maybe I should have taken medication honestly. I wrote about my full recovery on a website on my page. You should check it out! Its a non profit organization and I made it to help everyone.\n\n1. Exposures. Expose yourself as much as possible to fears. You need to desensitize yourself to all irrational fears. Do things progressively. I didn't hope on a plane the first weeks I started dealing with 24/7 anxiety and panic attacks. I couldnt even leave my house around that time. I started exposing myself to all fears. Leaving the house, driving alone, being alone, being around people, in closed environments, outside, and eventually planes and more extreme things. You need to expose yourself to desensitze your fears, but make progress at a good pace. It takes patience\n\n2. Read and understand about anxiety, symptoms, ocd etc. This helped me alot. Why? Because it shows you that anxiety is just a natural human response. It gets severe because of so many factors like severe trauma, stress, bad habits, drugs, bad lifestlyes etc. I had 1 panic attack that completely changed my life. It caught me by surprise. But when I actually seen the lifestyle I was carrying for the last 3 years, I realized severe anxiety was imminent. Trauma, stress, barely sleeping, working 2 jobs and going to school full time, etc. \n\n3. Accept all anxiety, intrusive thoughts, fears, symptoms, uncertainty. Accept all of it, that its not a monster. Its harmless. It takes resilience, patience, and so many attempts to get this down. This was especially helpful for intrusive thoughts. I used to have panic attacks over intrusive thoughts, but I became resilient over time with them. They did not affect me, and neither did the symptoms. They lost a hold of me and all power over me.\n\n4. Try to lead a healthy lifestyle. This helped me so much. I moved out of an abusive household and this sped up recovery in my opinion. It sucks that this is not always an option for people which is hell. Exercise, try vitamins to see if they help, set up a consistent sleep schedule, manage stress levels well. Try to notice when your stress level increase and then take a step back to relax. I remember working 1-2 hours lead to symptoms for me. I never pushed it, I stopped and knew my limits. Long drives also were hell for me, they gave me so many anxiety symptoms and brought on ocd symptoms. Know your limits and over time your body will recover.\n\n5. Patience. Your nervous system is extremely dysregulated. It takes months to years for it to return to regular levels. Your fight or flight is permanately turned on and needs time to go back to normal. Stay strong, seek help and try therapy if you can. \n\nI talk about my full recovery on my page you can check it out!\n\nThank you for making it sound so simple. I have been struggling for exactly a year now and I‚Äôd say in 85% recovered. The only symptom that I really still struggle with is feeling dpdr all the time, and my brain still thinks it‚Äôs a threat no matter how much I rationally know it‚Äôs there to protect me. I think working full time hasn‚Äôt helped my recovery but thankfully I quit next week! I know I will overcome this sometime this year, but I‚Äôve had some really dark days feeling completely hopeless, but seeing stories similar to mine like yours give me hope :)\n\nI‚Äôm glad it gave you hope. Stay strong. Take the break because sometimes you may never get it. Then when you‚Äôre ready you can go back into the force. The final stages of recovery are continuing daily activities but always knowing your limits. Wishing you a fast recovery\n\nYes I‚Äôm going to be focusing on my wellbeing for a while, exercising and going and doing things in the city with my spare time - things I could barely imagine doing 6 months ago (the city was terrifying) so I‚Äôm definitely getting there. It‚Äôs like I said the DPDR and emotions that are the struggle at the moment, feeling really sad and numb most of the time, and overall verrrry lost in life but I know it‚Äôll get better\n\nIt will man. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Proud you‚Äôre always pushing bro. Resilience wins wars. Good luck on your journey\n\nThe biggest thing I struggle with is figuring out if something is anxiety, or an actual medical problem üò©\n\n\"There is nothing to fear, but fear itself\" is the most profound words ever spoken, for me. Fear had held me back from so much! It causes me social anxiety (fear of rejection and judgement) health anxiety. Every panic attack is raw fear. I need to bring this up to my therapist.\n\nThough feeling all of these symptoms is incredibly draining, it oddly feels nice to know that I‚Äôm not alone. My anxiety often makes me feel like I‚Äôm alone, so just knowing that we‚Äôre all in the same boat together helps me feel a bit less alone. I experience most of these symptoms, and I am so sorry that you do too. In the least, I hope that these symptoms lessen for you. You are not alone ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nHas anyone else gone through periods where it intensifies then tapers off after a few days. I keep thinking its something in my diet, or lacking in my diet. I get all the symptoms above plus one other physical symptom is clinching my jaw and just clinched up in general.\n\nThis is me right now . Its horrible¬†\n\nWow this was so reassuring to me. I was just told I have anxiety by a doctor and took my first anxiety pill yesterday (made me feel horrible). \n\nI pretty much checked all of these off! I feel so constantly sick as well and my health anxiety is so bad that I cannot function most of the time. \n\nThis list makes me feel better and less crazy :) a lot of people tell me I have no reason to worry, but I can‚Äôt explain how it eats me alive. these things seem so scary and hard for me to manage that I just isolate myself when experiencing them. So happy to know these feelings aren‚Äôt something I just experience!!\n\nPlease know that some medications you need to get used to. They don‚Äôt work immediately, and hopefully you discussed this with your doctor. \n:)\n\nI‚Äôve DM‚Äôd you\n\nSo many of these symptoms I didn't realize had to do with my anxiety. Being sick for 3wks plus with a cold I can't shake. Heart flutters/palpitations. Being SO VERY VERY TIRED. Nauseous all the time. The confusion and thinking I'm crazy!!! \n\nI have been fighting taking meds and I am to a point where I may have to do. Even my therapist suggested it üò©\n\nhey how are you doing now?\n\nThanks for this I have severe health anxiety currently and suffer from a lot of these. I am really conscious and hyper aware of my symptoms.\n\nThanks very much for this. I always suffered a bit of social anxiety but the past 4 months have been very very exhausting and my anxiety has ruled my life like never before. A lot of these symptoms are familiar to me, it‚Äôs good to know I‚Äôm not alone. \n\nThe depersonalisation derealisation is the most frightening experience I‚Äôve had, I didn‚Äôt know there was a term for it. If you could share some coping mechanisms for that in particular I‚Äôd appreciate it.\n\nI do feel like I‚Äôm coming out of the worst of this anxiety episode, and I went to a very very dark place for a while. Luckily I have tremendous family support. \n\nIf anyone is really struggling don‚Äôt hesitate to message me and I‚Äôll try to help. These feelings do pass, even though they feel like they never will.\n\nHi! I struggle with very bad derealization as well and what work best for me is to simply accept that it‚Äôs there, don‚Äôt try to fight it. It might be scary because you feel although nothing is real and disconnected but the more your ignore it the faster it goes away\n\nThank you for this comprehensive list of your symptoms! Anxiety is a F monster and wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy\n\nHello everyone. I‚Äôm currently recovering from GAD. It‚Äôs been a challenge. I‚Äôm a commercial pilot and the stress from work and personal life took a big toll on my life these last two years. I impulsively resigned from a job that I enjoyed. The job did have some stress involved, but for the most part I really enjoyed it. I am recovering from GAD, however, trying to get my job back has been very stressful which doesn‚Äôt help me as I‚Äôm trying to recover. I was at that job for close to 23 years.¬†\n\nThe symptoms I experienced last year before I eventually sought help in July of this year was brain fog, dizziness, loss of concentration, unable to focus, my cognitive ability to think rationally and make decisions was impaired . Tension headaches, trembling, tinnitus, worrying constantly, insomnia, fatigue, claustrophobia, a feeling of not able to control my decisions and now I have this former employer that won‚Äôt take me back because I was in a vulnerable state of mind to have people convince me to leave for another job that I didn‚Äôt want because I‚Äôm getting close to retirement. So, now I have two hills to climb during my recovery. I really didn‚Äôt need this. None of us do!\n\nI was so cognitively out of it when I left my former employer that I didn‚Äôt realize what I was doing starting over again until the first week of the new job. I finally realized that this is not my old job and that there is something mentally wrong with me. The best decision I made was to seek help. However, I was longer at my former job. This is going to be a real challenge.¬†\n\nThe symptoms I had described earlier, I had gone to the doctor last year to see what was wrong with me. I thought I may have long covid because I had covid in 2020 and 2022. The PCR tests came back negative and I was diagnosed with a viral infection. So, when I wasn‚Äôt flying I would take Sudafed to help with the dizziness, but the dizziness still came back. I thought there may have been loose crystals in my vestibular system, so I tried repositioning them by laying down and moving my head side to side. No change. I saw the doctor again. Same diagnosis. Eventually, I just delt with it not realizing that it was GAD that was causing these symptoms. Unfortunately, it took losing a good job to find out what I was dealing with.¬†\n\nYes, this really sux, but I can‚Äôt let this beat me. All I can do is continue receiving treatment and use my coping skills to fight this disorder. As for my former job, it‚Äôs going to a challenge to getting it back. Whats sad is that mental health issues are a stigma in aviation, so pilots are less willing to fess up and seek help until it‚Äôs too late. I sought help, but the doctors never determined that it could be psychological. After I had left my former employer and I realized that there was a problem with me my symptoms sky rocketed and I became a mental mess. But I never gave up. Believe me there are days that I wonder why this happened to me, but I keep telling myself to not give up. This is just another challenge to prove to how vulnerable our lives can be and that we can beat this through professional and peer support.\n\nNever quit. Never give up\n\nHow are you now?\n\nYour story made me cry. I have a similar story as a professional. Been in a GAD anxiety cycle for a good year now. Been at my profession for 27 years, but have hardly worked during this past year. Dealing with the symptoms is hard enough, but then dealing with the cascading failures of how it affects your whole life is a mountain to climb in itself. Your relationships suffer, job suffers, career suffers, and finances suffer. It's a lot to manage when you are just trying to survive when your body is stuck in fight or flight. The dizziness, woozy, brain fog stuff is one of my worst symptoms....mainly because it's so darn hard to do anything when you feel like your mind isn't clear....like being drugged or something. Are you doing better? I sure hope you get your job back and you are healthy again. Keep moving forward. it takes along time, but we will get through itüôè\n\nWow, i‚Äôm not the only one who has a weird choking thing, thought it was just be overreacting or maybe preparing myself to get sick, how did you get over that?\n\nI have this too! I swear I feel like I‚Äôm going to stop breathing sometimes!!\n\nThanks for your post. Very inspirational for those of us struggling. So happy you‚Äôve mostly recovered and I with you continued healing. \n\nWe can do this folks. I‚Äôm sure as hell not giving up.\n\nI have most of these. I can not believe that you managed to recover. I don't know what to do anymore...\n\nsame i need some help\n\nIt's been a year since this started for me and I feel like I've got dementia at this point (I don't, just feels like my brain is pudding)\n\nYou definitely don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve experienced the same thing today where I knew where my house was but I just couldn‚Äôt attach any thought to it while I was driving back home. It was really scary but now that I‚Äôm a bit more chill I see that it was just anxiety and once I make it out things go back to normal.\n\nThis might take longer than what I initially thought though.\n\nThis semester was tough. Haven‚Äôt had this kind of anxiety in awhile. I was in class the other day battling a panic attack looking at the floor like, this is it I might actually pass out here.\n\nI have similar physical symptoms, need help !!!\n\nI‚Äôve DM‚Äôd you man\n\nI have most of these, it‚Äôs so debilitating, and then I feel like people don‚Äôt really understand the magnitude of the symptoms. I feel like they just think. Well it can‚Äôt be that bad you‚Äôre still functioning, (yes, barely) it‚Äôs so sad.\n\nThis. The only person in my life that truly understands what I‚Äôm going through is my mom, because we‚Äôre unfortunately like mother like daughter lol. My support system is fantastic, but so many times I think that they just think I‚Äôm being dramatic or weak (oh how the mind plays tricks on us) when I just want to scream that I literally feel like I‚Äôm going to have a heart attack, pass out and shit myself all at the same time if I leave my house. That I‚Äôm tired ALL the time, not because I don‚Äôt want to do anything, but because my body is in fight mode 24/7 and I don‚Äôt feel peace and contentment anymore.  Praying for you and hope you can find some relief soon!!‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI‚Äôm so happy to read you‚Äôve recovered! I have most of these and more. I am completely mentally and physically crippled by this. I‚Äôve had 24/7 tunnel vision, disassociation and visual snow for 10 months. I can‚Äôt function on a daily basis anymore and I have kids and a full time job.\n\nSame I was gonna off myself but have a son now and I can‚Äôt do that to him.  I‚Äôm stuck here dealing with it\n\nHow long recovery take? I think mine jumped to extreme physical anxiety after covid\n\nI have every single one of these symptoms and it's so draining, I just want it to end\n\nI have more than half of these and I have been in bed for 4 months and lost a lot of weight and I have never wanted to take my Zoloft but now I‚Äôm considering it I just don‚Äôt want to make my symptoms worse‚Ä¶. I have been turning to my faith and god and it‚Äôs made me feel better\n\nAny luck ?\n\nMy RECOVERY\n\n**My Journey Through Depersonalization, Derealization, Anxiety, blurry vision, panic attacks, visual snow etc..¬†\n\nIt all began with excessive deep thinking‚Äîquestioning everything, analyzing every detail of existence, reality, and creation. I spent countless hours lost in existential thoughts, pondering the meaning of life, the nature of consciousness, and the origins of the universe. These questions consumed me, pulling me deeper into my mind until I felt trapped within it. What started as curiosity spiraled into something far more overwhelming: depersonalization, derealization, anxiety, extreme brain fog, blurry vision, visual snow, depression, and an unrelenting sense of disconnection from the world around me.\n\nFor about a year, these symptoms dominated my life. I couldn‚Äôt work, focus on tasks, or even engage in simple daily activities. It was as if my mind had become a labyrinth with no exit, and I was stuck wandering its endless corridors. Despite this struggle, I want to emphasize that none of this was induced by alcohol or drugs‚ÄîI‚Äôve never used either. My experience stemmed purely from overthinking and dwelling on profound, often abstract concepts also paired with discovering that many of the things we know as our reality is actually not real or true like money as a currency, the food we eat (GMO‚Äôs,processed foods), movie industry, news etc..)¬†\n\nWhen I first encountered others online who described similar struggles, I felt hope. Realizing I wasn't alone reduced my symptoms by about 20%. There's immense power in knowing someone else understands what you're going through. Still, I knew I needed professional guidance, so I sought help from a psychologist after my doktor suggested it to me. While he listened attentively to my problems, his solution‚Äîa prescription for antidepressants‚Äîfelt insufficient and he actually never heard of the terms DP/DR. Though medication might alleviate some symptoms temporarily i never took them and only went once to the psychologist.\n\nThese experiences don‚Äôt occur without reason. For some, they stem from spiritual crises; for others, physical imbalances. In my case, the primary culprit was excessive deep thinking. By constantly living in my head, ruminating on the past (which I couldn‚Äôt change) or worrying about the future (which I couldn‚Äôt predict), I neglected the present moment‚Äîthe only time we truly have control over. This mental habit left me disconnected from reality, anxious, and depressed.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, I realized I needed to make fundamental changes in my lifestyle. Here‚Äôs what worked for me:\n\n1. **Sleep Quality Over Quantity**: Sleeping longer didn‚Äôt solve my issues‚Äîit was the quality of sleep that mattered. Establishing a consistent bedtime routine, avoiding screens before bed, and making a calming environment helped improve my restorative sleep.\n\n2. **Healthy Eating Habits**: Switching to a diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods while reducing carb intake significantly boosted my energy levels and mental clarity. Proper nutrition plays a crucial role in stabilizing mood and cognitive function.\n\n3. **Exercise**: Physical activity became a cornerstone of my recovery. Whether it was walking outdoors, soccer, or strength training, exercise not only improved my physical health but also provided a much-needed outlet for stress and anxiety.\n\n4. **Social Connection**: Isolation worsened my symptoms, so reconnecting with friends and family was vital. Engaging in meaningful conversations and shared activities reminded me of the joy and connection available in the present moment.\n\n\n5. **Breaking Old Patterns**: To heal, I had to break free from old habits that perpetuated my suffering. This meant stepping out of my comfort zone, taking small actions each day, and focusing on progress rather than perfection.\n\nUltimately, there is no magic pill or quick fix for these kinds of struggles. Recovery requires effort, patience, and self-awareness. If you‚Äôre experiencing similar challenges, know that you are not alone. Recognize the triggers‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre rooted in excessive thinking, unhealthy habits, or emotional wounds‚Äîand take proactive steps toward healing.¬†\n\nToday, I‚Äôm grateful for the journey because it taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, presence, and self-care. Life may still bring uncertainties, but I‚Äôve learned to navigate them with greater peace and purpose. Remember, your mind has incredible potential to heal when given the right tools and attention. Take one step at a time, and trust the process.\n\nConclusion: All of this did not happen without a reason and the creator Allah swt does not burden a soul what he/she cannot bear. Stop defending that which is taking power from you like depression, dp/dr, anxiety and attack it. This all happened to you because you might be extra sensitive, emotionally build, past trauma‚Äôs but it does not mean you have to take it as your identity. Change the way you think, change the way you eat, change the way you sleep. You have to take action now and don‚Äôt let anyone label you with unsolvable mental issue and put you on medication for the rest of your life. One thing I can guarantee is that whilst you are experiencing all of these things is that you are not in the best shape of your life, you don‚Äôt know how to eat proper food which came from creation and not what mankind designed and changed genetically. The way you sleep is not on point. You have a lot of goals but don‚Äôt act upon them. Either you belive in a creator or not don‚Äôt forget that this life is a test and as a man trauma and difficulties build you up so you can become a better version of you‚Ä¶\n\nIf you don't mind asking how many times you were exercising?\n\nI feel very similar to this! I‚Äôm going to be starting my second week of Lexapro, fingers crossed it helps! Anxiety that spirals into health anxiety and OCD is truly an absolute curse. It‚Äôs so interesting you mention the constant brain chatter! I honestly feel like I‚Äôm insane sometimes because of it. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm having a thought and then all of the sudden it‚Äôs a snippet of a song and then more random nonsensical thoughts. My poor memory is almost embarrassing for someone in their late 20s. The muscle twitches, tingles, weird body sensations, the floating/dizzy feeling. How did you recover? What helped you?\n\nI just left a message under imagining dragons comment. check it out!\n\n  \nThe brain chatter scared the hell out of me because of my fear. But it lost all power over me. \n\nIt was a huge process and so many errors made. But im so thankful to have made it out. Im still battling ocd but  thats slowly going away.\n\nDM‚Äôd you\n\nHow are you feeling now ?\n\nLo de los pensamientos aleatorios sin sentidos los tengo al dormir, estoy obsesionada con que me estoy volviendo loca y estoy autovigilandome 24 horas y al dormir el paso de la vigilia al sue√±o estoy a√∫n consciente de los pensamientos incoherentes, y acojona bastante..\n\nYa me han dicho que es toc puro y duro pero yo sigo obsesionada y pendiente de lo que digo hago y pienso..\n\nUna pesadilla\n\nHow did you recover, which meds or therapy?\n\nno meds or therapy i was broke. I did it with full self help therapy. And so many lifestyle changes. I left a comment under imagining dragons comment. check it out\n\nDamn I keep mentioning a lot of these to my doc and insisting it must be something physical when she brings up my history of anxiety...\"panic attacks?? but i'm not panicking!!!\" Apparently you don't need to be mentally panicking to have an attack, it's just a relfex my body has now...but I got put on propranolol and it seems to be helping a bit so far!\n\nPanic and anxiety attacks vary, you may not have a panic attack but you may have an anxiety attack, it can be physical or mental and although it is not as desperate as panic, it still causes great tiredness and fear in the person\n\nThank you so much, I experience a lot of this, and I recently increased my dosage of Zoloft back to 200mg after about a year at 150mg. A lot of trauma and PTSD in 2023 made me go back up and I had a lot of times wondering if I‚Äôll ever feel good again. This helps ground me in that I‚Äôm not crazy, but I want it to stop so much. Thank you.\n\nDid you ever experience tension headaches or dull like tension going up the back of your head or feel like your whole head was being squeezed?\n\nYeah thats common with anxiety. He probably label it under migraines\n\nI think the anhedonia is probably the most miserable symptom for me as it makes me understand why people would end their lives.\n\nGo to a shelter and adopt a dog...I'm not joking.\n\nHi I need your help and support with this..\nFeeling anxious about this \n\n\nI feel like I‚Äôm going down the spiral with my anxiety and health anxiety especially and I need to know if any of you ever experienced physical symptoms like I did.\n\nRecently I have been struggling with headaches. The headache starts behind my left temple on the top, sometimes a bit more behind and goes to my neck, sometimes to my ear and on the right side. It‚Äôs usually moderate and numb pain. One time when I was anxious and it was extremely humid outside I got this pain on the left side that felt like someone hit me on that side, and after a few seconds and rest it stopped and never came back. I tend to have this moderate headache often and even though two neurologists reassured me that I‚Äôm fine I am so scared of aneurysm. I don‚Äôt have a family history of aneurysms, I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt smoke, I am a 26 year old white female with a normal blood pressure too. \nOn top of that I have this bell ringing sensation in one of my ears but not with headaches. For the past two days I felt a bit nauseous and tired but after taking a nap it went away. But then I started feeling dry mouth and had to drink lots of water. This headache lasts for a few seconds and minutes, goes away and comes back. Sometimes when I change positions it helps. It usually happens when it‚Äôs hot and/or humid outside, when I‚Äôm anxious, stressed, or angry, if I drink too much Coke Zero or when I‚Äôm tired. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I also obsessively check my pupils size and my vision and sometimes I have a feeling that my vision in one eye is weaker a bit but then goes back to normal and goes into the other eye. I‚Äôm just scared. Has anyone had a headache like that? I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point.\n\nHaving something similar how are you now? My docs are saying it‚Äôs a headache or pinched nerve as I was getting little electric zaps on left side of head only\n\nTry the book Dare Barry Mcdonagh\n\nThe brain chatter gives me anxiety it seems because I keep thinking it will never stop at times but ik having anxiety about it keeps it going so I‚Äôm working on that. Just would like to know that it does stop\n\nHey what do you mean by difficulty in speaking??? Like stuttering??\n\nIf you don't mind asking, have you faced the difficulty in speaking, and how it looks like? Did you feel tightness in your muscles' throat area?\n\nI have this¬†\nbecause of tightness in jaw and neck muscles¬†\nIt triggers my health anxiety makes me feel like I have some sort of disease\n\neven neck stiffness\n\n A post like this provides relief. But then afew days later you know you'll be searching for another post that reaffirms all the same things.   \n  \nAnd then you'll be searching again and again in the hope that one day the circle can be broken.  \n  \nAnd another thing about anxiety, is that if you Google any of the symptoms, Google will almost always give you some horrendous disease or illness in return to stress about.   \n  \nPractically all the symptoms OP listed will have an anxiety sufferer thinking 'cancer', 'heart disease', 'brain tumour', 'alzheimer's' etc etc. And you'll be thinking; \"I KNOW it's anxiety, but WHAT IF this time IT ISN'T ?!\"\n\nAnd Doctors will patronize you and write you off as a 'basket case'.  \nOr want to give you anxiety drugs whose side effects are as bad as anxiety itself !  \n  \nOr maybe one Doctor will say \"You have PPPD\".   \nAnd another will say \"PPPD is something we Doctors invented to get rid of annoying patients and give them peace of mind, kind of like the IT Help Desk telling you to reboot your PC to get you off the phone\".\n\nThe seemingly never-ending cycle of anxiety. Sucks to be us. :-)\n\nTotalmente, le√≠ el comentario principal me relaje, sent√≠ un alivio que llevaba tiempo sin sentir, empec√© a bajar y leer mas comentarios y le√≠ uno que me acojon√≥ de nuevo y me dej√≥ temblando y fatal de nuevo..\n\nThis is me right now avoiding to be on medications but my God i will have to give in because some days im just spaced out‚Ä¶ i keep thinking is the fact im not eating enough when is not üò≠ also i have adhd.. ugh\n\nHey, did you or anyone else have had afterimages? If yes, how did you get over them?\n\nYea but barely anymore. I stopped paying attention to them. When your fear is elevated it‚Äôs hard to do, but once your body becomes stronger, it‚Äôs easy to overcome fear of symptoms.\n\nHow long did it take to reach here?¬†\nIt has become so difficult me to look at something bright, or even watch a sunset:)\n\nDoes anyone ever experience sharp pains in their stomach/ belly button? Also excessive gurgling that‚Äôs almost nonstop like your hungry even tho your not or just ate‚Ä¶? I‚Äôve been dealing with this for a bit and my health anxiety is through the roof. All the other symptoms in the list I have also experienced a lot, but the constant stomach gurgling and sharp pains is new to me.\n\ni experience sharp pains and gurgling when I'm really gassy. It's probably just gas. If it lasts for more than a week and it's really concerning to you, talk with your doctor. I doubt it's anything serious, though. Anxiety makes you hyperaware of physical sensations. Anxiety can also cause stomach pains and gastrointestinal symptoms\n\nWhat about joint pain, and leg weakness? Trying to figure out what‚Äôs anxiety and what actually something going on. I have most of theses above symptoms, but the main ones that freak me out are joint pain that‚Äôs migrating, leg weakness, tremors in hands, hand weakness and I feel like am in a constant state of fight or flight.¬†\n\nAny update on these symptoms? I'm also experiencing similar symptoms as you described and have been wondering the same thing! Like is this anxiety or something else?!\n\nI‚Äôm not sure if these symptoms were chronic for you but I‚Äôll dm you my own story as well.\n\nThank you for this. Just wondering how you overcame. Have you shared and if so can you link it.¬†\n\n\nI'm trying to find words for my journey but I am at that odd place of it's over but where am I? There is a lot of confusion and I'd be lying if I said seeing the destruction sickness caused me, i don't feel like digging a hole far too often. LOL. I wanna know how others made peace &amp; forgave themselves.¬†\n\nThank you for posting this! Seriously. I‚Äôve been battling this debilitating anxiety for the past year, and have slowly made steps to push past it, but it having seen your list of symptoms and seeing just how ‚Äúnormal‚Äù this is, makes me feel so better and a little less alone‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYou said read and understand, can you recommend any books?\n\nI wrote about how you can make a full recovery on my profile website. Check it out there. It‚Äôs free, I made it a non profit.\n\nI'm so sorry you experienced this, but thank you for sharing because this is so reassuring. I am experiencing every single one of these things and I just keep convincing myself I must have some fatal condition and this can't all be from panic and anxiety. The hypnagogic hallucinations are so terrifying and disturbing. And I get the brain chatter in the middle of the night. I'll wake up and be having conversations in my head or repeating phrases or words from a show I watched before bed. I never thought if it being connected to anxiety.\n\nEstoy igual que t√∫, pensando que es algo peor, que es imposible que sea toc y ansiedad seg√∫n mi psic√≥loga, tengo todas las parasomnias habidas y por haber, pensamientos al dormir sin sentido al pasar de la vigilia al sue√±o, me levanto hecha un cacao mental porque me levanto mil veces al ba√±o, tengo mil sue√±os, pesadillas, y que todo esto sea ansiedad..seria flipante..\n\nThis is so relatable. I was (or I thought I was) out of it for over 10 years and suddenly it came back after a period of intense stress both at home and work.\nIt's so nice to this list, makes you feel less lonely and knowing there is a way to feel better üòä\n\nomg this is so reassuring! can you describe your headaches? i‚Äôve been dealing with them on and off and it‚Äôs so frustrating bc i‚Äôm constantly worrying whether it‚Äôs something serious or not. i had a ct scan back in march and was told that it wasn‚Äôt anything\n\nThank you.  I‚Äôm in the middle of a derealization episode right now that‚Äôs also got some breathing issues attached to it, and it‚Äôs all so new for my anxiety that I‚Äôm so out of my depth to cope, and that fear is only continuing the cycle.\n\nYou are an inspiration!!! I am struggling so bad with the physical symptoms of anxiety üò≠ I feel like there‚Äôs no way out. I keep trying mediation but all of it gives me even worse side effects than my original anxiety symptoms. Is there anything specific you did for shortness of breath, tingling &amp; weakness in arms, dizziness, derealization?\n\nMenos mal, pens√© que era la √∫nica a la que la meditaci√≥n me hac√≠a m√°s mal que bien, no s√© porque pero me pone m√°s nerviosa..üò£¬†\n\nWow you had all of these symptoms? My heart goes out for you. How did you make a full recovery?\nFor me, the hyper vigilance/fear of dying/ agoraphobia is the worst\n\nHow long do y‚Äôall withdrawals last when you‚Äôre coming off hydrozine\n\nHi there, I know you posted this a little while ago, and I‚Äôm just wondering what the ‚Äòconfusion‚Äô you felt was like? I feel like im having severe memory loss and I keep on forgetting where i am/what i‚Äôm doing and I don‚Äôt recognise familiar surroundings.\n\nYea that‚Äôs confusion. I experienced exactly what you described. I didn‚Äôt recognize my family members either\n\nHey man, I appreciate you posting this. I have experienced almost everything you've listed so far too.\n\nI've been in this anxiety cycle for almost 2 years. It really ramped up over a year ago with the mental symptoms, intrusive thoughts, irrational OCD fears and themes (mostly sexual and violence based for me). Muscle twitches, PVCs, etc. I have hope that I will get better. It has actually improved a good amount ever since I started learning about the condition and learning to let go and truly accept the symptoms. It's just a matter of time now.\n\nThis is Schiz-OCD?? Fear going crazy\n\nFirst of all, I want to say that this will be translated since I am Spanish and I do not understand English well, I hope it is understood in the best way.\n\nI am Victor from Spain, I am 20 years old and I have had anxiety since I was little, on May 9, 2022 this hell began from which I am still just as bad, that day as soon as I woke up I had thoughts of harming myself, they came involuntarily and they scared me a lot since I did not know why I had them because I did not and do not want to hurt myself, I was very scared and anxious, my chest hurt, I had trouble breathing, I ate little, I slept with my mother ... I thought this would be because of a bad day and that it would go away on its own but unfortunately it was not like that, a few days after this, being in my room, from one moment to the next out of nowhere this thought crossed my mind: What if I kill my mother? At that moment I started to cry, I didn‚Äôt know what was happening to me, because I had that kind of thoughts, it had never happened to me and I was very scared, after this I decided to go to the psychiatrist to tell him about this and he told me about OCD, I didn‚Äôt know what it was but reading about it fit with what was happening to me, after a few days, exactly on May 27, 2022, I saw a news story on television about a mental illness called schizophrenia, I was in shock, it was like, I have this... At that time I didn‚Äôt know exactly the symptoms of that disease, I more or less knew what the disease was but I didn‚Äôt know the symptoms in depth, when I saw that news I entered a loop that lasted about 4/5 months which every day I read and watched forums, videos about the symptoms of this disease, I read about delusions and hallucinations, from that moment on I was aware of the noises I could hear, I tried to find out where I heard the noises to know if they were real or not. it was a real noise or a hallucination, if i was watching a video and i heard something that i thought could be outside of that video i would rewind the video to see if i could hear it again, around that time i don‚Äôt know if it was due to stress i developed floaters and i confused them with hallucinations, sometimes out of the corner of my eye i would see flashes and it would scare me, sometimes when i would go to sleep in that phase of falling asleep sometimes i could ‚Äúhear‚Äù my own thoughts, it was very strange, they were like random thoughts of things that had happened to me during the day and i would get scared that they were hallucinations. There is also the other symptom that scared me, which was delusions, I read about them and after reading I noticed that I had those same thoughts but I knew they were lies, for example, I read that a delusion is an idea that is given 100% veracity even if it is proven with clear evidence that it is not true but the belief about that idea is still maintained, such as believing that they are going to kill you without having proof that it is true, well after reading about delusions I have that style of thoughts but I know they are lies, what happens is that I am afraid that from one day to the next I start to believe them and start to rave, to summarize, I have paranoid thoughts but I know they are lies, all this comes from reading about schizophrenia, I think reading about the symptoms has screwed up my head, any help?\n\nHola, estoy igual que t√∫, llevo con toc y ansiedad toda mi vida pero un d√≠a me levant√© con un ataque de p√°nico por una pesadilla y lo peor que he hecho en mi vida fue leer s√≠ntomas de esquizofrenia en el maldito google..llevo 4 meses hundida en la miseria pensando que estoy desarrollando quiz√°s esquizofrenia, somatizo todos sus s√≠ntomas desde que lo le√≠, tengo miedo de escuchar voces o ver cosas raras, estoy todo el d√≠a pendiente de mis pensamientos de lo que digo o hago por si ‚Äúhay algo raro‚Äù. Es un sin sinvivir 24/7, ya he estado en terapia y me dicen que tengo toc de libro pero yo sigo pensando que puede ser algo peor..\n\nI‚Äôve been on a spiral the past week. Always dealt with anxiety daily but haven‚Äôt dealt with panic attacks in about 15 years and I‚Äôve been in a constant panic attack. My anxiety is usually OCD mind racing isolating type anxiety not ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm dying‚Äù anxiety and the past week it‚Äôs been that. I feel so much better right now because I haven‚Äôt been eating and I think that makes my anxiety extremely worse (low blood sugar and hypertension) which cause real symptoms which make the other ‚Äúreal‚Äù symptoms from anxiety so much worse. Happy I read this. I ate an hour ago and feel 10x better than I have the past week.\n\nOmg can you explain more about the deja vu feeling. I notice it happens most when I'm stressed but it makes living so hard because it makes it feel like I'm not truly living.\n\nI don't mean to scare you but Deja Vu feelings are a huge indicator of epilepsy.\n\nI feel like I'm going through this right now, how did you overcome these issues.\n\nThank you so much for sharing. My health anxiety has been so bad lately and I tend to spiral. It‚Äôs getting better. But thank you so much ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nI‚Äôve been experiencing a lot of things from this list, I even talked to my therapist about it &amp; told her I was thinking about talking to a psychiatrist or something because, I haven‚Äôt been feeling the best &amp; I really don‚Äôt want to be on meds but, I think I might just have to. I didn‚Äôt think me being on my healing journey would be this hard &amp; full of ups &amp; downs!¬†\n\nThanks for sharing. Gathered with family waiting for my 93 year old mother in law to pass. Lots of anxiety today. Not feeling well.\n\nThis was so helpful to read, thank you!! I have many of those symptoms right now too and would give anything for this to be in the past.\n\nHey, thank you for sharing your experience. How did you heal the palpitations? How long did it take?\n\nI just read this and I have basically every scary symptom you have I started having them at 26 years old they would come &amp; go. I‚Äôve had some serious medical problems over the years and now that I‚Äôm older they‚Äôve come back worse then ever and I can‚Äôt even speak &amp; I‚Äôve tried talking to a sister Drs but I truly feel like they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal or they pacify me and that‚Äôs that. I really feel like it‚Äôs taking what life I have left away from me worst thing try and get a doctor appointment a psychiatrist or psychologist. I really don‚Äôt have anyone to help me.and because I‚Äôm now 72 I‚Äôll the drs make me feel like because of my age they just don‚Äôt want to take any time with me. I‚Äôm having a severe one now they‚Äôre getting longer &amp; more intense. The kind of drs I‚Äôve mentioned their waiting list are 4-6 months long or worse. Plus in April I woke up with loud whistling in my ear saw an ear spec. Diagnosed me with titinitis. I feel like I am doomed right now. How did you deal with it did yours go away? Sorry I must sound like a basket case I sure feel like one right now\n\nI would try to meditate on the Bible, The Word of Our Living God. Pray, meditate, He will provide you something. If not, maybe it is a way to come to Christ? I am 26 years old, overcame everything and relapsed. But this brought me to faith!\n\nCould I please DM you? üôèüèª\n\nHad pretty much all this for almost a year when recovering after a very short benzo stint. All went away.\n\nSo that means i dont have 10 different diseases at the same time\nBut come on i have at least one of them they is no way i have all these signs and have nothing i need to go to all the doctors and then i will be sure if i don't go to the doctor i feel like i will always be anxious everyday\n\nWow, so many of these issues are like what I constantly experience when my anxiety is at its high. It's very defeating.  What did you have with groin pain? Like was it around the hips too or around that area rather than directly at the front? but more to the side? Just asking to see what you have/had because I'm currently going through that as one of my symptoms.\n\ncurrently going through 75% of them, not an easy week for sure!\n\nME TOO.¬†\n\nDid you ever have trouble with not ‚Äúconcentrating‚Äù while writing or talking? Like, I‚Äôm writing a word‚Äîsay, ‚Äúconcentration‚Äù but then I miss writing a letter. I‚Äôm writing it down by hand and it comes out as ‚Äúconcenr‚Äù, missing the T, and immediately I notice the mistake and correct it. Or I‚Äôm talking, saying something like ‚ÄúWe were learning about z-scores in statistics today‚Äù but it comes out as ‚Äúwe was learning about z-scores in statistics today‚Äù or ‚Äúwe were learning z-scores in statistics today‚Äù. And I notice right after I said it, that it came out wrong, but it‚Äôs weird to correct it.\n\nI also have a tendency to unconsciously tighten my neck muscles in the front. I don‚Äôt know the names of the specific muscles, but when they tighten, they pull down the corner of my mouth. I‚Äôve done this for years, but it started happening really frequently after the anxiety.\n\nDo u experience brain fog, in a sense that u can't think clearly\n\nWell, fuck. I haven't gotten a proper diagnosis or even any medical attention (orthodox parents) but i just checked a majority of these boxes.\nThe impending doom, i felt crazy. I keep getting visions of getting hit by a truck, among other things. And the brainfog, dear god. I was worried i had rotted my brain out.\n\nWow maybe this all has been anxiety for me. Literally ive had every single symptoms. The ones i struggle the most with are the mental ones.\n\nI‚Äôm always wondering if there is something wrong with me or if I‚Äôve just got anxiety. I get symptoms that all fit anxiety and they come and go constantly but I always struggle to accept that all it is, is just anxiety. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if anyone has experienced this but sometimes I‚Äôll be laying in bed and out of nowhere just completely randomly my body will make me take a instant random gasp just one time until I sit up and it goes only happens every few days but that is one thing that scares me and makes me think it‚Äôs not just anxiety. Has anybody ever experienced this?\n\nI think I‚Äôm going almost all of these. The fear of death and the depression. My mind can not focus. Brain fog. It‚Äôs debilitating.\n\nWho gets itching all over¬†\n\nSo helpful\n\nI‚Äôve had a lot of these currently dealing with tingling type static feeling soooo faint on my legs that moves around, any advice? I too have ocd which mean I think about it over and over\n\nI usually do a hot bath too help with that.\n\nAfter my mom passed went back to work ya. They changed everything my anxiety got worse. Lot of those symptoms.¬† Not my girlfriend but ya.\n\nI think i could write a textbook on my symtpms and my own diagnosis of those symptoms. Symptoms are so real they cause such negative thoughts. I ebeoieved I had cancer, adrenal crisis, menopause,bowel issues, kidney failure, brain tumours, you name it i had it \nCan I ask you state recovery!! Did you feel you were doing alot better but still had some symtpms like dizzyness off balance nausea etc and then days where you you felt you were losing yoru midnight and to tired to fight all over again?\n\nBonjour, je te remercie infiniment pour le travail que tu fais. Je me permets de m‚Äôadresser √† toi, j‚Äôesp√®re que je ne te d√©rangerai pas. Je te remercie d‚Äôavance pour ta lecture.\n\n¬†Je suis un immense anxieux et stress√© depuis ma premi√®re crise de panique √† 18 ans. J‚Äôai v√©cu par le pass√© plusieurs des sympt√¥mes de l‚Äôanxi√©t√© s√©v√®re que tu as pr√©sent√© ici et je suis parvenu √† les surmonter gr√¢ce √† l‚Äôacceptation, la compr√©hension et l‚Äôexposition. \n\nToutefois j‚Äôai une inqui√©tude immense concernant mon √©tat actuel, j‚Äôai 25ans et je n‚Äôarrive pas √† savoir si ce que j‚Äôai en ce moment sont des sympt√¥mes de l‚Äôanxi√©t√©, puisque certains d‚Äôentre eux ne sont pas cit√©s dans ta liste.\n\n¬†J‚Äôai une peur terrible d‚Äô√™tre dans la phase prodromique de la schizophr√©nie et qu‚Äôil ne s‚Äôagisse plus seulement de symptomes li√©s √† mon anxi√©t√© s√©v√®re que je tra√Æne depuis mes 18ans, d‚Äôautant que je suis un consommateur excessif de cannabis depuis ma plus tendre adolescence. J‚Äôai peur que cette anxi√©t√© s√©v√®re que j‚Äôai depuis 7 ans et toutes ses manifestations symptomatiques, n‚Äô√©taient finalement qu‚Äôune annonce d‚Äôune entr√©e dans la schizophr√©nie.\n\nTout a commenc√© il y a maintenant 1 mois, apr√®s un √©v√®nement et un contexte particuli√®rement stressant (entretien d‚Äôembauche). Durant cette ann√©e j‚Äôai renvers√© de force mon rythme de sommeil au moins 6 fois, ne dormant pas de la nuit pour retrouver un rythme normal. Je sentais que cela affectait consid√©rablement mon cerveau, mais mon incapacit√© √† conserver un rythme jour/nuit normal m‚Äôy obligeait.\n\n¬†Le lendemain de cet entretien tr√®s stressant qui repr√©sentait, pour moi et toute ma famille mon entr√©e dans le monde du travail, j‚Äôavais en ma possession deux types de cannabis diff√©rents. J‚Äôai consomm√© plusieurs joints du premier type, jusque l√† tout allait bien, puis j‚Äôai consomm√© 1 joint du second type. D√®s la consommation de ce second type de cannabis, j‚Äôai imm√©diatement senti mon √©tat cognitif se d√©grader brutalement.\n\n¬†Je vais te citer du mieux possible ce que je ressens¬†:\n\n¬†\n\n\\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Toute prise de parole me semble co√ªteuse en √©nergie et ne me vient plus de fa√ßon spontan√©e et naturelle, au point o√π je pr√©f√®re ne pas parler, ou ne pas r√©pondre. Cela a radicalement chang√© mes rapports sociaux, je n‚Äôai plus aucun plaisir √† interagir car cela me semble anormalement difficile et d√©sagr√©able. Je me force √† parler.\n\n\\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Hors de la maison j‚Äôai la sensation que mon cerveau n‚Äôarrive plus √† correctement traiter la quantit√© d‚Äôinformations visuelles et autres stimulations sensorielles.\n\n\\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Il y a une forme de DP/DR mais qui ne ressemble pas √† ce que j‚Äôai pu vivre avant, les choses me semblent effectivement r√©elles mais j‚Äôai la sensation que mon cerveau n‚Äôarrive plus √† les traiter et donc je ne me sens plus vraiment ancr√©. Avec une sensation tr√®s bizarre lorsque je me regarde dans le miroir, o√π je me reconnais tr√®s bien mais je n‚Äôarrive pas √† maintenir mon attention sur mon reflet.\n\n\\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† La concentration visuelle est tr√®s difficile, je le remarque notamment lorsque je regarde un match de basket, o√π je n‚Äôarrive plus √† percevoir de fa√ßon claire les mouvements de chaque joueur.\n\n\\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Les t√¢ches habituellement simples me semblent anormalement complexes sur le plan cognitif, me faire un caf√©, faire √† manger, prendre une douche‚Ä¶ Lorsque je sors faire les courses, c‚Äôest une catastrophe, je suis compl√®tement submerg√© par toutes les stimulations visuelles ext√©rieures, pareil lorsque je vais dans un endroit public ou lorsque je suis dans un trajet de voiture.\n\n\\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† J‚Äôai une grande perte d‚Äôint√©r√™t pour quasiment tout ce qui me plaisait auparavant et j‚Äôai une diminution consid√©rable de mes √©motions. Plus rien n‚Äôest une source de plaisir, cet √©tat m‚Äôemp√™che de pouvoir prendre du plaisir par rapport √† quoique ce soit. Cela est flagrant au niveau du rire lorsque quelqu‚Äôun fait une blague dr√¥le, j‚Äôai l‚Äôimpression de rire comme m√©caniquement, mais sans en ressentir l‚Äô√©motion en moi.\n\n\\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lors de moments sociaux avec plusieurs personnes je n‚Äôarrive plus √† interagir correctement et √† m‚Äôins√©rer dans la discussion collective. Lorsque je prends la parole je n‚Äôarrive pas √† m‚Äôexprimer comme je le souhaite et spontan√©ment, je n‚Äôarrive pas √† transmettre correctement mes id√©es.\n\n\\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† J‚Äôai des hallucinations auditives et olfactives r√©currentes depuis qu‚Äôun psychiatre, au vu de ces symptomes, a propos√© un arr√™t de l‚Äôanti-d√©presseur (que je prenais depuis plusieurs ann√©es) pour passer √† un anti-psychotique dont j‚Äôai lu qu‚Äôil √©tait quasi uniquement donn√© dans les cas de schizophr√©nie.\n\n¬†\n\nJe pense avoir √©num√©r√© l‚Äôessentiel de ce que je ressens. Ce nouvel √©tat cognitif/mental est absolument permanent, m√™me dans mes r√™ves. Cette forme de diminution fonctionnelle et cognitive est tr√®s handicapante et a g√©n√©r√© un isolement social total. Je ne suis qu‚Äôavec ma m√®re et ne sort quasiment pas de la maison. Je ne discute plus avec mes amis car je n‚Äôarrive plus √† y ressentir de plaisir.\n\n¬†\n\nPour toutes ces raisons je n‚Äôai plus de vie et n‚Äôexiste plus. Je passe ma journ√©e dans ma chambre √† chercher sur Google ce qui m‚Äôarrive, c‚Äôest la seule chose qui m‚Äôint√©resse. Je suis dans une inqui√©tude permanente, surtout li√©e au fait que ce que j‚Äôai ressemble beaucoup aux symptomes n√©gatifs de la schizophr√©nie, qui existent notamment dans la phase d√©butante, avant l‚Äôapparition de la crise d√©lirante aigue.\n\n¬†\n\nJe me dis en permanence que vivre une vie dans cet √©tat n‚Äôa aucun int√©r√™t et pense beaucoup au s‚Ä¶ .\n\n¬†\n\nAyant gard√© le r√©flexe li√© √† mes anciennes crises d‚Äôanxi√©t√©, j‚Äôai tent√© d‚Äôaccepter mes symptomes et de vivre naturellement avec. Mais j‚Äôai observ√© que, contrairement √† avant, ceux l√† ne s‚Äôatt√©nuaient pas lors d‚Äôune quelconque activit√© ou distraction o√π j‚Äôoccupe mon esprit, au contraire ils m‚Äôapparaissent davantage et m‚Äôemp√™chent de pouvoir tirer de la satisfaction de quoi que ce soit.\n\n¬†\n\nC‚Äôest extr√™mement difficile √† vivre, d‚Äôautant que je ne sais pas s‚Äôil s‚Äôagit encore une fois des symptomes de l‚Äôanxi√©t√© ou bien est-ce que cette fois-ci j‚Äôai r√©ellement bascul√© de l‚Äôautre c√¥t√©.\n\n¬†\n\nDis-moi si ce que je raconte ici t‚Äô√©voque certaines choses, je suis vraiment d√©sol√© de te faire lire tout √ßa mais je suis dans une d√©tresse immense. Encore merci d‚Äôexister et de me permettre de te livrer ce message.\n\nMadre m√≠a tengo el mismo miedo que t√∫, como sigues?¬†\n\nYo hice lo mismo, que es buscar en internet s√≠ntomas, y aparece la temida esquizofrenia, eso fu√© lo peor que he hecho en mi vida, nunca me atrev√≠ a leer sus s√≠ntomas ( siempre he tenido miedo a la locura ) pero desde un fuerte ataque de p√°nico que me dio hace 4 meses, me dio por leerlo, y ha sido los peores cuatro meses de mi vida.¬†\n\nPienso igual que t√∫ que tengo los s√≠ntomas negativos, pero luego pienso que cuando vives aterrorizado es normal no querer salir, que te cueste hablar, o que el miedo te paralice hasta el habla, que no encuentres placer ante tal panorama mental de miedo y que como el mensaje principal dice todo este afectado a nivel cognitivo..\n\nintento pensar en positivo..\n\npero la mente juega malas pasadas me autoexploro tambi√©n los pensamientos hasta cuando voy a dormir y estoy cogiendo el sue√±o, me cuesta mil expresarme, pienso que voy a somatizar todo de ver cosas raras o escuchar cosas raras y eso me aterroriza 24/7.\n\nMi anterior psic√≥loga me dijo que ten√≠a toc de libro pero yo sigo pensando que es algo peor ya, que de tanta ansiedad y tanto toc me ha hecho trizas la mente..\n\nQue pesadilla..\n\nI have like 85% of these symptoms\n\nHola, tengo toc y ansiedad desde que soy una ni√±a con todos tus s√≠ntomas al completo, ya tengo 37 y sigo igual, pero desde hace 4 meses tuve un ataque de p√°nico por una pesadilla y lo peor que hice fue buscar los s√≠ntomas en google y terminas leyendo cosas y s√≠ntomas de lo m√°s temido, la esquizofrenia, bueno despu√©s de buscar eso he estado FATAL, pensando que tengo esos s√≠ntomas, somatizando todo. Estuve en cama dos semanas llorando a diario.¬†\n\n¬†Con ataques de p√°nico 24/7, empec√© el psic√≥logo y empec√© a hacer cosas pero siempre con una agon√≠a en el pecho brutal ya no pod√≠a vivir as√≠, y empec√© a tomar lorazepan, jamas tome medicina, pero me relajo un poco pero cuando se va el efecto vivo en un miedo constante, ya no quiero ni salir, me cuesta la vida socializar pero disimulo bastante bien aunque por dentro est√© muri√©ndome literalmente.¬†\n\nDebo decir que tengo toc sobre todo de hipocondria es el m√°s marcado desde ni√±a entonces esto es un martirio.\n\nLos dos psic√≥logos que he tenido me dicen que tengo toc de libro y sigo sin creerlos, mi mente obsesiva est√° convencida de que estoy desarrollando esquizofrenia..\n\nNo me atrevo ir al psiquiatra por si ve algo m√°s o me atiborra a antidepresivos..\n\nL√≥gicamente ya no me apetece hacer nada y me cuesta la vida hablar porque estoy pendiente de lo que hablo de lo que pienso 24 horas hasta cuando estoy empezando a dormir tb estoy pendiente de mis sue√±os..es brutal la autovigilancia..\n\nLuego cuando ‚Äúno pienso o no estoy atenta‚Äù todo me sale con m√°s naturalidad..\n\nTengo todos tipos de parasomnias, duermo pero me levanto much√≠simo, sue√±o fragmentado..\n\nQuiero salir de esta obsesi√≥n como las otras que he tenido sobre enfermedades f√≠sicas pero esta me est√° costando la vida, porque es uno de mis mayores temores..\n\nQue puedo hacer?üòî\n\nI don‚Äôt feel so alone anymore\n\nI needed to read this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve recently convinced myself I have mad cow or fatal insomnia‚Ä¶ I have had a ROUGH month. It‚Äôs been so bad. Constantly googling. In and out of the ER. I have so many REAL symptoms that present neurological in nature, usually worse at night when trying to sleep, and it‚Äôs just scared the shit out of me‚Ä¶ feel like I‚Äôm losing it. Memory issues, restless leg, super weird headache with a tingle that runs down my arms constantly‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs horrible. Doctors say I‚Äôm fine and shit but I don‚Äôt feel fine. The derealization part sucks so freaking bad. I can‚Äôt go outside because of it.\n\ni‚Äôm struggling so bad with you. It‚Äôs been a horrible month and im convinced something is wrong with my brain, i see a neurologist wednesday but all in all i think i just have crippling anxietyüò≠\n\nThat‚Äôs textbook ocd. Had all that. You need anxiety and ocd treatment. ERP is the best treatment for ocd.\n\nHow do you recover?\n\nI am late. But did you take any medication? \n\nHow long did it take to get better?\n\nAlso was anhedonia (did you have sexual anhedonia too?) the last symptoms to get better?\n\nYea had all that. No medication. It was hell but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt take it, because coming off of medication sometimes brings back anxiety temporarily worst.\n\nReally feeling the sky and ocean one, I have this wierd sensation when looking up at buildings, into the horizon or up at the sky. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs fear but definitely triggers my anxiety. Anyone else feel the same and found ways to help manage this. I think I just need to expose myself to try and desensitise this feeling.\n\nI have also a weird fear of the sky. I overcame it through exposure. But relapsed after few years. It is a mix of Agoraphobia/ OCD Existential and panic/anxiety. We can‚Äôt handle the fact how big the sky is and how big the world is. Never was like this but I hope there are others who recovered and share their story. It makes us depressed and hopeless\n\nI‚Äôm happy to say that i have nearly fully recovered and you definitely can recover from this. If anyone needs some advice or reassurance drop me a dm. I really was at rock bottom these past few months but there‚Äôs a few things I did that really benefited the speed of my recovery, I respect that everyone‚Äôs road to recovery is different however but I‚Äôm sure I could help some people\n\nThank god finally all of my symptoms i am reading here :( i thought i am the only one who is facing this worst symptoms üò§ i am scared to sleep at night üòû\n\nCan I ask how you recovered?  I am going through the same type of symptoms and am a single father of my 8 year old son Oliver.  He needs me and I really need to figure this out!  Any info would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks.\n\nYea I have a website where I put all the steps I took to recover. It‚Äôs free and on my Reddit page. Just click on my profile. Hope you can recover sooner than expected, stay strong üôèüèº\n\nCried after reading this üò™\n\nI have had lots of these too. Did you ever have a burning in your mouth?¬†\n\nDid you also have random dull abdominal pain?\n\nBruh its like reading a post about myself lmao\n\nI have most of these symptoms, I'm so grateful that you post this list of symptoms (and how you did recover).  I've been going through severe anxiety since 2022 and had a lot of panic attacks over the last years, and became also very paranoid..and therefore isolated. I have the feeling that I'm going downhill. I have to work 6 days a week for my income, so that also give's a lot of pressure. If only I got rid of these distressing symptoms like the weird tinnitus (low frequency noise, eery tunes) and pain on my chest. I would love to visit your website. Where can I go?\n\nIt‚Äôs on my page. Just click my page and check it out there!\n\nI have majority of these and I agreee the dizziness and dpdr are the worst. I‚Äôm scared I have MS. Health anxiety is severe lately I don‚Äôt know how to get out of this¬†\n\ni feel you girl! i had an mri done to rule out MS. So hard to believe its just anxiety. Feel free to message me if you need to talk!\n\nDid your brain chatter ever quote on quote ‚Äúsound‚Äù like someone else saying it?? Like obviously I don‚Äôt hear it out loud but I can sometimes kinda sense that it‚Äôs like a different voice than mine almost. I‚Äôm so scared.\n\nYea all the time. I actually talked about it more in an OCD post. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/s/JZSOrg5Azy\n\nHey , I asked you a question in your DM. Thanks\n\nHello ! My symptoms are driving me crazy . Elevator feeling in chest and stomach , blurry vision but fixes with my glasses ¬†, dizziness , short term memory loss , chest pain that comes and goes ¬†, palpitations , skin itching . Tried meds and nothing has worked but only created side effects . Need helppppp\n\ndoes anyone have muscle movements? like waves in my back muscles, and intense fear?\n\nI am experiencing this for weeks now. I just cry everyday because of everything im feeling\n\nSo what did you do to recover?\n\nThis is so me. All of it.¬† Feel I'm going crazy.¬†\n\nDid your tinnitus go away completely? And Was it constant When you had it? Dealing with this symptom right now from stress/anxiety\n\nWhat about ringing in the ears?\n\nCan someone tell me if they‚Äôve experienced this? \n\nIt‚Äôs a hollow kind of contraction feeling on the left side of my chest, just below my sternum, there‚Äôs no pain, I can just feel it, it‚Äôs been bothering me a lot and I‚Äôm just trying to see if this is something anyone else has experienced before, stupidly when looking for answers it obviously came up with coronary heart disease and artery spams which (as we probably all know where this goes) leads to death and heart attacks.\n\nJust curious if anyone can relate to this sensation or symptom of anxiety?\n\nHow did you overcome  most of them\n\nHey Is it normal to litterally deal with these symptoms 24/7 like I feel like my heart pounds even if it‚Äôs not fast everyday every second and I just started getting visual snow which hasn‚Äôt passed since I got it\n\nü•∫ü•∫ such a peace of mind when I see this that I ain‚Äôt goin mad atm I‚Äôm suffering with some weird chest sensation like a cold but I don‚Äôt have a cold and it keeps setting off my anxiety and freaking me out for no reason sucks :( but I keep telling my self it‚Äôs only temporary and wil ago away¬†\n\nHealth anxiety is torture both physically and mentally. Seeing your list of symptoms definitely helps, the problem with health anxiety is we kind of already know it's anxiety but there's that voice in your head saying 'but what if'. At least for me that's the case.¬†\n\n\nAt the moment my main issue is shaking both internally and externally. Have been on propranolol for a while but have also been put on setraline now too. This latest case of severe anxiety has been going on now for about 8months, and it's certainly the hardest I've found it. I've had the internal tremors before but it's just lasting a lot longer which increases anxiety more. If I don't think about it, it kind of goes away, it's mostly in my shoulders and chest area but will get it elsewhere. Definitely seems related to muscle tension.\n\n\nAbsolutely hate it.\n\nSame. I feel less alone now.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt mind me asking how long did the vision symptoms last, currently going through all vss issues and it‚Äôs constant from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to sleep, there‚Äôs a light blob and it‚Äôs so annoying‚Ä¶\n\nSame!! I have an appointment tomorrow with my doctor again. Hopefully she refers me to a neurologist.¬† I'm afraid I have either MS or a brain tumor. So I'm freaking out. I do have crippling anxiety though so idk if it's all in my head or not. I had bloodwork done and they only found I have low iron and low vitamin D.

    "title": "A bad THC trip has left me with permanent anxiety; or, a warning for people with anxiety to not underestimate edibles",
    "body": "#Long post warning. TL;DR I had a nightmare edible trip a few years ago and it seems to have permanently affected the way I react to weed and increased my daily general anxiety. Looking for similar experiences, hoping for some explanation or a happy ending.\n\n\nTitle says it all. This incident happened about two years ago. Here's what I can remember from the trip:\n\nBackground: I smoked a lot on and off since I was in my late teens (now in my 30s). Had a brief period of hard drug use, then my wife helped me clean up my act and my life has been pretty sweet and my overall anxiety had been quite low - for the past few years, I haven't had anything stronger than a beer and some weed and generally that was fine until this incident happened. I never, ever in my life had any sort of weed-induced anxiety save for one time in high school when we got chased by the cops through a park while stoned, but an hour later we were just laughing about the experience. I do have general and social anxiety disorder but weed never amplified that, in fact it was always the opposite where weed would calm me down and mellow me out. It was like a miracle drug. I never got stuck in my own head or anything like that until this happened. This is important to note: for the months leading up to this incident, I stopped smoking daily to focus on work, usually only getting stoned on the weekends. So my tolerance had dropped.\n\n\nDrove into the city to see a movie. Hanging around outside beforehand, I took two edibles 20 minutes apart, each of which contained roughly 2g of some dispensary shit that had been mailed in to our state. They were peanut butter firecrackers. I completely fucked up the dosage and accidentally put in about ten times as much as I intended (I'm bad at math). That was my first mistake. I did not take into account the fact that I had a lower tolerance and just wanted to get ripped. So I gobbled them down and the die was cast. Someone I talked to estimated that I ingested at least 800mg of TCH. For reference, I think the dosage of most edibles these days for normal people hover around 10mg.\n\nAbout 35 min later, we were sitting in the theater when the first one kicked in almost all at once. For about 3 minutes, I was giggling and feeling good. Then I realized I was way more stoned than I expected, it was kicking in too fast, my heart was thumping, and the second one hadn't kicked in yet. So the anticipation of how much higher I was about to get started to make me uncomfortable. My only thought was the second one hasn't kicked in yet, it hasn't kicked in yet, holy shit this is going to be a lot. My hands began to tingle and I got lightheaded and all of a sudden my heartbeat and breathing seemed way too loud to be normal.\n\nI tried to calm myself by telling myself that I was in a movie theater and all I had to do was sit and distract myself with the movie, and that was when the paranoia started. I felt like everyone behind us was watching me. I started breathing really quickly and I was just about to lean over and tell my wife when the second one kicked in.\n\nJust like the first one, the second edible hit me in the head all at once like a hammer. I blasted off. For a moment, all I could do was grip the arm rests as tightly as I could and wheeze through my nose, trying to control my breathing. I started drooling and sort of foaming at the mouth like a dog. My vision exploded into a kaleidoscope of color but they weren't pleasant colors, they were hostile and unnatural alien ones that only served to reinforce the idea that I was not in a comfortable and natural place. I felt like a space monkey locked in some hateful alien zoo. The small rounded lights on the walkways seemed to me like eyes which were staring furiously at me. I lost the ability to hear things and all I could sense out of my ears was a low, deep evil droning like a ship's foghorn. I covered my ears but it didn't help so I started shaking my head furiously, whispering no, no, no. At this point my wife looked over at me to see wtf I was doing and she saw that I was tripping out. She whispered something to me but I couldn't hear her because I had lost my ability to hear or discern human words. Her voice made no sounds but her teeth scared the shit out of me. They looked like the angry teeth of a shark. She rubbed my hand and noticed I was sweating bullets.\n\nThis was the last point where I noticed anything about the movie. I sat in there for 20 or so more minutes but despite watching the screen I had no idea what was happening and I might as well been like the dude from Clockwork Orange who was brainwashed with his eyes taped open. Right after the second one kicked in, I got stuck in a mental thought loop where I could not perceive any conscious thought other than this is your last day on earth over and over again. I probably thought the phrase over a thousand times as I sat there. The Beatles song \"A Day in the Life\" played on loop in my mind, but not the nice part, the scary, dissonant crescendo part. The only words in my mind I could hear were YOU'RE DYING, YOU'RE DYING, YOU'RE DYING again and again.\n\nI had just enough of my wits left in me to realize that I was about to puke so I got up as normally as I could, wobbling and jerking, and just pretended there was nobody else in the theater as I made my way for the exit. As I walked, my vision began to fail. Black spots dotted my scope of vision and things were morphing and shifting before me. I held the handrail as tightly as I could and completely lost my frontal vision as soon as I saw the bathroom. So, the last 20 or so feet I had to walk sideways like a crab using my peripheral vision as I could no longer see out of the front, only the sides. I noticed one of the popcorn minions was watching me carefully so I had to consciously act like I wasn't a drug addled lunatic because I was terrified they'd call the cops (at the time, we lived in a non legal state).\n\nMade it to the bathroom just as the second edible peaked. I'd wager it was abound 1 to 1.5 hours after ingestion, although it felt more like 5 or 6. I stumbled into a stall and puked my guts out. I convinced myself my puke was full of blood and freaked out some more. Then I sat down on the toilet and tried to control my breathing, but every time I did I'd remember that my guts were bleeding and hyperventilate some more. I was distracted for a moment when I thought I saw a camera hidden in the stall lock and panicked some more because I thought the people in the theater were watching me on their phones through the camera in the bathroom. This sent me into a spiral so I sat on the toilet for a while burying my face in my hands and crying. At this point, I was wholly convinced of my imminent death. There was no peace with it at all, only pure, blind, primal panic. Nothing but adrenaline and the pounding of my own heart in my ears.\n\nThis period where I was alone in the movie theater bathroom was one of the worst moments of my life. I've overdosed on cocaine and opiates before, I've had severe alcohol poisoning, hell, I have had several bad trips before on both LSD and psilocybin but nothing compared to this. What I felt on those psychedelic bad trips was fear, yes, but it was more like awe and amazement to the point that made me nervous and blew my mind and my fears then were a result of my realization that I was just a teeny, little insignificant part of the universe. On an acid trip, I cried, but I also laughed and loved. Acid was scary at times but it was a good fear, the kind that makes you grow as a person. My bad weed trip, however, had no insight to offer whatsoever. There was no depth, no connectedness, no realizations, only primal, utter fear of the deepest kind that was disjointed and disharmonic. Like concentrated adrenaline and anxiety and confusion that was unrelenting, unceasing, and unyielding. I felt like a lost child in some evil and foreign place and that I would never see anyone or anything that I love ever again. Just pure fear.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes in there which felt like a few more hours, my wife texted me asking if I was okay. She realized I hadn't come back and left the theater and was waiting for me on a bench outside of the bathroom. She offered to come in and help me but I didn't want to draw more attention to myself so I somehow managed to text her and say I need to just sit in here for a minute. She waited for me out there for about another 30 minutes before telling me she wanted to come get me so she could drive us home. At some point, I thought someone was banging on my stall's door and trying to get at me. Someone screaming at me to come out right fucking now. This very well could have been a hallucination of psychosis and not a real person. I don't know. It wasn't my wife, she waited outside for me as I sent her a garbled text that I'd be out in a minute.\n\nMy vision was still severely fucked up at this point and I couldn't see very well, so she took me by the arm and guided me out. I had to take the theater steps one at a time like a little old man because I was so unsteady on my feet. Somehow we made it to the car. I don't have any recollection of this journey. I remember walking out of the theater and then suddenly I'm in my car in the passenger seat. I cried a little bit more and I begged my wife not to drive yet because I was paranoid thinking the police were watching us and would drop spike strips to run us off the road. So we sat in the car for another 20 minutes before she said fuck it and drove us home, telling me I'd be more comfy if I was tripping out in bed instead of in public. I think I passed the peak somewhere on the drive home because my vision and hearing started to come back to me, and as soon as we got into the house I descended from paranoid mania into just being super fucking stoned. I fell asleep almost immediately in my bed and I was still ripped when I woke up for work the next day.\n\nI was mentally fucked up for about two weeks after this experience. I felt semi-stoned for a solid 3 days and my memory was affected for the next 3 weeks. After a while, I tried to just laugh it off, and decided to try to smoke again. Well, it happened again, not nearly to the same degree but just enough to make me uncomfortable instead of fun-stoned. My mind just began to race and my anxieties really blew up. As soon as I took a puff, everything that had worried or troubled me that week immediately came to the front of my brain and it was all I could think about. I could no longer stand to be stoned around anyone other than my wife, as I felt they were all judging and laughing at me. So I just kinda stopped smoking. That was two years ago and every time since then that I've smoked, I'd had some degree of anxiety that made it unpleasant. I get so lost in my own head and very often spiral into a mild panic attack unless I'm at home with my wife and I can distract myself with a video game or something.\n\nI do feel like this experience has permanently affected my brain as it relates to anxiety. Despite being in a better living situation today - better job, more money, more stability - than I was when this happened, I'm way more on edge most of the time. I live in fear of another panic attack like that, because THC seems to amplify all of my deepest fears, which is insane because for 90% of my life it had the complete opposite effect. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Anyone here gone from an enjoyer of cannabis to someone who lives in complete fear of it?",

    "all_comment_text": "This is honestly sort of common. It's not permanent. You probably triggered a latent anxiety disorder or spectrum of anxiety symptoms. Do the usual things to manage anxiety disorders (Therapy, lifestyle changes, and medication if needed) and you will feel better eventually.\n\n100% this. Very often you can find a predisposition to anxiety somewhere in the family tree that you inherited. THC just sets it off. Not always the case, but for what it‚Äôs worth, anecdotally I have seen this a bunch.\n\nYep. This exactly. Took a long time to fully get past but now I‚Äôm good\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhat meds? As a bipolar patient, antidepressants are a no for me but I need anxiety relief. I was traumatized by thc too.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhat meds? As a bipolar patient, antidepressants are a no for me but I need anxiety relief. I was traumatized by thc too.\n\nYou should discuss with a doctor or psychiatrist because this will be different for everyone. It also can take some trial and error unfortunately. I don't have bipolar disorder but atenolol, hydroxyzine, and a benzodiazepene (for emergencies) work well for me in reducing severe anxiety.\n\nOh man. I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that. I always tell people that no other drug has fucked me up more than taking too much THC lol. You definitely overdosed. Thankfully overdosing in THC can‚Äôt kill you per se but can really take you on an uncomfortable and hellish ride. \n\nI accidentally took too much at a concert once and had similar symptoms. Totally thought I was losing my mind and my head would explode from my heart pounding so hard. I had panic disorder before that overdose and definitely after lol. Now I‚Äôm much better and take smaller controlled doses. I have a nice time now and it really helps me sleep/relax. However I know it‚Äôs not for everyone.\n\nYeah people downplay how powerful THC is. I can handle massive doses of psychedelics but a hit of strong weed will have me terrified. I tripped out and got a 220bpm heart rate once from just a hit of strong weed.. Nothing can really calm me down (aside from a benzodiazepine) if I'm too high from weed as well. I used to smoke a ton and then I stopped for 3 months, ever since then it's just way too strong to enjoy.\n\nAbout 15 years ago I smoked weed for the first time, which triggered a panic attack. Ever since then I‚Äôve had anxiety and panic attacks, so I really relate to this.\n\nThis sounds exactly like my situation.. except it wasnt my first time smoking. Just smoked and got in my head which turned into my first panic attack, and daily anxiety never left.\n\nI remember instant dread and depression the next few yearsüò≠üò´üò´\n\nThis is what happened to me, I‚Äôd smoked before but weed triggered my first panic attack and since then I‚Äôve never been able to smoke again without one. Luckily I was never really into weed and can happily go without but I can‚Äôt tell you how many times people have told me it‚Äôs just a me problem and not a weed problem.\n\nyep same i wish this was talked about more.\n\nMe too, people don‚Äôt understand that weed Isn‚Äôt so great for everyone‚Äôs brain chemistry.\n\nYeah well people get very defensive because the argument is that weed is perfectly safe for everyone¬†\n\nExactly. Thank you for this comment.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDid it ever get better?\n\nRead the chimp paradox, it really helped me with my anxiety.\n\nWhat meds? As a bipolar patient, antidepressants are a no for me but I need anxiety relief. I was traumatized by thc too.\n\nI used to have panic attacks before any types of drug use when i was in my teens, my dad told me its all in my head and to keep saying that.. eventually after doing what he said it went away without me noticing it.\n\nNow when i took too many edibles his advice didn't work and I struggled with panic / anxiety for 2 years before I finally said fuck it and just accepted it as a normal feeling.. and luckily it hasn't bothered me for over a year now.. crazy how strong THC is lol\n\nSame here , in 2010 I smoked weed, and had a very bad trip, panic attacks, anxiety and depression ever since.\nBefore that I used to enjoy smoking weed , but unfortunately after that experience even a tiny puff takes me to hill.\n\nThis may seem like I‚Äôm nitpicking, but it gave you **indefinite** anxiety, not **permanent**. I bring this up because if you go through life saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt fix this‚Äù it will be a self fulfilling prophecy. \n\nYou will best this. I‚Äôm not sure how or when. But it‚Äôs not permanent. \n\nPersonally, I learned my limits. The only way to learn them is the hard way I think. I know if I take too much I‚Äôll have a bad time. So I stick to low doses. I also had a conversation with my wife and let her know what was going on. No matter how much my anxiety is going on at any moment, if she says ‚Äúit is fine. You are ok.‚Äù I‚Äôll believe her. Between lower dosage and trusting her over my anxiety brain, it‚Äôs helped me relax and enjoy life a lot more.\n\nthis happened to me as well. last year i thought it would be fun to smoke for my birthday, had a horrible experience and tried everything to calm myself down, nothing worked. after that i felt very off‚Ä¶ about a month later, i finally broke and had my first panic attack. several followed over the next month after that. i have been to therapy and on medication ever since to help manage it, and it has gotten better, but its still there. sometimes i feel like i will never be the same ever again.\n\nHi! I want you to know that you should really be proud of yourself even if it‚Äôs the smallest accomplishment. I‚Äôm glad to hear you are doing a little bit better. It will get better with time and never lose hope because i promise you it will. I will pray for you i hope you start feeling like yourself againüíì\n\nyou are so kind ü•π thank you for those words. ü©µ\n\nExact the same happened to me! In december of last year i had a really bad panic attack from high THC content CBD oil then i got over it and returned to normal but 1 month later i was hit with another panic attack and then more in the following months. Now i dont deal with panic attacks anymore but im chronically anxious and hypervigilant. This is hell for sure\n\nI actually had a very very similar experience and have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks ever since. I would like to talk if that‚Äôs possible. My story is almost the exact same as yours‚Ä¶\n\nSure. I'll probably delete this post at some point (lol anxiety) but you can message me\n\nPlease keep the post up man. There is alot of people who went through very similar situations that are struggling with it as well. Myself included. I had a really bad panic attack from trying high THC content CBD oil 5 months ago and ever since then i been dealing with anxiety issues\n\nI'm glad you have yet to delete the post bc I needed to read it, in addition to the comments. I had a pure hellish and nightmarish experience two nights ago. I recently tried pot for the first time last month and only needed a couple hits per joint to feel nice and relaxed. But I didn't really like the burning sensation of smoking, so my husband suggested we make weed butter so that we could bake with the butter or just put some on toast. Well, we over did it on Saturday night with how much we put on a slice of toast. \n\nI truly thought I was having a psychotic break, and like you mentioned, I was certain it would be my last day alive bc everything about what I was experiencing was so dark, wicked, and suffocating. Luckily we were in the comfort of our own bedroom when it all kicked in, and my husband did a good job trying to calm me with breathing exercises, but I've never felt so helpless and broken in all my life. It felt like someone or something had kicked me outside my body but I was still connected somehow too, and yet had zero control. There was this feeling like someone was flicking my brain on and off to the point of my memory of who I am, my whole life, was on the verge of being erased. Every now and then, different parts of my body felt like they were on fire. I kept springing out of my husband's arms bc to be touched felt crushing and I couldn't keep myself from manically pacing and vocally spiraling. It was traumatizing. It's two days later and I'm still breaking down crying when I think of how it felt, how painful and horrifying it was. \n\nAnyway, I'm glad your post was still up bc most people regard weed as completely harmless and I really, naively I guess, thought only shrooms or other psychedelic drugs would be ones that would produce a \"tripping out\" experience (good or bad), and that weed was basically gonna always result in a relaxed or happy high and this was just not the case. I'm someone who thrives on mental peace and does much to cultivate that everyday, and this experience shook me in such a way bc it was the antithesis of peace. Like someone in the comments said, apparently, weed doesn't work well with everyone's brain chemistry. Certainly not mine.\n\nYes! I tried half a 1:1 edible (so 5mg) yesterday night because everyone swore up and down it would help my insomnia, and had the worst trip. I lost sense of reality and it felt like I was melting and like experiencing my first panic attack all over again. It got so bad I called my dad to come over and talk me down after I took some benzos. I‚Äôm still on edge thinking about it almost half a day later. I agree on leaving the post up. I‚Äôve been very embarrassed and felt very alone and even got some scolding because ‚ÄúI took too much‚Äù even though I took less than the recommended amount. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be trying it again and just take melatonin.\n\nTerrible experience. It felt great going up but it didn‚Äôt outweigh the horror of the rest of it.\n\nHi, I'm sorry I am just responding now 4 days later. I think when I first read your message I was still feeling that...heaviness...from my own experience. Kinda overwhelmed, emotionally, and I couldn't find a single word to write back. But I was sending you quiet hugs through the ether, whoever you are, wherever you are, hoping you were feeling better than I was, and recovering faster from your own experience. I was so relieved to read you had the company of your dad to assist, and simply be there so you weren't alone. I swear it's been a little over a week now since my scary night and though I've had many good moments since, I still feel like I survived something when I let my mind go back to that night, which is crazy and I hope this post never comes down. \nSending lots of wishes for you to be feeling better. ‚ô•Ô∏è \nP.s. I used to deal with bouts of insomnia in my 20s and melatonin worked for me, though I will add that over half of the handful of sleep paralysis experiences I had were during the time I took melatonin regularly. Not sure if that's just a coincidence. But I truly hope you find something that works for you.\n\nI just wanted to comment, your situation really resonated with me. I took just 10mg of edibles two days ago and had an absolutely horrific and dark experience. It still has me shaken up and I'm trying to read things like this to assure myself that it will be okay. \nThe tldr of it is I took a few gummies at a friend's suggestion (even though I dont smoke or do edibles) after my grandfather's funeral because I thought it would help relax me. \nNeedless to say as you pointedly described it was the antithesis of relaxation. I think the biggest issue is that I was not in the right head space and I currently medicate for anxiety. \nSpecifically in my state of psychosis I was fully convinced I accidentally shot myself and was dying, and that I was seeing my life flash before my eyes before I faded out. I cried and told my friend I was so scared and not ready to go. That I can't believe I ruined my wonderful life and that I wouldn't be able to marry my fiance. I begged my friend to tell her I loved her and that I was so sorry. I begged him to stay with me until I passed. \nIt just feels like I tore my soul.\n\nFirst off, I am so sorry about the passing of your grandfather and that in your grief you tried something that seems to grant relief to a good chunk of people. \nReading your experience right here and in the other comment you left made me ache for you instantly. Seeing you had this horrific experience only two days ago let's me know how vulnerable you are likely still feeling. It's a level of trauma that feels exactly like your soul is recovering. \nIt ended up taking me probably an entire week to feel all the anxiousness, shame, and depression subside, no doubt a leftover symptom from the overwhelming fear of that nightmare trip that lasted hours. I'm honestly surprised I didn't have a heart attack. \n\nJust like you, I really thought I was dying. I told my husband multiple times to please call the police if I do anything crazy, call an ambulance, get me restrained. In the whole brain flickering on and off and me losing memories of who I am, I was truly panicked that I'd hurt myself or anyone else. The whole time I'm sobbing the hardest my heart has ever cried. It felt like I was in the worst state of mourning I'd ever been in, for the loss of my life.\nI told my husband this felt like death and hell and torture all at once, and that I could see how anyone who's ever dealt with mental issues with psychotic episodes and the like, where they feel victim to their own minds, could just want it all to stop/end in their desperate need for mental peace. I felt so mentally fractured. Like you, at times I felt like I was me and someone else too. Like someone else was replacing me, though. \nAnd I remember it all so very vividly. I had one hard seltzer drink after I took the tiniest bit of butter (we should've measured but we were new at this), and I can't believe how different it was from being drunk. Despite the one drink, this was like being totally sober, but clearly tripping out on THC and remembering every detail. Which, remembering is a gift, bc it shook my soul, and I don't ever want to take a risk experiencing something like this again. \nTo feel the magnitude of that heaviness of shock and despair that I thought I had killed away the life that I fully love, very much not ready to say goodbye to anytime soon, was a wakeup call that maybe some people can smoke weed, take edibles or whatever, and for them it's relaxing and positive, but I went 40 years never having tried anything but alcohol and I don't find it's worth the risk for me to dabble in anything else. \nApologies for the long text. \nSending you big hugs as you heal from this. And happy wedding day someday to you and your fiance ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\n[deleted]\n\nAgreeing with this too. I went through a VERY traumatic weed trip about a month ago (only my second time smoking too) and I'm only just starting to lose the feeling of anxiety when I think about it.\n\nYou would be making a mistake by deleting it. I found this after searching \"edible freakout reddit\" on google, it was the first result, and everything you describe is EXACTLY what I just went through EXCEPT ON A 5MG MEANT FOR SLEEP LOL. But, mind you, my imagination is overactive even while sober, THC just sends it over the edge.\n\nAgree, please keep this up.   \nI had a similar experience from an infused pre-roll off of ONE hit (experienced smoker here) and reading your story helped me understand that my experience was similar, and real. Every time I recount my experience to friends, they all laugh it off and essentially gaslight me into thinking 'you just smoked too much! that can't happen!'\n\nGood luck to you and hopefully you will feel back to your best 'normal' you can!\n\nThis happened to me. I quit for 6 months or so because it was causing anxiety. Eventually I found myself smoking and nothing bad happened. I felt great. So I‚Äôm back to smoking on occasions but have about 20 mg of Stiizy edibles a day. Haven‚Äôt had anymore panic attacks from it. Everyone is different though.\n\nI want to add to this thread because I went through this same scenario back when I was 16 (around 2007) and had very little knowledge about what was happening and it terrified me. I tried smoking with friends because many people in my life smoked and enjoyed it. My own mother smoked to relieve anxiety, so I didn‚Äôt really give it a second thought. However the effects it had on my brain were the exact opposite. A couple friends decided to hot box their car. I took a hit and held it for a second before exhaling. The THC sent me straight into one big unrelenting, horrific panic attack. Prior to this, I had never experienced a panic attack or any kind of anxiety. But in that moment, I genuinely believed I was dying. Suddenly my perception of reality was different. The world around me looked way too real. That‚Äôs when I would feel this cold rush that traveled through my neck and up to my head, then back down again. I felt my hands shaking and my heart racing. I wanted to crawl right out of my skin. I spent the next couple hours riding out this horrible trip on my friend‚Äôs couch.\n\nThe days that followed, I felt way off. I felt the same panic lying just under the surface, waiting for the smallest thing to bring it back into full force again. It didn‚Äôt take much to send me spiraling into another panic attack, so naturally, I would. All the time. Sometimes the attacks were triggered by someone or something. Many times they would happen for no reason at all. I attempted to tiptoe through the remainder of my teens and young adulthood by avoiding anything that may trigger my anxiety. I dropped out of high school. I avoided driving. I avoided working. I avoided people. (Granted this didn‚Äôt last long because I quickly ended up having to support myself so driving, working, and human interaction were nonnegotiable.)\n\nLiving this way was extraordinarily difficult and exhausting. Honestly, it got to the point where I would just lay in my bed crying and thinking that I had irreparably altered the way my mind perceived reality. During this time in my life I didn‚Äôt have the means to see a doctor or psychiatric professional so I just raw dogged it. The panic attacks continued for months, but they did fortunately lessen in both frequency and severity. And I never made a real conscious effort to keep track, but I‚Äôd guess that it took a couple years for them to fully subside. I‚Äôm 32 now so it‚Äôs been some time since 07, but I want to stress to those that are currently dealing with this, that this experience and the residual effects won‚Äôt last forever. You will be okay and it might take some time, but you will eventually heal and get back to the person that you were before all of this.\n\nI wholeheartedly believe that THC just affects people in different ways. I‚Äôve had plenty of friends throughout my life say stuff like ‚ÄúYou should try again when you‚Äôre in a better mindset‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou just need to smoke a different strain‚Äù etc. But I‚Äôve made the decision to never use anything with THC ever again for the sake of my own mental wellbeing. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not against those that do. I support the legalization of marijuana. But I think it‚Äôs incredibly damaging to act as though it can‚Äôt do any harm. I certainly believe it can unmask some latent psychiatric disorders in people who are already predisposed. And this is something that‚Äôs extremely important to consider but not widely discussed.\n\nAnd one more thing OP, please don‚Äôt delete this post! This is such a helpful resource for others who may stumble upon it after experiencing the same thing. And hopefully they won‚Äôt feel so alone and helpless. Good luck to you on your path to regaining mental tranquility!\n\nThank you so much for sharing this man. Im also 32 and it is really comforting knowing that you went through something similar and you managed to overcome it. I never tried anything related to cannabis before and i always had anxiety problems which would mostly appear as episodes of health anxiety (hypochondria). I also have an autoimmune issue (Hashimotos hypothyroidism) that contribute to both my depression and anxiety. I read a long time about how CBD oil was helpful for both anxiety and autoimmune issues so 6 months ago i decided to give it a try. I was only able to find some high THC content CBD oil at the time so i went with it thinking that in the worst case scenario i would probably just be a bit slow or \"stoned\". Big mistake....  \n  \n When it hit me i was sent into a full blown panic attack straight away and it was the most intense and horrifying feeling of just absolute terror i ever experienced in my life. It was quite traumatic indeed. During that panic attack i started to dissociate so i felt like i was only \"halfway here\" which made things much worse. I was however still completely aware of everything that was going on and how bad i was feeling but it was horrible. During the panic attack i remembered that some studies correlated cannabis and schizophrenia and then i was 100% convinced i had messed up everything and would be locked into a psych ward for life. It is hard to put into words how frightening it was to experience that. Luckily after around 3 or 4 hours of terror i managed to calm down while laid down in my couch. \n\nI then managed to return to \"normal\" the following days and didn't had any anxiety but almost exactly 1 month later i got hit with another panic attack out of nowhere at night before bed (it wasn't as bad as the first one on THC but it was a panic attack). I was then very anxious feeling like another panic attack about to come out for a week but managed to return to normal again... Then a couple weeks later i was hit with another 2 smaller panic attacks in a short span. Months later i don't deal with panic attacks anymore but due to those panic attacks i am now chronically anxious dealing with GAD and OCD like fears of going crazy (which was the main fear i had during that traumatic THC experience). Deep down i know im not really going crazy and its just anxiety since im way too aware of myself and aware of what is going on but that whole experience of terror and panic was very traumatic and that fear stuck with me...now chronically hyper vigilant and constantly obsessing with that fear.\n\nSounds to me, that everyone commenting on their \"bad experiences\" that you people just take way too much THC at once. MICRO DOSE is key. I'm predisposed to anxiety and panic attacks per both sides of my family. THC in micro doses helps my social anxiety. I'll know I took too much if I have a panic attack. It's happened before. Listen to your body and mind, take small doses üëçüèº\n\nWhy do people post about lowering the dose or trying a different strain, when you are on a thread about quitting due to anxiety!!! Don‚Äôt get it!!! Quite selfish actually.\n\nI experienced my first panic attack from an edible in 2019. I too wasn‚Äôt right at all a couple weeks after that. I just got progressively more anxious. A few months later I had to check myself into a psych hospital. I‚Äôve never been the same since.\n\nWas it just anxiety? Hope you‚Äôre feeling better. I had a similar bad anxiety experience too\n\nI think people tend to be unaware that marijuana can cause detrimental mental health outcomes just by being well, itself. ¬†It‚Äôs a plant and very helpful yes, but weed contains at *least* 400 different chemicals while 60 of them are reacting with your nervous system upon even first consumption, and can do so permanently. Anything that alters our nervous systems and the chemicals in our brains can be chronic and lifelong. It‚Äôs just a luck of the draw and subjectively the person. The stereotype that marijuana is all natural and absolutely heaven sent needs to be re-evaluated by those uneducated or unaware. Not by assuming, I‚Äôm just hoping your comment wasn‚Äôt deflecting the properties and affects of what this plant can do to individuals on its own; highlighting anxiety itself as a root cause of negative thc induced situations may be insensitive giving misinformation. Anxiety doesn‚Äôt just muster automatically in our bodies, it‚Äôs derived from our experiences, trauma, genes, physical health, and lastly the things we consume that contain mind altering effects and chemicals.\n\nI really don‚Äôt like when people make blanket statements that weed helps people with anxiety without for this exact reason. I think people really need to qualify that statement with saying, it helps some or many people, but not all. I‚Äôm happy for those it works for, and I don‚Äôt think we should ban it because a lot of people experience genuine relief or don‚Äôt have issues with it. Some things, like having a trip sitter, managing your doses, etc can definitely help you have a better experience. \n\nBut even when doing that, it can be difficult to truly know if you‚Äôre going to be someone it helps or hurts, and the panic attacks and paranoia weed can induce were some of the most terrifying things I‚Äôve ever experienced. They were borderline traumatic for me, I thought I was having a heart attack during it, and were a major factor in what kicked off a panic disorder and obsessive cardiophobia I‚Äôm still learning to overcome years later. \n\nI‚Äôm not trying to excessively fear-monger but simply let people know that good experiences with weed aren‚Äôt universal, and that you should be cautious about taking it if you‚Äôre already in a bad mental state or don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. I admit this is partially my fault for not doing my research or preparing enough, but hearing language about it being described basically as a miracle drug for anxiety really ended up harming my mental health and setting me back.\n\nThanks for the common sense!!!\n\nI definitely didn‚Äôt read this whole thing but all I can say is edibles were the first thing to absolutely skyrocket my anxiety to an almost depersonalization effect. I was having some cancer anxiety for a few weeks and once I ate 2 edibles  an hour later I‚Äôm fully convinced I‚Äôm dying of cancer and just holding my kids crying thinking I have months left to live. Never had that problem with just smoking but after that I refuse to even touch edibles ever again\n\ni legitimately thought i was dying when i took an edible. had panic attacks daily for 3 years. it just now has went away.\n\nSame. It‚Äôs been two years now and getting better but the anxiety and depressive side effects of anxiety still get me down daily\n\nI‚Äôll be honest, these stories are the reason I‚Äôll never try weed. I‚Äôd love to be able to smoke or try an edible and just **relax**, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll react well with me. I‚Äôd rather deal with the anxiety I have now.\n\nSame. I watched a video on YouTube some years ago and though I can‚Äôt remember much from it I do remember someone in the video mentioning that not everyone has a good time on weed/edibles. They described a bad trip they had and that‚Äôs stuck with me ever since. I have a feeling that if I ever did try I would not have a good time like some do.\n\nThe crazy thing for me is, I had a good time with weed for years, then all the sudden, after a couple of bad experiences with weed and triggering anxiety and panic attacks it was like it was never enjoyable again.\n\nYes no matter what you do don‚Äôt try it! I went my whole life without ever trying it and then earlier this year at the age of 29 I tried it. I was never tempted before but was going through a hard time and decided to give it a try because it‚Äôs the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù drug. Well I had a bad trip and now dealing with GAD and other mental health issues. I never even had anxiety or panic attacks prior to this. It‚Äôs not even worth the possibility of this and I get so tired of the weed pushers on here saying just smoke for anxiety it helps more than AD. No, weed is the reason I‚Äôm even here.\n\nDon't feel bad. Same thing happened to me a year or two ago. I miss smoking with my buddies but the anxiety ain't worth it lol. Go to therapy and get some counseling done and change your life for the better homie\n\nDamn bro, the way you wrote that made it very easy to understand and relate (although I‚Äôve never taken nearly as much as you.) I hope you find some relief eventually.\n\nI can totally relate to this. Marijuana triggered a lot of DPDR for me too\n\nPart of me wishes I never smoked weed. I had a handful of unpleasant experiences over the years and stuff like this makes me think about how much it could‚Äôve contributed to my anxiety\n\nThis sounds like something from r/trees. \n\nBut brother you ate way too much, eating two grams of THC is like eating two full syringes of RSO. Most doses range from 5 to 20 MG, 2 grams is is 2,000 mg to put it in perspective for those who don‚Äôt partake.\n\nIf that ever happens again, use some CBD to help come down.\n\nWow! Thanks for the explanation of dose, I had no idea. I‚Äôm glad OP is okay, because wow!\n\nCBD cuts anxiety?\n\nYoure def not alone. I didnt take as much with you but i had a very bad trip that i think deeply affected my psyche. I dont think ill ever be truly the same again. That said, i got back on anxiety meds and have started therapy and im doing amazingly better than early this year. I hope one day i can tolerate weed again so that i can enjoy the benefits. Maybe ill never be able to tho and thats ok. I think people with anxiety need to be careful with weed. And avoid edibles too cause they last so damn long and the dosage can be fucky\n\nSame exact thing happened to me. Two years ago I took a bong rip and convinced myself I was having a heart attack/stroke/whatever, and it was so bad that I made my boyfriend drive me to the hospital. I had been a daily weed smoker up until that point, so it one of the actual worst experiences of my life. After that, when I tried to smoke I would either be fine or I would have panic attacks so bad that I would have to curl up into a ball and wait hours until I could breathe again. \nUnfortunately, I have extreme death anxiety now, and most likely never go a day without rumination, anxiety, etc. It‚Äôs manifested physically, and I‚Äôm constantly tense and waiting for ‚Äúdoom‚Äù to get to me. I feel like I lost myself completely after that, and can‚Äôt really even find joy in things anymore without the thoughts constantly in the back of my mind. \nI do think there‚Äôs some predisposition to this type of feeling, like minor anxiety from childhood etc then manifesting when something huge like this happens, and I wish I knew how to fix it. Nobody understands how serious it feels and how quickly the switch takes over. \nI‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôre going through this and I hope you and I both can overcome it. It makes me feel slightly better that I‚Äôm not alone, even though in reality it‚Äôs been extremely isolating and upsetting\n\nHow are you now? My brother is going through the same thing\n\nI used to smoke everyday until it gave me a panic attack once and now I have near constant anxiety when I'm not medicated\n\nThat happened to me but just with weed in general. I used to smoke daily but I had one bad panic attack when I smoked on a new medication and ever since I couldn‚Äôt smoke OR drink alcohol. It gives me extreme panic attacks. I don‚Äôt know why alcohol has been affected.\n\nHEY! i‚Äôve never seen someone with something so similar to me!!! smoked to much in one night and freaked out thought i was dying im sure u know the deal lol. right after that night i had my first panic attack. for the last 2 years i‚Äôve had extreme panic attacks and anxiety specifically over being around weed but over other things too. My recommendation would be to never smoke again i know it may sound rough but once it‚Äôs in your head and u smoke it will make it way worse. People say weed ‚Äúcalms‚Äù you down but everyone‚Äôs body‚Äôs react differently to things! i will pray for you i hope\nyou are doing alright. You got this!!!\n\nYeah, fortunately it's pretty easy to just not smoke weed anymore. No one is making me. If you live in fear of it, don't do it anymore.\n\nI'm sorry about your bad experience AND.... You're an amazing writer.\n\nThis happened to me with a vape. I can't smoke and I can't even have caffiene either. I'm the most sober I've been in 15 years and boy does it blow. Hope yours is just temporary!\n\nA similar thing happened to me about 7 years ago. I started back slowly seeing if I could handle it in the last year or so. It takes time but you won't always feel like this.\n\nive been on some serious roller coaster rides with edibles and extreme anxiety joined that party.... long lasting, debilitating anxeity lol\n\n  \nbut that being said, like others have mentioned, THC can trigger anxious episodes. Ive dealt with anxeity since a child and anxiety is cylical in nature. Ive had my anxiety trigger by many different things, the best thing to do, is kill that anxiety dead in its tracks. Ill take xanax for a few days, make sure the anxiety doesnt rear its ugly head and slowly taper off the xanax.\n\n  \nI deal with the 3 headed monster, anxiety, depression and OCD, they all cylical in that way. Anxious episodes are most common for me, they the hardest on my soul but easiest to manage. Depression is the least common but a bitch to manage when it starts... its not quite as debilitating as anxiety, more mild. OCD most with automated negetive thoughts.. OCD i can do decently well with meditiation and midnfullness.\n\n  \nLong story short, youll have to learn yourself and your mood disorders. they arent cureable but they are manageable.\n\nI ate a whole brownie and haven‚Äôt been the same since a few years back :(\n\nhow are you now?\n\nHi, I‚Äôm so sorry you had such a scary experience and that you‚Äôre having a hard time with anxiety. I wanted to tell you that you‚Äôre not alone and that I went through something similar a few years ago. I had a really bad experience once after a year or so of smoking a few times a month. Even though I used to question if it had been laced, I think what really happened is that it triggered an episode of anxiety and depersonalization that lasted for a few months. I looked into my family history and realized a few relatives had also had unpleasant experiences with thc and that it had also triggered some problems for them. I then decided that I wouldn‚Äôt smoke anymore for my mental health and it has been so worth it. I‚Äôve tried some cbd products and interestingly, they always tell me they have so little thc that I shouldn‚Äôt feel a thing, but even tiny amount make my body react so I‚Äôm just thinking some peoples body chemistry is a lot more sensitive to it. I spent a few years pretty terrified about being exposed again but I am now comfortable being in the vicinity of it - i just won‚Äôt let myself get hotboxed lolol. This took time and also I used my coping strategies around it like any other fear I might encounter. One thing I remember from the research I did is that there is no permanent damage or so to the body from thc. Once it‚Äôs out of your system it‚Äôs gone for good. That helped me a lot. Just to remind myself that I am okay and that nothing I me is broken or changed beyond repair. I also did a lot of research on how THC can trigger depersonalization/derealization. This might‚Äôve been the hardest part as the more one worries, the more one tends to derealization from the overwhelming anxiety. I remember feeling like I was in a dream and that nothing was real. Thankfully, this feeling did not last forever and it certainly won‚Äôt last forever with you either. Please take really good care of yourself and get help for the anxiety/derealization if you are able to. I had already been in some counseling which helped a lot but actually the one thing that really helped was a single session with a reiki healer that my family encouraged me to go to. I was so skeptical and even cried on the way there but it was incredibly worth it. I just wanted to say that it does get better and that it won‚Äôt be like this forever even if it feels like it ü´Ç\n\nDude, just get sober.¬† I know people will disagree but a person with an anxiety disorder has no business doing drugs or even alcohol.\n\nI mostly agree. I have pretty bad anxiety--although mostly under control. I've completely cut out weed and limit alcohol. I can drink 2-4 drinks in a night and be OK, but anything more than that, I get super anxious. It's just important to know how you react to these sort of things.\n\nEvery single time I have smoked weed, I get really bad anxiety. Edibles really screwed me up.\n\nI remember the first time I had edibles in Colorado. My boyfriend and I were wanting to explore the mountain areas in Denver. Before that trip, we went to Medicine Man and bought edibles. I remember eating those damn cookies. They were so small. Anyway, I got a pack that had 10 small cookies in it. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it and felt like it was tolerable, because it had been almost an hour and absolutely nothing was happening. Well, we get to the mountains and stop in a rest area to look at the beautiful waterfall. I thought it was beautiful, but then suddenly my whole body started sweating and I told Cory it was hitting too hard and we needed to leave. My god it was just the start, cause we had to drive almost an hour just to get out of the mountain areas. The entire time made me super dizzy. Mountains all blended in together and it felt like we were in a snow globe driving endlessly through the same path and getting nowhere. Everything felt over exaggerated, which sucked. \n\nThroughout this entire time, I felt like I was going to go into cardiac arrest and have a heart attack. The physical pain from it was traumatizing. I thought I was going to die. I felt pulsations happen so strongly. It was like pure animal fear. I started to think what it would be like to die and it scared me more, because it‚Äôs a real thing that happens. The thought of my consciousness waking up in a complete dark void alone and the feeling of damnation from that is just plain horrifying. I felt so stoned, like you, I could barely walk. Started crying some and screaming because of how terrified I was. It was a scream like none other that I have ever made. You would have thought I was being stabbed or something‚Ä¶ those are other thoughts that would happen. The horror of pain. Like if someone dies in a car wreck.. what would it feel like if my skull was literally smashed in.. to break my back‚Ä¶ to be stabbed‚Ä¶ or burned alive.. just really fucked up stuff I become paranoid of. I remember being paranoid of being shot by someone.. just some absolute freaky shit. I don‚Äôt know why pain and fear like that happened for myself, but it definitely traumatized me.\n\nI‚Äôve never had an edible since. I woke up paranoid as fuck. I was hugging a pillow at home in bed and still felt fucked up the next day. It was awful.. truly‚Ä¶ weed has never really been one to calm my anxiety down. For whatever reason it tends to make it worse for me. Nothing helps my anxiety go away like that. I‚Äôve had to build up my tolerance over time before. It helped when I did that of course. Usually I‚Äôd just take one puff then snub it. Even that would throw me into a panic attack at times. Especially those damn vapes, they screw me the up. It sucks, cause when it‚Äôs a good trip, weed is actually very enjoyable. I‚Äôll still never forget eating 7/10 cookies. It seriously fucked me up. I have never been that high before, nor do I ever plan to be. \n\nI eventually want to try and smoke weed again. I haven‚Äôt smoked in almost 3 years by my own choice. It‚Äôs way too scary. I have also had issues arise with my heart after the pandemic happened. I know for a fact it wasn‚Äôt weed related, but I sure can tell you it was horrifying. Pericarditis has made me realize my mortality as a human being. It totally screwed with my normal daily functions. Everything hurt. \n\nIt‚Äôs sad that it does these things to me now, because I am a musician. When I smoked and had good trips before, it really helped me with my creativity. I could literally hear music in my head that I wanted to compose and arrange for mainstream type media. This is why I desire to try again eventually. I think that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs so beautiful. Not only that, but it definitely helped me a lot when I would play piano, because it would help my whole body relax. I could play insane music. I remember learning the Volodos Turkish Marche. It‚Äôs a virtuoso piece. The feeling of accomplishment when I could play it at the fast tempo I worked it up to was phenomenal. I got to where I wanted to study what it felt like to be that relaxed while I was stoned so I could emulate that feeling anytime I sat down at the keys.\n\nI‚Äôve had my pros and cons‚Ä¶ I definitely know the cons and exactly where you are coming from. I feel like a fucked up person saying half of the things I did. Maybe I would even scare people sharing these thoughts.. and if I do I apologize. You‚Äôre not alone though. If you do want to try it again, I‚Äôd say avoid sativa. Roll you a blunt or rillo the next time you want to try. Start with one small hit. Don‚Äôt breath it in too deeply and then snub it. Wait for at least 10-15 minutes and decide if you want to try again. Build it up in increments. That‚Äôs exactly what I will have to do when I do give it a shot. I also have to take klonapin when my anxiety gets too bad. I dispose taking medicine so I made sure to always take it as needed. And when I do, I only take a small piece of the medicine. Like 1/4 of a single pill. I slap it under my tongue so it goes directly into my blood stream. Though bear in mind this is only when I‚Äôm having extreme anxiety attacks and my heart racing gets out of control and I panic. I also like to listen to water flow sounds on YouTube. Even a bathtub filling up with water is relaxing while listening underwater for some reason. \n\nI hope me sharing this helps in some way man. I‚Äôm really sorry that this has induced panic, but there are ways to help combat these situations. I even found out you can make your heart rate slow down by focusing on exhaling when breathing. The lack of oxygen will make it slow down. It‚Äôs assuring when that happens and really does help relieve the feelings of anxiety attacks when they take control. You also have to be your own guide too. Give yourself the tools when this happens. You can feel fear and easily give into it because it‚Äôs scary and who wouldn‚Äôt, or you can guide yourself through the fear you know exist and utilize the side of you that can rationalize fear itself. Fact checking helps too. When you‚Äôve had these feelings before, they were terrifying.. truly terrifying.. but they never killed you and most likely will not. It‚Äôs like having a monster with piercing eyes look at you. You know it exist and feel like it could murder you soul, but then that subconscious you create for yourself when this happens is very powerful too. It sucks when you‚Äôre rationalizing these things to someone else and no matter what you feel like they just don‚Äôt get it, because you know your body and what does and does not feel right. The one thing you can relate to more than anything is yourself.. and in those moments, that‚Äôs where it feels like you have to be your own best friend. People piss me off when they make it seem like absolutely nothing. It makes me feel like I don‚Äôt matter at all and if I did die from it they wouldn‚Äôt care. \n\nI‚Äôve had to learn to be my own best friend throughout all of these experiences.. I hope me sharing this has helped in someway.\n\nSometimes, I feel like creative minds have a tendency to get too creative and it can become a double edge sword. I hope I can smoke one day again and be able to feel like a functioning pot head. Building up that character of yourself to be your own best friend is a really helpful asset. It‚Äôs basically you creating, no.. giving yourself a very strong tool to utilize when these situations happen. You‚Äôll get to a point you feel okay, and then suddenly you are thrown back into the anxiety full blown all over again. Nobody wants to wait on you to chill out forever. Having someone there feels reassuring. I‚Äôm going to post links to the sound effects I have used to chill myself out and mentally focus on feeling okay and understand control that I want to have assertion over. I send a hand on the shoulder to you pal‚Ä¶ I really get exactly what you‚Äôre going through with this. Down to a T.\n\nI had a similar experience albeit lower dosage a few years ago. Plenty of good times but two bad trips and it's not worth playing around with anymore.\n\nSounds like what happens when I smoke flower. I never take much edibles, but this would likely happen as well if I took a ‚Äúnormal dose‚Äù. Too much anxiety and paranoia. Sorry this happened to you, sounds awful.\n\nI had a bad experience the last couple times I ate edibles. Once feeling all sorts of anxiety and resentment towards little things building up, resulting in a fight with family, the other I just had all sorts of weird things happen with my vision.\n\nBut I'm ok with flower for now.\n\nsame for me\n\nEdibles can be wayyyy too strong and on top of that it stays in your system for long time. Always consume enough CBD with your THC to not get bad effects. [Video about the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2cAFRAX3Gs&amp;pp=ygUTYmJjIGludHJhdmVub3VzIGNiZA%3D%3D), please watch whole video or dont watch it at all.\n\nI also had a bad trip and i got hit with anxiety and panic attacks. Many years later i still take sertraline every day for it. It flares up now and then but i never got rid of it anymore. I curse the day i decided to smoke too much weed, but have to deal with it now.\n\nI‚Äôve had a similar bad experience with firecrackers and I swore off the shit for several years. I dabble here and there now but it took a long time for me to come back to it comfortably and I don‚Äôt do edibles anymore.\n\nI don‚Äôt think it caused anxiety for me long term but I definitely felt the effects for a while after. I still feel like an idiot about it.\n\nYep I smoked for years smoked one night had a massive panic attack and have been dealing with horrible anxiety issues 6 years later still‚Ä¶ more people should know about this kind of thing.\n\nYeah I feel this one. I had a very bad bout of dissociation issues after. That night was the worst night of my life. I am better now but not 100% and probably never will be.\n\nI had an experience with an edible that was really scary, but nothing like what you described. Like you, I‚Äôve done a fuck ton of different drugs throughout my life. Im also in recovery from opiates and alcohol. I have smoked weed for most of my adult life as well. But until 2020, I‚Äôd never taken an edible. \n\nMy one and only experience with an edible was awful. It was truly the worst drug experience I‚Äôve ever had, which is really saying a lot for as much shit as Ive done. It made me so anxious and paranoid that I was begging my husband to take me to the hospital because I thought I was dying. But again, the whole experience was not as bad (or didn‚Äôt last as long) as what you‚Äôve described. And since then, Ive smoked weed and been just fine. I will never take an edible again, though.\n\nThis happened to me too! My worst moment that made me swear off it was in 2021 and now I smoke a few times a week. Weed really helps me with relaxation these days, which I never thought would be possible again. \n\nThe best advice I have is if you're anxious about using it, first of all you don't have to. But if you would like to try again, start small and work your way up slowly. Get high in a safe and cozy space and if a dose is too much for you then try a little lower dose next time. Smoking over edibles, if you can, is what helped me return to weed. I started only taking a few puffs of a joint at once and just learned what it felt like to be a little high instead of balls to the wall high every time. \n\nI also have been in a lot of therapy for anxiety since then and while I still have it, it is nowhere near as debilitating. So that could also contribute to why I'm more comfortable with weed now.\n\nI hope this doesn't come across as irreverent, but do you feel better ...now? After writing this? This is beautiful writing &amp; I was right there with you. I've actually been here, only I fainted- in public. Busted my lip open on concrete. People rushed over. It was a whole thing. I have a severe anxiety disorder (present prior to any experience with weed) but if I'm not careful &amp; don't consume balanced \"products\" in low doses I can spin out in that \"impending doom\", \"I'm dying\", \"I'm an abandoned child\" sort of way too.\n\nJust to say- thanks to OP for sharing - you‚Äôre definitely not alone. \n\nI used to smoke when I was young and just enjoyed it but then I had a bad experience around a bunch of strangers smoking way too much on a boat, and I believe it traumatized me for a long time. I couldn‚Äôt talk to other people about it back then and I felt like I was not normal for a long time- I think years- because it sent me into a spiral of self doubt and negative thoughts. To be honest it took a long while for me to realize the thoughts I had were just mind chatter and not necessarily reality. \n\nToday- 20 years later I don‚Äôt smoke weed anymore. From time to time I do enjoy a small vape toke of indica / or CBD type of noid. Nothing too strong. And it relaxes me- but I know I can‚Äôt take much as the mere fear that some paranoia/anxiety could be triggered stops the fun.\n\nExact same experience. I smoked quite a bit when i was a teenager and had tried a few other drugs but last year i took a few edibles (which didn‚Äôt seem like much compared to how much i used to take) and was convinced i was dying, so convinced that i ended up calling 911‚Ä¶ \n\nit was THAT bad. i was alone in my basement, my heart beating so fast and felt i couldn‚Äôt breathe. by the time paramedics showed up i was coming down a little and it shook me a little into reality, super embarrassing looking back on that BUT ever since then i haven‚Äôt been the same, i‚Äôve always had anxiety but it‚Äôs far worse now. \n\ncan say almost certainly i will not be smoking weed ever again\n\nThis happened to me as well. I was always a shy and nervous kid, and I smoked occasionally when I was around 16-18 and it was all laughs and giggles. One day I ate too much of a strong edible, and had a nightmarish panic attack that felt like an eternity. I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly, my heart was thumping out of my chest, I was hallucinating loud voices in my ears, and my mind just heavily believed that I was going to die. It felt as if my bed was engulfing me in a monstrous way. My biggest fears in life felt like they were in the front of my mind, blasted to oblivion, and those thoughts were going to cause me physical harm. Ever since then I have not been the same, and when I‚Äôve made the mistake of trying weed again, depending on how stoned I got, it‚Äôs been a similar experience as that. Either paranoia when buzzed or an attack when stoned. I cannot do weed, and my stoner brother never seems to understand why, even when I explain this to him. My anxiety has also gotten worse, and weed could have definitely had a part to play in it. I hope your anxiety chooses to quieten down, living life in fear is extremely exhausting.\n\nMan, I didn‚Äôt realize how common this is until I read through this story and similar anecdotes in the comments. I too smoked a lot, and drank a lot too in my younger days. Then all the sudden I had a couple bad experiences with getting too high, started having major panic attacks to the point where I went to the ER a few times. It was affecting me to the point where I was missing work and couldn‚Äôt function. I had to get on meds (Zoloft and Xanax , some others were tried). \n\nI can‚Äôt even drink alcohol anymore because it triggers my anxiety now too.  I totally stay away from alcohol and weed now (haven‚Äôt drank in years and probably haven‚Äôt smoked in a couple decades). I am in a much better place mentally now but neither drug is worth it to me, If I were OP I would consider dropping weed completely.\n\nThe only drug I've ever tried was marijuana. Had a bad experience as a teenager in the 1970s, never touched it again. \n\nThen about a year ago, a Psychologist strongly suggested I try Delta 8 for my anxiety. I was afraid to take it, so I got the lowest dose and pinched off a VERY tiny piece of the gummy to try it - a piece so small, it wasn't even truly chewable. \n\nIt was even worse than my teenage experience.  I literally went to bed that night hours later, fully expecting to die but also not caring if I did, because death was preferable to the hell I was in. \n\nI talked to my Psychiatrist about it, and was told that it's been known for decades that some people have THC induced psychosis, it's a very well known phenomenon.\n\nHe told me to never touch pot/edibles or even be around pot smoke, because it's dangerous for me; and he reported the Psychologist to her licensing board for practicing beyond the scope of her license, and causing patient harm in the process. \n\nIt's all legal here, so it's very easy to get any of it, but that definitely doesn't mean it's safe for everyone. \n\nI'd suggest never touching THC again, in any form. What you described wasn't anxiety, my friend. It was psychosis. It's therefore no wonder you're constantly anxious now; but with time, your anxiety will return to baseline. \n\nI'm very sorry that happened to you.\n\nWhat kind of psychologists suggests taking THC, I mean come on! Hope he got struck off!\n\nThis happened to me a few years back. The derealization stayed with me for months. Prob about 6 months total. It sucked. But it is common in people with anxiety disorders. Just try to remember that your body went through a weed induced panic attack. You are still feeling the effects of the panic attack, NOT the weed. If that makes sense. Good luck\n\nIt may take some time for your nervous system to relax again, but this is certainly not permanent. You will recover from this and return to your normal life. Fwiw I've had the most intense panic attacks while doing edibles as well...it has never been fun, it's strange to me that it doesn't affect everyone like that. Now you know you can never do edibles again. I don't smoke weed at all anymore even though I used to heavily. I don't find it enjoyable because it always makes me anxious and paranoid.\n\nIf marijuana has no haters im dead\n\nHi! I usually don‚Äôt comment I‚Äôm a lurker but your post touched me. I went through similar things to you. I was at heart an anxious person until something bad happened and I adopted this fuck it approach to life and felt no regard for my own safety. I used a lot of drugs, but mostly smoked weed. I took a break and then smoked a blunt, had no tolerance, crazy bad time like you had. And in me, that snapped me out of my fuck in approach, and from there I was anxious again. That was 4 years ago now. I spent those 4 years working on myself - therapy, exercise, meditation, all the usual junk that I never used to believe would work but it has - and now my anxiety is present but it no longer controls my life. It‚Äôs manageable. I‚Äôve been off all drugs except alcohol for most of those 4 years, only smoking occasionally. I recently started smoking again, and I don‚Äôt get that anxiety. I also used to smoke daily, now only once a week on a Friday or Saturday. Point is, the bad ‚Äòtrip‚Äô made me realise I had these issues to deal with. Was having panic attacks whenever I went in public. Couldn‚Äôt ride the bus or trains or go to gigs anymore. Felt like I wasn‚Äôt living life. So I took some time to deal with them. Now, I have a stable job, my own flat, recently went on my first plane in 5 years. All of this is still hard some days, but im still on the long road of getting there. I can also smoke again - I have a better relationship with weed, and am generally a lot happier as a person.¬†\n\nShit sucks to go through. It really does. It takes a lot of courage to overcome anxiety. You‚Äôve gotta face those fears everyday. I really empathise with you. But if you do go through with it, and face those fears, you‚Äôll find a level of health and happiness you didn‚Äôt have before. Hate to say it, but it is kind of character building. That doesn‚Äôt stop it from sucking though. Take some time off weed, focus on your healthy habits. CBT helped me massively. And remember progress ain‚Äôt linear, you will stumble along the way. But as long as the general trajectory is upwards you‚Äôre doing great.¬†\n\nWhat you guys have created is a placebo effect in your mind which has caused anxiety and panic when smoking or ingesting weed. The good thing is in the same way that you created it, you can also reverse it. The thing about reversing anxiety takes a lot of work. It's like tying shoelaces over and over and then needing to untie them all over again. So how do you reverse anxiety? That depends on you. Everyone lives in their own reality and you decide what will take it away. If you feel that there's a certain remedy that will take it away then it probably will. The second thing you can try is to stop worrying about what you can't control. Over worrying about something never leads to a solution. Realizing that there's actually nothing to worry about and distracting yourself with a different thought might help to ease your anxiety. The trick is to get yourself to stop thinking so much. Rather, it's to observe your thoughts and anxiety the same way you do with emotions. They come and go. Slowly, you'll get better at not overthinking, and slowly, you'll stop worrying about things that you have no control over. That is what anxiety is, is overthinking. Don't think about a specific thought so much, let it pass you by if it serves you no positive purpose. And lastly, to anyone reading this, I give you strength and power to overcome your anxiety. You're not meant to live in fear or worry all the time, I promise you that. Let go of the subconscious addiction of overthinking.\n\nMy brain needed this thank you\n\nIf it makes you feel better, I had a extremely bad trip on only 20mg of THC. It has been almost a year since then and I have anxiety very frequently. Before I barely had it. However, the first few months were the worst. Now it is way more manageable.\n\n[deleted]\n\nyeah man it does get better! for me, i had panic attacks for many many weeks and could barely go outside. i was also dissociating really bad and didnt feel real. however after fixing my diet and hitting the gym, everything got a little better one day at a time. id also recommend magnesium glycinate. its really good for stress relief and sleep if you struggle to get to bed early. ALSO drink a lot of water to get that stuff fully out of your system.\n\nI‚Äôm totally not advising to do it but I had the same experience a couple of times and the most recent time I went full psychosis style anxiety and it really messed me up with anxiety for days after, the crazy solution for me was I smoked a very small amount just enough to enter the stoned state and while I felt that anxiety come back on the come up I set up the TV to play some motivational and inspiring videos like Jim Carey‚Äôs speech and watching them calmed me down and I felt the anxiety go away altogether then when I was sober it was non existent. I don‚Äôt condone it but it really did help me.\n\nWE ARE THE EXACT SAME ALMOST TO A T thank you i thought i was alone i swear\n\nJust yesterday, I took way too much of one of those goddamn gummies. And I literally felt trapped in eternal darkness for like 3 solid hours (which felt like 20 mind you) it was terriblebut here goes:\n\nSorry for this long ass post. TLDR: I took too much of a dose and saw hell and tribbles.\n\nSo my girlfriend was working and I'm at home enjoying some palworld and I remembered that I had bought some of those gas station gummies at one point for me and her to try and have a good time. I opened the pack, and it was this huge gelatinous blob, and I was like, there's no way I'm supposed to eat this whole thing, so I read the directions....there were none. So thwn I checked the serving size, and it broke it down as the gummy was 4 servings. So, me being an idiot I thought, \"Well, I've been high in the past, and it never really affected me much.\" Let's do 2 servings (half the gummy). At first, I felt nothing, then about 1 hour later, just as I was preparing to go pick up my girlfriend from work, I feel it was starting to kick in. So my first thought is Fuuuuuck she's gonna kill me if I can't get there, and I didn't want to act stoned, so I was like eh I'll just drive there and ride out this high, it can't be that bad.....Boy was I in for the surprise of my life. Driving there took what seemed like roughly 4hours(it's a 10 minute drive). But I made it, park3d the car and said all right dude your fine just try and relax and breath. This did not work...of course first came the paranoia, I swore everyone in that parking lot was watching me, and of course my dumb ass parked close, so there were gaggles of people parked around me, coming and going. At this point, my gf would still not be out for another half hour. So I got out of the car hoping some fresh air may help, I remember snapping back to reality just stating blankly up at the sky. I must have looked like an absolute lunatic. So I got back in the car... somehow and decided I should get in the passenger seat because there is no way I was driving back in this state. At this point, it had literally only been 4 minutes since I got there, it felt like an eternity. So I managed to get into the passenger seat and figure I'll just lay down and take a nap. That should help, right? WRONG! As soon as I close my eyes, I'm awakened by a car door slamming, and I freak out. They must be here for me. There's no way that's just somebody doing their grocery shopping. Nope at this point I start getting all these fucked up thoughts like I'm dying, this is how I'm going to live now, the depressing anxiety just kept getting worse and time was still standing absolute standstill. I was in a really bad place, i had several different thoughts of getting out of the car and running into the woods so no one could find me. I was thinking this is the end for me, my gf will leave me, I'm gonna get arrested and l, I was an absolute wreck. Thankfully I didn't do anything too stupid, because eventually after what seemed like a decade, my gf arrived, and I confusedly stumbled through what I had done and how much of an idiot I am and yadda yadda, she just kind of laughed and said well that'll teach ya, then proceed to drive home, the only thing I remember from the drive home is that we were being followed by tribbles...yes tribblles from start trek and they were trying to follow us home to eat us....I haven't seen star trek in years, no idea where tribbles came into play, but whatever. So we're finally home, I get inside and immediately lay down, but there is no sleep to be had, nope just more paranoia and spinning, like everything was spinning and I was hot and sooooooooooooo thirsty, I could not drink enough water, I felt like I was chewing on sand, it was glorious. After about 3 hours the super high started to relinquish it's hold on my mental state and I actually didn't mind the last half of the night, I was just very calm and relaxed and then bed. Woke up this morning, and I was still high, and I had to work all day feeling like I was being watched and terrified. It's been horrible, and I would just like it to stop now. I have learn3d my lesson, no more weed Edibles for this dude, again, sorry for the long post!\n\nI've got a personal theory going on...\n\nEach time I take an edible I experience a different kind of severe anxiety I have (fear something hurting my dogs, that im bothering other people, paranoia that everyone is out to get me, etc). I believe these are like the most basic of my instincts/thought processes/motivations and that I've learned to repress addressing the fear/anxiety behind each of them. I've repressed so much, I no longer have access to this and so I'm not able to address it. So when I experience it when taking an edible, I'm able to use the coping skills and CBT techniques to get through the few hours. It's so empowering because those techniques actually work in those situations. I've been using the same techniques every single day without feeling convinced/empowered over my anxiety and I take an edible and feel amazing afterwards. \n\n This isn't the same as you because you definitely took way too much to close together, but could be something to think about\n\nCan I ask what cbt technique\n\nSuccessfully identifying my anxiety/paranoid thoughts, challenging them with facts that I can list, physically looking for facts that disprove my thoughts, busying myself with other things, grounding techniques, deep breathing techniques... very helpful\n\nHad a very similar experience on Delta 8. I'd never tried anything else before and had no clue what I was getting into. Triggered the worst panic of my life and that was followed by ongoing severe anxiety for a while. Through therapy and medication I was able to steadily improve over the next 2 years and I'm almost back to normal now. It's possible! I don't touch anything mind altering anymore. I don't even drink (not that I did much previously) because the moment I start to \"feel it\" the anxiety is triggered. Just not worth it for me. \n\nPSA: You can buy Delta 8 at any gas station or vape shop but don't underestimate it because it can really fuck you up!!\n\nI used to only get panic attacks when I was high and then some trigger flipped 15 years ago and I started having them all the time. Around that time, I ate two homemade pot brownies and they were so strong that I thought a painting on my wall was talking to me.\n\nI had a similar experience two years later when I ate a small piece of what I thought was a pot brownie and it turned out to be made with hash. The next 24 hours were hellacious. I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking, I couldn‚Äôt stop peeing. When I closed my eyes my vision swirled. Similar to you, I was a prisoner to my own mind. I didn‚Äôt know if I would live to see the morning.\n\nI smoked and did edibles after that experience but I always have anxiety. I‚Äôve stopped using weed now because I can‚Äôt enjoy it, I‚Äôm too worried about having a panic attack. It sucks, but I‚Äôm not one of those people who feel relaxed. I‚Äôm curious if my bad experiences with weed triggered my panic disorder now too.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you but you wrote it out very succinctly. It was an interesting read.\nOne of the worst experiences of my life was the first time I smoked too much weed. The panic was constant and awful. I had to hold onto the floor to ‚Äúkeep from falling ‚Äú and had the intense feeling that I couldn‚Äôt get out of a time loop. But after it passed (after a few hours) I‚Äôm not sure it really contributed to my anxiety‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs just always been high for me. I wonder if meditation might help?\n\nSimilar experience a few days ago but different circumstances leading up to it. I wrote an eight page post that I tried to post and I kept getting an error when I tried to post, so I took that as a sign that I shouldn't post it.\n\nI've had panic attacks before but while in the military and not stoned. The one the other night was the worst in my life. I got stuck in a thought loop where I figured out some secret code about death and the loop wouldn't stop until I was dead. It was fucking horrific and I'm sure I shaved a few months of my life expectancy. \n\nI learned about something called mindfulness and have been practicing it every day since. Yesterday the thoughts started creeping back in and I was able to ride them out long enough to get back to playing a video game and stop thinking based on the few days of mindfulness training I have done. It's still too early for me to know how well this will work in the future but I do believe it will help. I think alot of anxiety and panic we feel comes from self judgement and the physical things that happen in fight or flight. Mindfulness at its core teaches you to feel the physical stuff without fear or judgement and helps to retrain your brain to get out of a thought loop (ruminating). Basically controlling your mind so you can get out of the loop. \n\nDefinitely worth looking into for anyone who deals with anxiety and panic. It's not fun or healthy to have that level of anxiety and I'll try anything if it could lead to a life without anxiety. I would love to be able to smoke like I did when I was in highschool.\n\nWhile reading I could relate and re live your anxiety. I have gotten pretty bad anxiety in the past but now it's okay for me. Op don't worry, take the break. Why do something which triggers your anxiety. I remember I was not anywhere close to it after the first panic attack for 2 years\n\nSame kinda thing happened when I was 16. Marijuana still makes me anxious and I'm sober and have been for a fat minute. But the long term anxiety of it don't last that long. It'll only get better\n\ngood luck\n\nHappy ending would be that you will eventually smoke weed again as you used to without the anxiety or unpleasantness, same thing happened to me 2020, took me a bit but since early 2023 til now ive had a good run of comfortably smoking as i used to out of bongs, joints, smoke drives etc, i do avoid edibles tho\n\nSame happened to me I have no idea why it was edibles juss weed, I havent even been able to smell the smoke from it. Now I have horrible anxiety almost everyday worse when I'm in a public situation.\n\nI guess it depends on the person/circumstances. I have social anxiety and have a cookie here and there and have never had any bad anything. If anything I just end up staring at the tv and laughing at anything that moves.\n\nI had a very similar experience. I always had generalized anxiety, but never panic attacks. I had my first panic attack from a D8 edible 3 years ago. I didn‚Äôt feel right for weeks, but I eventually did feel better; enough that I tried D8 edibles again. I had a few really good times with them, then another paranoid episode/panic attack. I felt like I was losing my mind.  I haven‚Äôt been the same since, always afraid I‚Äôm going to get another panic attack. And I have had a few out of nowhere. I can‚Äôt even use CBD anymore because it seems to trigger the panic, even though it‚Äôs supposed to help anxiety. \n\nHowever, I will say that I‚Äôm getting better using the DARE method. I actually found out about it in this sub. It‚Äôs something you have to work at, but it does really help. I‚Äôm not ready to try any edibles again, though. Not sure if I ever will.\n\n100% you're not the only one, I totally can't smoke weed anymore either. Started to notice a few years ago that 9 times out of 10, smoking was putting me through the most dog shit highs. It just stopped being worth it, I'm not even interested in trying again. I'll just have a few beers every now and again and call it good\n\nYeah, about 3 years ago and it happened during the worst period of my life (up until last month) I was a heavy weed smoker thanks to my medical card, so I figured I could handle it fine. \n\nAnyway, I had a 10 mg gummy and decided to get in some \"private time\", and just when things got to feeling good that's when it hit. I kinda had symptoms like yours, I was almost blacked out but the fear of passing out in my cramped room and hitting my head kept me on my feet but my legs were like jelly. I was shaking like a leaf, my heart was pounding like crazy and I could barely talk. I swear I was having a stroke, so I called the EMT and stumbled into the living room where my mom was, and I guess in my panic I still got frustrated with her because she was worried and making my worry worse, but I told her to unlock the door for the paramedics to come in. \n\nSo according to them my blood pressure was sky high, my heart rate too. As a precaution I went to the ER and my peak passed because both were stable after I got there. In the end it turned out I had a UTI and was dehydrated. After that ordeal I tossed those edibles in the trash. I haven't messed with anything since with the exception of a puff off my vape a year and a half later which was pleasant and no side effects except me cleaning my room and giggling at dumb shit. I also had a very small piece of a  delta 8 gummy and I hardly felt anything. \n\nThat period of time I had lost my favorite uncle to cancer and my youngest nephew was killed by a distracted driver a week apart from each other. I'm the type who just buries how I feel about most things until something else triggers it. I guess that edible had unlocked everything I was avoiding in the worst way. \n\nI lost my mom last month on Mother's day and I feel like I desperately need an escape, but I assure you that it's never a good idea to smoke or take edibles while you're in a bad head space. It doesn't work out well.\n\nI'm so sorry you went through that and are still dealing with anxiety. I have anxiety for different reasons but the smallest thing can trigger a panic attack so I know how much that sucks.\n\nEdibles are just not a good idea for anyone with anxiety. Back in college, I had a similar experience with an edible that put me off of weed for years. When I finally decided to try it again, I went for a good old fashioned glass pipe rather than a bong or vape. I think this is the way to go for people like us with anxiety-- you can control how much smoke vs air you breathe in, plus you can take one puff and then stop to see how you feel, or stop if it's getting to be too much. Vapes/bongs/edibles are more concentrated, so you can take in too much very easily.\n\nI really feel for you man. Ive gone through something similar myself. The key is to keep yourself grounded and replace the negative thinking patterns with positive ones, you‚Äôll need to find a way to distract yourself or replace the line of thinking that induces the anxiety in the first place.  It‚Äôs not easy. I still struggle.\n\nIndica gummies are the only edible I can do now . Regular weed and high percent strains turned on me as well , once my heart speeds up a little I start spiralling into panic. The only indica type gummies give a great body relaxation and almost no head high .\n\nI have a friend who I used to get high with all the time but she started getting really bad anxiety. We've talked about our different experiences with weed and anxiety and I think we just approach the experience in a different way. \n\nNot saying this is going to change everything for you or whatever, but here's my experience:\n\nTHC seems to be an awareness amplifier. This is why people report \"paranoia\" on it or say their heart is beating like crazy when actually they are just becoming aware of their heartbeat to a degree they normally aren't. For me and my friend, we both become aware of an uneasy feeling in our bodies and minds, but I think the difference is what we do with that feeling/awareness. For example, when I am high, my body can feel so stiff and tight I begin to feel claustrophobic in my own skin. That can be a very anxiety-inducing experience. However, I remember that my body is not actually tighter, I just have increased awareness of the tightness. I use this as a tool to recognize and then relax tiny muscles and areas of my body I normally wouldn't even be aware of at all. In turn, this takes me from \"feeling\" tighter (even though it's an illusion - I'm just more aware of tightness that's already present) to *actually* being more relaxed. The increased awareness allows me to identify and relax subtle tension that would otherwise continue in the background. \n\nThat's a physical example but I can do something very similar with my mental state as well. \n\nDon't know if that helps but wanted to share.\n\n‚ÄúYou took too much man, too much, too much‚Äù\n-Dr. Gonzo\n\nMy first and only experience has been with thc (delta 8). I was a stupid 18 year old, my boyfriend had a cart but didn‚Äôt have the pen battery so he took a iPhone charger and cut it up so he could heat up the wax. I‚Äôd had thc at very low doses a couple times and I didn‚Äôt particularly like the way I felt but I didn‚Äôt hate it. I had a migraine and read that it could help with pain so I decided to take a hit. \n\nI inhaled, held for a couple seconds, then exhaled and immediately knew I was in for a ride. The smoke cloud that came out was way bigger than anything I had done before. I just kind of lied there for a minute and I was fine until it was immediately not fine anymore. \n\nI was panicking. I continued to panic for what felt like hours. My boyfriend was high off his ass as well but he‚Äôs better at handling things like that. I was so scared and paranoid I made him pee in a cup because I didn‚Äôt let him leave the room. \n\nAfter that night, I kind of just moved on. I will never touch another drug again. But a couple months after, something traumatic happened and my brain seemed to latch on the that experience. I had this debilitating fear that people were trying to drug me all the time. \n\nThc can be dangerous, especially for people with anxiety. It‚Äôs all chemicals that we don‚Äôt know much about and it‚Äôs one of the most common psychosis causers. You‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôve been dealing with the anxiety ever since but it gets better.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHey! I took a micro dose gummy (1.5) last night by Soul brand. I am highly convinced that gummy had all the THC from the whole container in it. I was shaking, my insides felt cold, the WORST cottonmouth, heart was beating out of my chest and my brain couldn't shut off- random thoughts and regrets kept popping up. I tried to eat something to hopefully offset the feelings/effects. I was miserable for at least 3 hours. From 1.5 mg?? Very convinced there was more than that in that gummy.¬†\n\nI see posts about this all the time in r/psychiatry. Its really common for massive doses to induce serious panic and having a long term negative effect on a person‚Äôs mental health. Dont worry though, youre not doomed. There are things you can do to get better. I would definitely recommend seeing a therapist or psychologist who specializes in helping people with anxiety. And it doesn‚Äôt hurt to have some xanax on hand to stop a panic attack if one comes on. I keep .5mg of xanax with me at all times and simply knowing i have it has kept me from having a panic attack on several occasions. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend relying on xanax for everyday use though.\n\nIn late August last year, I experienced a scary **greenout** after smoking a marijuana cig. It was only a few puffs, but it was enough to cause the most prolonged and most intense panic attack of my life.\n\nThe aftereffects did not go away the following day, and that is when I knew something was wrong. \n\nMy body became hypersensitive to every sensation. It felt as if I was experiencing the human form for the first time. Every experience was scary, intense, and all-consuming. Because of these intense sensations, I ended up in the ER four days later.\n\nIt took me a month to reconcile what was happening and begin my healing journey.\n\nI am no stranger to counseling, so this was the first leg of my journey. I needed help processing what happened, so I sought help through talk therapy, RIM therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. RIM (Regenerating Images in Memory) helped the most. \n\nIt has been seven months, and I am more than halfway to finding balance with my new body and mind. \n\nAs I understand it, anxiety alone can not cause disease (diss/ease) in the body, but it can bring any latent health issue to the service. For me, it was several health issues and past trauma that needed to be addressed and brought to balance. Health anxiety has been one of the most challenging experiences of my life and has impacted me physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. \n\nMarijuana was a form of escapism, and it wasn't until I acknowledged 'why' I felt the need to escape my life that change started to happen. I have since given up this THC and hardly drink as well.\n\nI have chosen to balance my body and rebuild our relationship through food, lifestyle changes, exercise, and mindfulness. \n\nOnce Pandora's box has been opened, there is no closing it, but you can find balance and self-acceptance. This experience happened for a reason, and until this is acknowledged, true healing cannot begin. Anxiety will continue to be heightened until the body knows the difference between a safe situation and a safe situation. Anxiety will help you build a closer relationship with your body. Much closer than most people experience, but it benefits you in the future.\n\nHad a paranoid trip last week. \n\nJust felt like death was near. Had this feeling of dread despite being in the comfort of my room.\n\nDoes anyone ever feel like their tongue slithers?\n\nTongue slithers? Check with a Dr\n\nWow i read it like 15 minutes its been rough for me with panic attacks for over 3 weeks LONG STORY anyways I hate my life for it but hear me out its just a mental thing that people put name ‚Äúpanic disorder‚Äù or smth and you will be okay it just to save you to give burst of energy to run away (to better place), I will soon quit smoking tobacco but the leaf thats only few times in my entire life and never again. I‚Äôve never wanted to go back in time as much as now. Hey atleast it was dun in the beginningüòÄ. Sleep well. Feel pain in body (something wrong‚òπÔ∏è) its just your brain triggering false alerts. Stay calm, you are still a live, so that means nothing wrong with your body. Cheersüçª\n\nWhen I was younger I made some bad decisions that put myself in a situation that could be toted as life or death. I literally thought I was going to die and I was calling out to Jesus. That was the day that I never touched weed or alcohol or vapes or pills or pharmaceuticals ever again unless it was absolutely necessary. I'd begin to experience panic attacks during school and just kind of everyday life. I couldn't figure out what was happening to me and every time I would feel like I couldn't breathe. At one point I was driving with some friends and I had to turn back around and drop them all back at their houses because I couldn't take driving at night with the bright lights. I finally ended up seeing a therapist and he explained to me that this reaction was normal considering the circumstances that I just experienced and that it was just the adrenaline coursing through my veins. After I had a counter argument for the argument of anxiety that my body was trying to propose I was able to conquer it by just a strong mind and relying on the logic and reality of the situation. Now again I never went back and ever touched anything like that again. That being said I'm not sure how to help you if you plan on continuing to use it. \n\nOne of the friends that I had at the time I had just met after moving cities when I almost got arrested at my last one for weed. His entire family were drug addicts. We would literally be riding around the city and see his homeless father cracked out on the side of the road and say what's up. His mom was in prison when I met him and when she got released she went right back to the pills. His sister had always been crazy and would basically take anything you put in front of her. He was adopted by his grandparents and his grandfather smoked weed for medical purposes (nothing wrong with that). He never touched any of that stuff in his entire life except maybe some alcohol here there and vaping. He was always trying to get me to get off of anything like that and quit doing it. I felt like God was using him to help me. As hard-headed as I am it took me having to take too many pills and feeling like I was about to die to really open my eyes. I realized that I didn't want to be like any of those crackheads in his family and I didn't want to be a loser for the rest of my life like my brother's sperm donor that beat my mom. And through him I was able to see how to enjoy life without doing any type of drugs. It was difficult before this because I had been smoking weed since I was like 11 or 12. Hope it helps bro ü§ùüí™‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI am hoping that I find some answers in this thread. My daughter has a very similiar experience so far\n\n[removed]\n\nThis content has been removed.

So when your tolerance dropped and you over did it, you learned how to do that with your body. So what you want to do is train your mind and body to relax with a tiny hit from a cigarette style bat. ONE SMALL HIT once a night when you are already comfortable. You will eventually be able to leave and go to the store comfortably, and so on and so forth. The key is BABY STEPS, don't let yourself over do it. Don't over do it.\n\ni hope so i hate leaving the house when i have thc in my system\n\nIm dealing with the anxiety part of a bad weed trip but I can't find anything solid talking about semi-permanent weed perma trips? I feel like I have been high, or not entirely \"there\", since 2 or 3 weeks ago. Never happened before. Im afraid to drive because my vision isn't normal. Then I panic all over again. Vicious cycle. Probably doesn't help that I keep smoking thinking that it will help me somehow....\n\nI smoked a mountain of weed from when I was 18 till about 28 years old. When I was 21, I had recently gotten my first apartment, completely alone from my parents and family. I also found out that my job was being outsourced to India (this was during the great recession) and I was a major pothead back then. Something happened one day in 2009 where I got high and had the worst bad trip imaginable. I'll never know if I was laced, or if I was just going through a hard time/ evolving. But I wasn't the same for many years after that bad trip. I felt like I was going to die, and had an overwhelming panic consume my entire reality. I could barely function for half a day, just pacing around in my apartment freaking out. I began to smoke less and less for several years until finally completely quitting in 2016. I cannot handle weed, even the smallest dosages. I have conquered my paranoia and anxiety over time but my 20's was a very difficult time. It's like that bad trip / panic attack unlocked something that was already inside of my psyche. And the rest of my family handles weed normally, with zero panic attacks or anxiety. This has always confused me, but it seems that I'm not meant for the Mary J. Life is life. The game's the game. I don't miss getting high or drunk. I live a completely sober lifestyle these days. If you read this entire paragraph, thank you.\n\n  \nFrankie P\n\nOne of my first experiences with weed was quite a bad bad trip. Then I didn't take any for a few years. Last year, I had a pretty stressful year, and started smoking some weed once in a while. Once, my friend gave me 2 gummies, which thought wasn't a lot since she's really tolerant compared to me so I was reallyyy high. It felt like my brain was swinging from one way to another. I could hear different things in both ear. It was really weird but I didn't have a badtrip. A few weeks later, I had a friend come over and we smoke one joint, and then another since I thought I wasn't high anymore. It went to shit from there. My hands were uncontrollable, they were shaking very intensely. I was stuck in my head, some words that don't even exist were repeating in loop and I thought this was the indicator I was dying (thought I had seen this before when I was being born, therefor it meant I was dying). So yeah I started screaming. My heartbeat was so fast, even my friend thought I was dying. Then my friend brought me to the sink to put some water in my face, and this really helped. As soon as I moved, I started to be stucked in my head again and I could hear and see the words again. Now that I think about it, it felt a bit like the other time where my brain was swinging, but this time it was swinging so hard that moving was making it wayyy worse. \n\nThen, a few weeks ago, I took half of some gummie. The people I were with took a whole one. And here we go again, everything was shaking really bad. I was trembling as if I were cold and I couldn't move too much because otherwise it woule start again. There were words again. I took a shower and it somehow helped, my girlfriend helped me and she told me I was saying stuff like \"don't move/don't do this/not in this order, otherwise it's gonna start again\".\n\nIt's so weird because it's almost always the same trip, but sometimes it's more intense then others. I think weed might not be for me. What do y'all think? I've been struggling with dosing as well. My gf thinks weed makes my anxiety pretty intense. (I don't have any dx but I'm a very anxious person)\n\nYou consumed 4 GRAMS of THC?  Are you sure that's correct? 30 MG and most people are gone.   Can't imagine 60 or more times that dose, and how insane that would feel.\n\nI had a terrible edible trip 3 years ago and had terrible anxiety,panic attacks, desrealization you name it, well I felt better my body self regulated but still have irrational thoughts tho., and last I tried a different kind of edible gummy I was like I'll just try it a tinny bite maybe like 1mg like barely anything and again same thing happened it was horrible so never again. I feel much better now I got better quicker since I knew what was happening unlike the first time.\n\nSee thing happened to me 7 years ago. I was in a bad head space smoked too much I think. I had the worst panic attack of my life, and was honestly never the same after that. Severe anxiety for the next 6 months and the generalized daily anxiety that has ebbed and flowed the years following that event. I just started taking meds that work for my anxiety, and actually smoke and took an edible for the first time in 7 years. I took a very small dose with people o trust and care about so it went pretty well. Even tried an edible by myself and it went well! I think you just have to give it time. Hope you‚Äôre doing well. Take care of yourself.\n\nEdibles and weed comedowns make me very depressed these days. I prefer to abstain\n\nI swear this is the spitting image of my experience. Smoked from age 12-21 and it was very blissful for me. Once I hit my mid twenties (I‚Äôm 27 now), I started having the same exact experiences and I can‚Äôt touch weed. I believe it has to do with your brain chemistry, aging and such. Because of course there are plenty of others who have had shifts in life, smoking their entirety of it and still smoke chronically today in their 30‚Äôs with little to no averting experiences as these, leading them to stray away. So in my opinion, baby steps if you must but don‚Äôt try increasing because your brain may be permanently affected by this. I‚Äôll only rarely take a tiny puff from a joint because my severely low tolerance warns me of that purgatory I had went through before.¬†\nEveryone told me to increase my dosage and the amount I smoke and that I‚Äôd grow a tolerance and lose anxiety. Nope. So please just do what you feel is best because thc toxicity does exist. And it can be harmful to some. Just because it‚Äôs *glorious marijuana* and everyone is obsessed with smoking doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be detrimentally negative for others. Also I‚Äôd say 95% of the people I know to be chronic smokers, can not function like eating, driving, going out in public, just basic daily activities without smoking. They can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôve said for myself I‚Äôm glad something enticed and scared me awake enough to realize that it‚Äôs not such a bad thing being a non smoker. I don‚Äôt have to worry about the addictive tendencies, debt in my wallet, or the terrifying experiences that lead me to sit in my room all day unproductively.¬† Godspeed to you my friend, I would take that experience as a revelation and sign of new beginnings.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm really glad to find similar experiences, although I wish nobody went through it. This thread helped lots, thank you.\n\nIn my case: bad calculated edibles. A bit of alcohol in the mix. I had big paranoia and hallucinations. I imagined everyone wanted to hurt me, even my own friends and now two days after still anxious af and thinking about all these horrible things weed could have done to my brain. Questioning myself, my life, my friendships, instead of my just-born anxiety. \n\nI also have family members that had bad experiences and needed treatment, but we all (me included) thought it was hard drugs they didn‚Äôt want to talk about and now I understand. Kind of felt like facing my demons in mind and flesh, but still mentally somehow in hell while my body returned. \n\nI have tried cocaine, I take xtc sometimes, and nothing ever felt like this. Bad come downs from xtc just feel like I need time to recover, rest and distract myself on my own happy world. This feels like the more I try to connect with my brain the more hostile it is with me. I‚Äôm a super deeply spiritual person, I love connecting with myself, even meditate once in a while, but now I feel I want myself to just shut up. I‚Äôm never touching weed again.\n\nTHC trip. Lmao¬†\n\nOh do shut up!\n\nI want more data- for those who have had this sorta thing happen to them, did it ever go away? How long did it take?\n\nAbout a month but things get better after a week. Just take care of yourself, plenty of vitamins, and if u feel like help try antidepressants.\n\nDamn man that doesn‚Äôt sound fun at all. I kind of get where you‚Äôre coming from though. I generally don‚Äôt like to smoke because I get very anxious and stressed out, but I took a few hits from my sister in laws bong in an attempt to numb this bad neck and shoulder pain that i‚Äôve been having. It hit me in about 5 minutes. My ears started to ring like crazy, my body went numb, and EVERY sensation that I felt was like it was magnified 100x over. Im certain that from the outside, I probably looked like a hardcore tweaker with the way that I was constantly rubbing my body to make sure that I‚Äôm conscious. Long story short, that was the worst experience I had and I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll be doing that ever again.\n\nit'll definitely go back to normal bro, I took an extreme amount of edibles my usual was around 50mg and one night i decided to take 1000mg (don't ask why) and well... I ended up having the worst panic/anxiety attack ever went to bed woke up and felt like things were alright. Next thing you know 2 days later after being sober my brother said something to me during a gaming session which sprung me into anxiety like i felt during the edible and that feeling stuck around and progressively got worse for 3 weeks, couldn't eat couldn't leave my room sleep felt almost impossible and i couldn't enjoy watching my usual shows / youtubers and constant intrusive thoughts.. I also didn't feel \"real\" if that makes sense. \n\nI ended up in the hospital for 4 days hooked up to IV's due to not being able to eat anything for weeks and I was barely getting any liquids down. they said everything was fine and the nurse gave me multiple xanax throughout the 4 days which basically knocked me out. I went home and noticed I could laugh a little while watching youtube and things started to look a little better this was week 5-6. after that things got progressively better as the months went by and a year passed, I finally felt able to enjoy things again and only had a little anxiety / panic attacks.\n\nfast fowards another year, year 2 where were at now.. I started feeling fully back to normal and I stay away from edibles. I also ended up breaking my 2 year fear of being high or drinking alcohol.. I smoke pretty often and never have issues anymore and socially drink without any either. Things will definitely return to how they were but its a process.\n\nI had a similar experience I consumed 550mg of hhc wich is slightly differnt to thc but basically the same thing I ate 2 edibles before I went to someones house hoping by the time I left and got home they would have kicked in they didn't and I waited 3 hours or so then I decided to consume another 2 I waited about 2 hours with no effects at this point i was wondering if it was a bad batch and they were weaker then explained in the description from the sight I got them from so I ate 3 more I waited again 1-2 hours the gummies I had tasted really nice and I came to the conclusion they were duds and I just gotten scammed so I consumed 4 more just eating them like regular sweets I decided to stop just incase they did hit realising it may have been a bad idea if they kick in a dew minutes later I was sick I went to make a tuna wrap and get a yogurt then it hit all at once I couldn't find any of the stuff to make a wrap I dropped the yogurt everywhere all over the carpet and smashed a bowl at this point I was out of it I realised this was a bad idea and I started to panic I was with someone at the time who was only smoking weed and wasn't taking edibles like I had so they were more sober then I was and helped me to the sofa and was asking if I was alright I was panicking and they asked if I needed a ambulance wich set a terrible tone to the whole thing because someone asking me if i needed a ambulance worried me even more then I started seeing there head floating in the air and black outlines of what looked to be stairs that would fly across the room and I'd have to follow them and move my head towards them to finish a sort of puzzle to get out of the high I had to listen to the weed to escape the weed told me to turn off the music and stand up and walk into differnt rooms otherwise I'd never get out so I was doing this for a few hours then I started panicking thinking I'm never going to get out I'm trapped for eternity thinking this is my life I'm stuck here now I go back to the sofa and I'm wobbling around and then I fall forward and whack my head against the corner of the coffee table after that I was wobbling and kept falling and couldn't walk until the next day when I woken up turns out the whole time I was imaging walking into differnt rooms and doing all these things I was just sat on the sofa but the hallucinations were so strong I didn't know the different between reality and what was fake these stairs atleast that's what I remember then looking like were getting shorter wich to me at the time was a sign I was getting closer to the high ending but it didn't I thought i was there forever with a bit of help I got to my room and got to bed but my head was bleeding from the hit when I went to bed I continued completing tasks and walking around hallucinating I also was in a peice of clothing that was a elevator and if me or anyone else opened our eyes this music that was playing would restart and so would the elevator it's random I know but that's what happened When I woken up the next day after I got some sleep I was for some reason scared of the the color white for some reason everything felt fake and weird I'm not usally someone who gets scared over things and it takes alot for something to scare me but during this experience I was terrified I thought i was immortal living forever it was horrible I don't know how to even explain alot of other things at all really there were other people trapped in time stuck forever on differnt boxes and we would trade items and give eachother things to try and escape wich didn't work Also I'm not a experienced smoker I do it now and again with friends also this was my first time getting high on edibles and I have taken what I thought were edibles before but they were duds so I was just thinking these ones were the same situation I'm saying this a day later after the experience and I'm still feeling slightly weird now also I'm not going to say my age but let's just say I'm to young to be doing stuff like this really and at first I was slightly worried if I had caused any permanent damage to my self expecially I was worried about whacking my head wich I haven't gotten checked yet but I will do but yeah I think I use to underestimate the power of cannabis as someone who only ever really smoked it It was a life changing experience for sure It hasn't made me much different from how I am now I think it's somewhat helped me appreciate things around me more but still I am worried that I have caused some soft of permanent damage due to my age and the fall if anyone wants to check out the gummies I took they were gummie worms I got on Doze zone they sell cbd and hhc for people who don't know what hhc is I'm not 100% sure my self but if you don't know I'd say Google it but if you want to get some good edibles go to there sight but let me warn you please do not take anymore than one if you are a first timer like I am expecially if you are a teenager looking to get high with his friends like I was and then making a massive mistake actually maybe don't even take one take half trust me it isn't worth it I would have rather thrown them in thr bin then even got high that day it was horrible it was torture but it's up to you.\n\nI'm still stoned right now even a day after I'm just able to function.\n\nHey! Exactly 1 year from October 16th I experienced this. I was left with what I thought was permanent anxiety and depersonalization. Today I can confidently say it's in the past and I'm 100% normal. However, I do believe this experience messed up my eyes in some way. They never really healed like I wish they did.¬†\n\nNow what helped the most is¬†\n1. A well balanced diet and stayed away from sugar, try Keto for a bit.¬†\n2. Water is the only beverage you should have, at least 1.5L a day.¬†\n3. Exercise first thing in the morning. Start slow if you're not used to it.¬†\n4. Watch the depersonalization manual on YouTube, definitely reassured me that everything was ok and will be ok and that it's only temporary.¬†\n5.(optional) I'm no preacher but coming to Jesus helped me tremendously, this is completely up to you however.¬†\n\nI‚Äôve had this since the beginning of my journey xD. Too much in wrong situations as well where I had to be very focused to get through as well. But sober I don‚Äôt get paranoia from the times I‚Äôm on it (most of the time). But on it I have a hump first hour to three of just convincing myself it‚Äôll be worth it. And then I‚Äôm sailin. Just accepted it as a comeup and yea sometimes it‚Äôs really overwelmin but I go back to the Im not the anxiety and try to sit with it\n\nI'm late to the post but I found this thread because I had a really bad trip a few days ago which I was told was impossible on weed. It too was an edible. I didn't know who I was or where I was, I kept seeing people in the room who were not there. I thought that I had killed myself and I was seeing my life flash before my eyes. I cried and told my friend who was there that I was so scared to die and I couldn't believe I would ruin my wonderful life. I said I loved him and that he didnt have to feel guilt over what happened. I just needed him to help me pass. Again I fully convinced I was dying. As I started to come out of the peak I thought I maybe had a seizure but then I started to wonder if my sense of self was acutally just a figment of my imagination and I was actually someone else. At one point I thought my brother had died and I was having a mental breakdown because someone had just told me. In the end I would say I encounted my biggest fears. Losing my friends and family and losing my life. I'm still shaken by it and I'm trying to find solace that things will get better in the coming days.\n\nI know this was a while ago but I just smoked for the first time in 2 years and this happened to me. I smoked frequently for like a year and then one day I took like 700 MG and tweaked the fuck out. It eas quite similar yo your experience I  thought my parents were banging on my door I thought that i was imagining myself being quiet and in reality I was just screaming at the top of my lungs and everyone was trying to get into my room my heart was pounding and it felt like it was in my throat so I had my hand pushed down on the top of my chest to \"keep my heart in place\". I also lived out an entire musical about like a chef living in an alley I don't know it was insane but after I had that horrendous experience I tried a couple times after that had more panic attacks and just stopped now I tried it again still no luck and honestly I'm not going to try after this I've had many a panic attack in my life hut truly nothing can compare to those because of how unsure I was of what was real. I'm aware 700mg was way too much but now even if I take a small hit of a joint I have a panic attack. Nice to know someone gets it.\n\nYeah it‚Äôs shit isn‚Äôt it! Glad you are better!\n\nWeed can turn on you.\n\nThere‚Äôs a reason why people say this about weed/edibles/THC:\n\nFirst it‚Äôs magic\nThen it‚Äôs medicine.\nThen it‚Äôs misery.\n\nGo to a psychiatrist for med manage her and get on some type of medication to stabilize your anxiety.\n\nThen cut way, way down on your weed use or try to stop.\n\n Marijuana Anonymous or SMART Recovery can help.\n\nThank you for this vivid story lol. I came here to see if anyone experienced the time loop I experienced from trying edibles the first time and you really made me feel better, and you made me laugh my azz off!\n\nHey I know exactly what your going through if you ever decide you wanna smoke again make sure you smoke indica and indica only smoking indica is a body high meaning your head has nothing to do with it so all of the anxiety and thoughts that are up in your head will stay there and you will be completely chill there‚Äôs no such thing as a bad trip on indica so if you want to I suggest trying indica before immediately assuming you can never smoke again I promise you that‚Äôs not how it works my g\n\nCame looking for a possibility as to why I could have had a bad trip. I took an indica thc edible. This wasn‚Äôt my first time but it was the first bad trip. Wondering if what I had maybe wasn‚Äôt just indica..\n\nI‚Äôm late but I ate an edible in Thailand after never trying weed before. The edible was 250mg and I have forever anxiety now. It‚Äôs only been a few weeks but I can‚Äôt even sleep. It was the worst night of my entire life. I‚Äôm constantly in a state of severe overthinking. I really hope it gets better for you üò¢\n\nFrom some reading I've found, they're finally figuring out that people process thc in two different ways, either thru front brain system of receptors or the back of the brain. They discovered it by rat experiments. Those who process thc via front brain receptors get opiate like responses, it produces relaxation and pleasure. But when it was injected into the back brain system of rats, they felt anxiety and paranoia. They think it comes down to biology and genetics. \nI hate pot, along w my sisters but my brothers love it. I experience very little joy, only slowness of thought and paranoia. I am tired of pot enthusiasts expecting everyone else to find pleasure from pot and was relieved to discover a biological explanation.\n\nI tried a THC drink before, after about an hour I started feeling really weird, like I couldn‚Äôt comprehend anything that was going on around me. Then I went into a psychosis mind loop that felt like hell. I thought I had died. I felt an overwhelming since of fear and hopelessness. I felt like I was in a coma, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt move or speak, but my boyfriend who was there with me during the whole thing said I was thrashing all over the place. I even at one point screamed so loud that I‚Äôm surprised my neighbors didn‚Äôt call the cops. Everything that was going through my head I was repeating out loud. It was truly one of the scariest and worse times of my life.¬†\n\nWow! I am really sorry you had to go through that! I can feel the discomfort and fear after reading this - I am 33 now, and over the years, there have been many visits to the ER as a result from marijuana edibles and each time it has happened, I have always promised myself - never again, yet I always end up going back to weed. Had I of been in your shoes during this experience, an ER trip would have happened and/or ambulance called as I would have been so frightened, so fair play to you being able to just get home and wait it off...\n\nOne of my experiences: In mid 2024, I made some cannabis firecrackers. This was my first time making an edible by myself. Foolishly, I didn't really pay much attention to the dosage thinking I would be fine. I put approx. 3/4 grams of decarbed weed in each cracker. Fast forward, a friend arrived at my house - he ate a full one, and then 15 mins later, I ate a half. As we both sat in my living room with The Simpsons on in the background, I noticed my friend becoming quite uncomfortable - he got up walked into my kitchen, then back into the living room and broke down in complete fear and more or less started crying. I then got up and walked to the garden and became so so anxious! My breathing felt labored, I started experiencing tunnel vision, and my heart was pounding. My friend then proceeded to vomit all over my garden in pure distress and level 100 FEAR. After a few hours, we were ok, but we didn't feel right for days..."

But good on you!!\n\nSeriously I was mentally preparing for something like that girl who picked at her legs to the point you could see her bones üò≠\n\nAs someone with Restless Leg Syndrome, I immediately figured this was going in that direction. Cause sometimes you really just wish you didn‚Äôt have to feel your legs lol\n\nThat‚Äôs what I thought. Also I‚Äôm pretty sure my restless legs are worse than I‚Äôm anxious. And my anxiety is worse than my legs are restless.\n\nI think I have restless body syndrome.\n\nI got scared, I was like ‚ÄúOh no‚Äù üò≠ until I read it all (I want to try exercising too but I‚Äôm afraid the discomfort would cause me anxiety more üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è)\n\nI thought he wanted to chop off his legs ü§™\n\nü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nAs a person who destroys my legs, my first thought was the same.\n\nKelly Ronahan has entered the chat üòÇ\n\nIt‚Äôs so funny seeing this right now because this morning my friend came upstairs from his little home gym area and he goes ‚ÄúI think doing legs is an antidepressant‚Äù\n\nExercise programs have been studied and meta analyses sometimes show they are literally more effective than antidepressants. Now granted that‚Äôs an average effect size so it doesn‚Äôt mean it will work for everyone but yes, exercise is a real and proven antidepressant\n\nEspecially once you start noticing results. It can take awhile but could be as simple as one day realizing those little 5 or 8 lb weights you started with are suddenly a breeze and you can move on to the next step.\n\nI remember one time I was working out every day and it didn‚Äôt seem like I was getting any more fit. My body wasn‚Äôt really changing. I wasn‚Äôt putting on any muscle mass and if I was it wasn‚Äôt noticeable. And I still had an apron belly (still do but I also haven‚Äôt been regularly working out for years now). Then one day I was doing tricep skull crushers which I‚Äôve always found nearly impossible to make it through and really have to dig deep to get those last couple reps out if I didn‚Äôt just give up. But all of a sudden it felt like a breeze. I was living in a bachelor basement apartment and the ceilings weren‚Äôt high enough in the living space to lift the weights so I would have to do it in the bathroom because the ceiling was just a little higher for some reason. I still had to try and avoid the vent cover for the ceiling fan because it came down low enough from the ceiling that I could hit it.\n\nAnyway the whole point of that description is that I had to stand in front of a mirror while doing it. Usually I would just face away from the mirror even though I know it‚Äôs better to look in the mirror so you can make sure you have proper form. This day for some reason I was facing the mirror and noticed not only was I suddenly able to lift the weights way easier but that my muscles while engaged were actually bigger than when I started. I just hadn‚Äôt noticed because I avoid looking in mirrors.\n\nA really sad thing I‚Äôve noticed in this sub is how reluctant people, especially those with cardiophobia, are to make their heart rates go up. Being sedentary is a lot more likely to bring about the things you‚Äôre afraid of than exercising. There is so much well validated scientific evidence out there that exercise is beneficial for managing anxiety symptoms and people just won‚Äôt do it for some reason. Will it cure you? No absolutely not, but it will give you relief overall and improve your mood AND your health. Your body and your brain are very connected, it‚Äôs kinda funny how easily we overlook that because it‚Äôs such an obvious statement.\n\nFor me it was because I thought I knew everything there is to know about the body and heart. Until I went to my therapist and they explained some things. I‚Äôm a perfectly healthy person and I IN FACT do NOT know anything about how it works üòÇ. Once I was able to wrap that around my head I now work as a mover (lots of heavy lifting and moving around). I feel that many people whom have that fear also think they know a lot but in reality they don‚Äôt\n\nIt‚Äôs a viscous circle. I don‚Äôt like the feeling of a raised heart rate during exercise because it triggers palpitations which in turn triggers my anxiety but also the after affects calms me and I‚Äôve less anxiety, it‚Äôs about finding the right exercise for you I think\n\n&gt;A really sad thing I‚Äôve noticed in this sub is how reluctant people, especially those with cardiophobia, are to make their heart rates go up.\n&gt;\n\nYes. Suggestions re: anything approximating exercise are often met with overt hostility.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1epmm9b/exercise_is_15_times_more_effective_at_reducing/\n\nFear of failure. I fear not being good enough at the work out. I‚Äôm also afraid of the discomfort and pain it‚Äôll cause me. Even though I know not doing it makes other pains I have feel worse.\n\nThere‚Äôs no real failure to be had tho! It definitely depends on your mindset. I have to adopt a ‚Äúprogress, not perfection‚Äù mindset a lot of the time, especially when it comes to exercise. One push-up is better than zero. Also, find a form of exercise you ENJOY. I do a lot of rock climbing. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs physically challenging, it‚Äôs got tons of variety, and the community is really welcoming and kind.\n\nIt could be that whole thing where you don't notice the paper cut on your finger if you just got stabbed in the eye\n\nI have never heard that üòÇbut I‚Äôll just suffer through my paper cut, thanks.\n\nI did this yesterday with triceps and chest - I totally relate to the heart palps and low grade panic attack, but yesterday I worked my muscles to EXHAUSTION (I couldn't get my top off, my arms were so wrecked.) \n\nI felt SO GOOD AND TRANQUIL. I'm sure you're right about the endorphins, but something about muscle *exhaustion* is incredibly cathartic. \n\nI love seeing these posts, thank you. I was out of the gym for two months because of a panic uptick in my day to day. This reminds me that fighting past it guarantees healing on the other side.\n\nI think maybe for me it‚Äôs even I‚Äôm exhausted through actual exercise instead of being exhausted from dealing with my mental health issues it means I‚Äôm too exhausted to obsess about my mental health issues.\n\nExercise is a godsend when I'm going through a bad bout.  The endorphins during the workout and during the 3 days of DOMS after are enough to dull any bad anxiety spell.\n\nDOMS?\n\nDelayed onset muscle soreness.  That is, the sore muscles you get 24 - 48 hours after exercise.\n\nThanks!\n\nBased on my experience, It seems to me that you don't experience terrible crippling panic attacks. Something that feels like a heart attack on daily basis. Diet and exercises work for sure, but sometimes people have no choice and have to take SSRIs and benzodiazepines. That does not negates benefits of the diet, exercise, and CBT or whatever else that could help of course.\n\ni take beta blockers!!! safe and not ssris (might go for m them anyways)\n\nSSRI should also be a kind of blocker. Though I wouldn't advise their usage cause of withdrawal symptoms (and in my experience, side effects)\n\nI‚Äôll take the side effects over suicide.\n\nNot a joke at all, after you get those effects everything will look so minuscule in comparison. (If you're suicidal, you will still contemplate suicide over the ssri side effects)\n\n\nI'm talking from experience, not like I completely made this up\n\nWhat are you even saying?! I‚Äôve also gone through the insane weeks of withdrawal with multiple anti anxiety meds (SSRI/SNRIs both) and side effects (hence switching so many times) and would do it all over again in a heartbeat. Meds saved my life.\n\nEverybody is different and many SSRIs and SNRIs come with the warning that side effects could include thoughts of suicide. Even if you never had them before. Or that they could get worse if you already have them and if that‚Äôs the case you‚Äôre supposed to get help immediately.\n\nPeople also react differently to different medication. A medication that helps someone with little to no side effects could make someone else feel like garbage without even helping their issues.\n\nGo ahead and downvote me if you all want but this is a scientific fact. Also even in the medical community pills aren‚Äôt seen as the solution for your mental health issues. If you have really bad issues you need counselling and therapy to help you. Pills will basically just be like putting on a life jacket so you don‚Äôt drown but you‚Äôre still just floating in the ocean.¬†\n\nI was on pills for a while. Three different ones over a period of years. They would make me feel sick at first and then I‚Äôd start to feel mentally a little better but every medication I‚Äôve tried just makes me feel nauseous which doesn‚Äôt help me when I‚Äôm trying to overcome my anxiety and depression so I can be active and feel useful. Instead I just feel sick and don‚Äôt want to do anything because I feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up. And eventually the pills would stop working anyway even once up to the maximum dosage. So I gave up on them and I‚Äôm trying to do continuous counselling which I‚Äôll likely be doing for the rest of my life but it‚Äôs better for me than the alternative. But if pills work for someone there‚Äôs no shame in taking them. They just don‚Äôt work for me and this dude.\n\nDo you consider yourself average if that's the case? I'm exactly average and meds don't cut it for me.\n\nAverage in what way? And how many have you tried?\n\nAverage in the sense that I don't get constant nor seldom panic attacks and they're debilitating enough for me to consider meds. I've tried heavier meds (such as haldol), benzos, and SSRIs. I had the advertised effects, but my vision had scary symptoms, as well as sex was compromised and when I was presented with different SSRIs with worse side effects I just quit and got constant nausea as a withdrawal effect.\n\nIsn't that enough for me to talk shit? I don't think so. In any case meds aren't the cure, these are an aid to the cure and are not intended for prolonged use.\nYou definitely fix shit by yourself after feeling these things on your skin. I won't get back to these meds.\n\nOh but to answer your question about average, I have had ups and downs! 10 years ago I had daily panic attacks and now I have maybe one a year. My issue is now with ruminating thoughts which is another kind of torture haha\n\nThat‚Äôs totally valid but it‚Äôs also worth noting that everyone reacts crazily differently to every med. Zoloft worked for me for 2 years then suddenly I started having awful symptoms which I couldn‚Äôt find anything online about at the time. I do question how over-prescribed some medications are without doctors FULLY explaining the risks and side effects, but I think the benefits outweigh the negatives for most people. I wish you the best in your journey!\n\nSex doesn‚Äôt matter to me when I‚Äôm suicidal.\n\nYou‚Äôre right, my life isn‚Äôt a joke and I‚Äôm very happy to be alive bc of SSRIs.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo that‚Äôs not at all a normal symptom of that class of drugs (SSRIs), but definitely an effect of long-term benzo use.\n\n\"So that‚Äôs not at all a normal symptom of that class of drugs (SSRIs).\"  \n  \nMost definitely is. Emotional blunting is a common effect of SSRIs. I experienced it myself with Effexor. She remembers what happens but there's no emotion attached to it. I remember going to my grandpa's funeral and not feeling a single thing. But at the time, that emotional blunting was helpful for me.\n\nIf you‚Äôre worried about that, taking a drug that is linked to early onset dementia is probably a bigger concern (benzodiazepines).\n\nWrong on both counts, SSRIs are well know to cause blunting, and benzos haven‚Äôt been shown to cause serious memory deficits by high quality controlled trials\n\nThey‚Äôre  (benzos) literally used in hospitals to reset bones bc of their amnesia effect. You give the drug until the person can‚Äôt remember a word you give them, snap the bone into place, and the person can‚Äôt remember. But ok.\n\nI should clarify. Benzos in typical daily anxiolytic doses don‚Äôt cause this. But yes, in high doses they are amnesic drugs\n\nYou caught the essence of what I meant\n\nWhat a funny way to say that - ‚Äúbased on my experience you don‚Äôt experience the same thing‚Äù with little to no context on how this person is actually feeling besides that being content means leg day could be the key\n\nEdit: not trying to take away from the fact that medication is HELPFUL and the key to some people‚Äôs anxiety to function however that is that makes life not totally suck. However, our feelings are OUR feelings and what‚Äôs big to someone may seem small (vice cersa) but that doesn‚Äôt take away from that‚Äôs all we know. That‚Äôs the world. Crashing down on us in whichever way that is. No one is invalidated here but everyone is validated - small victory for this guy that maybe leg day is the day he looks forward to. Small victory to you that medication is then daily thing that helps you look forward to literally anything.\n\nDouble edit: the scary parts for me about ssris is that when I started the prescription my doctor, whom I know and trust with *my life* asked me -‚Äú do you have Suicidal thoughts?‚Äù I felt so many things from the question like yes and no because what is normal to people that don‚Äôt want to exist and crawl into a joke all the time? I was honest - I told her that I don‚Äôt want to exist most of the time but I know it will always end so eventually I‚Äôll feel a slight happiness. She asked if I had a plan. J didn‚Äôt realize I had a plan until I was telling her how and why I would do it the way I would. \n\nShe looked at me and said ‚Äúif you do not or suddenly stop taking this after a long period of time, it will heighten your drive and can make you MORE irrational. This thought of how and why you would do it right now you can rationalize, but if you‚Äôre taking these for 10 years and suddenly stop you might actually do it‚Äù\n\nI tried many Ssris still after that, for many years and always thought, I‚Äôm so grateful there‚Äôs an actual human that would tell me this. Whether it‚Äôs totally true, I don‚Äôt know but it brings me some sort of stability knowing that whatever I am going through I can do on my own\n\nYeah that was a fucking absurd comment. People with severe crippling panic attacks aren‚Äôt all the exact same. Some get better without SSRIs. And the last fucking thing anxiety sufferers need is someone gatekeeping their anxiety. Comment actually makes me furious.\n\nThis sub loves to play the ‚Äúbut my anxiety is worse than yours‚Äù game based on one recommendation or comment.\n\nYeah during my Kratom withdrawal I would do so many squats trying to battle the rls!\n\ncurious¬†why¬†you¬†won't¬†try¬†ssris?\n\nGood for you. Unfortunately, going \"ham\" doesn't actually do anything for a lot of anxiety sufferers. Doing stuff like that can exacerbate someone's anxiety. Anxiety is a spectrum. What works for you won't work for someone else. Just saying.\n\nI agree with you. Whenever I go nuts working in the yard, my anxiety gets worse because it increases my cortisol. A half an hour to an hour work out helps to manage my anxiety.\n\nI used to bike a lot and felt the calmest and most at piece totally makes sense\n\nI haven‚Äôt skipped a day mountain biking in a while.  I‚Äôm getting strong and it really takes the edge off.  Also no booze for a few days.\n\nHold up. You won‚Äôt try an SSRI, but you‚Äôll smoke nicotine? üò¨\n\nI love the energy haha\n\nYou don‚Äôt need caffeine or nicotine to function.  You think you do, but you don‚Äôt.  Your addictions are saying that you have to have them, they are liars. You are on the right track with exercise.  There is no better way to keep anxiety at bay than frequent exercise.\n\nyo why do you think people run such long distances?\n\nYou definitely should end nicotine and coffee intake.\n\nEndure the withdrawal for a couple weeks and replace with an healthier alternative \n\nAnd also exercise in general should work, do what best works for you. Just remember not to create other issues while tackling this one\n\nWhen I quit Zyn, I noticed a HUGE difference.\n\nIf you aren‚Äôt completely bed ridden from anxiety and depression I feel like a solid workout routine and diet are the best foundation for your treatment for mood disorders\n\nAmen, I went into total muscle failure doing anxious Pilates last week. It was a good use of the energy, and I felt good about myself.\n\nI‚Äôm 53f with a anxiety disorder, amongst other things \nI had agri phobia (well still do in some cases) I was housebound for over a year, since my mother passed away\n Now I go for walks, until I rolled my ankle and done ligaments \nSo I thought about going to the gym, I‚Äôm just hesitant about going, I‚Äôve never been to a gym in 20 years, I wouldn‚Äôt know how to use the equipment, and I‚Äôd feel like a real dickhead\nPlus, I think I would be really sore, as I haven‚Äôt used my muscles in over a year\nHelp me please\n\nI used to have a panic disorder when I was younger and it just so happened to go away when I started long distance running. A bit hard to have a panic attack when you‚Äôre running 8 miles every other day.\n\nI love to go on long, rather fast walks. So this does speak to me. Also interesting to hear about NAC; do you have primary literature for it?\n\nIf only I had the courage to go into the fkin gym. I have infinite free time and could go at night. Yet I still have to sign contract and get membership so uhmmm yea\n\nWould love to try\n\nI used to go to the nearby trail, find a hill that was steep and then just walk up and down it until I felt like I could taste blood. It helped a lot with the internal struggle. Even better when you get home again and have some nice food to eat, then it's basically just exercise, and not en elaborate self harm scheme. It also helped me get a push to take a shower.\n\nIt's all about tricking that brain of yours.\n\nGoing for a nice long run does wonders for my mental health\n\nI always heard you jack up your testosterone by doing squats, lunges, deadlifts etc on top of the endorphin rush\n\nCardio is usually pretty good for stress\n\nI think you just jumped in too hard without a warmup. It's definitely helpful to work out, but you can do it without destroying your legs. Do a routine of hard but differing calisthenics. Do a warm up first that is cardio and stretch. Then stretch after. All the anxiety relief of exercise without that pain that stops you doing it again tomorrow\n\nBreak a leg!\n\nHardcore workouts make my anxiety worse. They keep me wired the entire day. Even when I do them early in the morning. Just walking and moderate weight training for me üò©\n\nIntense exercise is recognized as being an excellent tool for lowering anxiety. It's part of the DBT tool called TIPP (Temperature, Intense exercise, Paced breathing, Paired muscle relaxation)\n\n[TIPP skills video](https://youtu.be/fGYiaoNFOD8?si=e0vQp17c_EF7ZXaZ)\n\nlol the headline for this reminded me of an old jerry springer episode called \"i'm happy i cut my legs off\" and i was VERY worried for you until i read the rest lolol\n\nHard heavy bodybuilding and powerlifting moves, like squats, really do help as they take great concentration and release a ton of changes to your blood chemistry. Things like leg extensions can be incredibly painful, which can be quite distracting and create endorphins. I‚Äôve pushed hard in the gym for 40 years to tackle anxiety.\n\nIs buspirone a hard ssri\n\nYesterday I went for a short walk just intending to go to the corner and back but ended up walking past my apartment building on my way back and went up to the other corner and back. That already felt like a lot for me because I‚Äôm terrified to even go outside the apartment right now let alone be around other people. Luckily there was nobody else out yesterday. Too cold for them I guess.\n\nOnce I did get home I ended up just doing five bicep curls on each arm with my kettlebells and five whole pushups (told myself I‚Äôd try for six the next day) and gave up trying to get myself to do anything else.\n\nThen an hour later I had my noise cancelling headphones on listening to music dancing around in the living room like nobody was watching and that made me feel way better."

    "body": "Hi everyone. I recently met a psychiatrist who finally understood the severity of my anxiety. He has prescribed me effexor in combination with mirtazapine. For the first time in 24 years I feel calm, obsessive ruminating intrusive thoughts have been reduced 95%. I'm now feeling extremely depressed and low thinking about how difficult my life has been these last 24 years. I was experiencing full blown panic attacks day after day for 24 years. Just wondering if anyone can relate",

    "all_comment_text": "Happy to hear you‚Äôre doing better‚Ä¶. In the years you‚Äôve been struggling with anxiety did you feel an impending doom like you‚Äôll die soon kind of symptom?\n\nI definitely have, my thoughts were never consistent on what I was gonna die of. Sometimes climate change would make me scared to go outside, or a comet would smack the earth. Sometimes the internet can play huge roles in some of these intrusive thoughts.\n\nMy anxiety never made sense.  At some point I started assuming that it was fear looking for something to be afraid of, rather than something specific triggering fear.  My therapist thought that it was my brain avoiding thinking about something more painful.\n\nI can relate. Definitely fear based¬†\n\nWow you just said what I have come to realize in the last 24 hours. I think my brain is trying to find a reason to fear bc I have all these symptoms but don't really believe any of the ridiculous anxious thoughts I'm having so like you said basically looking for a reason to be afraid. How do you overcome this¬†\n\nOnce you know your anxiety is a lie, you can start addressing the symptoms instead of attempting to soothe yourself of whatever ridiculous lie it has told you.  Practice grounding techniques, breathing, self care, etc.\n\nMakes sense.¬† Thank you¬†\n\nMine is linked with a loss of a loved one few months back but the thoughts arised a month ago and it‚Äôs been really uncomfortable always thinking I‚Äôm gonna die, just don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôll take to get better\n\nLiterally same thing I‚Äôm going through i feel like I‚Äôm going mad trying to tell myself it‚Äôs just anxiety but it‚Äôs so exhausting.\n\nGlad to hear that you‚Äôre finding some relief. Chronic panic feeling is absolutely life crushing. Fingers crossed on continued improvement.\n\nMy psychiatrist gave me propranolol and rexulti and it has stoped my panic attacks. I still have very bad anxiety but I‚Äôm so thankful that the attacks ended\n\nI take those two meds too and they are amazingly effective in my case as well.\n\nEffexor + Mirtazapine combo is known as California rocket fuel:)\n\nY\n\nI can't imagine the relief. Congratulations!\n\nHah, similar experience. 15 years, here. I've gone through so many doctors. I was having a bad series of attacks and met with my latest one and said \"I've been panicking for five days straight\" and he put me on Klonopin instead of nightly lorazepam. I can actually feel the triggers that used to set me off, I'm stressed and worried and anxious about things, but it doesn't cause a panic attack. It's just normal, garden variety stress. It's incredible.\n\n\nIt's a low dose and we will move to another med after I've been stable for a while.\n\nWhy move to another med once stabilized?  Why not stay with what works?\n\nLong term daily benzo use is a bad idea. Tolerance builds up and then you wind up physically dependant on a drug that's not working as well as it did and is incredibly hard to get off of.\n\n\nI am prescribed ativan and klonopin for my anxiety but only a max of 3 doses a week. I took them 3-4 times a day for a couple weeks while I was getting stabilized on other meds and then weaned down to use for panic attacks only. Some weeks I don't need any and other weeks I max out.\n\nwhen I finally went on effexor at age 27 I wondered why I didn't seek help before that. From as early as I cud remember I couldn't go to sleep like a regular kid because I was afraid I wouldn't wake up. I didn't kno wat was going to be the cause of death but something would take me. that more or less continued until I was 27 so I can relate\n\nI just made a post asking for an experience like this. Thank you.\n\nFeeling depressed because of meds? Or that it took so long to find something that worked?\n\nhappy to hear this i‚Äôm next on the list to be healed\n\nI take mirttazapine and my anxiety is pretty much non existent anymore üòä\n\nYikes. I‚Äôm sorry it wasn‚Äôt taken seriously. I‚Äôm really so sorry.¬†\n\nThank you!\n\nI wonder if you have PTSD‚Ä¶. \nThat must have been so difficult for your mind, body and spirit. You‚Äôre poor nervous system. Maybe get your vitamin levels checked by a good functional doctor so you know your body has what you really need to heal.\n\nI'm glad you have relief for your anxiety, thank goodness for that. I believe anxiety and panic disorder to be one of the most difficult mental health disorders to deal with. \n\nYour work is not done, you have medications which has taken the edge off but you need to look at therapy now. I'd encourage you to join group therapy and 1x1 therapy. \n\nYou got this, OP.\n\nEvery time medication is mentioned in this sub, some try to turn people away from it. And it's fucking sad because they may be preventing others from getting the help they need in order to lead a more normal life.\n\nWhile people should be aware of potential issues with medication, that's something you should be discussing with your doctor. I really wish this sub would ban such comments that may prevent others from at least taking to their doctors about medication. Far too often it's hurtful, rather than helpful. Imagine if we allowed people to adamantly discourage others from getting cancer treatment because of the potential side effects.\n\nExcellent point. Meds get such a bad hammering, especially on online platforms. Big pharma profiting off our misery etc. Psychiatrist medications are saving lives everyday. It saved my life!\n\nwhen you say feeling depressed now, do you just mean it in the \"emotion\" sense like low mood rather than like clinically? considering effexor is an anti-depressant.. bc if you do just mean the emotion then yeah, that's understandable, very similar to how many folks w adhd feel once finally medicated when you realise that's what's been missing your whole life! i'm so glad you found a solution that works for you! is it generalised anxiety you've got or?\n\nI'm worried about seeing a doctor and them prescribing drugs for me. May I know if there are any major side effects of the drugs?\n\nI'm keen on knowing too\n\nCan it get worse. At some point you reach that conclusion and are willing to try anything. There are side effects to any drug\n\nCongrats! Anxiety is the worst thing ever.\n\nI‚Äôm so happy that the new medicine helps!! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYes. I was hospitalized for 10 days because of panic (and another med making me sick)\n\nI was on Effexor for 19 years, they added Mirtazipine. First night 7.5mg, not much difference. Second night 15mg, that definitely did something.\n\nIt increases appetite considerably however. If you notice that (and you probably should have if it will happen to you, i remember waking up the next morning feeling like i could eat a horse) try to make better food choices to deal with it if you aren't already on a good diet.\n\nSame combo I take. It‚Äôs brought the intrusive thoughts and existential dread to a tolerable level. Not gone but I just don‚Äôt care about it anymore\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that.\n\nYAY!!ü•≥üéâüíï\n\nI can certainly understand the constant panic attacks. I had 30% of my left lung collapse when I was around 19 or 20. It was called a spontaneous pneumothorax. I was in excellent health and never had anything serious happen health wise before. I was in the hospital for 4 days with a chest tube the diameter of a dime in my side between my ribs draining the fluid that was trapped Between my chest wall and my lung. After 4 days they pulled out the chest tube stitched up the hole and sent me home. I was fine for maybe 3ish days and the panic attacks started. I was just watching a movie at my folks house when this horrible feeling came over me I started sweating my heart started pounding I felt like I couldn't breathe. I quickly got up off the couch not knowing what was happening or what to do. I took only a few steps and felt like I was definitely going to die or pass out so had to just lay on the floor face down. Unfortunately there was no passing out just sweating and feeling the the worst feeling I've ever felt while trying to explain to my folks and girlfriend what was currently happening to me. The only thing I¬† was actually able to say was I needed cold water and a fan blowing on me and that I couldn't move. These episodes went on at least 10 times a day for about 2 weeks till I could see a doctor. Finally I had my appointment and was prescribed celexa. They said it would take a couple weeks before I would notice a difference, which to me at the time was like a death sentence. I had already been dealing with it for a couple weeks...oh of course I hadn't been able to go back to work since my lung collapsed. So two more weeks seemed impossible. I had no choice of course. I started taking the med and dealt with the constant panic attacks for about 8 days. On the ninth day I got up and felt like a new person. I was waiting for the attacks but they never came. I was all better.\n¬† ¬† ¬†I'm 45 yrs old now. I still take the same medicine, over time I have had to increase my dose a couple times to stay on top of it but I have never had another attack like the ones I was having.¬†\n¬† ¬†I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. I don't know how you made it so long before being able to find the help you needed, but not only were you able to survive that long but you also finally did get the problem fixed. You are doing what you can with what your given. I don't know much about depression but I do understand how it feels to be depressed and I can see the situation it has you in. I don't have advice for you for the past or for your future but from what you have shared with us in you question I can tell how strong willed you must certainly be. That kind of strength wasn't wasted on you my friend. You got this.üß°\n\nCurious, what medication had you tried before?\n\nCymbalta(twice), lexapro(3 times), Zoloft, Trintellix, Propranolol, Xanax, seroquel\n\nI'm glad this combo is working for you. It wasn't good for me.\n\nIs mitrazapin really that effective cuz I still haven't used it yet, my psychiatrist prescribed me mitrazapin for my insomnia along with Zoloft\n\nAny issues with the drugs you‚Äôre taking?\n\nStuff like this makes me hate Docters, they needed 24 years to help you out and subscribe some meds. What a bunch of random people they are.\n\na prescriber who listens and understands FTW!! I‚Äôm really happy for you OP. That said, I completely relate to the reality check it sounds like you‚Äôre currently experiencing. If you‚Äôre not already in therapy, please look into it. In addition, reach out to your prescriber ASAP regarding the depression you‚Äôre experiencing in the aftermath. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs normal and understandable (I‚Äôve been going through something similar) and your prescriber *should* be the first checkpoint in navigating your recovery journey.\n\nSo I‚Äôve been dealing with this going on 5 years. Seems to hit me in cycles with very few days of relief in between. My primary put me on Zoloft which I had a very bad reaction to, so we changed to lexapro, I got up to 10mg which the doc told me is not addictive, it helped but not side effect free and not 100% but everything I read was it‚Äôs best to check into treatment if you want to get off. anybody have any thoughts?\n\nI‚Äôm in the process of learning what life is like without being in fight or flight mode. Best we (therapist and I) could tell, last year at the age of 24 was the first time I‚Äôd experience not being in fight/flight since one month of age. I had open abdominal surgery when I was a month old without pain management or anesthesia. It screwed my nervous system up badly. It was I think last July when I finally experienced a level of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù feeling and it was so weird that I was actually having panic attacks because it felt weird‚Ä¶ they‚Äôve pretty much stopped now, but for 3 months I‚Äôd feel wonderfully calm and then start freaking out because I was able to notice more sensations and ‚Äúfeel‚Äù more in general.¬†\n\nSorry to hear you have been dealing with anxiety for 24 years... wow. I've had MDD and GAD for only 4 years and it's been hell. The trial and error of finding the meds that works best is grueling. Every 3 or 4 months, I'll have a very good day (out of the blue) where I feel great. I then spend the entire day looking back at how really sick I was and all of the things I missed out with family and friends, so it basically ruins the one good day I have! I'm new to Reddit, but I find that reading other comments let's me know that I am not the only one dealing with this and there are others that are worse off than me. I try to put it in perspective. Sorry, I didn't mean to turn this into a story about me. I just wanted you to know that I can totally relate. I am very happy for you in that you finally found something that works!!\n\nYea, I‚Äôm currently going through this for the past 3 years straight. Little back story, about 5 years ago I was getting bad panic attacks before that but they would last normal lengths. Went and got help and after a few med trials, they reluctantly put me on lorazepam. I took them as prescribed, didn‚Äôt abuse them, never took more than I was supposed to, etc. I reached a point where everything was going great and I felt I didn‚Äôt need them anymore. So I took myself off them. I stopped getting them prescribed and was off them for over a year. Fast forward - my 52 year old mother died unexpectedly, my fianc√©e with whom I had a 2 year old child and thought things were going great cheated on me and life as I knew it fell apart. I started getting panic attacks that would literally last days and not go away. So I went and tried to get help again. It‚Äôs now been 3 years of them prescribing me different medication, increasing dosages, and jumping through all these hoops. Nothing works. I live in perpetual fear and get panic attacks about having a panic attack. I have built up a successful career and literally everything is about to fall apart. No matter how truthful and how much I‚Äôve opened up to doctors or psychiatrist, they refuse to give me the only thing that helped. I understand the long term affects and the risks involved but the thing is - if I can live a normal quality life and continue raising my kids to help them succeed in their futures..I don‚Äôt care if I deal with dementia or other issues when I‚Äôm older. The sad part is the doctors have seen the physical toll it‚Äôs taken on me. I‚Äôve dropped like 20 pounds, I look like a wreck, they see my high blood pressure and constantly having to have the nurse walk out of the room to get my average and it‚Äôs like no one cares. I finally had a new appointment with a psychiatrist on the 23rd and that was helping me keep it together. I was originally misdiagnosed with general anxiety disorder when in fact what I have is a panic disorder. Lo and behold within the first 15 minutes(I didn‚Äôt even bring up the benzos yet) he talked about how against benzos he is and gave me the usual rant doctors give pertaining to them. I have now lost all hope. I have tried atleast 15 different medications at varying dosages and nothing works. I am at the end of my rope. I have been completely honest with everyone and spoken to crisis counselors, therapist, literally everything‚Äôs I‚Äôve jumped through all their hoops and nothing I do is good enough. I don‚Äôt understand what it takes to qualify a person for benzos. I mean there has been people on them for decades and I can‚Äôt even get temporary help. I am days away from giving up and ending it, like literally, and it just doesn‚Äôt matter to anyone. I‚Äôm glad you found your relief and I hope others don‚Äôt have experiences like mine. I am done fighting and I just can‚Äôt take it anymore\n\nSo, what you are saying is that you are no longer having panic attacks, but are now severely depressed?\n\nI‚Äôm so happy for you! I‚Äôm struggling with the same thing at 22 I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy my doctor prescribed me something but I‚Äôve been too scared to take it.\n\n[removed]\n\nI tried everything to manage my anxiety. Exercise, meditation, diet, yoga, therapy, breathing. I'll check out Shaan Kassam though. Thanks for the advice\n\nDon‚Äôt. If the med is helping then stay on the med."

Be well, at your own pace.\n\nThanks, a positive comment always helps-no matter what.\n\nThank You.\n\nWhat a very kind, supportive post...Thank You!!!  ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§\n\nThose are things I wanna hear from people I know. Kinda words I need too. So I thought I should throw em here. Wc.\n\nThank you! I'm ok right now but last week was terrible. I had a couple bad breaks with anxiety on sunday amd monday and last week was pretty much a depression week (wednesday afternoon and weekend was better). I have an appointment today and we're going to duscuss medication\n\nHope the meds treat you well. Glad you're okay now. You can take a screenshot if you ever need this post again. üôÉ\n\nThanks! Not sure whether or not we'll actually try medication (honestly I'm not entirely sure in which stage of anxiety they come in). All I know is I've been anxious on/off for about 15ish years now and the worst of it is pretty unbearable. It feels like there's also some depression on the side there but I'm not sure if it's normal depression or mental illness depression. I'm overall really confused about this entire thing sometimes since I've been like this since forever and I have no clue if it's normal or not. I just don't have the strenght to be like this forever anymore\n\nHow have you been coping all these years?\n\nIt's pretty much been constant worrying and catastrophizing about things, intense stress about school, work, money, state of the world etc., fear of making mistakes and being overly critical of my self, really bad self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness and feelings of depression that can take me to pretty dark places. I'm still here so I guess it's a life, just not very enjoyable one\n\nYeah most time they go together depression and anxiety. Hey, you'll get better. Also find a therapist. Not saying all that works, but at least you're looking for help.\n\nI'm glad I contacted the public mental health services in my city. I've heard that my wife's friend's boyfriend went there with depression and he got into proper psychotherapy. I've been in student healthcare with this from fall to spring and it didn't go anywhere. I believe it's because I'm doing really well with grades and that's really all the university cares about\n\nThank you, very heart warming! &lt;3\n\nThank you &lt;3\n\nThank you! It‚Äôs my birthday today and I‚Äôm panicking about leaving my house to see my friends next week ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWhy not let them visit you instead? Your territory.\n\nThey live a few hours away so we‚Äôre kind of meeting in the middle for a weekend, very excited, very anxious!\n\nWell-intended but I don't agree the world's fuckd up. This is the sort of thinking that leads a lot of people to experience anxiety and depression. There is a lot of good things in the world so let's remember that too.¬†\n\nLots of good things in the world. Thank you for the reminder. I need to be better at recognizing the good things :)\n\nThank you ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWas feeling  panicked about life &amp; how out of control &amp; expensive being alive is.\n\nSometimes this is all I need. Just the reminder that what I‚Äôm going through will pass. ‚ÄúIm okay. Im safe. I can keep moving forward.‚Äù\n\nI guess it's just my day to read posts and cry. Thank you for posting that.\n\nlast time i \"made it through before\", everything fell apart even more lol, so no, not doing that again\n\nThank you\n\nthank you i really really needed that. my worries came back and now it's heart related problems even though im perfectly healthy and young, in fact it's funny because they were the first thing i worried about and now it's the latest, like a cycle lol. i just needed a reminder it'll be fine, thank you\n\nthank you so much for this\n\nI need this today. I have actually needed this the last 2 months as my anxiety has been so high I can barely function most days and have cut my days at work short over it. The last 3 weeks has been especially bad between being sick with whatever is going around making me think death and my grandparents both finding out they have cancer around the same time.\n\nCurrently having a really bad anxiety attack.

    "body": "Today I taught my monthly crafting workshop. I‚Äôve taught over a dozen of these courses and they usually consist of about 15-18 really excited and awesome students who are paying customers and excited to learn. From me! \n\nNaturally I‚Äôm a little nervous during introduction but become much more comfortable as class goes on. But today I had a full on freak out in front of my entire class. \n\nAs I was about 2 minutes in, suddenly my heart began to race, I became disoriented and could barely speak. I could feel the walls closing in on me and felt like I was about to pass out as my entire class watched all of the confidence leave my body. I had to stop and visibly compose myself. I felt like I was going to pass out and wanted to run away and hide, and come back out when I was calm.\n\nI apologized to my class, was honest about being abnormally nervous today and really generally anxious. I kept my head down with shame as I could barely muster the courage to face them all while I spiraled into the abyss. After what felt like an eternity I was able to compose myself and carry on with class.\n\nClass actually recovered just fine. Everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves and were excited to talk with me and take photos after class. But I cannot help but feel mortified. I had lots of new students, my coworker was there, my hair dresser was present, family friends I haven‚Äôt seen in years all came to support and take my class. I feel like I failed them and am terrified this will happen again for nexts months workshop.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note my anxiety levels in general have been at an all time high over the last few weeks. I rarely get acne but my skin is breaking out in such a manner that I really feel it‚Äôs starting to take a toll on me physically. I am quite overworked and spread thin these days. Which I also shared with class during my episode and now I feel stupid for telling them that. Like why?!\n\nI want to forget this ever happened! I hope being vulnerable humanized me but I am absolutely humiliated. ",

    "all_comment_text": "I don't know if this helps at all, but I just want to say: if I were in a crafting class and this happened to the teacher, and they handled it the way you did, not only would I like them so much more because I could relate to them, but I would also feel incredible respect for them for just living their life, teaching classes and being unapologetic about having anxiety. For taking a moment during class, being honest about  having a panic attack, getting through it and finishing the rest of the class where they taught me how to do cool craft stuff. It would make me feel hopeful, to see someone succeeding and not letting panic hold them back. It would make me feel inspired, like maybe I could do that too.\n\nSuch a thoughtful response, wonderfully put, I‚Äôll add, never be ashamed of who you are. The person you described is brave, honest and caring, vulnerability is not a weakness. You had a truly human moment, any person in that room that would think ill of you, do not deserve your time.\n\nYes I absolutely agree with this. If anyone in your class ever feels this way, they are very likely to speak to you about it first, knowing that you too have 'been there'. \n\nUnfortunately I too have suffered panic attacks many a time in public places and once in front of a class that I hadn't met before, I didn't have my assistance dog with me and I thought I could do it alone. Anyway, the point is, I have experienced similar panics and as much as I'd like to say that it wont happen again or that you wont feel this way after the next one, I would be lying. What I can say is that, it gets easier to recognise these things coming ahead of time, sitting down so that you don't collapse and being able to communicate before the attack gets too difficult.\n\nI understand the shame that comes with the panics; but you got back up, you carried on and showed so much strength that you should be (and I'm sure your class is) very proud. If this is happening more regularly though, you might be wise to speak to your doctor, medication could be an option for you.\n\nThank you so much for your thoughtful response. It took me a minute to get back on reddit but I am in awe of all of the support. You don‚Äôt know how much it‚Äôs appreciated!!\n\nYou didn‚Äôt fail‚Äîthis sounds like a success to me! The worst case scenario happened: you had a panic attack. And the result? The class went by incredibly well. And you know what? I can almost guarantee that someone else with anxiety in that class saw how you handled that incredibly difficult situation and feels so much more validated, knows that they can have a panic attack and be okay afterwards. You did so well!!\n\nThank you so much üò≠ I didn‚Äôt even think about this but it‚Äôs so true. I crumbled but I got through it and hopefully helped someone else in the process\n\nYou definitely helped me! It‚Äôs really reassuring to know that even in panic, it‚Äôs possible to handle a situation with care and grace. You did an awesome job\n\nwhat would you think if your teacher had a panic attack in front of the class you‚Äòre attending? laugh at them? think they‚Äòre weak? no, you‚Äòd feel sorry and compassionate because it‚Äòs a shit situation. and who isn‚Äòt nervous speaking in front of class, i think most people can relate to that. the situation is WAY worse for you than for them, your students won‚Äòt think about it much again\n\nThank you, you‚Äôre right!\n\nYou could take propranolol before the class - will prevent physical symptoms of panic attacks\n\nDid wonders for me when I had to speak. Slows the heart. After I went through 30 of them I didnt need them again and rebuilt my confidence in crowds\n\nThis would work but if you can avoid it I would - whenever I've taken it it changes my personality to be less personable than my normal self, you might not end up with anxiety synotoms but your class may not relate to your normal warm vulnerable self like they do normally.  Not saying don't do it, but just to be aware\n\nI never experience any personality changes when I take it\n\nThanks for the recommendation I will look into it\n\nOof sorry this happened. I haven‚Äôt had a full blown freak out but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm nervous about. I definitely repeat every way I could‚Äôve taught better and all my interactions during class. I accidentally over share all the time. Anxiety sucks. But I think it probably humanized you more to empathetic folks. And I‚Äôve been trying not to care what non empathetic think. I think they are flawed with lack of care and I shouldn‚Äôt care about them. All ya can do is just try to give your self grace.\n\nYou‚Äôre right! Ty so much\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry you went through this but I really admire your honesty about it. In 2020, I had a full blown panic attack during a meeting where I had to give evaluation results (I‚Äôm a speech therapist so you can just imagine the shame) and I just pretended to be sick because I was so mortified. If it helps, I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack in a meeting since then and I‚Äôve had hundreds of meetings but it‚Äôs in the back of my mind. Maybe have a bullet point list to assist next class, stretch/run in place before hand, make a joke to break the ice, etc. before the next class? You‚Äôve got this!\n\nThank you! I have a printed agenda but I think bullet points and practice prior might help me too\n\nI was at a stand up comedy show once and the comedian had a panic attack 30 seconds in. He had to drink some water and sort of bend over the stool for a few minutes while the entire audience just waited. We just wanted him to be okay, and we related to how hard it was to have anxiety AND be in front of an audience. We cheered when he recovered and got on with the show the best he could. There was no pity, just respect. It was like a tiny bump in the show, as tiny as someone stuttering a little on stage. Nobody honestly will think about it ever again, and if they do, they‚Äôd probably go ‚Äúyeah they were pretty nervous but nailed it after that.‚Äù They will most likely remember enjoying the workshop more. As someone who also holds lectures and workshops regularly with anxiety, good on you! You should be super proud of yourself for persevering!\n\nWow thank you for sharing. This actually gave me hope!\n\nOh no! I hope you‚Äôre okay now! Only thing I can say is that it sounds like you have some great students who really respect you so I‚Äôm sure they are proud of how you overcame it.\n\nThank you! üôèüèΩ\n\nWhen I was at the local community college, one of my teachers had to leave the classroom for a few minutes because she had a bit of an anxiety attack. Being familiar with anxiety myself, I went to check on her. \n\n  \nWhen she came back to class, she apologized and nobody made negative comments.   Since it was a psychology class, there was a lot more understanding and she was able to turn it into a lesson on how to help those with anxiety.\n\nI love that!\n\nWe were all really worried about her. It also showed that even teachers aren't immune to moments of anxiety.\n\nSorry you went through that, but you‚Äôre amazing for even continuing the class afterwards! I‚Äôm a teacher myself and this happened to me a couple of weeks ago and my co-worker had to finish my class. Afterwards I was so scared that it would happen again that the fear totally started to evolve around ‚Äòbut what if it might happen again‚Äô.. Now I‚Äôm learning to accept the ‚Äòso what if it happens again‚Äô. You‚Äôre human, you‚Äôre not a robot. You‚Äôre doing the best you can and sometimes this is it.\nI wish my teachers were open about this, just like you have been.. that might‚Äôve helped me not being so harsh for myself when this happened to me. So please don‚Äôt beat yourself up about that!\n\nHaving said all that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm still a bit scared teaching a new class tomorrow. But someone here on Reddit once said that they would challenge their heartbeat/whatever to get even worse.. you can‚Äôt control your heartbeat, so it won‚Äôt work and can ease your anxiety. And to sort of ‚Äòlean into‚Äô your fear. It isn‚Äôt for everybody, but I tried both.. and noticing that I can actually not make it worse helped me at the time and made me smile even! But tbh I do feel like I also want to talk to a therapist to learn how to be more confident and kind to myself. \n\nAlso reading your story it sounds like maybe talking to someone about your workload or work/life balance isn‚Äôt a bad idea. Don‚Äôt want to overstep, but they could be signs of a burnout? So maybe in order to prevent from totally burning out, you could make some changes somewhere (with help from a therapist or someone from the HR department.. not sure who‚Äôs the best person in your situation).\n\nGood luck with everything! Your workshop next month will probably be great!!\n\nThank you! You‚Äôre right about leaning into the uncomfortable. I truly believe fear over it happening again will most definitely make it happen again so I‚Äôm trying to avoid that too.\n\nI instruct courses too and have had panic attacks while up in front of a group. It‚Äôs awful. But I was at conference this week when a speaker said they were having anxiety, and, as others have noted, the whole crowd cheered and said ‚Äúyou are doing great!!‚Äù Being open about it is great since so many others have the same feelings about public speaking.\n\nExactly this! Ty. I‚Äôm so glad I made the decision to be open and honest with my students.\n\nFocus on other things and become highly involved wwith the stud√®nts. It fot me throufh 25 years of teaching. I suffer from extreme anxiety.\n\nVery very likely at least one of those students has experienced anxiety themselves and is grateful you spoke up about experiencing it. Would you call one of your students an embarrassment if hey had a panic attack in front of you? Of course not. And they‚Äôre not doing that to you either.\n\nSorry to hear you had a rough time.. feel for you. I think you handled it really well and should be proud of yourself! And if anyone is judging, what does that say about them?\nLook after you and hope you can get to the bottom of what‚Äôs increasing the baseline anxiety\n\nThank you reddit friend!\n\nI have been teaching adults for about 8 years now and I have had full panic attacks a couple of times in front of them in the earlier days. It's totally fine. People are more understanding of anxiety and depression nowadays. You being vulnerable about your disease definitely helps! I talk to my students all the time about it and how it's actually very prevalent in my career and the field I'm training them in.\n\nI'm really sorry you're going through the middle of panic attacks and anxiety right now. It's such an awful feeling, but with medication and therapy, it does get better.\n\nThank you so much for your kindness üôèüèΩ\n\nOf course. It gets better over time if you put in the work. You'll get through this.\n\nA few things to try to more quickly calm yourself and shift the focus of your brain away from the anxiety: \n\n\nfirst, for the physical reaction - try buying a small fan and have it ready to plug in and sit right in front of it to both cool you down and act as a small noise maker for distraction.\n\nHoneywell turbo [Fan](https://www.target.com/p/honeywell-turbo-force-table-air-circulator-fan-black/-/A-11153539?sidd=108S&amp;ref=tgt_adv_xsp&amp;AFID=google&amp;fndsrc=tgtao&amp;DFA=71700000086347372&amp;CPNG=PLA_Home%2BImprovement%2BShopping_Traffic_Local_Traffic%7CHome%2BImprovement_Ecomm_Home&amp;adgroup=SC_Home%2BImprovement_Fans&amp;LID=700000001170770pgs&amp;LNM=PRODUCT_GROUP&amp;network=g&amp;device=m&amp;location=9016675&amp;targetid=pla-1462200138600&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_-GxBhC1ARIsADGgDjsJq9lHd-dUbVcqVpfo6EqNRoydoV883vLHL6bXHmk7fyxReLN6mtgaAsPxEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\nNext, find a game you like to play on your phone. I have a few including candy crush, and Block Puzzle which is a bit like tetris, though you can't rotate the blocks.  \n\nWhen you feel the anxiety coming on, pause whatever you are doing and play a few minutes of a game on your phone - it can greatly reduce or even eliminate the onset of the panic attack.\n\nNow, if you're in a class, you can always break in to whatever your session is and have some prepared 5-10 min small group or individual exercises they can do while you are calming down. You may need to practice this so it comes naturally and automatically.\n\nThese are great tips and I‚Äôm buying that fan asap. Thank you!\n\nI was in a class once where the teacher had a panic attack in front of us. But he noticed it from the beginning, so he said I‚Äôm gonna take a moment be right back\nAnd we all had a break while he did some deep breathing somewhere else. It‚Äôs totally fine, none of us felt any type of way. I felt compassion for him because I know how it feels.\n\nI'm sorry this happened but in hindsight you made it through it.  The worst happened and you came through it. You did it!\n\nThank you ü•π\n\nSounds like you handled it really well. There is never any reason to be embarrassed about a medical condition, which is exactly what a panic attack is. I think its easy to forget the symptoms are identical to having a heart attack and can be as debilitating.\n\nA few months ago, I was at work on a ferry.  We were laid up over night and I was the on duty senior officer. A crew member came running trying to find the captain as a crew member had collapsed while cleaning in a stairwell. I ran down there and initiated the emergency response. Symptoms were that of a suspected heart attack so that is what we treated him for. He was barely conscious when I first got there, breathing erratic and poor and not normal blood pressure (I can't remember now if high or low). The captain was doing some inspections in the engine room so didn't hear the commotion until some one went to find him.\n\nThe poor bloke was not normally on our ship so none of us knew him. Be we did what we are trained to do and looked after him. The ambulance came and took him to hospital.\n\nTurns out later it was a panic attack, and he had a history of them. They can be really serious, the guy did not look well when I first got to him.\n\nThank you. What a scary experience. It‚Äôs such a fear based condition and fear it might happen again only sets the future tone. But I‚Äôm working on it and hope my experience in class helped someone see it‚Äôs okay to lose your marbles now and again. Lol\n\nI am glad you are working on it. I've had panic attacks before but mine were while I was sleeping. Really hard to stop as I was asleep so no idea what was triggering them.\n\nDon‚Äôt be ashamed. One day one of them will experience this, and they‚Äôll remember your experience. Then they will understand.\n\nI know it sucks to feel so exposed in front of a group of people. But as someone who has been having anxiety in public for two decades now, take it from me: no one will remember it. Only you will remember it and feel shame or whatever other feeling. Everyone else is just too focused their everyday lives and their own struggles. They don‚Äôt have the brain capacity to register everything they notice about others in the moment. Their thoughts in that moment were literally like ‚Äúoh, my instructor is looking a little off today. Oh ok they said they‚Äôre very stressed out today. Now what will I cook for dinner?‚Äù\n\nThis is such a good point. People are probably way too consumed with their own lives, understandably, to worry about the things happening in mine. It does bring me ease\n\nHonestly, as a student, any teacher being open about their mental health makes me like and respect them more because I can relate. And you kept teaching, so by definition you didn‚Äôt fail them at all! If this happened with any of my instructors I‚Äôd probably admire them more afterwards and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt judge.\n\nThank you so much\n\nFirst off, you were AMAZING! I would have probably left the class never to return again.  The fact that you recomposed and made it through the class was spectacular.  Having the panic attack in and of itself is usually an entire day ending ordeal for most.  It's helpful, at least for myself, to remember the episode and the actual outcome that everything worked out in the end and that you survived it when your mind starts to remind you about the panic attack again.  The last time I had an attack in public while holding a training someone called the paramedics and once calmed down we continued the course a few hours later.  Many of the adults in attendance confided to me their anxiety struggles, like CEO/owners of businesses etc.  This helped to reinforce the fact that most have/had struggled with this and have come out the other end in great shape.  Your story will go into my mental strength box as a WIN over panic/anxiety.\n\nThank you so much for the kind words and stories. You know sometimes my attacks last forever and I‚Äôm so grateful that I was able to reel it back in. You actually helped me by saying to remember that in the end everything turned out okay. I think that will help me greatly in my future workshops\n\nI‚Äôve gone through this during presentations, especially ones that were recorded. What I can guarantee is it comes off much worse in your head than in reality. I‚Äôd bet most either didn‚Äôt notice or didn‚Äôt think much of it. We tend to be harder on ourselves in these situations.\n\nAlso, most of them probably have something they aren‚Äôt comfortable doing. I‚Äôm sure they related to you and like you more because of it.\n\nTry looking at your hydration - this can have a huge effect on anxiety levels.  Aim to drink 2-3L of plain water per day, preferably with a pinch of salt for electrolytes.  You'll be surprised how much calmer and together you feel.  \n\nAlso watch out if you drink coffee/caffeine - its a diuretic meaning it flushes water out fo your body, so even if you think you are hydrating well, you can need a lot more to compentsate.\n\nThis! I am a daily coffee drinker and terrible at drinking water\n\nHi, I‚Äôm a college teacher and suffer from panic attacks. Mine are pretty well managed now, but I‚Äôm honest with my classes about my condition and mental health issues in general. I find that my students really appreciate my openness, and it relieves them to know others have anxiety. We can share our struggles and ways we cope.¬†\nI really share openly with others too. Just a week or so ago I mentioned my panic attacks to my dental hygienist. She immediately started opening up about a panic attack she had at work the day of her son‚Äôs graduation. We were both so grateful to share and connect on the issue.\n\nI was diagnosed with panic disorder a few years ago and I've been working through it. I had a bad habit of measuring my progress by the number of panic attacks I had. Its difficult not to, it seems like the most intuitive metric to measure how well you're handling anxiety. \n\nUnfortunately, this leads to a feeling of dread when thinking about future attacks that COULD happen. It's not just discomfort that's on the line, its progress. You have one, and then the little calendar in your head that says x days without incident resets back to zero. It's an awful feeling. \n\nIt took me a long time to stop measuring my progress and overall mental health by the number of panic attacks I was having. My therapist helped me look at it this way: every panic attack is an opportunity to GAIN progress and that is exactly what you did in your class. The worst happened, you spiraled, you had the worst case scenario happen and had all the horrible thoughts you didn't want to, and it DID NOT stop you. You composed yourself and finished your task, and at the end of the day you were back home safe and sound. \n\nAnd the next class you may very well have another attack, but now you KNOW that you can get through it. Repeat that back to yourself as many times as you need to. You are capable of having an attack and still pushing through it. It's a hard truth that panic may be present in some degree for the rest of our lives, but we can live through it, we can make room for it.\n\nThank you for this comment. I had a panic attack after not having one for two years last week. All I kept thinking was I‚Äôm back to 0. I couldn‚Äôt find any way to reframe the shame and disappointment until reading this comment.\n\nMate this happens and life goes on. Trust me I had plenty of embarrassing times from school and guess what? No one remembers them cause they got their own life to live. This might seem like a big deal for you because this is *your* life but *trust me* people truly don't care about your failings, awkward moments as much as you assume they do. \n\nWe all living in this shitty world trying to survive.\n\nCompletely understandable to feel initially embarrassed or upset that this happened in that moment. But please try not to feel humiliated and beat yourself up. What happened, happens! And you handled it with grace. You absolutely became more relatable and perhaps some of those students watching you, may too deal with panic attacks. Perhaps they don‚Äôt feel so alone.\n\nHad it all my life. Google ‚ÄúThe Charles Linden Method‚Äù - helped me.\n\nI work in a bank and i had a panic attack while i was with clients. I just started to feel hot and like im having a heart attack and took my blazer off and said i was hot. Then i realized im having a panick attack. I tried to hide it but my hands were shaking really bad so i told them sorry i think im having a panick attack but i will be fine in a few seconds and countinued my work. They were really understanding it was a mother daugther duo and the mother said its familiar to them nodding at her daughter but i still felt so humiliated. I was so lethargic for a few days and thinking about: now this is going to happen every time i have to communicate with people? But i always forget about it. I wouldnt even remembered it until i saw your post. This is just a really fresh experience but dont let this discourage you!!üòä\n\nYou did a fantastic job. Be sure to have a laugh about being so nervous in front of such wonderful friends and family &lt;3\n\nDon‚Äôt forget, you‚Äôre not alone. More than likely a number of those students understood you more than you know.\n\nI‚Äôve been there! It was scary and felt the same way you did. After that happened I got on anxiety/depression meds and it has since helped a lot. I admire your confidence and vulnerability to communicate with your class on what was happening. Even though it hasn‚Äôt happened since (2 years ago) my prepared plan, if it does, is to tell the class/crowd that I‚Äôm sorry and suffer from intense migraines. You got this ü§úüèºü§õüèº\n\nYou are human and panic attacks are not exotic or very uncommon. If people ask you something about it, explain that you are a human being and these kind of things can happen in a certain fase in your life.\n\nMost people understand anxiety as everyone knows someone who has it for the most part. When I used to get attacks at work I would let them know that I was having one and excused myself. Never caused any problems\n\nSome one in the audience who also get‚Äôs anxiety or panic attacks was probably inspired by this. Seeing someone get anxious, be honest and recover and continue going shows that it can be done!\n\nPersonally I started filming my exposure therapy and caught some panic attacks on camera and I share them online. Just check some of the comments on this video, it‚Äôs not embarrassing and all and your story actually sounds like a positive story as it all turned out okay and people were understanding!\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/JS6rd4AcyrI?si=bJEYpPdHTAv3d1KP\n\nI‚Äôve had so many panic attacks in public that it acted as accidental exposure and I pretty much have no embarrassment about panicking in public anymore. It‚Äôs just a real thing that happens and I should not be embarrassed or ashamed. Would I be rude or mean or think badly if I saw someone else panic? Not at all! I would try to help them!\n\nWow, much respect! What a champ move just staying there!!\n\nI have a problem with my vagus nerve, and this happens to me often. I am a college professor. My students are aware of this and know that sometimes I just need to sit down right on the floor right in the middle of class. I find the more vulnerable we are in the more open we are, the more grace we give ourselves and the more grace others give us. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about this at all. no need to be mortified. You are a human after all.\n\nI instruct courses too and have had panic attacks while up in front of a group. It‚Äôs awful. But I was at conference this week when a speaker said they were having anxiety, and, as others have noted, the whole crowd cheered and said ‚Äúyou are doing great!! Being open about it is great since so many others have the same feelings public speaking.\n\nDo NOT feel shame over this. You are human! Fuck anyone's judgement, that's their problem, not your's. You made it thru, you're a warrior. Never forget that. There is no shame in having panic attacks, you cannot help the way your body responds, and you're not alone. It's just something that happened, it doesnt define you. Your strength to get thru it and keep living, that's what defines you. You're incredibly strong. Thank you for sharing your story.\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion hardly anyone took notice. I have had many people tell me they were terrified or having a panic attack and they looked absolutely normal.\n\nI relate. When a panic attack happens, it happens. It doesn‚Äôt matter who you‚Äôre around, it can happen anywhere at any time. So I‚Äôve had my fair share of panic attacks in front of my friends or family or even out in public with strangers. It‚Äôs extremely embarrassing afterwards when you can think clearly and are grounded. Usually, no one could understand what was happening to me or why I was acting like that, and they‚Äôd play it as some dramatic act. To my surprise, no one had a panic attack quite like me before. It shocked me, and made me feel terribly alone, ashamed, and embarrassed. There were only a few people who really supported me throughout my entire panic attack and gave me what I needed in the moment. Truth is, some people will think you‚Äôre insane and others will sympathize with you. Best advice I can give is surround yourself with people who will be there for you when you need them most.\n\nHey, scrolling through my history and was wondering how your doing?\n\nThis is so kind of you to check in and I‚Äôm sorry for the late response. I am feeling soo much better as have since hosted an amazing workshop. So I‚Äôm feeling super positive and hopeful! Thanks so much for asking üôèüèΩ\n\nYay! Glad to hear it :)\n\nDo you guys get caffeine itching like i do? Ive been using caffeine as an anti anxiety and anti pain thing for awhile but the come down is always the same the coffee craving and a really bad back and thigh itch usually mixed with the anxiety. Im over the anxiety im not affected by it but the bodily issues have started to get out of hand. I dont even get panic attacks anymore i just get chest pain and stomach pain and the itch. Im kinda lost on what to do my friend said possibly it was cialic disease but im wondering if others have this itch also."

    "all_comment_text": "It is an awful experience, I feel for you. \n\nI remember having a high stress call centre job for 5 years, and my Friday evening ecstacy at it being the end of the work week was mirrored be sheer dread on Sunday evenings. The theme to Countryfile (Sunday evening UK farming show) still makes me stressed.\n\nThe problem is that the job and the stress becomes so all-consuming that you end up focused solely on getting through another week rather than trying to make a change. \n\nIf you have a family, I imagine you end up with little time to breathe.\n\nTalking about it with someone will help; acknowledging that this can't continue and  working on a plan to leave with that person will help a lot more. Don't be afraid to not be the strong person and ask for help.\n\nI feel the same, except it‚Äôs not just my current job; it‚Äôs *all* jobs. It‚Äôs just having to work in general. I literally cry every single day like you, except also AT work. In front of people on accident sometimes. Also fine on the weekends except for Sunday nights (well, mornings for me because I work nights). I‚Äôm putting off sleeping right now actually lol). Fuck this life, man. I‚Äôm not married (not by choice) nor do I have kids (by choice), so I really got nothing to live for except maybe my family and my whole 2 friends. I feel myself slipping further and further every day. I‚Äôm going to Disney at the end of October/beginning of November, and I think that might be the only thing keeping me alive. Who knows what‚Äôll happen after. All I know is that if I have to work 40+ hours a week for the rest of my life, I don‚Äôt wanna live.\n\nI resonate with this a lot.\n\nMe too unfortunately\n\nThis is my problem too. It‚Äôs so exhausting\n\ni feel the same way. i had to take today off due to a nervous breakdown over work. the idea of quitting and finding a new job stresses me out just as much as going to my current job. it feels hopeless.\n\nI‚Äôm 100% hopeless. I could quit and live with my parents, but I‚Äôd have no money and my credit would be fucked because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay my credit card bill. Still might do it anyway when my housemate moves in with her girlfriend next year. (She owns the house but will lose it if I‚Äôm not here to help pay the bills.)\n\nYup i sacrifice sleep a lot because fuck work, hobbies are far more important\n\nI‚Äôd do that more if a) I actually worked on hobbies and not doom scroll or play video games or watch YouTube, and b) I feel 100 times worse if I don‚Äôt get enough sleep.\n\nI work as an arc at the post office,and lately my anxiety is thru the roof!!! I'm taking up to 6 mg of Valium a day but it's not helping!! I'm having suicidal thoughts a lot ,and it's scaring me tremendously!! Someone, please help me!\n\nI was in this situation once. I lasted probably around the same time. I went home, cried again and talked to my husband. We came up with a plan for me to work part time jobs (like Uber, Amazon) while applying for jobs. I was able to leave shortly after that. That place was the WORST place I‚Äôd ever worked and I was just thinking about it last night (obviously at 2 am when I do all my best thinking instead of sleeping). Try and come up with a plan to get out and move on. Even doing that will make you feel better.\n\n\nEdit: I also wanted to add this was 6 years ago and I‚Äôm STILL up thinking about that effing place. Some places will fuck you up.\n\nI'm 100% there with you. I'm up at 4 am having anxiety over having to go into work,  Sunday nights it starts at 4pm knowing I hand to go in there. I tried my psychiatrist and she just have me a ton of anti depression meds.  We have gone through restructuring that I thought would help. They even have me a promotion in title ( not pay though). Nothing send to help and the job market is terrible right now\n\nSave yourself before you are no longer in control, and who will be there to save you?\n\nI am so sorry you are going through this, I suffer from severe anxiety myself and it has effected my career for over 13 years, I have missed over a week of work, having to l lie to my work about kids being sick and people passing away, I feel so guilty when I do that but the anxiety is so severe, just want you to know that we all think we are alone in our anxiety and we are not, we are going through this together and doing our best, wishing you peace today\n\nPlease take my experience on board. I was miserable too and I had so much anxiety going to work, that it gave me panic attacks. Something has to give. Your mental health is paramount and you are important. Resign and take time out, before you start a new job. Be kind to yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè\n\nBeing kind to yourself doesn‚Äôt pay bills unfortunately. I‚Äôm in the same situation but I can‚Äôt find anything that pays what my current job does. I can‚Äôt take a pay cut because I need the money. I‚Äôm stuck and miserable at my job.\n\nSame. Stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nSadly many, many, people don't have that privilege. Looking for a new job should be the focus but it's rough out there.\n\nYeah, not possible for most people to quit their jobs or take unpaid time off. We gots bills and shit.\n\nCan you apply to a more chill place or work remotely? Your husband should help support you through this\n\nI fucking hated working corporate. It‚Äôs literally designed to manufacture stress\n\nYou're so right! \"Literally designed to manufacture stress\" üëèüèªüëèüèª\n\nNo job is worth sacrificing your MH for. Get a new job and get out of there asap!\n\nStaying there won't help you. Leave, and find something that'll make you happy. Your partner should understand that you need to put your happiness first.\n\nAt this point it isn‚Äôt even about happiness. It‚Äôs about getting to a healthy baseline state. Which is so necessary for OP\n\nThis is happening to me as well, any advice pls?\n\nWhen the only way of you fixing your anxiety is leaving the place, but you can't leave makes everything complicated. If you can't leave I suggest that you should see a psychiatrist.\n\nYep. Except I‚Äôve been seeing psychiatrists and going to therapy off and on for over two decades, and nothing helps. The only thing that would ever help is never working again, but that‚Äôs just not possible lest I be homeless and starving.\n\nThis just happened to me, but I didn't address it in time and now I'm unemployed. As others have said, your health is more important than making money.\n\nTry thinking about a career switch. What things do you enjoy doing that you could get paid to do? One thing that has helped me in the past is going to a professional resume writer. They will ask you questions about your work experience and translate your answers into skills you probably didn't know you ever had! I guess I'm saying don't feel like you're stuck in the same field of work you've been doing for most of your life.\n\nI'm currently looking at data entry jobs, fully remote. I do much better when working from home (strange thing to say, but I worked best and was quite happy during the Covid 19 pandemic when I was fully remote). Good luck OP.\n\nI know that feeling to well, that's why I quit nursing near the end of 2020... I just couldn't do it anymore.\n\nWhat do you do instead ? lol\n\nI had a job that was pretty stressful. It was a relatively simple job, but it was stressful as hell because a couple of my co-workers were very mean to me. My manager couldn't care less and he was obnoxious. I would sometimes would go to he backroom to cry. I always was on edge before and after punching in. I eventually got Bell's Palsy from the stress and that's where I had to stop. I quit like the week after and it was the best feeling ever. I was so relieved. It was worth it. My next job although physically demanding, it was nowhere near as stressing or depressing. I'm so glad I didn't stay in that other job.\n\nI have had this same problem on and off. I work at a psych hospital where my anxiety skyrockets to unbearable amounts when theres an aggressive/violent/impulsive patient. every situation is different but for me, I talked to my boss and was able to arrange some temporary accommodations to make it easier on me. I love so many aspects of my job that it wasn‚Äôt worth quitting. Every time I power through it I feel like I‚Äôm gaining resilience\n\nJust want to push back a little bit on the ‚Äúmy only medicine is leaving‚Äù thing. Anxiety is scary and horrible, but there are so many little things that you can do to ease your nervous system. I‚Äôm not saying that this job isn‚Äôt what caused you to have anxiety, but if you‚Äôre like me, you will still have some degree of anxiety when you leave. This job is not forever but anxiety is something that will stay with you for quite a while. Therapy can definitely help. Try your best to process work things emotionally and really truly take care of yourself (eating, exercising, following a healthy schedule). Set boundaries at work, they don‚Äôt own you, see if you can take a gentler approach. If you have the privilege of leaving your job, definitely take it! But that anxiety will be here to stay until you learn to work with it.\n\nFocus on what you can control. Make yourself a tasty, nutritious meal. Run a hot bath with Epsom salts and oils. Prioritise relaxation and self care.\n\nI knew it was time to quit my last job when thoughts of crashing my car on the way to work started to be less thoughts and began feeling more like a plan.  Luckily, my wife was cool with it, and we could afford it.  This was in late January.  She is less cool with it now.  I have looked.  I could have a job in a heartbeat.  I've a psych degree and have worked a lot with kids.  Prior to the last job I'd been a para.  They want me back.  And it's one of the least triggering types of work I've done.  Something  \"cozy\" about a nice school system.  Thing is, wife was tired of getting sick all the time.  To be fair, that last school year I did bring home pink eye, Rona, the flu, and strep throat.  Elementary school kids are germy, lol!  It also doesn't pay well.  But. My thinking is, some money is better than no money.  Job hunting is one of my least favorite things.  My degree limits things.  My agoraphobia and GAD, and Social Anxiety Disorder further complicates things.  Even 10 years ago I could at least function in a customer service environment.  Now, I don't think I'd last a day.  And living in a very spread out city, with agoraphobia sucks.  My wife doesn't really get it.  I do feel like I'm letting her down.\n\nYou say you have responsibilities?? One of those is your health, which will get worse if you remain in an unreasonably stressful employment situation.\n\nSorry you're going through this.  I've been where you are -- unfortunately, more than once.  Both jobs literally made me sick and completely stressed out. \nI ended up quitting and finding temporary jobs before taking on a new position. One of my temporary jobs -- pet-sitting-- was perfect for de-stressing.  I also made a lot of money doing something I enjoyed.  It ended up being a regular part-time job for me and one of the best decisions I've ever made. \n\nYou can do this, OP.  You can put your health and well-being first and earn income-- even if it's not from  a long-term or career job.  I'm pulling for you.\n\nQuitting the job was the best decision I made! I'm not married with kids exactly cause of these reasons. I'm telling you bro staying in toxic places is definitely not worth it even if you are married.\n\nYep. Im a barber if that tells you anything.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if this will help, but these are some of the things I remind myself when I‚Äôm stressed about work:\n\nYou only actually need to do the things your boss tells you to do. If someone‚Äôs making you feel like you‚Äôre responsible for some vague scope that keeps getting bigger and you can‚Äôt keep up with or keep track of your tasks, tell your boss that. Work needs to be measurable, trackable, have a beginning and end ‚Äî if yours isn‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs your boss‚Äô problem, not yours. Bring these problems to your boss‚Äô desk and drop them there; leave with only the things you can put on a checklist and check off. \n\nYou might have ‚Äúnice-to-do‚Äôs‚Äù that you came up with yourself, or that you think would improve things or make you look impressive, but do those last. Don‚Äôt tell anyone about them; do them if you have genuine downtime or not at all. Just knock off the things someone is actually kicking your door in for and don‚Äôt worry about adding too much value. It‚Äôs unlikely they pay you enough to be that innovative. Save if for yourself. \n\nIt‚Äôs only work and you are only responsible for thinking about it during the hours they are paying you for.\n\nSAME! Literally have ulcers over mine. \nCaring less helped.\n\nI keep having this happen and it‚Äôs ruining my life. The job I want to reapply to refuses to hire me back because I left unprofessionally. (Had all my struggles and stuff build up and I walked out) It was the only job I‚Äôve had that made my life slightly better, and my ex coworkers want me back but the hiring manager is refusing. Soon I won‚Äôt be able to afford therapy on my own, and I can‚Äôt stay at a job long enough to make enough money to be able to afford medication to get my life on track and stop having massive anxiety. \n\nI don‚Äôt have any advice, just know that you‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôve thought of ending it several times this month alone. Massive hugs to you and I hope you get out of this tough situation soon.\n\nDo you have FMLA leave? My fianc√© is having some issues similar to this, and took a month's leave and is seeing someone about her stress and anxiety.\n\nSeconding medical leave. I wish I did this when I was in a similar situation. \n\nIt can at least buy you more time to prioritize your mental health and hopefully look for other jobs\n\nHave you considered taking fmla leave?\n\nThis sounds like me in my first couple of years at my workplace. I felt physically sick and exhausted from the pressure of my first office job. I had a panic attack in front of coworkers about 8 months in. \n\nI still feel like I am more anxious in professional situations than most people, but starting talk therapy (specifically with someone skilled in cognitive behavioral therapy ‚ÄîCBT ‚Äî to retrain the automatic negative thoughts), focused on building workplace confidence /  tackling my imposter syndrome, helped more than any medication I‚Äôve ever tried. Now I am still with the same company but much happier and more resilient to challenges. \n\nEveryone‚Äôs different but if it‚Äôs helpful, I had success with humanistic/‚Äòperson-first‚Äô therapy style, heavy on the CBT. It took maybe 2 months to tell whether or not it was helping. You might need to shop around to different therapists till you find one that feels right.  \n\nIt can get better!!! Hope you‚Äôre okay.\n\nI‚Äôm in the same boat, even for how long it‚Äôs been going on‚Ä¶I‚Äôm trying to apply for other jobs now but it‚Äôs so hard. And doing that extra push to apply and asking for informational interviews when I‚Äôm already feeling like crap and trying to sound energetic like someone people want to hire, well, I‚Äôm not making it work.\n\nMy eating is terrible, sleeping is terrible.\n\nTell me about it. I‚Äôm in the Military worst decision of my life joining this shit. I don‚Äôt regret joining but I can‚Äôt wait to get out either.\n\nLet me tell you you‚Äôre not alone! I‚Äôm struggling everyday like you and I get panic attacks at work, and many times I felt like vomiting‚Ä¶but I try my best to survive because there is no way I will find another job right away and I need the money I can‚Äôt survive one month without salary üòñüòñ I started going to therapist, I also get medication for panic attacks occasionally. Did you try antidepressants?\n\nIn this instance i think its better to work multiple jobs that dont give you panic attacks if you aren‚Äôt finding something that pays enouvh\n\nThis is me too! I have been there a long time and for some reason I'm really struggling. I know I need something else. üòû\n\nI left my job because it was causing me to lose hair and I basically was going to end it. 4 months after I left, almost half of the management left with most of my colleagues saying I left at a good time.\n\nWait same!!!!!!! lol I love my job though but it does cause crippling anxiety and I feel like over time this is going to drain me\n\nIf you have some savings and survive on it for sometime until you find something better/develop new skills... Fuck the job and quit NOW!!!. \n\nI did it and thats one of the best decision I've taken. I was at the point where if i didn't resign voluntarily management would have eventually fired me for how pissed I was at work and how it was impacting my work, since id simply stopped caring about everything at work(responsibility/colleagues/even clients). That's how bad I felt and the anxiety of having to do it every day was something I don't wish on anybody.\n\nAs tough as the job market is rn as long as you're not stressed daily will def further you in living a more fulfilled life in the present. The future will take care of yourself if you're happy in the present. It's literally yolo and memento Mori. This is my experience, do what works best for you tho.\n\nFor the longest time I hated my job, we all commiserated over how much we hated it. But eventually I was able to get out of there to a better job. It's a tough market right now, but hang in there, it is much easier to find a better job when you already have one.¬†\n\nThis happened to me. I like to think I was normal before I became a teacher. I never wanted to teach but my mom paid for my schooling and she thought this would be the best choice for me as I had no idea yet what I wanted to do in life. After 6 months of having panic attacks, anxiety and fighting depression, I finally last week quit teaching. It‚Äôs hard to not see any over night benefits but I know it will get better as time goes on and I am away from the toxic workplace.\n\nUpdates?\n\nHello,\nThe job is still stressful since it has many responsibilities, it slightly got better, i kept on applying for many jobs, i had a job offer for a job that has no contact with humans unlike this job it's mainly linked to human contact, but weird enough I'm considering to not take it, why i find it weird that someone asked for update today, is because today i need to make a decision and I'm leaning more towards staying in that job.\n\nI find it weird myself, especially that the job offer seem like a repetitive job and has better working hours, but i decided this time to follow my gut feelings.\n\nI'll post another update in two weeks.\nEither I'll be in a better place or I'll be anxious and crying again. Only Allah knows.\n\nThanks for asking.\n\nI have a job that i like  what i do its in fitness and yoga im supposed to start almost full time 30/35 hrs January i have a psy degree and applied for a counselor and got it 40hr/ wk but the thought of leaving my flexible job where i get to have control of my schedule for the most part is close to home and is expanding and my boss will pay for more skills im super torn:/ idk if i like counseling or not im a s/a counselor too and could just get the experience that way but im 24f and 9-5 structures make me v anxious but idk y i wont feel like a \"real adult\" if i stay in smth i enjoy. And if i dont like being full time i doubt the counselor job will be there. I have gad 2 :/ . But want to move towards earning enough to be on my own just so ik how and i am but will probs only make 30k yr where i am or 48 full time thoughta?\n\nYou are the source of your anxiety\n\nYou‚Äôre getting so many downvotes but this is actually true to a certain extent.\n\nWe all are the source of our anxiety. We worry a lot about stupid little things, because we overvalue everything and everyone. No one deserves that much attention. OP, I‚Äôve been there. Try changing your perspective about the job and make the best out of it. Go to work with a confidence of 4yo in a Batman cape. Go to work imagining no is there but you, do whatever makes YOU as comfortable as possible.\n\nI wasn't trying to be mean but anxiety is coming from within you that's always the source\n\nI knowü§£\n\nBeast mode"

Just wanted to let you know you‚Äôre not alone, as I‚Äôm in the same boat.\n\nfeels nice knowing i'm not alone but i would not wish this feeling on anyone. hoping we both begin to feel better soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nMe too, my friend. ü©∑\n\nI hit my lowest last year. I remember sobbing in my bed, alone, thinking how \"it will never get better for me.\" It did. These are what have helped me:\n\n1. EXCERSISE without question, especially running. I know you say it sucks and it does but feeling anxious is worse. If you hate running a good cardio excersie is also the rowing machine! I was lazy too, bro.\n\n2. Cutting out added sugar\n\n2. Journaling. No, this doesnt mean rambling on a page. I frequently wrote for just 15 minutes a day (1) a thought I had (2) why I believe this thought (3) reasons that disprove this thought and try to rationalize the flaws in my thinking.\n\n3. I listened to Therapy in a Nutshell on Youtube\n\n4. this is a good one but really hard. I would be in the shower and I would turn the water frigid cold as long as I can bare and control by breathing; no hyperventilating. \n\n5. Did these consistently; these are only a few ideas\n\nExercise really helped me overcome a lot in life. I know it can take a lot of motivation to just GET to the gym BUT once you do it and keep at it, it's so worth it. My general anxiety has gotten so much better as well as my social anxiety. I lift weights and I personally prefer that. But sometimes the treadmill calls my name. I just wanted to add my 2¬¢.\n\nTherapy in a nutshell is bomb, she give amazing advice\n\nYes exercise seriously it saved my life in many years. I also hit the worse rut in my life last year. I stopped exercising because I got afraid then, you know what I did I read the dare book which also helped me so much started walking then started going to the gym then I felt better and better. Exercise and some good therapy has saved me.\n\nwhats the dare book? i search on amazon and there are too many of them\n\nIt‚Äôs by Barry McDonagh\n\nLook in your apps for his iPod it‚Äôs worth it. Also gives his name to get book.¬†\n\nexercise and reducing (or stopping) drinking.\ntry to work out in the morning so you don‚Äôt spend time thinking about it before. also it‚Äôll help with the cortisol levels that naturally spike when you wake up. you can start small - a few push-ups every morning, try to vary it throughout the week but keep it small to begin so you build the habit. follow it with water and some breakfast and then BOOM, you have accomplished so much and the day has just begun! (i used the Fabulous App to start these habits and it was really helpful, but if you don‚Äôt want to pay, i basically just told you the first few weeks of its suggestions lol)\nalso, gratitude journaling can help. my counselor gave me a fill in the blank one for morning and night, each can be as short as 30 seconds but i‚Äôve started to enjoy spending more time.\n\nExercising DOES suck but god does it work. Any time I get hit with random/significant bouts of anxiety or depressive thoughts I go on a walk outside and I feel miles better. Sometimes I even just do jumping jacks. It works!\n\nAll of this. I brought myself out of the dark horrible hole that is panic disorder on my own (no meds or therapy) it takes hitting rock bottom and being so over your own shit to change but it‚Äôs possible. Exposure to fears, exercise (even just long walks outside in a pretty park), being out in nature is so damn healing, sleeping well, eating well, no/limiting alcohol, cutting out sugar/caffeine, digging deep to figure out why this is even happening, talking about my feelings, having a comfort person that can listen. Acceptance is a big one too, accepting that you‚Äôre not in danger and that your body is actually trying to help but failing a bit lol. Trusting your body. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack in a long time now but if the sensation starts up (this time due to a trigger, because I still have my baseline anxiety, before it was just happening continuously but I can stop it in its tracks now and a ton of that is accepting and letting it roll away.  At my worst I was dropping weight because I couldn‚Äôt even eat or sleep because of the panic and nausea. Was a true nightmare. But it‚Äôs important to remember you‚Äôre still in there, it‚Äôs just a matter of rewiring things. Your body makes the anxiety and you can also unlearn it, can rewire that misfiring over time, just takes a lot of time and inner work. Anxiety feeds anxiety. Learning that is so important. Progressive muscle relaxation in the moment of panic or intense anxiety helped me everytime more than anything else. Also the podcast the anxious truth sheds a lot of light on healing.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI'll second on cutting out sugar. Such an addictive substance.\n\nThis!\n\nIt‚Äôs possible you may be burned out. Don‚Äôt feel bad as many are in your position. I recommend to start with small things. Such as tasks that take little to no effort, some self reflection, and maybe while laying in bed - listen to some self development podcasts for motivation. ü´∂\n\nIf you have a full-time job you are already ahead of many, many people who are struggling with just that part of life. Since you do have an unfulfilling job your next step is to figure out a specific goal that you have and then begin working toward it. That will give your life some meaning and purpose and will lead to other things. Figuring out what your goal is is in some ways much harder than actually achieving it.\n\nHi OP, just wanted to say I could have written this myself today! I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, it feels lonely and cyclical. There‚Äôs a lot of good suggestions here (which I plan on trying to implement myself) I hope something helps you too!\n\ni hate tips that expect you to go from 0-100 instantly and always suggest the most blase 'things you already feel bad about not doing' activities\n\nwhat helped me this spring is\n\n- sitting outside and reading, smelling the fresh air\n\n- playing guitar and drums again (this is obv fairly low effort for my situation i should say, don't try to learn anything Right Now if it feels intimidating)\n\n- picking an area of my room to straighten out (as small as necessary, the drawers in the nightstand, etc)\n\n- starting to cook again (chopping vegetables feels very cathartic for some reason)\n\n- convincing myself how shitty social media was and trying to look at my phone as little as possible \n\n- taking up vaping for weight loss for holistic self appreciation and esteem lol\n\nalso fwiw you're not lazy, you're just tired from work\n\n üéØ I aways laugh at the exercise etc brigade. I went into a coma &amp; started having inexplicable Suizures about 3 years ago being a very active, clean eating, very spiritual person who read &amp; listened to audiobooks religiously.\n\nAnxiety as my psychiatrist keeps telling me most of the time  just is something having gone very wrong.\n\nToo much work stress, fear Mongering on SM etc and the more you embrace and make it part of your personality the worse it gets. \n\nexercising with the sole intention to beat anxiety seems silly to me.\n\ncut out caffeine if you drink it as well. also was gonna say about the gym, it‚Äôs hard to self motivate especially with anxiety but what helps for me is signing up for a class (boxing, rock climbing, etc) as it forces you to participate and be there at a certain time and have someone instructing you what to do makes the exercise a lot less stressful and more like following orders which helps me. If I went to a normal gym or runs I‚Äôd be totally lost and probably make reasons to skip but with a class it feels a lot easier to just be there and let them guide me if that makes sense\n\nhope things get better! life is short and we all deserve to feel good inside, one step at a time remember\n\nI‚Äôm not sure of you have tried medication, but it helps! It brings motivation, it makes things easier. You don‚Äôt have to be on it forever. Stuff will get asked, I promise!\n\nCame here to also endorse meds. I‚Äôd literally never been able to snooze before starting my SNRI‚ÄîI‚Äôve always woken up feeling panic/dread that miserably propels me through the day. Instead of fighting a constant hurricane of anxiety (which consumes soooo much mental and physical energy) meds make it more of a drizzle or occasional downpour.\n\nThis. When my anxiety was at its all time high I started lexapro/wellbutrin. Stayed on both for about a year and then got off them both. It really helped me get my anxiety back under control and kick start me back into gear. Starting medication can be scary but the benefits are amazing.\n\nI don‚Äôt have any advice for you, as I‚Äôm in the same boat. I feel as if my life is meaningless and I‚Äôm useless. My anxiety has taken everything from me. I do the same‚Ä¶ get home from work and just lay in bed all evening. Thankfully I have kids so they need me to do things for them, but they don‚Äôt solely rely on me anymore so I can get away with bed rotting. My house is also a mess and I have no motivation to clean it. Anxiety sucks. It‚Äôs debilitating. I hope you can get past it. And I hope the same for myself. ü§ç\n\nHere‚Äôs my thoughts, and it‚Äôs pretty simple so forgive me for that, buts it‚Äôs what helps me.\n\nPlenty of people have been in my situation and got out of it alright.\n\nPlenty of people have been in much worse, and through much worse, than I have, and they made it out alright.\n\nI‚Äôve made it through everything else in my life up until this point, if I could make it through all of that, I‚Äôll be alright. \n\nYou never know what tomorrow brings, and honestly fuck tomorrow, you never know what the next 5 years will bring. It‚Äôs cliche and so over used, but life‚Äôs full of ups and downs. You‚Äôll have shitty moments, days, weeks, months, even years, but the sun will rise and you‚Äôll be okay. It‚Äôs the suffering and the lows that makes the happiness and highs significant. Happiness and peace cannot exist without sadness and chaos. \n\nEverything always works out in the end, friend üñ§\n\nEdit: to add some actual advice that did change my life though, something obtainable and actionable, start exercising and go outside as much as you can. There‚Äôs scientific evidence to back up how unbelievably important exercise is for both our physical health and mental health. I don‚Äôt know if I would be here today if I didn‚Äôt find love in working out. Being outside, going on hikes, camping, whatever it is that sounds appealing to you, will undoubtedly help, just being in nature and having the sun shine on you.\n\nI would like to congratulate you first for your realisation, the seed has been sowed in your inner consciousness, now the right thing to do is keep your eyes open and try to move far away from your comfort zone and do one exercise a day where your heart starts begging for breath.\nI‚Äôve been at a similar place like you for a longer period (approx 3 years) post my serious relationship and got tired of just drinking and working 9 to 5. I started looking for other opportunities but this time really differently not just weekend blues. So become a seeker now and go on hunt. \nGod bless\n\nHey OP. Take everything slowly. If you feel overwhelmed by a million things that need doing. Have a simple goal for the week. Even if you think it's not going to impact much. It's the little wins that make us feel accomplished. The whole house needs cleaning/tidying? So make the bed. Yes it's small, but you think after it's done, that took 5 minutes why have I put it off 3 months? If that was easy, maybe the next small thing won't feel so overwhelming. Do things that you know will impact your quality of life for the better first. Pile of clothes sitting in the corner? That can wait , rather a couple plates to clean. Personally I know that when I am low , taking one look at those plates sitting on the side will unfortunately prevent me from making food that evening after work. And don't fall for the self guilt. \"oh I have spent all of my day off doing nothing!\" So what? Burnout is real. You are allowed to have a 'day of rot' as I call it. As for health changes, personally I now supplement with daily vitamin C and iron tablets as I had a massive lack of energy. Hope this helps x\n\nAre you really lazy or do you just have ADHD overwhelm?  Mornings are where my unprompted anxiety peaks and I never understood why until I started to understand  my brain was simply overwhelmed with trying to figure out how to do all that needs to be done. \nNow I‚Äôm just really kind to myself and roll with the flow of the morning. If I feel extra anxious I‚Äôll try to understand why and then work on a solution. I get like this if I feel compelled to do something- like exercise. If I  feel like I ‚Äòshould‚Äô do it you can guarantee I wk t so I figure out ways that makes me want to do it or I simply don‚Äôt and I‚Äôm kind to myself about that. Negative self talk about everything makes my anxiety worse so I actively stop doing it and I talk to that inner child and just tell them they‚Äôll be ok.\n\nI feel this way, and I am having issues connecting with other people and enjoying my time in social situations. I am happy on the surface but right underneath anxious as heck and just wanting to go home\n\ndo you have any time off you can take from work? I‚Äôd advise to take as much off as you can and just schedule a week to do nothing! give yourself some time to catch up on everything and have a breather. I also just want to say you‚Äôre not alone and you will get through this! reach out to people around you but also belive and trust in yourself, you‚Äôre stronger than you think\n\nThe only thing that‚Äôs truly long-term helped me improve my baseline level of anxiety and reduce the frequency and intensity of my panic attacks has been exercise. Cardio and weight lifting, 5-6 days a week. Sometimes that just means 30 minutes of walking at a slight incline at a moderate pace, sometimes it‚Äôs more intense. But no meditation, coping skill, or amount of therapy has made as big of a difference as exercise. It‚Äôs saving my life.\n\na big thing for me was accepting that i was not lazy, that i had a mental problem that affected my ability to complete tasks. exercising was hugely helpful for me. therapy and medication was more helpful, although it was really hard to make those appointments originally bc i just viewed them as daunting tasks, understandably. i‚Äôm on beta blockers which is the best thing ive ever done for my anxiety! i tell everyone this because it is the most helpful thing i have discovered for completing tasks: setting timers for chores. if my dishes have piled up like crazy, i‚Äôll set a timer for 15 minutes and wash dishes for just that amount of time, if im not done by the time ive set, i just leave the rest of the dishes there. and i end up feeling more accomplished even if i didn‚Äôt finish my chore. on really bad days i can set a timer for 5 minutes. it makes the task feel so much less scary and way easier to do. hope this helps!\n\nIt helps me to do tiny steps. Like, I don‚Äôt drive straight home and ran an errand. Or choosing only one little thing to complete-for me putting away laundry. Instead of the gym, take stairs and walk at lunch. Just start pointing in the right trajectory inch by inch. Anything is always better than nothing\n\nOne day at a time!!! Don‚Äôt rush anything, it will take you back to square one. Start small, maybe clean the fridge or just a shelf in your home. Go from there, do what feels comfortable to you with the energy you have. Slowly your energy and your life will start to feel more normal. You do you!!! As long as you don‚Äôt give up on that, life will slowly fall into place‚Ä¶ Good Luck My Friend‚Ä¶.üëçüòÄ\n\nJust know you‚Äôre not alone in feeling that way because I have been feeling the exact same way for awhile üò≠\n\nWhat works for me when and my advice is to put the mess of your life aside for a little while and indulge in things you enjoy. Remind yourself what joy feels like even if it‚Äôs small. Ignore the voice inside your head that says you don‚Äôt deserve whatever it is. Then after you have met those needs (most likely physical pleasure but perhaps an exciting adventure) then put that carrot on a stick and give yourself a small but annoying task list. Promise yourself that you can have more of what brings you pleasure as a reward. Then build up your tolerance for annoying tasks you are not motivated to do. \n\nAnother pice of advice I believe works wonders is spending some time outside. Go on a walk during your lunch or just spend some time driving around a beautiful neighborhood if you hate being outside. \n\nAlso, novelty. Doing something that is new and therefore a novelty to you can help you get out of your head and into your emotions where you can feel your feelings and find your joy somewhere amongst all of the others. Do something you have never done before.\n\nI think your best bet is to start with something tiny and go from there. You're stressed out and you have no motivation so trying to fix things in your current state is going to result in bed rotting. Start with something really small and simple.\n\nIf you want to clean up around your place start with a little square in one of the rooms. Clean it up and if you feel like doing more go ahead. If you don't then you at least got a little bit done.\n\nIf you used to workout really hard and now you don't at all, you can always start with a single squat or pushup. Don't make yourself feel like you have to get a full workout in. If you only do a single bodyweight squat that's more than 0. Take small steps as much as you need to.\n\nI don‚Äôt know the answer but fully relate to your post! Having spent 20 years medicated I didn‚Äôt find that it fixed any of this for me, so I don‚Äôt know what the solution is. I‚Äôm sorry for us ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI felt the exact same. Factors that fixed it (not in order): transitioning to a WFH job, meeting my husband, adopting a dog (visiting it during lunch breaks until wfh), moving across the country, cutting out toxic family members, forming close friendships, becoming a parent, and getting on an antidepressant. It‚Äôs totally possible for your life to do a 180. It‚Äôs hard to see past the now, but in 5 years from now.. your life is statistically going to be way more drastically different than you‚Äôd predict it to be.\n\nEmbrace self care and continued self discovery. I have had severe anxiety my whole life. But I have found that the less I am willing to pour into myself the easier it‚Äôs to feed my compulsions. I set time aside each day for pleasure. Complete time to me. Without distractions I color. I meditate. I find something. Even if it‚Äôs doodling on a napkin. I didn‚Äôt find this momentum till I held myself accountable to MYSELF. Not anyone else. I made these changes after everything that could have possibly gone wrong in my life. TLDR long fucking year. Lost everything. But now almost a year later I am seeing the changes mentally. There‚Äôs hope. It‚Äôs hard. It takes will. But I believe you can find a method of peace.  Even a small one. Hope this helps. üíì\n\nI relate. A lot. If you‚Äôre into neuroscience, read the book ‚ÄúThe Molecule of More‚Äù. Could be that you‚Äôre working with a dopamine deficiency on some level. Fascinating book either way. Good luck OP! You‚Äôre definitely not alone here!\n\nHey OP, thanks for making this post. So relatable to a lot of us I‚Äôm sure. Many people have rightly given practical solutions of things to do in such state. For me, what works is fixing the mindset, and blocking thoughts which perpetuate anxiety. So, I‚Äôve written the following quotes down and I read them:\n\n-You cannot hate yourself to become better version of you. Give yourself grace. Be kind to yourself. Please don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. You deserve love, as much as others do.\n\n-Action kills anxiety. I try to think about the root cause of anxiety-usually procrastination of some work that is supposed to be done! \n\n-Anything that is worth doing is worth doing poorly. No need to be perfect. No need to complete it. Just start. Do it for 10 minutes only. Do it in a bad way. Do it half baked. What matters is to start. Have zero expectations about the standards of the result/outcome. I have to do it poorly. This thinking helps me let go of perfectionism/fear of failure mentality; and enables me to get started on something. Don‚Äôt think about it, just start. You wanna workout- just tell yourself that you‚Äôll do it for 10 minutes only! Once you start it, maybe some days you keep going. Some days you don‚Äôt; still 10 minutes is better than nothing. \n\n\nAs a person with crippling adhd, the biggest hurdle is to start tasks. I experience adhd paralysis of being unable to start working on things which are not highly mentally stimulating. All my life, I‚Äôve been too hard on myself, holding myself to impossible standards of perfectionism, hating and punishing myself for failing to meet those. Only recently, after massive depressive episode, and reading therapy books, I understood that firstly I‚Äôve to be my own best friend, love myself, encourage myself, be kind to myself, and reduce my expectations to zero! Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, then I still can‚Äôt do the work! That‚Äôs life :) wish you all the best OP\n\nCaffeine and sugar. Avoid that. I hated caffeinating beverages because of my anxiety spikes when I needed em for work. Actually became addicted to coffee even though it made me anxious. I stopped that and started herbal teas.\n\nSounds like you need a holiday from work, and focus on you.\nEven if you cant afford to do anything, make a list of thibgs you'd like to do if you had a day or a week to yourself.\n\nI can SO relate to the work eat sleep trap.\nHope you manage to do something that works for you üòä\n\nSounds like you need a holiday from work, and focus on you.\nEven if you cant afford to do anything, make a list of thibgs you'd like to do if you had a day or a week to yourself.\n\nI can SO relate to the work eat sleep trap.\nHope you manage to do something that works for you üòä\n\nYou need a vacation. My best tip: pick one thing. Be a useless mess in everything but one thing. For example: commit to doing a 20-25 minute, enjoyable and cozy  online yoga video after work each day. And that's that. Do that for.a month. DO NOT ASK MORE OF YOURSELF. \n\nMy prediction? A month later, your body and mind will feel a teeny tiny bit different. From there, either replace that one thing with a different one (aka: COOK DINNER). OR, if you feel it's plausible, add one more small thing. (for example: Yoga video in evening, quick kitchen cleaning session before work.) \n\nBe extremely forgiving of yourself outside of these new things you're asking of yourself. Remember, your job takes most of your energy, and you have a paycheck-- that means you're a lot safer than you feel. It sucks, but you aren't in a dire situation, you're doing great.\n\nOne more helpful comment -- a lot of the time I find I am feeling sad because there are many things I would love to do but do not have the energy (nor time!) to include in my life. So, in my planner, I have a dedicated page or two for \"things I miss/want\". I jot down authors I've been meaning to look into, activities that sound fun, hobbies I want to get back into or start, etc etc etc. That way, I don't feel like I'm missing out on them, I just know I won't forget about them and can sit back and wait for life to give me a window to check back in. And, I HAVE actually miraculously on occasion in a happier or freer moment flipped back to those pages and DONE THE THING. It feels good. Good luck!\n\nWhen you have anxiety, bed is your worst enemy\n\nHey OP, when I‚Äôve been stuck before my motto was ‚ÄúI just need one step in the right direction‚Äù I started off small with what I could feasibly do and grew from there. Then I had medical issues and am in the process of taking ‚Äúone right step‚Äù again to build back up. I believe it‚Äôs in the baby steps and celebrating those steps no matter how small. You‚Äôre one small step away from feeling better and better each day. Arguably, you already took a step. If you mention your struggles they are manageable. You opened up. Celebrate that. Sending strength and light your way.\n\nI have low energy, especially when I get home from work.  I have to hit the gym or go for walks on my lunch hour.  Maybe try to incorporate your goals into the morning or at lunch?  Or try to do things before you get home.  Once I am home I rarely head out again during the week.  Don't give up!  Small steps\n\ni feel i‚Äôm in the literal same boat as you. absolutely no motivation to do anything once im off work.. and on my days off i feel so exhausted and sleep in so late and it‚Äôs hard to get up.. like a vicious loop\n\n. I used to feel like that a lot in the past.\nFor me, I had a very toxic relationship with productivity, I always had those big plans on what to do and what I wanted to achieve in my free time but after work I just never felt like doing anything. The tasks were to daunting and I was already exhausted so it felt impossible. \nI would often just end up doing nothing and feeling disappointed in myself.\n\nWhat works for me:\nBe kind to yourself, dont beat yourself up over it. its not ‚Äûlazy‚Äú to be exhausted after a full day of work and tbh most people are. Most people dont get a lot else done when they are home at 7pm and its FINE.\nif you do want to get into some better habits, baby steps! you will not magically feel like working out four times a week. but maybe you could go for a walk after dinner, every day. even a short one would be great. \ndont overwhelm yourself because all the changes dont matter if you cant keep up with them longterm, so go slow and steady. \n\nall the best to you, i hope you will feel better soon\n\nIf you haven't already, go get a check-up! See if any deficiencies could be contributing--low iron, thyroid, vitamin D, etc.\n\nGet outside more. If you don't have the energy to walk, just sit out in the fresh air.\n\nLess time on social media--for entertainment, try crosswords, painting, coloring, books\n\nAs others have said, set a timer for a short amount of time to just knock something out. Most people aren't automatically motivated, you get the motivation by starting/seeing your progress. Also you can get more done in 10 minutes than you realize!\n\nExplore therapy and potentially medication. Sometimes the medication helps bridge the gap so you can start doing things like exercise, Journaling, putting in the work in therapy, etc.\n\nBooks I'd recommend: Heal Your Nervous System by Linnea Passaler, The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook by Edmund Bourne, You Will Get Through This Night by Dan Howell, and Burnout by Emily Nagoski\n\nI wish you all the best!\n\nI have never been in an internet conversation before this moment - other than commenting on Facebook. Reading these comments from all of you today is so eye opening for me. I have felt so alone and like a failure because I don‚Äôt have an outstanding career and im not financially successful. Anxiety has been ruling my life more and more and im getting ready to call my new boss at my job I‚Äôve only had for two months and quit because im older and can‚Äôt physically do the work. Seeing that there are others who have lost jobs or not been able to defeat their anxiety - other people who feel inadequate and like a failure has given me the first glimmer of hope that I‚Äôve had in so many years. Shame has taken over me and I‚Äôm so embarrassed around my successful friends but because of all of you on here I see that I‚Äôm not some abnormal failure. I see that good people struggle with the same issues that I struggle with. I feel so much emotion right now just knowing that it isn‚Äôt just me - there are other people who feel the same way. I‚Äôm going to stop beating myself up and try again. Thank you all so much for your openness and candor and for giving me an actual will to try again. I wish all of you the best. May you all live long full lives of peace and happiness. Bless you. Thank you for this pivotal moment. Your words have given me strength.¬†\n\nRescue/adopt a dog? That has definitely helped me with exercise. I know not everyone has the ability to just go out and do that, just a suggestion.\n\nIn the same boat\n\nJust make the first step go for a cycle or walk youl feel alot better Trust me . And fight that negative thought I know it's not easy but try telling yourself it Enough you'll change your mindset took me years to get it Manageble myself so gl You can do anything .\n\nForce yourself to wake up early and workout.  It will be rough initially but eventually you will get used to that.\n\n1. Do not give up. \n2. Go outside.\n3. Think of positive things and things you‚Äôre \nthankful for. \n4. Talk to someone.\n5. Write\n\nDogs\n\nI‚Äôve felt this way a lot of my life. I had executive function issues. I couldn‚Äôt do anything. I also woke up every single morning in a full on panic attack for a long time. This was years ago now. I‚Äôve found the med combo that works for me and also my psychiatrist said something about my hormones being in a better state? That might be something to look into that doesn‚Äôt usually get mentioned. You‚Äôre not alone ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nRock bottom usually is the most transformative time. You‚Äôll realize that the darkness is the way. Just push thru. Wake up and take action. Easy to say. \n\nTry reading about stoicism. Or just 1 youtube click away. Goodluck.\n\nEdit: also. One should never strive to be rid of anxiety, as it resides within all of us. Rather, one should face it every day and decide to discard it.\n\nAnother thing that can help is to write down all your priorities for the day and then work on knocking off the most important tasks or at least tasks you can easily accomplish. Scratching them off and seeing a visual of your progress can be uplifting. When knocking down those big daunting tasks, it can help go into autopilot‚Äîdon‚Äôt think about it because thinking about it will stall you. Just do it, like you‚Äôre on autopilot. What micro steps can you take to complete the tasks?\n\nIs there someone you can speak to that can help alleviate your stress? Speaking and connecting to someone that you trust can help lower your anxiety, albiet momentarily but you can try to hold onto that sliver of hope for awhile. Maybe a phone call to break the monotone and overwhelming anxiety that you have on a day to day can be a nice break.\n\nMicrogoals! Do one little attainable thing each day. Maybe it‚Äôs ‚Äútoday I‚Äôm making a list of‚Ä¶‚Äù\nOr it could be, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ordering the walking shoes‚Ä¶‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt matter how menial, it‚Äôs just small amounts of progress towards that greater goal, the whole point is that they *are* attainable and proactive. \nGive yourself permission to have been relaxed, on some level you needed that but now it sounds like you feel\nLike you need something different and that‚Äôs all ok.\nIt doesn‚Äôt have to be everything switched all at once, it can be gradual and less daunting and give you time to process, ask questions, what do you really want to try? What are you realistically going to have access to? What activity could be a way to move your body comfortably and want to do it more often?\nPersonally I love walking, I have access to a lot of nature despite living in a city. Headphones and a nature walk is such a reset I can almost feel the stress being moved through me and out with each exhale, it‚Äôs not a cure for my anxiety and depression but it makes it more manageable, I look forward to walking/hiking and do so with no expectations of how much or any sort of forced regimen it‚Äôs just I know I need to move my body sometimes and that‚Äôs the way I‚Äôve found it to be most motivating.\n\nI have started taking magnesium glycinate that helps take some of the edge off of my anxiety. Also if you feel panic attacks coming, sour candy works great to help and get your brain focused on something else. I know its so hard im sorry.\n\nI mean you work really long hours. I don't blame you all you want to do is lay in bed\n\nI have bipolar disorder so I can really relate to your situation.  I have ridden on the bipolar roller coaster many times.  If I had to choose between depression or anxiety, I would pick depression.  I compare anxiety to holding a live wire.  Anxiety (and depression) has become an inseparable part of my life.  I don‚Äôt have much to contribute to make you feel better.  I think that the most important thing for you is to first stop calling yourself ‚Äúlazy‚Äù and using the word ‚Äúhate‚Äù when referring to yourself.  Despite your debilitating illness, you are still working.  That is a major accomplishment.  It is so hard not to be negative when you are anxious.  It‚Äôs less tiring to not do anything.  You feel that you are drowning.  That everything overwhelms you. It is difficult to make yourself do anything except the basics: work, eat, sleep.  Waking up is agony.  It‚Äôs like a nightmare that has come true.  When I‚Äôm anxious, it‚Äôs a physical sensation in the pit of my stomach. Don‚Äôt feel as if you have to do everything at once.  Pick a small goal.  Break it up into smaller pieces that are achievable.  Don‚Äôt set yourself up for failure.  It seems like you have suffered for years.  My doctor and others have recommended that I just go out for a bit and get some fresh air.  But it is impossible when I am anxious and/or depressed.  I rely on medications to give me relief.  I don‚Äôt know if you are taking any psychiatric drugs to help you diminish your anxiety or if you are in therapy.  I encourage you to get help from a psychiatrist and try different medications.  Get a therapist if you feel that doing so would help you.  I know it‚Äôs tough to live in a constant state of anxiety.  Don‚Äôt beat yourself up. You are doing your best.  That‚Äôs all I can ask of anyone.   I hope that you find a way out of the wilderness of depression and start living again.  Because you deserve it.\n\nfirst step \n\njust like writing you first need to learn to do letters (a b c d....) before writing poems\n\nFocus on the MOMENT. You‚Äôre overwhelmed because you‚Äôre thinking non stop about the past or about what you should be doing. Just focus on the moment and do things slowly at your own pace. If you go back to over thinking, then pull your attention back to the moment. This will help you focus and not feel so overwhelmed. It‚Äôs hard but if you keep practicing it gets easier\n\nI‚Äôm on the same boat internet friend, usually just switching up diet a bit can lift you up\n\nAlso, sleep with calming audios and sleep meditation or sleep hypnosis, they do help, don‚Äôt judge before u try\n\nAlso gratitude journal helps, just write down 1 thing a day, it adds up\n\nDo some simple exercises at home. Stand in the shower, bend down and touch your toes, get on your knees, reach up etc. Just move and stretch in any way you like for just a few minutes. That‚Äôll do for now. Then do it again tomorrow. Sit and take a few nice big deep breaths outside looking at the sky. Make sure the exhale is longer than the inhale. Nice and slow. Just for a minute or two. \n\nThat‚Äôs more than you did yesterday.\n\nI don‚Äôt know you but I am proud of you.\n\nHi, I don't have the answers myself but I am offering you a very warm hug. I'm sorry you're feeling this way. You are not alone. This too shall pass. üíï\n\nBiking. Find a bike if you don‚Äôt have one and ride down a trail, sidewalk, anywhere really. Try to let go of everything and immerse yourself in nature and talk to yourself while doing it. It‚Äôs given me clarity and it also primes my body for other exercises\n\nI feel the same way as you‚Ä¶ as soon as I‚Äôm done work. It‚Äôs hard for me to want to do anything cause I‚Äôm mentally and physically drained from work. All I want to do is lay down and relax lol. Then I tell myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start working out tomorrow after work!‚Äù Never works! The only thing I can suggest is really pushing yourself to do even 10 mins of working out. Then when you get in the habit of doing it after work , increase it to 15 mins then so on. Just to get the momentum going. You will NEVER regret working out! If anything, it will give you more energy to do other stuff around the house after. Then you can go to sleep feeling accomplished and good! Try it‚ò∫Ô∏èlet me know how it goes!\n\nI notice too, small time frames for working out, makes it easier to do and goes by super fast. It usually gives you more energy and you say once you‚Äôre almost done ‚Äúfuck it, might as well do another 10 mins!‚Äù\n\nStart small. Like insanely small. Take time out for yourself.  Instead of working out, start with just sitting outside for 15 minutes and then progressively ramp up how much activity you do. Apply this to everything. There are free dbt workbooks online that help me a lot whenever I‚Äôm at a super low spot\n\nA weird thing that helped my anxiety too is just sitting without doing anything. We are always preoccupied with some type of action. Even laying in bed is an action because we‚Äôre doing it to fall asleep. Spend at least 5 mins a day to start out just sitting down without any goal in mind, no waiting for something, no listening to anything, no distractions. Your mind naturally processes and heals things without your input and it does it best when you give it time to be focused on absolutely nothing\n\nAre you anxious because of the past or are you anxious about not doing more? \n\nThe dead center answer is you need to start regardless of what it is you want.  \n\nor just accept that you don't want to change anything and don't be hard on yourself anymore. \n\nSmall hack... Try to make the \"hard stuff\" as easy as possible so you can get going. ANY increment small enough so that you can be consistent... Then you literally wake up one day and say wow... It's been 5 years of working out, yoga, grappling, crossfit... whatever rocks you. \n\nI think focusing on results will increase anxiety.... Maybe focus on the process of whether you're doing what you set out to do."

    "body": "I had pretty bad anxiety for the last year, it came out of nowhere really (25F). It was mainly performance anxiety like going to college or going to work. Then, I couldn‚Äôt even hang out with my friends of 10 years without feeling like I‚Äôm gonna throw up. It got to the point where I‚Äôd throw up before work and I‚Äôve been there for 3 years, extremely familiar with the people, environment, whatever. \n\nI finally told my mom while I was in a really anxious state and she gave me 10 mg of propranolol. It felt as though it immediately worked. It subsides all the physical symptoms like racing heart, sweating, shaking, nausea, etc. \n\nI made an appointment with my primary and he prescribed it to me. The 159/90 blood pressure probably helped with the prescription as it is for blood pressure &amp; heart rate specifically but nonetheless I am using it for anxiety now. 10 mg a day, not a big dose. I haven‚Äôt felt one pang of anxiety in an entire week almost since I started taking it everyday. \n\nI never knew how difficult anxiety was just hearing it from people but to live it.. it‚Äôs a different story. \n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôm praying you feel some relief soon. \n",

    "all_comment_text": "Yup beta blockers have done more for me than anxiety meds did. I don‚Äôt regret them, but wow a year on a beta blocker and I am a brand new person compared to this time last year. Seriously.\n\nCan you share dose? 10 mg of long acting or does the standard propranolol work?\n\nI‚Äôm actually on bisoprolol. A quarter of a 5mg pill. It lasts for 24 hours so I only have to take it once a day.\n\nIsn't there a tolerance build up?\n\nI‚Äôve been on the same dose for a year, so I‚Äôm not sure. I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs not one I usually hear about tolerance unlike benzos or even SSRIs\n\nI‚Äôm on my first day of propanonol too!  I took 10mg this morning and my nervous leg shaking, and general whole body stress was so much better at work.  Excited to try 20 on Monday since those are my worst days.\n\nIf your healthcare provider has not recommended a higher dose then please, do not to ahead and take it bc the day may be harder. Beta blockers when not titrated correctly, particularly when used for non-cardiac diagnoses, can cause hypotension (low blood pressure), bradycardia (low heart rate), and episodes of syncope (fainting). \n\nBeta blockers as a treatment for anxiety are off-label. Do not double your dose without at least speaking to your pharmacist\n\nYou‚Äôre correct, my doctor specifically gave me permission to adjust the dose with knowledge of my health history.\n\nGood to hear. I‚Äôm a med student and health literacy is a big passion of mine. Also the amount of hospitalizations we get for polypharmacy (overprescribing) is pretty insanely high. So I always try to encourage ‚Äútalk to your doc. At least Talk to you pharmacist.‚Äù\n\nWe‚Äôll make it through Monday. Weve got this, even with the deep psychological trauma of being live, well make it!\n\nDo you know anything about melatonin and propranolol together? Google says conflicting things‚Ä¶ I really want to take melatonin because I haven‚Äôt been sleeping since starting propanolol.\n\nI am on propranolol for tachycardia and have had no problems taking melatonin. I space my evening dose about 30 mins to an hour before I take my melatonin.\n\nI take 30 mg of propranolol a day and it's great. It doesn't get rid of all my anxiety but it does a good job of reducing the physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, chest pressure and that feeling of vibration.\n\nHere's a pro tip - If you wake up anxious then set an alarm for an hour before you usually wake up. Take the propranolol and go back to sleep. Then when you get up for the day you aren't waking up with that sense of impending doom.\n\nI‚Äôve thought about doing this!! I start a new job soon where waking up an hour early will be easy so I will def be doing this! Thank you :)\n\nThanks for your comment. Do you happen to take the fast acting or the extended release? If the fast acting, how long does it typically last? My doc is saying I can take it twice a day, but I‚Äôve been only taking in the morning and it seems sufficient so far. Thanks in advance!\n\nI take the fast acting 3 times a day.\n\nThanks for the reply!\n\nWhat milligram do you take and do you have any side effects starting it thank you\n\n10mg three times a day (combined with buspar).¬†\n\n\nI had bad reflux for a few weeks and then it went away. About an hour after I take it I feel kinda tired for half an hour or so but that passes.\n\nThis was my experience as well, lifelong debilitating symptoms, then I had a \"cardiac event\" that led to beta blockers. They changed everything, allowing me to foster confidence and build the skills I needed. Once the physical anxiety was gone, the mental anxiety was much easier to manage.\n\nI‚Äôm so glad to hear! I totally agree, with the physical symptoms gone, mentally it feels so much lighter!\n\nThat's what I'm hoping. I feel like if I can get a handle on the physical symptoms then the mental ones will be easier to deal with.\n\nWhich beta blocker/dosage?\n\nPropranolol 20mg has always done the trick for calming my physical anxiety symptoms\n\nDo you take it a few times a day? Never considered extended release?\n\nActually I only take it as needed now when I feel my blood pressure getting high and heart palpitations starting, and before big meetings. I find 20mg takes care of most of the day, maybe a second dose if the palpitations come back.\n\nThank you !! im glad you got relief and a break . im still struggling but getting better and realizing when my symptoms are anxiety and when i really am having real symptoms and need to press the panic button . For some reason this post made my day and gave me some hope cause i know i am doing better - not -100 % i know im healing but will get there soon ü©µ\n\nI‚Äôm so glad to hear ‚ù§Ô∏è keep fighting\n\nPropranolol was how I finally passed my driver‚Äôs test after being too anxious each time and therefore making dumb mistakes. I‚Äôve been a huge fan ever since!\n\nglad you found relief i also been struggling with anxiety that came out of nowhere really bad for the last 8 months after i had my first panic attack ever , trying to stay positive and keep my chin up\n\nMy first attack was just over 2 months ago, and I'm right there with you. We'll get through this.\n\nSame here. Mine was about 2 months ago. I‚Äôm on FMLA while I get this figured out.\n\nI‚Äôve been taking it as needed for a while now and it‚Äôs an absolute lifesaver. I have a panic disorder and very rarely do my attacks have concrete triggers. Sometimes I‚Äôll just be sitting or standing around and my heart rate will go anywhere from 120 to 190!! I‚Äôve had a 24 hour heart monitor test done and as far as my doctors can figure out it‚Äôs just anxiety. I‚Äôm taking Lexapro to manage my panic attacks but when one sneaks through I go for the Propranolol and that usually fixes it pretty quickly.\n\nPropranolol is being prescribed off label for the physical effects of social anxiety.  I‚Äôve been on 10-20mg twice daily PRN and I‚Äôve still got the emotional symptoms but the physical symptoms are GONE.\n\nheyyyy same!! im a few days in and i still feel all the mental symptoms, but the physical panic being gone helps so much with calming myself down.\n\nYay, right!! It‚Äôs like the feedback loop kinda slows down when the physical symptoms aren‚Äôt there\n\n*sighs in 90/64 baseline BP*\n\nMy baseline BP is around 85-90/57-65 usually and I take 10mg of propanalol every now and then and seem to be just fine!\n\n[deleted]\n\nOh no I‚Äôm so sorry :(\n\nSame! Worked great the first week. Then nothing. I was so hopeful. I‚Äôm trying the 60mg extended release so hope that works well again.\n\nHow is that going man?\n\nHad to stop taking twice a day. I was having side effects at even 10mg 2x a day. Started giving me right side pain and making me very tired. I did the gene sight test and unfortunately propranolol is one med that my body is more likely to have side effects even at low doses due to how I metabolize it. Never tried the ER because of this. Bummer.\n\nThanks for info. Are you gonna try something else?\n\nYeah I think so, but not sure what. Meet with my doc today to talk about other options. I've heard Clonidine can be helpful for anxiety, but it can lower BP too much for some people, which propranolol doesn't have that issue.\n\nThere's also Atenolol, alternative to Propranolol\n\nGood to know. Thanks!\n\nI also haven't tried Buspar yet either. So that is another I will try soon. I've heard really mostly it just causes dizziness for people.\n\nY'all don't get extreme brain fog from beta blocker? I have propranolol prescribed and every time I took it made me much less anxious but holy shit does it break my brain. It makes me feel super foggy the rest of the day.\n\nI had to take it while they were figuring out a heart problem and it was awful. I felt so cold and tired. No effect on my anxiety\n\nHonestly the brain fog and potential for additional forgetfulness has been the reason I've yet to try beta blockers.\n\nI like studying and learning new things, and not having my brain work well would seriously interfere with those goals\n\nPropranolol kept me sane during the last year of my Master‚Äôs program. Best description would be a calm body.\n\nI started propranolol 10mg twice a day last week due to anxiety induced palpitation, dizziness, 169/89 blood pressure, shaking and numb limbs. I know it helps because I remember taking the first pill before work but ALWAYS forget about the second pill after lunch break. And for the past week I have been thinking why shit always happens after my lunch break? Like all my emotional break down and panic come back after lunch. Then I realised it's the second pill that I missed. I hope your life gets better. Anxiety really erodes our true ability and talent.\n\nPnol is extremely underrated!   \nFor me, It did something benzos could never do...\n\nSo underrated!!\n\nI gotta try mine. I always go for the Ativan because it just totally calms my body and my mind.\n\nWhat does the P do that they weren‚Äôt?\n\nDid you try the propranolol yet?\n\nI have tried it, and didn‚Äôt feel like it helped and ended up with an Ativan after a couple hours.\n\nI have now also tried hydroxyzine and that helped more than I expected! I‚Äôve been able to do 3 events with it. Even though I had some nerves, I could handle it.\n\nIm on 20mg twice a day and it has helped tremendously.\n\nMake sure you drink a LOT of water.\n\nHave you noticed a big drop in blood pressure/heart rate? \n\nI was actually prescribed this and have not tried taking it due to my blood pressure being in the lower normal range. My resting heart rate is also around 65ish.\n\nI have low blood pressure and took Propranolol for a few years. I don‚Äôt think it made it any worse for me, I stayed around my normal range. I switched to Metoprolol at my cardiologist‚Äôs suggestion to treat a heart rate issue and was worried about the effects w/starting a different beta blocker but again, so far so good!\n\nThank you for replying! \n\nMy cardiologist gave it to me because I get bad palpitations and sometimes my heat races with them (probably anxiety of feeling them). \nI may go ahead and give it a shot then, just have my husband or mom around incase the first time. I read it can drop blood pressure and since mine is low, I really didn‚Äôt want to risk it.\n\nI was given this medication by my psychiatrist but have yet to try it, I‚Äôve convinced myself that it‚Äôll make my anxiety worse haha\n\nI‚Äôm also super nervous of trying new medication (lexapro like 5 mg sent me into a panic attack) but I highly recommend beta blockers. You feel absolutely nothing except you‚Äôre just not AS anxious. Of course it‚Äôs different for everyone but the effects are so so mild, you truly don‚Äôt feel anything!\n\nI‚Äôll give it a go! Thank you!\n\nHow did it work? Like you I was scared to start something and have it fail, but I gave it a go and I‚Äôm annoyed I didn‚Äôt earlier. Since your heart isn‚Äôt racing, your body doesn‚Äôt start looking for reasons to be upset, aka that feedback loop. But very new to it still!\n\nJust made me pass out\n\nWhat do you mean ?\n\nI mean  I had no anxiety ü§£ but I‚Äôd like to be conscious\n\nUnderstand lollüòÇ\n\nI fell asleep for an entire day\n\nIs clonodine similar?\n\nI just started it myself in the last couple weeks; switching from propranolol. Loving it! Helps both anxiety AND focus.\n\nSimilar yes! It may work just as well as propanolol for anxiety\n\nCool.  Because my doctor has offered clonidine it but I‚Äôm a little leery of pills.  But I will look into it next appointment.  Glad you‚Äôre feeling better.  Anxiety sucks.\n\nClonidine, though, is sedating.  I took it decades ago for Tourette's Syndrome &amp; sleep problems.  If I took it during the day, I'd be groggy, so, not good if you have to drive or work or be in a classroom.  Maybe I'm more sensitive to it, but just a heads up.\n\nI'm scared to take Propranol because up to now, napping has been one of my saving graces for times I'm feeling super anxious, and I've read that Propranolo doesn't let you go to sleep. Is this true?\n\nHello. Beta- Blockers can cause problems with sleeping in some individuals. In this case Melatonin usually does the trick.\n\nOh I‚Äôve actually been napping more üòÇüòÇ it definitely chills me out where a 1 hour nap sounds amazing\n\nI've been on prop. for a few years since getting panic attacks, and if anything it's made sleeping easier!\n\n\nObviously everyone is different and will experience different side-effects, but fingers crossed it can help you out, too.\n\n\nI usually take 1 in the morning, but am also able to take up to 4/day should I be experiencing severe and lasting panic symptoms. Otherwise, I can take 1/2 or a full tablet to kerb suddenly anxiety during the day; say if I have a weird interaction with somebody.\n\n\nThere are lots of ways that beta blockers can be taken, and different beta blockers will have different side effects. Your doc will know more. Good luck!\n\nexactly my prescription and so grateful for it! üíï glad it‚Äôs helping you too\n\nI have been using this for about 8 years. Helps me with fight/flight symptom. I can relax and do my presentations well.\n\nHow long does it last? I just got prescribed and can‚Äôt figure out when to take it to make it last the whole day. I had posted about this and not a single person replied ‚òπÔ∏è. My provider and the pharmacist said two different answers and I‚Äôm so confused. One said to take it before I‚Äôm going to be in a stressful situation and the other one just said it stays in my system. I don‚Äôt even know what that means. I‚Äôm someone who stays stressed and anxious and am just trying to figure out if I need to take multiple doses throughout the day or if the effects last the entire day and one is enough. ‚Äú6-12 hours‚Äù is a helluva gap\n\n[deleted]\n\nI mentioned in my comment that I spoke with my provider and my pharmacist and both gave different answers. The leaflet only gave directions for patients with HTN which I don‚Äôt have.\n\nThis is something that I think, rather than going to your pharmacist, you need to clear up with your doctor.\n\nI said provider and pharmacist.\n\nThat's fine, but this isn't something a group of people on Reddit will be able to sort out for you without actually seeing your medication. You're going to have to go to the person who prescribed it to you - your provider - and ask them for clarification. They're more likely to have a better understanding of what they prescribed to you in the first place.\n\n\nIf you explain to them that you've been told two different things, something separate by a pharmacist, then hopefully that will mean you get a concrete answer.\n\nI did. All mentioned in my comment that I asked my provider and my pharmacist and got two different answers, which is why I came on here to see what other people prescribed the same medication, propranolol, are doing. I‚Äôm not understanding the disconnect here. I see a post for the medication I am prescribed, I comment the dilemmas I am facing, I list what I‚Äôve done so far and you keep saying to do things I‚Äôve already done. If I haven‚Äôt made it clear, I‚Äôm happy to further explain but I feel like it‚Äôs pretty cut and dry ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nOne dose usually lasts 4-6 hours and gradually fades from there.¬†\n\nIt was crazy the first time I took metoprolol. It was like the biggest sigh of relief. I literally just sat on my couch and laughed at the fact that I didn't have anxiety, and my heart was beating at a normal rate.\n\nIs that similar to propranolol?\n\nYeah they're both beta blockers.\n\nI took one about an hour ago. Working well. Thanks for the tip.\n\nI also got crippling anxiety out of seemingly nowhere about 4 years ago. Then I developed intense migraines. I first started buspirone for the anxiety. And then my primary gave me propranolol for the headaches and holy heck it knocked all of my physical anxiety symptoms out. It was the best feeling ever!\n\nI wish it did more for me. Has anyone had success on any other beta blockers if propanolol didn‚Äôt help? I‚Äôm losing my mind on a trip I‚Äôm on right now and wish I had something to help me not be so anxious and irritable.\n\nSomeone commented that metaprolol was a bit stronger and longer acting!\n\nI‚Äôm scared to take this and hydroxyzine, errr. And you have to take it every day or as needed? I heard as needed - also heard if you get off it, the shock can be bad for your heart, real bad.\n\nI was prescribed hydroxyzine also! Kinda nervous to take it‚Ä¶ if I end up taking it I‚Äôll let you know of my experience. I really like propanolol because you don‚Äôt feel anything. The anxiety is just subsided a bit! It‚Äôs so so refreshing. Not the slightest hint of nausea either which always gets me. Good luck üôèüèºüôèüèº\n\nI got anxiety real bad with sinking feelings and it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt stand or walk for long without feeling tense or ima collapse or it‚Äôs all wobbly, pulse is crazy, just trying to feel better from that\n\nI‚Äôm gonna have to restart them and my doctor recommended that too¬†\n\nI know this thread is a week old, but Propranolol seems to induce Psychosis or some kind of mania in me for a reason I can't understand. Something to do with serotonin? It also seems to speed up my heart rate more often than reduce it.\n\nI hallucinated badly on it. Called pharmacy said it was a side effect that happens in a small percentage of people.¬† They told me to discontinue.¬† Please discontinue increasing the dose cause I felt weird so my pysch increased it brought out hallucinations.¬† Be well\n\nthanks for the info!\n\nGlad they worked for you I was on a low dose and hallucinated hard people running on my roof I actually laughed and called the pharmacy and sure enough beta blockers can cause hallucinations.¬† Benzos are the only thing that helps short term\n\nI'm currently on 80mg and was wondering if there was a safe, higher dosage.  I was just about to message my doc on mychart\n\n[removed]\n\njust prescribed today btw haven‚Äôt taken yet. Did you get dizzy the first time?\n\nDoes any one get muscle cramps or pain?\n\nI think it helps ptsd\n\nIt‚Äôs amazing but unfortunately I now get very severe suicide ideation and depression out of no where\n\nLook into POTS if it's helping\n\nNot for me beta blockers suck\n\nPropranolol is a game changer for my anxiety and overall health. My hypertension is ‚Äútreatment resistant‚Äù so my dosage is high (60mg, 2x/day) but my physical symptoms from anxiety have mostly diminished. The only downside is that it can lower my heart rate a bit too much so in those cases I decrease my dosage slightly when needed. That‚Äôs wonderful you are feeling better!\n\nYou take one 10mg a day?\n\nYes that‚Äôs the prescription dose, yesterday was the first time I felt that around 8 pm I really needed another (took it around 9 am) so :/\n\nYeah it says take 3 a day as needed\n\nAhh okay, mine says just one a day! ü´£\n\nMaybe that‚Äôs all I need too ima try it I just got it prescribed\n\nPropranolol is an excellent alternative to the standard SSRIs that are prescribed for anxiety. But I‚Äôd recommend taking it as needed as opposed to taking it daily. If you do decide to take it everyday and later decide that you no longer want to take it, you would need to taper off which is inconvenient.\n\nDoes it help if I tense up?\n\nI agree, it's the best medication for anxiety. No tolerance, no addiction, no withdrawal, and inexpensive.\n\nA life-changer! I take 40 mg every morning.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to me too. I went like three months with bad panic attacks and ended up quitting my jobs and not being able to enroll into another semester of school because I just couldn‚Äôt even leave my room without my heart racing. Propranolol 10mg saved my life honestly now that I feel somewhat normal I don‚Äôt even know how I survived during that three month period it was awful. I‚Äôm really glad you also got the chance to get prescribed this medication! I was thinking about going up to 20mg cause the 10mg doesn‚Äôt last very long"

And I told everyone to screw off for this weekend because I'm not leaving my house or talking to anyone. \n\nI finally feel like I have controll over what's going on again in my life lol.

I kinda just wanna kill myself‚Ä¶\n\nTalk to your doctor that treats your anxiety and ask for Paid Family Medical Leave (might be a different name based on your State).  In Massachusetts if approved you can take up to 5 months for yourself due to a Mental or a Medical condition.\n\nWork has made me stressed since day 1. And funny enough its almost never the actual work that makes me stressed\n\nHeavy relate. Wishing you the best ü§ù\n\nWe're on the same boat, bro.\n\nsame...i work part-time with 31 hours and i would love to reduce it but the money...\n\nCaffeine. Which is really sad because prior to my first ever panic attack, coffee really helped me at work. It‚Äôs been 1.5 years since I had a cup of coffee‚Ä¶\n\nI started drinking decaf because I love coffee but I can‚Äôt stand the anxiety.The taste is the same:)\n\nI want to do this too, but half of the satisfaction of drinking a coffee beyond the taste is knowing that I'll be receiving a drug, that I probably admittedly placebo myself with whether I need it or not. Just wondering how you get past that mind hurdle lol\n\nDecaf still has some caffeine in it so you're not completely missing out.\n\nDecaf crew ftw! ü´°\n\nAbout every three months I say to myself ‚Äúone coffee should be okay.‚Äù  It‚Äôs never okay.\n\nYeah I noticed this recently.\n\nI stayed off caffeine whilst I was having bad anxiety attacks and recently started having the odd coffee again.\n\nEvery time without fail a couple hours later my anxiety always spiked and from there it spirals from something minor to just an awful day.\n\nDefinitely no more caffeine for me!\n\nCaffeine has half life of 5 hours.  Do that cup of coffee in the morning is still going to be in your system when you go to bed\n\nThat‚Äôs tough, but good on you for prioritizing your mental health.\n\nTHIS. I'm in college and I'm soooo tired majority of the time but I can't even drink caffeinated pop without upset stomach,  restlessness, heart palpitations. Found out the hard way that hot chocolate at coffee shops often has caffeine in it\n\ni find i go through phases where there are times I can drink caffiene all day with no issue... but other times where 2 sips of coffee and im geeked out anxious\n\nI used to dependdd on caffeine. Now I feel constant brain fog because I quit cold turkey üò≠\n\nHeart rate or chest pain\n\nI feel the exact same way. Ever since I had my first really bad attack in May of this year, I've become hyper aware of my heartbeat, and it freaks me out.\n\nOmg I can shed some light on this. I have debilitating health anxiety and had Supraventricular Tachycardia up until this past August. Before you read any further, I have fully recovered from this stress trigger. For about 7 years I would have random SVT attacks that were misdiagnosed as panic attacks. My HR would jump up to close to 300bpm for 10 minutes, increasing in length following each attack. Id get one every 6 months or so. I actually have an EKG strip from an ambulance trip this past May at 286bpm. It was actually a life changing experience being rushed into the trauma room and having 15 people observing your vitals. Let me tell you, I know the feeling of always checking my heart rate. This past spring my SVT got so bad I had 3 45 minute episodes within 3 months, during that time I was constantly checking my pulse. Basically every time my HR rose it would make me anxious. It actually got to the point that I had a panic attack mimic an SVT episode with my HR reaching 160 bpm from anxiety alone. One thing that I had to come to terms with was my HR was going to speed up, it was an inevitable part of life. Although having personal experience with an uncontrollable hypersonic HR caused by SVT, I can tell you that your body can take it. Each time I had an episode of SVT, they checked my blood for a specific protein that marked heart damage, it was never once found. My case was an absolute extreme. I promise you, you will be fine, and in the event that anything did happen with your heart, I can also assure you that you become the most important patient in a hospital really quickly if so. Honestly of all of the health conditions I have faced, my SVT was the easiest because it was apparent that nearly every heart condition is extremely well studied, and treatable. I had a 45 minute operation to fix my SVT, I can live the rest of my life knowing it will never happen again. Also talk to your psychiatrist about propranolol if its really bothering you. Its a well known and very safe drug often prescribed off label for anxiety. It works by lowering your heart rate.\n\nThis is true. You can train yourself to realize the rapid heart beat doesn't need to come with anxiety. Then, you can keep it lower than it normally would go even if it's not ideal. Many times sicknesses will make it go up and it's normal as it's fighting an infection.\n\nWith that said, being in a good place neurotransmitter wise helps this. For instance, drinking too much caffeine might deplete your ability to \"not freak out\" but it's still something to fight no matter what state you're in. From experience alcohol hangxiety is hard to fight, so I ditched that and been 10x better.\n\nOther than that, too much food without drinking water has caused rapid heart beat so now I try to drink more water when it's elevated l, it has helped many times.\n\nI really like mineral drops in my water too, love the taste as well. I do worry about contaminants so I don't do it all the time but seems to being relief better than just water. Slippery elm seems to help for some reason too, I do pills right now but plan to try the tea. My typical teas I like are chamomile, lemon balm and black tea. Green and matcha I do as well. Teas have helped me especially to reduce coffee consumption. I dabble in black decaf and roobius too.\n\nYeah I get this. Casually just feeling like I am having a heart attack\n\nTell me about it I bought apple watch this year just to be able to take my ecg whenever I want now lol\n\nYeah, I spent 500‚Ç¨ on it and ended up selling it after three weeks, it was making things worse lol\n\nGet rid of it. It will make it a million times worse I promise.\n\nWhen I become short of breath. I notice I‚Äôm short of breath so I start to manually breathe, making myself even more short of breath. Then comes the high heartrate and then eventually hyperventilating resulting in my total freak out panic\n\nDamn I really feel the manual breathing part. Luckily I've realized that my anxiety can only ever worry about one thing at a time. Now its almost comforting to focus on my breathing because it means I cant worry about anything else. Also throwing on a movie or playing video games always helps. Try watching outdoor boys on youtube next time this happens.\n\nalcohol\n\nYeah I had to give it up, health and the hangover anxiety is just crushing.\n\nUsed that for years to self-medicate for depression until it gave me anxiety. Then I smoked weed to alleviate the anxiety until I got panic attacks. Same deal with coffee.\n\nWeirdly for me alcohol is the one thing that helps my mind slow and gives me confidence, which then reduces my anxiety. My thought loops are usually about my self worth. \n\nIt‚Äôs dangerous to know this for myself because obviously it‚Äôs short lasting and there is no way I want to create a dependency on alcohol. So far have managed to avoid becoming a ‚Äúdrinker‚Äù but it‚Äôs always a worry of mine. \n\nProbably a good thing if alcohol doesn‚Äôt work with you, you then have good reason to avoid it ü©∑\n\nhangxiety is so crippling. if i have the next day off, i sleep all day just so i dont have to deal with it.\n\nhere are some triggers for me (i can‚Äôt even explain why i get anxious because of some of these things : \n\n- people walking behind me \n- busy roads \n- walking in windy weather \n- falling asleep too early \n- not having a lip balm in arms length of me ( i know that is weird ) \n- people looking at me in their car \n- busy public transport \n- people shouting \n- big dogs not on leads \n- butterflies \n- ladybirds\n\nI have the same issue with the lip balm and for me also lotion. I don't know how to explain it but I already feel overstimulated most of the time and if I feel any discomfort especially dry hands and lips it sends me over the edge\n\ni HATE not wearing lip balm because the feeling of dryness makes me cringe or if my lips touch my teeth with no lip balm on\n\nI'm glad I'm not the only one who gets anxiety if I fall asleep early\n\nLotion not being nearby (I have dry skin)\n\nBusy public places \n\nChaotic meetings where everyone is shouting and nothing gets accomplished \n\nMy bladder\n\nMy asthma \n\nMoney \n\nToo many tasks\n\nPeople watching me eat\n\nNot having a toilet nearby. If I get anxious, I get an upset stomach, and that makes me more anxious because I start having tummy aches, and it makes me panic I‚Äôm gonna have to use a toilet, and the knot in my stomach gets worse‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a never ending cycle.\n\nI have a small bladder and also learned recently that anxiety can make you pee more. I literally always scout out the toilets any new venue I go to.\n\nI am exactly the same. And if I see a toilet I have to go to it just in case, even when I don‚Äôt need it. It‚Äôs the worst when driving somewhere unknown and not having knowledge of where the toilets are en route\n\nAre we the same person. I hate that it‚Äôs such a vicious cycle\n\nSame. Every time I go to a place, I immediately look around and search for a nearby toilet.\n\nI feel this too. And usually it ends in my running to the bathroom, sitting down, trying‚Ä¶ and turns out I actually didn‚Äôt need to go. Anxiety just made my guts completely lock up and feel awful without me actually in reality having to go.\n\nCauses me to run to the bathroom a lot at work, and I worry people are going to think I‚Äôm just avoiding work.\n\nThis was HUGE validation for me. Thank you for sharing. ü§ç I grew up literally planning each step to the washroom no matter where I was because I always felt ‚Äúsick‚Äù which was actually anxiety. But I was terrified of being sick in class and needed to know how close the bathroom was or at least the garbage can.\n\nI‚Äôm 34 now, and after feeling like a weirdo for years (literally a decade at this point), I came to find out that toilet anxiety IS indeed a thing for so many people!! \n\nA few months ago me and my mum went on a trip around Europe for 5 weeks. I live in Australia, but originally from Argentina, so I only get to see my family every couple years. It was the trip of a lifetime, something you don‚Äôt get to afford more than once. \nI wish I could say it was amazing, but half of the trip was ruined by my anxiety, and the fact that toilets are not that easy to find in Europe, or you have to pay to use it! which was a shock for me, cause here in Aus we have public toilets everywhere and always in great condition as well. Unfortunately this caused me panic attacks literally every other day, it was emotionally and physically exhausting, and by week 3 I was just counting the days to go back home. I broke my own heart because this was my mums dream as well. I still feel so guilty about it. It also caused a couple harsh talks and discussions between us and about my mental health, but I‚Äôm very grateful to have the best mum who supports me and does her best to try and understand me.\n\nBig life changes, not feeling understood, eating unhealthy food, and not exercising.\n\nFeeling misunderstood is a big one for me too. And then thought looping on what everyone else must be thinking of you üòÖ\n\ni feel you\n\nExisting lmao\n\nAnticipation of ambiguous or challenging parking situations\n\nTiredness. Stress.\n\nAdding the thought 'will this last forever ' to the anxiety symptom. \n\nInstant anxiety rocket fuel !\n\nthis is me with any new health symptom. I am an instantly self-diagnosed chronic sufferer\n\nTHIS!! i just want to feel normal again\n\nOmg yes!! I said this to my psychologist this week that I‚Äôm scared this is me forever now üòÖüòÖ I feel you.\n\nMy therapist tells me to always remind myself that the feeling is temporary. Mind you I‚Äôm currently in the middle of an anxiety attack and it helps but I‚Äôm still anxious for no apparent reason üò¨\n\nTHC\n\n10000%\n\nIf my eyes are open\n\nTHC and Caffeine\n\nTalking to other people.\n\nForced public speaking.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHaving too much going on in the week. Like, I‚Äôve been struggling with work and school and exams. Which is funny because I only work 6am-2:30pm two days a week and then I have 2 5 hour classes, a CNA class.\nAlso I feel waking up early stresses me sometimes, I just wanna sleep until 8, not 4-5am. 4am if I wanna eat a filling breakfast, which I NEED. This is why I‚Äôm going into healthcare so I can just do 3 12‚Äôs, I genuinely can‚Äôt ever see myself working 5 days a week again. It‚Äôs depressing for me. Too much of my week dedicated to a stupid job. \n\nMoney is the worse. Money stresses me. Grew up poor so I‚Äôve been saving money since I was 16, and bought my own car but if I take out my savings it‚Äôs like the world is ending. Even though I need it for food bills etc. sucks.\n\nThat‚Äôs one reason why I am trying to switch into healthcare as well\n\nWow! The '3 12's' thing is sending me! That's why I like serving... Making more money in less time, although having to deal with all the people during my work hours is the WORST. But you work less days, don't have to put as much time into getting ready because, in your case, only 3 shifts to work and not 5. Less commuting. Less of a lot of the triggers... Just, wow. Thanks for making me realize this.\n\nYes! It can be hard especially in healthcare but I think it‚Äôs 100% worth having 4 days off. I think it makes a huge difference honestly and I‚Äôm so ready. I worked full time plus another job for a while and now I realize , wow, I can‚Äôt do that lol! I love life and I wanna enjoy my life, not feel like my whole life is dedicated to my job. I am definitely excited to work less days and make the same if not more money :)\n\nBeing dizzy\n\nI‚Äòve been having the worst dizziness experience since a month, turns out my new noise cancelling headphones were at fault and absolutely messed up my inner ear. A debilitating experience..\n\nI feel you! Personally I love my loop earbuds they help me a lot. I just went through all this audio testing and stuff for inner ear and balance etc. My inner ears are fine and my hearing is above average which makes me more prone to getting dizzy. I also got diagnosed with vestibular migraines so I take magnesium for that now. Managing my migraine episodes helped me stay less dizzy and in return less anxious!\n\nI had unexplained, chronic dizziness for about 5 months when I was in college. One time it got so bad I couldnt walk, it was like I was wearing drunk goggles while actually being drunk. I basically survived by moving at a snails pace for the entire time. Strangely enough as soon as I got to physical therapy and walked into my first session, it went away. Never happened again. Doc thinks it might have been labyrinthitis. This is not meant to be fear porn, it was actually totally manageable. Despite being an incredibly anxious person, I got through it by staying busy. I came out of it feeling like a much stronger person.\n\nCaffeine, not enough sleep(same cycle as yours), Energy drinks, too much exercise/running, crying/sadness, travelling(going to a brand new place outside of my comfort zone which is my room or something im used to going to)\n\nHow awful it is that something like 'traveling' makes anxiety worse, when so many people look forward to it. And for the same reason that they love it, we hate it (going to a new place outside of my comfort zone). Damn this anxiety disorder.\n\nI totally get it. It's truly awful, especially since you think it's going to be totally fine but then when you actually GO THERE then it's just a mess. I've lost two jobs because of this, and it's horrid combined with my depression lol.\n\nMe, too.  I hate change and I hate travel.  I even hate the change from weekdays to weekends.\n\nemotions\n\nMoney/debt\n\nhangovers\n\nCrowds and traffic.\n\nThe fact that I have basically had no money my whole fucking life and how tempted I am just to leave this fucking realm.\n\nHi. I've been feeling a lot of hopelessness too. Please don't give up. Keep sticking around for the idea that tomorrow might be better.\n\nThanks friend, very kind of you to say\n\nBig fucking same. Let‚Äôs try to stick around together cause (what I tell myself) we won‚Äôt get to find out if we leave now, maybe the ending will be worth it\n\nIt‚Äôs just so fucking hard. I see posts of people applying to hundreds of jobs and getting nothing, and I‚Äôm here barely able to apply for one without forensically analysing the job listing, let alone being over picky because I don‚Äôt have the balls to just do what needs to be done. I‚Äôm so tired and life also owes me nothing\n\nNausea, starts every morning and then the shakes\n\nWeed and lack of sleep. Also no nicotine drives me insane.\n\nExtremely overthinking everything to the point of creating whole fake scenarios how that thing/decision/sudden change will ruin my life completely. And only if that doesn't happen I can relax. I hate my mind...\n\nI can completely relate. But hating your mind won‚Äôt help ü©∑ your mind is doing its best to protect you so you have to try and uncover why it thinks it‚Äôs in danger and work towards accepting these triggers. I‚Äôm by no means at that point, I‚Äôm still a work in progress but I believe trying to be kind to your mind is a first step.\n\nConfrontation\n\nThat's what kicked mine off in the beginning.\n\nNew health related symptoms. I instantly diagnose myself with chronic/dangerous conditions as soon as I experience a new thing. Recently I somehow pulled a muscle in my back while I was sick, I was sure it was meningitis. Also now my hands and face have been getting red, so that must mean I have MCAS. One time I was dizzy for months, that one sent me through a loop. I think I diagnosed myself with everything from brain cancer to multiple sclerosis. To my anxiety's disappointment, everything has gone away on its own. Anxiety makes it so damn hard to keep things in perspective.\n\nAmerica in 2025 and beyond\n\nOverthinking\n\nalcohol and health issues i don't know the reason for\n\nwaking up üòÇ\n\nThis feels too real.\n\nPeople\n\neverything üòí\n\nNot knowing if my relationship will stay or if my bf is going to quit.\n\nHealth issues...\n\nMe, too.  Any thing new totally shakes me up.\n\nDr google\n\nHeart palpitations, I know for some this is a symptom OF anxiety, for me it‚Äôs not necessarily it‚Äôs caused by some other issues I have going on but even though they‚Äôve been deemed benign, they send me SPIRALING.\n\nA hangover\n\nBodily sensations\n\nWork. I become a different, more high strung, sad person.\n\nIf I think about it too much.\n\nMy thoughts\n\nLife\n\nMy period.\n\nLack of exercise. I need to move. Gets bad after just a couple of days.\n\nBreathing. My own heartbeat. How tense I am in the moment. \"What if\".\n\nFeeling my heartbeat weather in my stomach, or neck. Or constantly touching my chest to feel my heart. Or checking my smart watch constantly. I actually threw away a brand new Samsung Galaxy watch within a few days because I was constantly doing the ecg scan. I'm now with the help of large does of CBD trying to block the urge or touching my chest to feel my heart rate.\n\nChronic pain\n\nWeed and caffeine\n\nLately, it‚Äôs been way worse when I have either nothing to do or have things to do but something is preventing me from doing them. Came into work the other day with a plan to get a bunch of stuff done and our EMR was down. It completely ruined my day even though it was back up within an hour.\n\nBad sleep and being sick\n\nWaking up\n\nWhen I‚Äôm super anxious I start to get really irritated and then it just escalates and gets worse, to a full blown panic attack but then I get angry that I‚Äôm freaking out and then it continues escalating\n\nStuffy air. \nI always need air circulating around me indoors.\n\nReplaying any past event (even neutral ones). It happens naturally and I always end up finding some fault in the way I played my role.\n\nLooking up my bank balance! It‚Äôs going to be cleared out, and I‚Äôm going to be homeless! Every single time.\n\nBeing around humans.\n\nNoticing my heartbeat. Makes it beat harder and faster which in turn makes me panic which in turn makes my hard beat harder and faster.\n\nSocial media, I have a huge problem with comparing, and I seem to fall for rage bait over and over again\n\nNoticing I‚Äôm not anxious üòë\n\nChest pain and palpitations üò©üò§ü•∫\n\nNot having food or water before hand, like a proper amount, I need my water with me whenever I got to mass at school because I will simply go crazy and have a panic attack without it.\n\nI lost my phone.\n\nCertain foods\n\nCaffeine\n\nLack of sleep\n\nNicotine\n\nHaving to hurry for something/somewhere. \n\nAlthough the truth is that probably it wouldn‚Äôt be such a big deal if I am late. But in my head, it‚Äôs always terrible.\n\nJust one thing I have anxiety about to go wrong, puts me into a cycle I struggle to get out of\n\nAny interaction with my mother.\n\nGetting a phone call. No matter the situation it will scare the hell out of me and crank my anxiety up\n\nWaking up\n\nA hangover completely fucks me. Weed is even worse though omg the paranoia is crazy.\n\nToo much alcohol‚ÄîI‚Äôm great for a couple of hours; then the acetaldehyde kicks in.\n\nAlcohol\n\nHangovers. Sitting alone.¬†\n\nDrinking as a coping mechanism. Sure, it might chill me out for a bit but once I sober up, anxiety is way worse.\n\nPeople and unexpected loud noises, especially screaming (doesn't matter if it's a good scream or bad, it instantly puts me on high alert)\n\nHearing/feeling my heartbeat. The awareness alone turns into an increased rate and force.\n\nEvery normal physical symptoms, no matter how minor.\n  \nIt must be cancer right?\n\nI can guarantee a panic attack if I have caffeine the day after a night of drinking alcohol.\n\nIt's a gift of sorts.\n\nnot getting enough sleep\n\nGoogle...\n\nTraveling. I used to love vacations because my parents would always plan them and take us to see a lot of cool things. Nowadays it‚Äôs anxiety inducing because I need to find out where EVERYTHING is by myself. Also I‚Äôm used to having a parent to fall back on if things go wrong but having that be completely up to myself, I‚Äôd just rather stay at home.\n\nThe first time I went on a trip with just myself and a couple friends, I had so much stress and anxiety that my stomach became completely fucked. Ever since that trip, whenever I need to go somewhere far away/ unfamiliar, my digestive tract just goes completely out of wack and I feel like ripping my stomach out because it hurts so bad.\n\nphysical sensations 100000000000%\n\nFor my girlies, the week before my period starts and during. Hormones are all over the places ü•≤ü•≤\n\nBreathing.  I've been experiencing anxiety breathing for over a year.  I catch myself holding my breath, and when my brain finally clues in, I gasp.  I've gotten asthma tests, and lung professionals have diagnosed it as psychiatric.\n\nGi distress.. diarrhea\n\nAnything that has to do with my health! Even if I just have a cold I start getting anxiety!\n\nCaffeine and intrusions into my safe spaces and periods, e.g. today I received a phone call after work, whereas my after-work hours are reserved for recovering from the stress of social interactions at work, and I don't want to talk to anyone except close relatives and friends until the next work day. Now I feel thrown off balance and on edge.\n\nDriving\n\nPeople looking at me while I park, people staring at me and walking past people when they‚Äôre walking towards me.\n\nAvoidance - I have to constantly challenge myself to do small things that can overwhelm me if I avoid them too much.\n\nLatelys it‚Äôs the caffeine and the heat weather. It causes me to panic attack.\n\nwhen you check your heart rate how its beating and how fast it is, then anxiety is gonna hit #health anxiety\n\nHearing the mail come through the mailbox on our door. Opening up my email.\n\nI've had so much bad news from emails and mail that I've developed a phobia for it now. I also have a constant ongoing panic attack while paying bills. (Even if I know I can afford them!) I keep making up the worst-case scenario all the time.\n\nGrowing up poor and then almost becoming homeless as an adult made me develop a fear/phobia for unexpected bills or messages from the bank. My heart is pounding just thinking about it! üò´\n\nWhenever I have an appointment or outing scheduled at 3 PM. Then I spend all day worrying about it and can‚Äôt get anything done beforehand.\n\nWhen I don't have enough money to he comfortable is when I get really bad.\n\nThe news on tv and uncertainty in social situations.\n\nThinking ahead\n\nBad working environment - it heightens my paranoia and I can‚Äôt seem to switch off and feel it‚Äôs their problem. I know that seems like an obvious thing to say, but I can‚Äôt just let it roll off my back - I obsess over every little thing that happens then.\n\nChecking my heart rate on my Apple Watch lol\n\nAnticipating social interaction and having to make conversation.\n\nWhen my body feels weird ‚Äî pain, digestive issues, doesn‚Äôt matter what it is. If my body feels different than it normally does, I always freak out and spiral.\n\nTracking my symptoms loll! I stopped and started feeling better pretty shortly after\n\nWhether it's at work, at home or running errands my arms and legs play tricks on me and start going numb/have pins and needles. A major physical symptom of mine and it makes me feel like something's wrong and I'm about to die üëçüèº\n\nFighting with my spouse.\n\nMy job. I actually have little to no anxiety when I‚Äôm on vacation regardless of if I‚Äôm just home for the week or whatever\n\nMy husband.\n\nPeople I care about picking at me or making jokes about things they know are significant triggers\n\nHonestly, anxiety over my anxiety. üò≠\n\nTemperature changes. Especially feeling hot to cold. \n\nWhenever I have a panic attack, there comes a point where I get a sudden cold flush and end up being sick. So getting a sudden cold feeling can trigger anxiety, leading to a panic attack. It's a whole cycle"

I often find myself feeling embarrassed for openly admitting that I love this movie. It's always nice to see other people who unironically love this movie as much as I do.\n\nIt was an *extremely* well-made movie - I say this as an amateur writer and a bit of a Titanic buff. It's a perennial favorite of mine.\n\nI think the flack is just from sour grapes...and from people who automatically hate anything that was extremely popular.\n\nAnd let's not forget the cultural hatred of movies/books that women tend to like....\n\nLabyrinth (David Bowie)\n\nYou remind me of the babe\n\nwhat babe?\n\nThe babe with the power\n\nWhat power?\n\nThe power of voodoo!\n\nwho do?\n\nyou do!\n\ndo what?\n\nOhhhhh this is classic.\n\nPrincess diaries.

    "all_comment_text": "Okay, you can‚Äôt physically put it in a box, but having an anti-anxiety playlist could be a good pairing with your tool box!\n\nany song suggestions?\n\nI like to listen to lofi beats playlists, and any classical or instrumental music. The Bridgerton soundtracks have so many great modern songs made classical. I've been listening to that one and liking the bridge between modern but classic.\n\nSome directions I find helpful for ideas - 1) songs you personally associate with happy memories, 2) something ‚Äòcalming‚Äô like classical or instrumental (if you have a favourite movie with a good score, I would recommend!), and finally 3) if there‚Äôs a song(s) that make you feel strong that‚Äôs always great to shift the mindset (e.g., I love metal and find it impossible to cry or feel sad/anxious to metal for very long)\n\nid probably go for bob marley. always makes me feel good!\n\nLol, this may be a bit strange, but I personally find hard rock/heavy metal very soothing XD. I dunno if this will work for you tho!\n\nAn instrumental song I really enjoy is \"Montana\" by Tycho.\n\nFor me brown noise help\n\nEver try comedy to get a good laugh? That's my go to.\n\nAlcohol wipes are my go to as smelling them helps me ‚Äúshake off‚Äù the panic but I guess it can work differently for everyone especially with ematophobia but maybe it something that could help! Anxiety toolbox is a great idea though ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nOoh yeah! An essential oil you find soothing could be a good option too\n\nI just purchased lavendar literally 2 days ago!! I put it on my wrists and my neck and take deep sniffs in when I'm getting those feelings!\n\nI was going to suggest lavender! I also find juniper very soothing.\n\nbought some lavender today!\n\nI have a lemongrass and orange oil roller ball bottle and it‚Äôs my favorite thing ever. It was revolutionary for me to be able to go places.\n\nI had hyperemesis when I was pregnant and alcohol wipes were the only thing that would stomp down my nausea! \n\nNow I use them whenever I feel sick and I find it calms me\n\nSniffing (not like huffing, just wafting them under your nose lol) iso alcohol wipes is also a great way to stop nausea !!\n\nThat‚Äôs funny. There must be something wrong with my nose. The smell of those actually makes me nauseous. ü§¢\n\nI love the smell of alcohol too, even when i‚Äôm not anxious just the smell in general. I find the smaller alcohol cube shaped wipes retain the scent and are much stronger than like wipes large enough to clean surfaces rather than just your phone.\n\nActually, there was a study that suggested smelling isopropyl alcohol was just as effective as top of the line anti-nausea medication for reducing nausea! [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6189884/)\n\ni have those!\n\nSour candy pulls me out of anxiety so fast\n\nSame! I like Warheads and Toxic Waste\n\nAnything that's surger free?\n\nLook for keto or diabetic candy‚Ä¶\n\nCame here to say this. Google sour candy anxiety relief, it can be very useful!\n\nChocolate and maybe some pictures that make you happy.\n\ni love the picture idea!\n\nWhat a great idea!\n\nI'd put in a fave stuffed animal. Never too old to cuddle.\n\ni have too many of those üòÇü§û\n\nNot possible üòÅ\n\nIcyhot, or muscle relief cream! The heating and cooling sensation always helps to ground me and give me a focus on whatever body part I put it on.\n\nWhy did I read that as \"icky-hot\" lol üòÜ üòÇ\n\nA phone number you can call.\n\nDogs also help lol\n\n1000%!\n\nA photo of a pet or, what i do is: i have a photo of me as a young child to remind myself to be kind and patient to myself. Also, peppermint essential oils ease nausea. A good notebook is always handy too.\n\nlove hearing the suggestions. i‚Äôve considered assembling the same to tap into for my worst days.\n\nPulseOxymeter, Xanax, Aspirin, Essential Oils,Inhaler,Gum/Mint Flavor. Vicks vapor stick. \n\nThats what I carry in mine. I always have it in my car. I dont leave my house without it.\n\nWaaayyyy off topic‚Ä¶ when I read PulseOxymeter my brain switched it to Flux Capacitor. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nThe pulse oximeter, or Pulse Ox, is an electronic device that measures the saturation of oxygen carried in your red blood cells, Also tracks your BPM in case you think your having a heart attack.\n\nI‚Äôve been to the year 3000‚Ä¶üé∂\n\nwhat‚Äôs a pulse oxymeter? what does it do?\n\nJust measure pulse and blood oxygen levels. Seeing good readings can heavily reduce anxiety, and it's fun to try and calm down to get your pulse and oxygen back to normal for me.\n\nThis is a great suggestion. Wanted to add I think a piece of paper where a breath pattern is drawn out to trace may help. \n\nLike a circle to trace with your finger, inhale 8 seconds as you trace the big circle. Hold 4 seconds. Then trace the circle counterclockwise and exhale 8 seconds. Or just trace on your skin with finger.\n\nI was thinking about a tattoo like thatü§£\n\nI can't leave home without a hoodie because whenever I have bad anxiety, I feel better if I can bundle myself up for somer reason.\n\nadd some snacks! I never leave the house anymore without something sweet and something salty!\n\nlmao I just saw you put it next to your bed BUT super valid too!\n\nSome notes written when you‚Äôre happy, or less anxious than usual. Just to remind you it‚Äôs okay\n\nI've heard sour candy is good for grounding during panic attacks/anxiety. Maybe you could put a few pieces of your favorite sour candy in there?\n\nWeighted blankets are also cozy\n\nDo they actually? I feel like I'd get the feeling I'm being constricted and would make my chest feel heavier. I've slept with them at night, but never thought to use it during an anxiety attack.\n\nActually they‚Äôre fantastic. I don‚Äôt like the feeling of being constricted either. But they‚Äôre a life saver during panic. The pressure of them is like a firm hug, and helps to ground me during panic.\nThe pressure that a weighted blanket brings actually is scientifically proven to help soothe the nervous system . And regulate your heart rate and bring you to a calmer state, faster .\n\nIdk, when I'm in a nervous fit I need to move around because I get hot and think I'm going to faint. Sometimes I lay down to calm my breathing but maybe next time I'll try throwing on a weighted blanket and see if it helps. \n\nI've tried using my dog as support before but I get so restless when I'm anxious that I just can't stand being touched.\n\nSometimes I‚Äôll wrap it around me like a cape or a shawl and just pace around. \nI hope it helps ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI gotta go find it now and see how this works. Thank you for the tips guys! ü©∑\n\nThey make weighted stuffed animals that can help anxiety, too. Lay it on your chest, stomach or back or even just cuddle one in your arms and the weight can help.\n\ni actually have an old build a bear that i took the stuffing out of and filled it with rice. works great!\n\ndo you have any links to some good ones?\n\nI believe I have a sharper image brand one. I've had it a long time. Google weighted blanket weights. They recommend weights based on your body. I personally like a bit heavier than what they suggest. Also make sure it has a removable cover for washing. Some you can buy super cozy replacement covers too. Just can't wash the actual sand or whatever it is. \n\nHeads up they are quite warm, but the weight of it on your body is extremely relaxing.\n\n[removed]\n\nproud of your recovery progress!\n\nThe little sand glass things that sit on desks. Theyre mesmerizing yo look at and help you temporarily disassociate so you are focused on one thing and not 900 things. \n\nAdult coloring books\n\nCrochet\n\nSour candy - focuses your body on the sensation/away from the anxiety!\n\nStomach stuff: Ginger chews (not crystallized) - I like the individually packaged Reeds ones. Chewable Pepto (or liquid, but I find the chewable ones easier to store). For the mints/gum, check the ingredients - sorbitol/xylitol/etc can upset some people‚Äôs stomachs. \n\nA paper with some comforting lines you can repeat out loud, or instructions for breathing exercises. \n\nCould be nice to have a pretty battery powered lantern or soft string lights in there - bright overhead light definitely does not help my anxiety, but sometimes full darkness is also a no-go.\n\nCurious why you would not want the crystallized ginger chews?  My love for them is preventing me from looking it up myself...üòâ\n\nCrystallized has more sugar so it can potentially upset your stomach more than candied.\n\nI‚Äôve read that eating a sour candy can interrupt a panic attack. I‚Äôve tried and didn‚Äôt work for me but it may for you.\n\na xanax\n\nThey have those cooling blankets now.  I got to get mine out to use.  I would recommend a grounding pad from Earthing.\n\n[removed]\n\ntelling myself it‚Äôll pass is my life line\n\nHeh\n\nI just carry around a flask\n\nDon't be like me\n\nwhatever works for you works!\n\nPeppermint oil. Peppermints, alcohol wipes, oximeter, talisman of good fortune, spinner, microfiber towel, chewing gum, sunglasses, tissues, bag,jolly ranchers, a water, listerine strips or spray, biofreeze roll on, advil, tylenol, pepto pills, tums, omeprazole, hair ties, small can ginger ale, dr mask to cover outside smells that might induce, hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes, travel toothpaste n toothbrush, a garbage bag, and a backpack lol to put it all in.\n\nWow!  Thanks üòä\n\nSome sort of handheld game, something simple like an old gameboy or a cheap Temu game that only has Tetris. This always helps me from anxiety to tummy aches. As long as it isn‚Äôt your phone or tablet (too many options)\n\ni have a switch which could work?\n\nIt suggest something simpler, [like this](https://a.co/d/1tRL7oF)\n\nMagnesium(powder form so it kicks in quicker) and maybe some cherry tart juice‚Ä¶\n\ni‚Äôm hearing about the magnesium a lot. could you explain more about why it helps/what it does?\n\nSo on a scientific level, magnesium diminishes or blocks the pathways that send cortisol to your brain(the stress hormone). Overall it calms down an over excited nervous system(which causes anxiety). Sometimes it takes a few weeks to show an improvement but everyone is different. Overall it makes me feel more calm, as if I took a sedative but not as strong. Majority of people are deficient in magnesium, especially in the US where most of us have unhealthy diets and don‚Äôt get the recommended amount in our daily eating. This is another reason why diet can correlate with mental health. Hope that explains a little bit, I‚Äôm not an expert lol.\n\ni‚Äôve tried magnesium before but it was supplement for. my mum always tries to get me to take it because i suppose it‚Äôs good to have anyways. thank you!\n\nbottled water, comfort snacks, a heating pad, maybe anti anxiety medication if you have it (I never take mine anymore but just having it on hand ~incase~ always helps ease my mind. \n\nAlso agree with the mentions of pulse oximeter and sour candy!\n\nI agree, just knowing I have my meds on hand usually does the trick somehow üôÉ\n\nLavender or peppermint essential oil\n\nThis is great! I also have a playlist of ambiance and ASMR videos for my panic attacks. It really helps me a lot. I also have this stuff called Migrastil Migraine Stick. It's roll on oil with peppermint. I put it on my temples, wrists and forehead. I also use a Vapo Inhaler which is just a tube that has menthol in it that you inhale and it helps clear your sinuses, but I use it when I'm panicky as well. Gin Gin chews are also good for nausea. I use all of these items I listed a lot because I get migraines, but they work really well to help me feel less panicky during a panic attack. I also really like CBD oil or CBD chews. I have some oil and chews from Charlotte Web. The oil I have is 17mg. It's sublingual so you use the dropper and drop some under your tongue, close your mouth and let it sit there for about 2 - 5 minutes. Then you can spit it out or swallow it. I spit it out usually. It works by going to your blood stream. The oil takes about 15 minutes to start working for me. The gummies are 10mg and they are lemon lime flavored and are called Calm. They take about 45 minutes to work for me. The instructions and dosage are on them. Magnesium Glycinate works REALLY well for my anxiety too! I use Glycinate because it's easier on your stomach than other forms of Magnesium. I just take one once a day with a meal. Be careful because CBD and Magnesium can make you sleepy.\n\nI put an Ativan in my box along with Imodium.\n\nAshwaganda.   \nCBD Oil.   \nL-Theanine.   \n  \nAlso, if you haven't already, get rid of caffeine and alcohol.    \n]\n\ni read this as i just finished my iced coffee ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò≠\n\nPropranolol and cbd\n\nSour candy! It redirects the brain when having an attack. Also maybe put an ice pack in the freezer so you put it on your chest or under your neck when having anxiety. ü´∂üèº  \nLove this idea so much!\n\ni always use ice packs! i‚Äôve actually bought some instant ones that you just snap and they go cold for convenience\n\nI‚Äôve been told that having sour candy on hand helps! I haven‚Äôt tried it yet but from what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs pretty helpful.\n\nOddly enough a nail file helps calm me down! Just don't over file your nails!\n\ni do this sometimes! i give myself a manicure and try to be as clean and precise as possible and usually by the second hand i‚Äôm ok\n\nCompression socks!\n\nA little bottle of essential oils to sniff to help relax and ground you. Something soothing like eucalyptus or lavender. If you have access to Walmart they sell them for around 5 USD. Cough drops are a godsend. I like gum too, but something about the cough drop being hard and long lasting makes it ideal. Clay or slime. Something you can squish that doesn't make too much noise.\n\nAlka seltzer heartburn relief! I find that 90% of the time, that helps with my palpitations.\n\nETA: And some sour candy! Maybe some warheads or sour patch kids. It really helps kinda \"shock\" you and keep your mind off the anxiety and focus on the sour taste in your mouth.\n\nI think this is so so smart!!! Im def gonna make a cute one id love to see everyone‚Äôs :)\n\nmines in a little lion king makeup bag it‚Äôs so cute haha\n\nA stress ball for progressive muscle relaxation therapy\n\nEdit: i like the really firm foam ones more than ghe jelly personally i can get out more tensenes sand frustration, but the jelly one helps me concentrate but it can also be a distraction lol\n\nSome colorful sensory putty!!!  And something that smells good! Like a small travel perfume . \n\nThis is a great idea though! I‚Äôll be sure to make one myself too\n\nAlso, I think any sensory toys / fidgets would be a great addition.\n\nA mister type spray bottle with water.  I spray my face and it‚Äôs cooling, a little shocking to the system, and refreshing. Also a face roller thing bc I find them relaxing!\n\nVapor rub to make sure I'm breathing\n\nrunning shoes\n\nSour candy and alcohol wipes (smell the wipes for sensory and helps nausea with anxiety) sour candy can help calm you!\n\nSome affirmations to read are very powerful and helpful! Here‚Äôs a link: https://www.hope-wellness.com/blog/tuxka10miyywag5qso02zxq8ibussd?format=amp\nGood luck!\n\nSome sort of citrus essential oil blend. Citrus is a very uplifting smell, you don't have to apply it to anything if you'd rather not, I used to just take the lid off and breathe it in\n\nAtivan? Lol. Kidding but I‚Äôm following for ideas for myself!\n\nXanax\n\nStuffed animal?\n\ni have many..!\n\nHot chamomile tea and a teaspoon of honey always did wonders for me especially for anxiety attacks at night! If it need to be bedside ready you don't need it to be hot just stick it in room temp water it will still help.\n\nThere are handheld fans with spinning LEDs on them that form quite mesmerising circles. Good for distraction from your own anxious thoughts.\n\nFor fast action anxiety relief, [this](https://mrnutsproducts.etsy.com/listing/1430227115) stuff should be in your toolbox. It‚Äôs amazing\n\nPulse Oximeter, aspirin, vicks extra strong menthol drops it's pretty good and the strong sensation helps me get out of my head, my headphones, diazepam/oxazepam for the real hard situations, acetaminophen, PPI, albuterol for asthma, hydroxyzine but considering removing it, and credit card is must for me\n\nWhats your go to nausea medication ppl?\n\ni‚Äôm prescribed prochlorperazine but the general fav tends to be zofran i think. no idea what the uk equivalent is!\n\nSomething soft is my go to. My tatty baby blanket is my best friend\n\nSomething that helps me a lot is having a word-search book I can reach for. It sounds dumb when I type it out- but reading, looking, and actually finding the words help me calm down when my thoughts are racing. Keeps me occupied.\n\nOh me too. I‚Äôm into fill ins now too\n\nInstant hand warmers (buy at convenient store) coloring book and colored pencils? \nA squeeze ball to help reduce anxiety? Your favorite snack, nice smelling lotion.\n\nFidget toy of some kind. I made a bunch for myself using cotton cord and wooden beads.\n\nI just created a free ebook for my website called \"Serenity NOW! Anxiety Toolkit\" It's got some suggestions for herbs, supplements, and flower essences you can try, but it also has a TON of information about things you can do in the moment of anxiety or panic to regulate your nervous system and calm you down. I'm happy to send it to you  if you'd like. It sounds like it's exactly what you're looking for.\n\nGum üëå specifically Extra polar ice.\n\nGinger chews. \n\nThe sucking/chewing along with the little bit of spice from the ginger can help preoccupy your mind and calm you down. \n\nI always have ginger chews on hand and have turned some of my friends who also have anxiety onto them as well. They‚Äôre pretty helpful (especially if you ever get nauseous during an anxiety attack)\n\nI love sniffing Lavender! Either essential oil or something like that.\n\nWhat about a SUDS (subjective units of distress scale) worksheet?\n\nI have eucalyptus essential oils to smell when nausea comes on\n\nMagnesium!\n\ncould you explain more on this? is it an instant relief or something you take and notice benefits from in the long run\n\nSuper soft blanket\n\nEssential oils\n\nCandle\n\nFidget cube, rubber band, and a click pen.\n\nSmall bottle of lavender essential oils‚Ä¶\n\nbought some today!\n\nA fidget toy like the bubble poppers or a fidget spinner.\nIf you‚Äôre like me and you have a bad memory, maybe make a list of steps to follow like the 5 senses grounding technique.\n\nSour candy\n\nHighly recommend a weighted blanket, it helps me calm my nervous system so much. \nAlso:\n- Relaxing playlist options \n- Bottle of water \n- Vicks vaporub\n- Flaxseed body pillow that you can put in the microwave, helps ease physical tension which in turn helps mental. Or a hot water bottle.\n\nHeavy on the Vicks!!!\n\nA flashlight, writing pen(s), crossword puzzles, radio (battery or hand cranked), first aid kit\n\nI‚Äôm hearing that really sour candy can sort of trick your brain into forgetting about being anxious. Might be worth a try.\n\nThis won‚Äôt fit in a tool box‚Ä¶ but hot showers help me.\n\nooo i‚Äôm the opposite. i have to be super cold\n\nLavender and a water bottle\n\nSomething soft and snuggly\n\nbaoding balls, it's a Chinese hand injury recovery tool, but the concept translates really well for anxiety. The practice is to keep them separated while turning in your hand, and keep the jingle from making noise. So, basically the opposite of bubble wrap, but you can make nice if needed. They're really affordable. \n\nPlus, one the anxiety passes you can get into reverse, non dominant hand, ect. Its relaxing and a skill I always found useful.\n\nA copy of Peace in Every Step by Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nThis isn't a quick fix bc you have to steep it for 15-20 but passion flower tea! I get the loose leaf in bulk on etsy along with chamomile and throw them in together in a tea strainer after boiling some water (usually the hotter the better since you have to steep so long). It's one of the only things that helps me wind down to sleep too. Definitely feel a difference when I'm feeling anxious!!\n\ni‚Äôve heard of this!\n\nFrankincense essential oil\n\nanything that makes you happy. put pins or ribbon or cute things on the outside of your bag, have some photos inside that remind you of good things. you could even put a bit of essential oil or perfume; a nice or familiar smell that will be nice but not overwhelm you as well. it‚Äôs good to have positive things associated with it because it‚Äôll be easier to remain grounded and not remain negative.\n\nWarheads, heated blanket, a brain game, noise machine\n\nCalm powder you can get it at Walmart Amazon or Walgreens it‚Äôs a great calming tool it‚Äôs just magnesium. I don‚Äôt know if you are a believer but I will always put on a sermon about worry or fear by some of my favorite preachers. I like dr. Charles Stanley, Joseph prince (love his voice very calming) and Craig groeschel. If not a believer I also love to listen to Wayne dyer. Lavender essential oil. A sky lite by bliss lights got it on Amazon love it.\n\nNot OP, and also not really religious but I love listening to Dr Charles Stanley. He‚Äôs a smart man and well spoken. \n\nWhen I was deciding if 30 was too old to go to nursing school, I heard him on the radio one day. No idea what the topic was overall but he said ‚ÄúGod would not give you a purpose on this earth and not give you time to fulfill it.‚Äù It was what I needed to hear. I was 36 when I finally finished nursing school and became an RN, and here I am 18 years later doing my thing. üòä\n\nyoga mat, eye covers for sleeping, candle, pillow or something to squeeze..\n\nVibrator. FR. You can‚Äôt be anxious post glorious orgasm.\n\ni do this and 9/10 times feel better üòÇ\n\nAnd some nice relaxing music with a relaxing picture like this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kCUwIi7qd2M\nGood luck!\n\nMe finding this at 2am is so comforting cause this was me 16 years ago - full blown panic attacks and emetophobia. I always carried Lavender Oil, Dramamine, GasX or Tums. Since the alcohol wipes dried out super fast I‚Äôd take two to three paper towels fold them into a square and soak them in Isopropyl alcohol and keep it in a ziploc bag for when I got nausea. I found original Purell hand sanitizer has the same effect for me.\nHypnotherapy worked great for my panic attacks. I had to pay out of pocket, of course, but it was worth it in the end. I had four sessions and it was like I had flipped a switch off and I haven‚Äôt had a bad attack since. I still experience anxiety but at least now it‚Äôs for rational reasons (like nearly being in a car accident) and I can get myself calm very quickly and continue on with the day.\n\nBottled water, photos of family/pets, play-doh or fidget toy\n\nsquishmallow (or any other stuffed animal), fidget toys, water, something that smells good, like a nice lotion or a candle\n\nEvian Water Spray and a mint nasal ‚ÄúInhaler‚Äù look it up\n\nSaving this post\n\nHello fellow emetophobe!\n\nI‚Äôd recommend adding a weighted blanket or stuffed animal, a handheld game that will occupy your mind (like Tetris on a Game Boy), and having a few guided meditations that you know you like teed up ‚Äî [this one](https://youtu.be/07j2hshKShs?si=Cs-BXiswcJbJ-nzY) is my favorite.\n\nreally intrigued about the weighted blanket, i feel like it could help a lot\n\nA vape\n\nHonestly, all the episodes of 'MST3K'!\n\nMy therapist said I should not have Any as when I rely on such things the problems start.\n\nthat might be what works for you but i and many others personally find it really helpful and my therapist is fine with it\n\n[deleted]\n\nTwist-ties. I turn them into tiny spirals which helps\n\n[deleted]\n\non the topic of smoking, i smoke blue lotus and find it to be incredible. almost instant relief\n\nHave a bowl of ice water at the ready to stick your face in. Sensory shock will help calm you.\n\na Journal\n\nThat's a great idea\n\nUnder eye patches!  I keep some on my nightstand, they‚Äôre very soothing especially after I‚Äôve cried.\n\nMaybe a small nug, or two\n\nThis is a great idea!! I think I‚Äôll make something similar :-) I‚Äôm pretty artsy and like using my hands when I‚Äôm angsty, so I like having creative materials around me so I‚Äôd add some paints, colored pencils, coloring books, pens, small canvases, etc. There‚Äôs a lot of mindfulness coloring books for adults which are super fun and relaxing!! 10/10 recommend\n\nFor me a trash bag üò≠ i dont know why but having a place to throw up helps me calm down. Some of the fear with my emetaphobia is the mess and embarrassment of the act. The trash bag/can helps me as its a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù place to do it (i have never needed it, but it helps tremendously)\n\nI heard very sour candy like warheads help with anxiety. I might have to give it a try later\n\nSour candy! It helps ground me when I‚Äôm very anxious.\n\nEye mask, hot sauce packets &amp; anxiety necklace.\n\nidk if this is just me but hand sanitizer?\n\nBeta blocker? If you have one.\n\n!RemindMe 5 days\n\nSour sweets, I know it sounds odd but it really draws your attention away\n\nI LOVE this idea haha following along to see all the suggestions\n\nWax Lavender melts (try finding a natural one)\n\n[deleted]\n\nEssential oil! Something sour too to help distract when anxious!\n\nReading this makes me feel like I have no anxiety lol\n\nWhat are the things for I dont get it\n\nwhat are you confused about? i‚Äôll try to explain!\n\nFood or snacks. I keep a few trail bars in mine and they help immensely to stabilize my mood.\n\nsour candy!!!! takes your mind off of the panic and anxiety and works similar to ice packs"

    "all_comment_text": "I remember crying as a little kid every time I was at a friends for a play date. It always ended in my mum having to come and get me. I used to regularly have nightmares too about things like our house catching fire. \n\nI was constantly getting sent home from school feeling sick and I‚Äôm sure it was just anxiety as there was nothing physically wrong with me\n\nOMG FELT THIS!!! I used to lay awake in bed at night making sure my smoke detector flashes a green light which meant it was working because I was petrified that my house would catch on fire!\n\nOh wow I always felt like I was the only one!! Terrifying wasn‚Äôt it? I still have an unhealthy fear of fire to this day!\n\nThis was me üòî\n\nSorry to hear this was you too. I‚Äôve been on meds for my mental health since I was 14 and I‚Äôm now in my 40s and my anxiety os worse than ever now\n\nSame here\n\nSame ! I used to always get tummy aches and worried and always felt scared . I never knew what anxiety was till 16! I got diagnosed at 18\n\nI was diagnosed at 14 after a particularly bad phase  - I‚Äôve been on medication on and off ever since. It‚Äôs weird to look back to being small and realising that I really was always anxious\n\nYep I know the feels , I thought I was always scared due to my sexual abuse as a child ‚Äò I feel that‚Äôs what triggered it üò©\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you, no one should ever have to experience that. It would make total sense for that to trigger your anxiety.\n\nI always wonder if mine stemmed from being in hospital a lot as a child and having to stay overnight alone. I was ill a lot with various things when I was little so it was quite a regular occurrence\n\nSo sorry for you. What kind of sick symptoms did you have?\n\nHeadaches, stomach aches and feeling like I was going to throw up. It never happened when I was at home, only when I was elsewhere so it must have been anxiety. I still get those physical symptoms now when I‚Äôm anxious\n\nI got sickly butterflies in my tummy\n\nPanicked when I had to come into class late, or go to the pencil sharpener across the room. Or asking to use the bathroom. Reading out loud in class.. the list goes on\n\nOh my god this hit me hard , anything to do with talking out loud I would be sick with anxiety . Every day of school I felt like I was going to throw up. Couldn‚Äôt do the register for the life of me or draw any attention to myself\n\nHaving to walk across the room to use the pencil sharpener was literally the scariest thing ever\n\nI remember practicing my part to read over and over\n\nYo. I get anxiety when I have to go to the bathroom on a plane. Even if I‚Äôm aisle seat. Getting up walking by a bunch of people. Ugh. I tend to have to give myself a pep talk beforehand.\n\nEdit for spelling\n\nUgh. Or walking to the back of the plane for your seat while everyone stares at you. Anxiety. üòü\n\nYep - once in second grade I was so afraid to ask to use the bathroom I ended up peeing myself.\n\nI somehow got into my head that my parents could die in a car crash. And I would always be scared whenever they'd drive somewhere.\n\nSo sorry. This is horrible\n\nSame.. this would send me in a tailspin as a child! I used to sob at the mere thought of them in a car, funnily enough looking back at it I was personally never afraid of getting in a car\n\nAnytime my mom was more than 5 minutes late to pick me up to school I would cry and tell the teachers she must‚Äôve been in a terrible accident and was not able to be convinced something terrible didn‚Äôt happen.\n\nOhhhhh i did that toooooo. I still do sometimes. It hurts physically\n\nYeah now I‚Äôm 30 and my mom didn‚Äôt answer my calls for a few hours when she normally would have and I called security in her neighborhood to check things out. \n\nTurns out she was napping. \n\nClearly I‚Äôve got a handle on things lol\n\nYeah....me too...... One day i called mom and she didnt answer nor replied to my messages. I called everyone and got no response. OBVIOUSLYmy first thought is \"she mustve had a heart attack and no ones seen her because she is in icu rn\". Turns out her phone just died.............\n\nI went through the same thing. Once after a snowfall, mine didn‚Äôt answer and I was home alone. Nearly an hour went by for a ‚Äúquick errand‚Äù and radio silence. I panicked and ended up going to the neighbors for help. Turns out she forgot her phone at home and there was an accident slowing traffic down. This was in the Southern US, where snowfall is a big deal.\n\nI had stomach issues. I was diagnosed with a nervous stomach, but they never did anything for my anxiety. I would get sick every time I ate.\n\nLiterally same. I was always told I was a nervous child by my doctors lmao\n\nsame here‚Ä¶ I would throw up so often too\n\nI didn‚Äôt like playing with stickers because it felt too permanent once I placed them. I would only play with the static cling stickers that I could move around. Also cried every time my parents suggested going to a park and flying a kite. I loved watching other people fly them, but was so afraid I would accidentally let go of I was holding it.\n\nthe sticker thing!!!!! i still do this.\n\nBloody hell, the stickers! I never connected that. I was always concerned I‚Äôd use them in the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù place and regret it, so just never used them at all\n\nI would cry almost every day consistently for probably all of my life. I remember waking up my parents to apologize for having a dream about smoking. I was terrified of Santa Claus and always calculated whether or not I was naughty (I think this is the biggest thing that made me develop GAD). I have a massive guilt complex now and I feel like I am going to get in big trouble for making easy honest mistakes. Probably just an extension of fearing not getting presents from Santa.\n\n\nI was diagnosed when I was 25 but my therapist thinks I had it my whole life because basically my whole childhood was just me being afraid of stuff that didn't matter. So I do not expect to recover from GAD any time soon.\n\nI was also afraid of a lot of things. I too think i have gad since childhood :/ sorry for your santa experience, i myself never believed he existed\n\nlolololol I believed sooo so hard in Santa because I met a mall santa with a real beard who knew my name and knew that I was going to move soon (info I didn't know at the time) and I thought that was really santa until JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL when my parents revealed that he was a friend of my grandma.\n\n\nMy parents let me believe until my brother and I got made fun of at school and were explaining to my mom how dumb everyone was until jokes on us we were the dumb ones.\n\n\nI laugh about it now but it still annoys me. But it just goes to show that I can be wrong about stuff which is the one good thing I got out of it.\n\nBeing wrong about something? That's literally one of my WORST fears to this VERY PRESENT day\n\nSame same I carry this with me always. I can be so sure put it out there and it‚Äôs wrong and I‚Äôm DYING INSIDE. ‚Ä¶no reason for this other people make mistake abut move on.\n\nI was afraid of so many things! Unless it was a Disney movie, I was always scared watching new movies (Men in Black scared me for goodness sakes ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).\n\nI used to be a crybaby and would cry at the first sight of conflict,be it mine or watching someone fight\n\nEdit:\nAnother sign of anxiety was I would apologise to my ex in a fight even if it wasn't my fault just to end it.\nWe are separated now.\n\nI'm 26 and i still hate fights. I cant\n\nI‚Äôm 42 and I still can‚Äôt handle any kind of conflict, even if it‚Äôs not mine. Hearing people raise their voices in that way sends me into a tailspin\n\nI refused to talk to any adult that wasn‚Äôt my parents (this included aunts and uncles unless I was in a really good mood). I was terrified of teachers at school and doing anything wrong. I NEVER spoke out in class or put my hand up because that would be the end of the world\n\nI now have crippling GAD and Adult Seperation Anxiety and pray my SSRIs start working again soon (I tried to come off and that was a no go so I think I‚Äôll just accept meds for life lmao)\n\nI remember having what I would characterize in hindsight as OCD behaviors. I am not diagnosed with nor trying to self-diagnose with OCD. That said I had very specific irrational fears that I had to perform specific behaviors to keep myself safe from, but in a very childlike way. I kept my closet door open, because the monster wouldn‚Äôt attack if it didn‚Äôt have the element of surprise. I treated all of my dolls and stuffed animals equally so they wouldn‚Äôt get mad and come to life and kill me. I wouldn‚Äôt sleep on the top bunk, because I thought that would make it easier for a T-Rex to get me. When I was *really* little I had to sing out loud any time I went to the bathroom, but I can‚Äôt remember exactly what the fear was there. I just remember that singing protected me from it. I had social anxiety pretty early on, but that was because I was a super outgoing kinda loud kid at first. When I started kindergarten at age 4, the slightly older 5-6 yo kids told me I was obnoxious and made fun of me for it. So I really turned inward and struggled with socializing for a long time after. My generalized anxiety started/got diagnosed when I was 19 or 20 and had my first panic attack.\n\n:(((((( that is so sad. My 6 yr old peers didnt like me either but i cant remember why. Childhood sucks. Are you on treatment now?\n\nNot at the moment but I don‚Äôt really have social anxiety anymore. Interestingly I think years of working retail/food service helped. Serious exposure therapy!\n\nI had a lot of worry and anxiety about my dad. He was very sick. I had a lot of social anxiety and academic anxiety - mainly tests. I spent a lot of time alone unless I was with family. Nausea, headaches, etc. Pretty normal symptoms.\n\nI compulsively confessed anything ‚Äúbad‚Äù I did and asked my parents to hit me as punishment.\n\nSo sad. I'm sorry:(\n\nToo many, off the top of my head‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôd get an upset stomach every morning before preschool and throw up in the parking lot. Seriously. It was apart of my routine to wait with my grandma outside and puke first. \n\nDuring nap time at said preschool the teachers let me put my nap mat outside the bathroom because I frequently felt nauseous from anxiety and would throw up unexpectedly. \n\nIf I was out to eat with family at a restaurant I‚Äôd take a few bites of food, get anxiety and have to stand up at the table the whole rest of the dinner while being essentially made fun of by my family (except for grandma who fought to let me do what I needed to do) I‚Äôm 27 now and still prefer to eat standing up. \n\nI slept in a kids mattress at the bottom of my grandparents bed until I was 8 or 9 and needed my grandma to hold my hand to be able to fall asleep. It wasn‚Äôt until my older cousin made fun of me for it that I pushed myself to sleep in my own room. \n\nI don‚Äôt know how I was never taken to a therapist as a child. My mom was a raging alcoholic teen mom who lived upstairs in my grandparents house, I‚Äôm also transgender and have always felt an extreme disconnect from my body and physical sensations so I‚Äôm guessing these 2 things combined are why my anxiety has always been so severe.\n\nBeing a lgbtq+ kid is really stressfull. With an alcoholic parent then...i am sorry for you.\n\nI remember having a meltdown because my parents thought i was gay, got beaten up and screamed at so much for so long. They gave me the silent treatment also. When someone ghosts me, it still makes me sick.\n\nThat‚Äôs horrible I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôve seen childhood silent treatment really effect people well into adulthood, I hope you‚Äôre coping the best you can \n\nAnd yes it definitely wasn‚Äôt easy but I‚Äôm much better now, thank you.\n\nWhen I first started going to school I would cry every morning until I got in the door. Went for like a year or two.\n\nI would panic like crazy about going to school, the first time I went, I cried for hours, didn't want to talk to a soul, my mom used to have to stay with me in class, after a while she'd stop staying with me, I'd cry still and eventually stopped but I still hated it and still got sick (IBS/vomiting) if there was long weekend due to a holiday and I had to go to school again, this continued straight into high school. Nowadays I do not get sick before going to a crowded area or around others because I hate when it happens and practice ways of calming down but I still feel the anxiety.\n\nI had been diagnosed with Separation Anxiety Disorder.\n\nAfraid of worse case scenarios all the time. Praying eveynight for the health and safety of everyone but being worried I might forget someone in my prayer or not cover everything. Scared to sleep in room because I might get kidnapped, the house might burn down. Scared to be home alone. Most adventurous things my friends wanted to do (walk into town on our own to buy candy) I didn‚Äôt want to because I was nervous of being alone and walking in town/crossing the street.\n\nOh religious guilt really got me too. In my teens, i used to imagine ways to kill myself so i could go right away to hell because i am such a sinner and a bad daughter\n\nI didn‚Äôt get diagnosed when I was a child because my parents didn‚Äôt care but there are home videos of me biting my nails in anxiety at least aged 2. I would tie myself to my bed so no one could take me. Lots of stuff.\n\nI bite my nails since im five \nI also used to pick my hair around the age of 7... but my *** beat me out of It ü§™\n\nI always thought my parents were dead if I was home alone and they said they‚Äôd be home at 8, and it was 8:05. This was before cell phones. This happened later with relationships too if I called they didn‚Äôt answer thought they died.\n\nMy mom said when I was little, after she put me to bed, I‚Äôd get up crying about not wanting to grow up. On multiple occasions. \n\n\nOther things were (and I still do this, I‚Äôm 30) is chew on the insides of my cheeks, and peel/bite the skin on my lips. My family always made fun of me for it or I‚Äôd get yelled at for having a red spot on my lip. As I got older I learned that was anxiety.\n\nOh I am so bad about chewing the inside of my cheeks üò¨ I have to make sure I stop before I go to the dentist because Im worried they‚Äôll notice and say something about it.\n\nLast time I went to the dentist I saw in their notes of my file they had ‚Äúcheek trauma continues‚Äù üò≠üò≠ so embarrassing\n\nHeadaches, every Sunday afternoon if school was the next day, I was 6/7. My stomach twisting and hurting. My emotions being all over the place at times. Throwing up multiple times every single morning for months at a time. I didn't understand what was wrong with me. The most \"comfort\" I got was being screamed at that it was all in my head and to just get over it. \n\nSo yeah, I had a lot of symptoms that were just ignored until I broke, then I got screamed at for it.\n\nAt 10 yrs old, hearing about appendicitis and being terrified that I might get it.\n\nPulling out my hair and eyelashes, picking the skin on my finger tips until they were so bloody my mom had to bandage and duct tape them. And my parents telling me ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt stop pulling your hair out, I‚Äôm gonna cut it off‚Äù was super duper helpful /s\n\nI was the only person in my family that regularly threw up.  I also hated throwing up/had (still have) a fear of vomiting.\n\nI remember being young - like 6 or 7 - and asking my Mom ‚Äúhave you ever felt sad for no reason?‚Äù and explaining that I feel really sad but don‚Äôt know why and she just said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.  She was rinsing dishes at the time so she was likely busy and not really listening but I just felt like this is just my experience I guess and obviously had no concept of anxiety or depression.\n\nLater, in Jr. High, I developed rebellious behaviors and was told I had an attitude problem and was taken to a Dr. for an EKG and a psychologist who found nothing wrong with me and I think that therapist more found that the issue was their controlling yet emotionally impatient parenting (Mom - controlling, religious // Dad - alcoholic, physically present while emotionally absent, abusive, mean, not religious).\n\nChildhood was not fun.  Parents married but overwhelmed and self absorbed, cared more about optics than supporting and nurturing a child.\n\nParents never considered I was an anxious kid, just ignored it and attributed it to ‚Äúshe throws up a lot‚Äù - which was maybe 4 times a year but to someone who fears vomiting, that was too often for me.  No one else in my house EVER threw up.\n\nAlmost all of the comments here hit close to home. Just my take\n1) worried that my house would explode if I forgot to off the stove (\n2) worried that my house would explode again if I forgot to switch off some electrical supply  \n3) cry over any damn thing \n\nFor point 1 and 2 I did off it btw\n\ndeathly afraid at night/in bed including nightmares, sweating, panic attacks and paralysis \n\nnausea, easily crying, social anxiety\n\ndepression\n\nsuicidal thoughts\n\nman...\n\nI cried before every test, every major paper, and every presentation. I was I'm choir and dance and cried before every performance. Nailed everything everytime- but simply couldn't do it without panicking first\n\nI was extremely quiet and was obsessed with being well-behaved. Adults praised me constantly but what they didn‚Äôt know was it was all out of tremendous fear of criticism.\n\nMy anxiety started when I was 2 because I'd get panic attacks,cry and bad stomach aches whenever I got on a coach or bus because I was scared to die but I was only diagnosed when I was 12. I'm now 18.\n\nSo many anxious moments and memories from my childhoodüò≠ and no, I was not diagnosed until college! I would go to sleepovers as a kid and would get so nervous about not being home, and sleeping at someone else‚Äôs house that my poor mom had to come pick me up in the middle of the night more than once. I was (and honestly still am) a perfectionist to my core and was TERRIFIED of getting in trouble or not getting an A in a class. Like you, if that ever happened, I‚Äôd have a full on breakdown and spiral with anxious thoughts. I had a lot of fears as a kid (and again still doü•≤) and thinking about them or coming into contact with one would cause me to become incredibly anxious. I have very vivid memories of my dad repeatedly telling me that I can‚Äôt be afraid of everything because it came up so often. \n\nI don‚Äôt blame my parents for not recognizing the symptoms, but I really wish I had been diagnosed as a kid and gone to see a therapist much sooner than I did. It made my first couple of years on my own as an adult incredibly difficult navigating managing and understanding my anxiety and panic attacks.\n\nI was not diagnosed in childhood, I still actually haven‚Äôt been formally diagnosed because I can‚Äôt see a therapist, but my social anxiety is as obvious as the sky being blue, so‚Ä¶\n\nAs for childhood symptoms, loooots of random spells of crying, which I‚Äôve only learned in the last year can actually be a panic attack symptom for some people (definitely still is for me). Had a hard time learning to text people when I first got a phone, cause I‚Äôd get so much anxiety over what to say and would put off responding to people from how much anxiety I got from it, then eventually just pretend like I never got the text because I was *so* anxious about what they‚Äôd think or how to even explain my irrational thinking. Praying and believing in a god was actually one of the only things that stopped me from having uncontrollable anxiety over things like ‚Äúwhat if a car crashes into us while we drive and we die‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat if I die and leave all of my family emotionally ruined‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat if there‚Äôs a fire and our cats hide and we can‚Äôt get them out and they die.‚Äù I specifically remember waking up in the middle of the night thinking that last one and quietly crying to myself for half an hour trying not to wake up my mom until I could get enough mental peace from praying to make it stop. (I‚Äôm not saying faith or praying is a requirement or the best solution for helping anxiety of course, I still had and have so many things I was anxious about, it‚Äôs just something that was and is true to my experience, especially not having access to therapy back then or now)\n\nWhen we moved and I switched schools for 4th grade I woke up the first day with getting stomach sick every way imaginable. I also would wake my mom up in the middle of the night to ask about death and other questions. So many other instances I could write a whole paper.\n\nDissociation and self-isolation to the point that I rarely left my room if I wasn't forced. \n\nMy parents didn't understand mental illness, so I would actually get yelled at for dissociating. \n\nIt did make me hard to punish, though. Like you can't really ground someone who never leaves their room and just stares at walls half the time.\n\nStarted off biting my nails, my mom says since I was a year old. Trouble sleeping since I can remember, feeling like I was nauseous and like I had butterflies in my stomach. Also just couldn‚Äôt sit still. Diagnosed with asthma around 7 years old. I had a reactive airway so anytime I would get anxious I stated to feel short of breath. And then the anxiety that I couldn‚Äôt breathe and I needed my inhaler with me at all times. The inhaler caused palpitations which made me even more anxious. Frequent bad dreams of someone breaking into the apartment, someone chasing me and I couldn‚Äôt run away.\n\nStomach pains before school, crying and throwing up before I had to give a presentation, crying over grades. I got diagnosed at 14 when I started getting panic attacks\n\nI used to (and still do sometimes) bite my nails down to the quick.\n\nWell one of my first memories was when my mom dropped me off for my first day of preschool. I was screaming and crying because I didn‚Äôt want her to leave me. There was a giant floor-to-ceiling window and I just stood there watching my mom walk away on the sidewalk while I cried and hoped she would turn around and see me and then let me go home with her. \n\nIn middle school, I remember having anxious thoughts that my mom would die. I was very scared about this. And it would manifest in some strange OCD-type rumination‚Äôs. For example, after school when my mom would pick me up, I would have these thoughts that I HAD to see my moms car BEFORE it entered into our school parking lot, and as long as I saw her car BEFORE it entered the lot, then she wouldn‚Äôt die. I think I was trying to somehow gain control/mastery over something I feared. I‚Äôm not sure, as I never told a therapist. lol\n\nI also got bullied a lot around this time by peers, so that‚Äôs when I really developed my social anxiety. THANKS Public Schools! üòÉüëç\n\nI did not get diagnosed until adulthood but looking back, whew lots of signs. \n\n- panic every morning about going to school, with no discernable reason (e.g., had friends, great supportive teacher, no bullying, etc.)\n\n- physical symptoms (e.g., headache, feeling sick, etc.) that I was convinced were 'real' - ended up that my poor parents got me an MRI just to be safe and of course nothing \n\n- specific rituals every night to ensure safety from bombs, intruders, fires, etc etc etc \n\n- didn't sleep over at any friend's house through the night till late middle school, would always call and have my parents come get me \n\n- difficulty with sleep for almost a year, having to get up after my parents put me to bed to 'check on them', make sure they knew I wasn't asleep (?? still not sure why that was necessary lol they are saints)\n\n- terrified of movies/shows/images not typically seen as scary or even ones meant for kids \n\n- was in one bad storm/tornado where no one was injured and was absolutely A MESS any time there was even light wind/rain for a long time after that\n\nI'm sure there are more that I can't think of right now\n\nOh god. I started having symptoms of OCD at 4 (obsessive counting to the number 4, repeating sounds under my breath, having to \"even out\" every time I bumped one side of my body, compulsively saying \"maybe maybe not\" at the end of every sentence in case I accidentally told a lie) and started having full-on panic attacks when I was 6 (feeling electricity shoot down my arms, fast heartbeat, fight or flight, sometimes vomiting, and screaming for my mom.) Although I had an extremely abusive friend at that age which I'm sure brought it out in me early. Either way, I'm on medication now and my symptoms are very manageable. I'm 22 now.\n\nI would have panic attacks as young as 3 years old. Started therapy when I was 4. I genuinely feared death at the young age of 3. Any sign of ‚Äúgore‚Äù aka a paper cut or even a scrape to the knee had me in a genuine panic attack. Hyperventilating and crying and genuinely scared for my life. Since the age of 3. Whatever the fuck happened to me at 2 or 3 to caused such intense fear, I have no idea.\n\nI really hated making eye contact, especially after I thought I may have done something wrong. Just couldn‚Äôt do it\n\nOh i too hate eye contact. My parents kept me forcing to do so, so eventually i learned. But now that i dont mask anymore, i barely look into someones eyes\n\nCouldn't pay attention in school and also dreaded being dropped off by my parents. I remember feeling like I was being abandoned every morning.\n\nLater on in life I would get sent home from school because I drank too much coffee which obviously is not good for anxiety. Would have nonstop panic attacks and didn't know why or what was going on.\n\nI would make myself throw up. I did not have an eating disorder, though. It was the only way I felt I could ‚Äúrelease‚Äù some of the anxiety. (This was in high school)\n\nIn 4th and 5th grade I would pull out my eyelashes. I would also lie to get out of things, and at the time I didn‚Äôt know why. In reality, it was bad social anxiety.\n\nI've had anxiety tics like eye twitching all my life, kids would make fun of me for it and call me names, went to several doctors to try and fix it and for some reason no one ever mentioned anxiety????\nLater on I developed the stomach problems that have now been a staple for when my anxiety is hitting really hard.\n\nFeeling sick in my stomach but it‚Äôs a unique nausea that if it happened I‚Äôd know I‚Äôm anxious.\n\nI remember an older kid who would play with my hair because she thought I was a cute kid. Instead of warming up to her, I would be shy and hide because I didn't think I deserved kindness and attention like that..\n\nStomach aches almost every day. Headaches too. My mom even took me to take MRI scans. Ofc, nothing showed up\n\npanic attacks that were misread as ‚Äúfits‚Äù or ‚Äúoutbursts.‚Äù extreme social anxiety to the point that i would go all day without speaking. behaviors like sleeping next to all of my belongings in a trash bag ‚Äújust in case‚Äù there was a fire or tornado, for YEARS. having to do everything in multiples of two out of a bizarre fear that if i didn‚Äôt, i would be transported to an evil alternate dimension???\n\nI had a very, very intense weather phobia. like, if the sky was perfectly blue and I saw a single grey cloud, I would start panicking and begging my mom to go home so I could hide in our basement with a flashlight and the emergency radio.\n\nI would also worry about my parents and sister having gotten into an accident or died if they didn‚Äôt answer the phone when I called. and the death anxiety that I‚Äôve had since I was seven or so.\n\nI was terrified to be seen or heard by others when the classroom was quiet. Like if everyone was having silent reading time, i couldn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt stand up, i stayed so still. If the classroom was mildly quiet, i couldn‚Äôt eat anything. I was so scared to make any noise that others would hear\n\nI would get stomach upsets when there's a thunderstorm lol. I'd get so scared i would call my mom's office and ask her what time she's going home.\n\nI'd feel restless when its 10pm and my parents are still not home. Id think of all the negative possible scenarios that could happen. I was just 7.\n\nI used to bite my fingers really hard to try and self regulate.\n\nSoo many stomachaches\n\nDid not get diagnosed as a child, parents didn't believe in it. Pretty much the same as now only worse. Stomach aches, and really bad headaches.\n\n I dont know how to explain it besides I would construct the worst possible scenarios in my mind then become convinced they were inevitable.\n\nMy heart rate was always 180 at the doctor‚Äôs when I was a little kid lmaooo.\n\nI wanted to move primary schools for eating sweets in the classroom, this sounds stupid but i took it very seriously. i cried and overthinked everyday, thinking id get in alot of trouble and i coudlnt have fun for a while , the pandemic saved me a bti since it lasted y5-6 which is when i felt it- and i rmember i called the police when my mum took too long to come back from the shop bc i thought she was dead or got hurt-. i used to overthink everything\n\nBeing completely mute in stressful situations. I‚Äôd also feel random waves of shame sometimes\n\nMy counselor and I figure I started with anxiety around 7.  I didn't do my homework and no one could figure out why or how to motivate me.  Eventually I was put in private schools, but that didn't help either.  I had no friends, which didn't help anything.\n\nAnxiety was just this unidentifiable feeling that something bad was always going to happen, so I frequently didn't try.  And I got caught in a negative feedback loop when I did try something and it didn't go right.  (Things sometimes went right, but it wasn't enough to overcome the anxiety.)  It's only been in the last 3-ish years (I'm a middle-aged adult with two young adult kids) that it was finally identified for what it is and I've been able to take steps to fix it.\n\nI was scared that if i accidentally scratched the floor with my shoe it would set on fire unless i step on it\n\nI remember being really young at birthday parties or events and telling my mom ‚Äúthe feelings back‚Äù and i would explain to her that it felt like either something bad was going to happen or that i did something wrong like guilt. my parents ended up ignoring this issue so it spiraled into panic attacks / depression crying spirals before any type of gathering in middle school. they still ignored it so I hid it in high school and eventually convinced it was normal. didn‚Äôt even know i had anxiety until my friend told me in college when i explained to her the feeling.\n\nDyshidrotic eczema. Fluid-filled, extremely itchy blisters all over your fingers. And nausea. \n\nNow I get panic attacks where I have trouble breathing. I had a pulmonary embolism in February, wound up in the emergency room. They operated immediately and removed 9 blood clots from my lungs. Did you know that PEs feel the same way as an anxiety attack? I have to carry a blood oxygen meter with me at all times to tell if I‚Äôm having a panic attack or another embolism.\n\nExtreme fear over irrational things. Not handling being home alone due to worrying about parents dying in wreck, whatever. As I got older, the fear wasn‚Äôt tied to a specific thing. I‚Äôd have days, weeks where I was in constant fear, with no known reason. It was like a switch flipped in my mind. Then I‚Äôd become very paranoid about everything. Complete loss of appetite, only able to eat later in the day. No desire for breakfast or lunch, the opposite of how I normally am. Peeing every hour despite not drinking more than normal.\n\nConstant stomachaches, panicky feelings, the urge to cry, biting my nails.\n\nMy parents were neglectful and either not at home or high af doing something else, that‚Äôs not here nor there. But I remember as the oldest, even as young as ten, I had to know where my siblings were at literally all times. I would close all the doors leading outside so if one were open, I‚Äôd know that they were outside. Could only relax if I knew where everyone one was. They were too young to know what was going on at the time as I barely did myself. In reality, they were only hanging with the neighbor kids but yeah. I‚Äôd even lie to make them come home just so I could relax for a bit. It seemed so weird to them at the time but they understand now that we‚Äôre older.\n\nDoes nail biting count ?\n\nYessss\n\nI was bullied a lot in school.  I would always have a headache and upset stomach 97% of the time.  Whenever I was in an iffy or unknown situation for me, my number 1 complaint was feeling nauseated\n\ni think my first symptom was actually a huge fear of the unknown and anything that you couldn't apply logic and rationality to. i wanted explanations for everything, was it safe? would i feel okay? how was today going to go? why do i feel this way? if there wasn't a clear answer, i grew very anxious.\n\nI would have a meltdown every time my parents went grocery shopping and took longer than expected.\n\nDelusions where I thought there were cameras in my room or drugs in my food/bath products, paranoid thoughts of getting molested or having my family murdered, nightmares, tooth grinding, body dysmorphia, physical ticks, throwing up in the morning before school every day, crying at friends houses because I felt scared\n\ni was having panic attacks but i didn't know what those were so I called them \"freak outs\" and blamed and shamed myself for having them. i didnt get help till I was around 19\n\nLots of crying, always leaving sleepovers early, wouldn't go inside a store without my mom, nail biting.\n\nCrying was the big one though.\n\nEach time my parents went out somewhere in a car, I would stay up by my window (which looked into the parking spot) until they arrived back, otherwise I would convince myself that they died in a car crash.\n\nI would stay awake until the sun came up watching the door, I put every single one of my teddy bears around my body before I could fall asleep, I was pretty much mute except in my house and with close friends, etc etc\n\nAlways worried a lot about health stuff and dying, even as a child I was a hypochondriac.  It only got worse as I got older, naturally because my body started giving me more problems with age, feeding my health anxiety\n\nI had my first panic attack around age 8. I was deathly afraid of choking. I used to chew my food as much as I could to avoid it\n\nCrying over everything, and then learning to keep to myself. I became very quiet.   \n  \nThen one day, I just stopped crying. I held it all in and became very numb. When I got to my teens, I started to self-harm\n\nI got diagnosed at six, but on medication the same year.  In kindergarten I keot getting headaches, so they drew blood and gave me a mri scan, it wasn‚Äôt till one of my parents brought it up that they looked into generalized anxiety disorder.  Then Covid and middle school just sent it skyrocketing.  I also could barely ever sleep alone, still struggling with that.\n\nI got diagnosed at 10 years old I would start crying everytime I couldn‚Äôt understand something so like everyday I got picked up almost everyday that year I always thought I‚Äôd throw up\n\nBetween the ages of 7 to 9 I remember puking before leaving for the bus stop for my school bus. Later I developed a fear of being late. I just had to be in school everyday, on time. \n\nThese are some signs I only recognised 2 years ago while talking to my therapist. I'm 35 now.\n\nI was shy. Thts it. Lol\n\nI was terrified of asking for help or other things. People terrified me.\n\nExtreme lip biting to the point where a whole side of my lip was basically busted from chewing. It hurt so bad but I couldn‚Äôt stop.\n\nConstant stomach aches and fear of throwing up in a public place.  I never force my kids to eat in a restaurant.  We can always box it up and take it home.\n\nI once had a panic attack that made my chest hurt\n\nAnytime I was alone. Even in the bathroom, my mom had to sit in on my showers and read while I showered. I had a traumatized experience, though.\n\nFreaking out over spending money for a barbie doll.\n\nI had Childhood Toxic Stress Syndrome. Upper respiratory infections, allergies, asthma, eczema, fainting spells, spacing out\n\nPanic attacks. All the time and I still have them all the time as a 29-year-old. I felt and still do stomach pain beyond what I've experienced with GERD (I was also diagnosed with that as a kid)\n\nWe always thought I was just constantly sick. I had constant nausea and ended up getting a lot of bloodwork done with clean results.\n\nStomach aches, throwing up, not wanting to leave my mom, having to sleep with her, picking at my skin.\n\nI was really afraid of talking to strangers, especially adults and i just wouldn‚Äôt talk to most people. Would also shut down if i got anxious enough or even cry- usually when i did something accidentally or otherwise that was ‚Äúbad‚Äù (for reference, i would usually only get a stern talking to but my own guilt was awful enough that it really wasn‚Äôt necessary)\n\nGagging\n\nTimed flash cards were the end of the world for me. Was beside myself for any timed test or activity. Also school was just hell.\n\nSocial withdrawal and avoidance of social activities. Begged to not go to school and camp and I would skip school and camp a lot. Begged to drop out of soccer and Girl Scouts. Never hung out with friends. Had really bad anxiety surrounding eating in front of people so I wouldn‚Äôt eat lunch at school. Really bad anticipatory anxiety before first days of anything or events. Then there were a lot more after i turned 14. That‚Äôs when my problems really started\n\nI had nausea and stomach issues, I would pile my stuffed animals around me at night like a barricade, I had a lot of night terrors and slept walk. I went to the school my mom worked at during elementary school and I requested to leave class a lot and would hide under her desk.\n\nI was diagnosed with anxiety at age 6 when what I really needed at the time was an autism diagnosis üôÉ\n\nCrying easily, hyperventilating, running away from situations, hiding in the cubbies or closet at school, struggling to speak if put on the spot or having to speak in front of a group, being scared to go to friends' houses for playdates, not initiating social interactions, getting nauseous or throwing up, frequent nightmares, not wanting to do anything alone, freezing or crying if my parents or sister walked away in a store, etc. I tried to kill myself when I was 11 to avoid a presentation in school.\n\nNauseous. All. The. Time\n\nConstant stomach aches as a child. My mother had my room painted with these different colored pink ribbons and it made me feel like I was stuck inside a present and I'd leave my room every night to sleep with my parents. They'd give me beanie babies to stay in my room all night. Sent me to sleep away Camp at 11 and I wrote them every day that I was miserable and wanted to kill myself. I refused to go on any field trips that were overnight too. I'd hide to try and avoid going to sports practices and games because I had such bad anxiety about letting the team down. Oftentimes I'd call my mom to come get me from sleepovers. I'd cry whenever my nana would leave from visits cause I was so scared she'd die before I'd see her again. Going away to college was also incredibly difficult.\n\nI would obsess over supernatural things happening to me, even though I didn't really believe it. I read about spontaneous combustion and every single night would like in bed panicking that I'd burn alive in my sleep. I watched The Mummy when I was 12 and barely slept for WEEKS because I kept imagining all the scarab beetles in the world were coming to get me. Also for months and months after 9/11 I thought every loud noise I heard at night was a nuclear bomb. So yeah, it was mostly insomnia. And here I am decades later at 3:30am still unable to sleep lol\n\n\nEdit: Ooh, also after I was in two minor car crashes while sitting in the same seat in my family car within a few months I refused to sit in that seat ever again, until my parents sold it years later, and had (probably my first ever) panic attacks every time I tried sitting there again.\n\nSleeping in the same bed as my parents from 2-13ish, night terrors, severe attachment issues with my mother. Praying that I would die in my sleep\n\nEdit to add- getting ‚Äúsick‚Äù at school whenever I was nervous and hiding out at the nurse/ getting picked up early multiple times a week\n\nOh there are so many. Got officially diagnosed at 22 and it came as no surprise. I used to be so terrified of thunderstorms because I was convinced there would be a tornado, and if the tornado siren went off? I would be trembling in my basement. My parents would try to go grab me games or toys to keep my mind off of it, but when they went upstairs to go grab them I was convinced they‚Äôd die because of the tornado. I also had a super irrational fear of fires happening, and I remember being in preschool knowing when we‚Äôd have a fire drill and staying as close to the exit door as possible for a quick escape, which also lead to me being so terrified my house was going to catch on fire and burn down. I also had bald patches in my eyebrows because I would pick at them when I was feeling anxious. For the first several years of elementary school, I would cry in class on the first week of school back from summer break because I missed my mom and felt like I couldn‚Äôt function without her. And omgggg the nervous gas! My family had a running joke because when I was really nervous about something I would have ‚Äúnervous farts‚Äù that smelled terrible. If my mom was toward the end of the school pickup line, I was convinced she forgot about me or something terrible happened on the way to come get me because the room started to clear out and I was still left there. Bonus points for if I was the last one left from my class. I did a project in my psychology class in high school about GAD and that‚Äôs when my anxiety really made sense, and I chose to start therapy not long after.\n\nI spent a lot of time in the nurses office. I was scared of throwing up or other people throwing up\n\nI don‚Äôt remember much of my childhood. I do, however, remember my aunt and father sending me to a ‚Äúplace of creative play‚Äù to make friends because all of mine were imaginary‚Ä¶.\n\nI ended up hiding in a tree fort they had and playing with my imaginary friends because the other kids made so nervous, I was shaking.\n\nCrying and feeling lost and unsafe\n\nIn about middle school, I pretty much stopped talking, like to a 70% degree less than I used to. I just couldn't think of things to say, even with people who id regarded as close friends. Id upon up more on school trips but once we were back in school again I resumed per normal. Sadly a lot of people distanced me from that which frankly was pretty upsetting :((\n\nI was sweating a lot all the time and had a really difficult time to sleep, I could go 3 days straight with no sleep and still had energy. Also a lot of overthinking. Ended up developing an eating disorder too. All this before I was 13.\n\nRunning away from other kids. I would sit on a bench in the park all by myself and wait for all the other kids to leave,then i could use the swings\n\nFrequent crying, rash on my neck, ocd intensified when anxious.\n\nHysterical laughter at inappropriate moments. One time when my parents were arguing and my dad was speeding, and another time when my dad got road rage and tried to start a fight with some guy.\n\n  \nFun times...\n\nFor me it was my body image since I was thinner. Also for some reason I didn‚Äôt like being the center of attention and this transpired when giving speeches and such when I would feel nervous af inside but on the outside I didn‚Äôt display it all.\n\nI would absolutely panic anytime my mom was out of my sight. I was certain that she was going to leave and abandon me, constantly. If she went to take the trash out I was literally in the windows watching to make sure she came back. There was one time I dragged my baby brother outside, damn near hyperventilating because she had been out in the garden for a mere minute too long and panic ensued. There was no logical explanation for this behavior, I had a stable home life and extremely involved parents who were active in my life and never gave me a reason to think this way.\n\nI‚Äôm reading these and relating and wondering if there‚Äôs any connection between our anxiety and religion possibly. Like if we were raised religious and that factored into the anxiety\n\ni bit my fingernails and lip a lot‚Ä¶and still do\n\nI cried a lot for no obvious reason. I had lots of tummy aches, headaches and nausea. Most of which I knew I was lying about but didn't have the language to explain how I really felt (or the belief that anyone would take me seriously even if I could). I was not diagnosed as a child in the 90s but I am absolutely certain I would be if I was a child now.\n\nAnytime I would sin I would need to write it down and keep a list of all my sins to make sure I didn‚Äôt forget to repent for anything because I was so terrified of going to hell. As I‚Äôm older I realize this is religious trauma. I was a child and I feel like my anxiety showed through my nail biting, feeling of always thinking people were mad at me, chewing on my shirt sleeves. \n\nI also had to stay home for most of grade 7 because I had severe stomach pain went to multiple specialists and the doctors couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with me. Looking back I feel like this was anxiety.\n\nI would feel my heart race and wonder if I was having heart problems (it was anxiety), I would sometimes have chest pains and get so anxious I‚Äôd make myself sick, I had a lot of anxiety about death and to this day I‚Äôm still prone to crying and biting my lips. I was diagnosed at around age 13.\n\nHahahahaha 1. I used to chase my moms car down the driveway screaming and crying bc I was scared she was going to die at work and not come back\n2. used to make my little brother check under my bed and closet, and turn the bathroom light on every single night to make sure no one was in there (or swiper the fox, I used to swear he was going to kidnap me, like had reoccurring nightmares of my mom being tied up in jungle vines while swiper has me locked in a mobile trailer trapped in a old timer porcelain tub) 3. have in depth conversations with my family on what we need to do when/if the house caught on fire (my parent live in a log cabin, so I also imagined it would be gone in seconds) and how I needed to get to my brothers room and push him out of his window. 4. wake up at 5 am to hug my mom and dad before they left for work bc i was scared they wouldn‚Äôt come back, and then would go back to sleep until my grandmother came to take us to school 5. cry and claw my arms walking to the neighbors house when her mom took me to school during 3rd-4th grade bc I didn‚Äôt want to leave my brother and dad 6. pray every single night for every great aunt, cousin, half-aunt I‚Äôve never met, bc I was scared if I didn‚Äôt, something would happen to them 7. any time I would go out of town without my mom, as soon as we passed a certain point in town, I would silently sob thinking ‚Äúthis is it, I‚Äôve gone past the point of return, I can‚Äôt turn around now, I‚Äôm stuck, this is it, I‚Äôm away, I can‚Äôt go home, what if something happens, what if they die‚Äù8. carried one of my moms tshirts and a photo of my dad if I ever had to try and stay the night with someone (I would like to add that I never spent the night without my mom until I was 16 or so, prior to that, she had to come pick me up)\n\nDetaching from reality. I think I've been doing it my entire life. And nausea. Lots of nausea.\n\nDreading the next birthday party I'd have to attend because I HATED birthday party games and the anxiety it'd give me\n\nStill a kid, but shaking, sweating, hyperventilating, itchyness\n\nI would go around in the middle of the night and make sure all the doors and windows were locked. I was scared that if it walked through doors I would be transported to a universe where everyone hated me. And I was scared that at night an army of cookie monsters would march down the hallway and kill me.\n\nWhen I was a kid I thought I had both a heart and lung condition because I often had heart palpitations and couldn‚Äôt breathe. It was anxiety, I just didn‚Äôt know it at the time.\n\noh man, this is stuff I haven't thought of in a while because I usually spend my days dissociating nowadays, but here's a few that looking back, I know were symptoms of anxiety. \n\n- crying whenever I had a school/friend/cousin sleepover and I had to stay away from my parents. I distinctly remember being in third grade and being in the schoolyard, with other kids dancing to Hips Don't Lie (it was a big big deal then), but I was looking up at the sky and sobbing and wondering why I was being so dramatically sad. another time, my aunt literally shouted at me because I wouldn't stop throwing up when I'd gone to her place for a sleepover with my cousin. I literally remember my stomach dropping as 9PM came and I realized that I wouldn't be able to go back home now.\n- I wouldn't go to school if my friend wouldn't show up. Saturdays were optional and she was somebody who was v regular with school while I wasn't. but even if I was low on attendance, I wouldn't go if she wasn't going because then I wouldn't know what to do or who to hangout with. mum was furious but I wouldn't budge. \n- I had an English teacher in seventh grade who liked me a lot. I was a good student, read a lot, and wrote poetry. I also was a lot into news and trivia and stuff like that, which she knew. so she volunteered my name for an inter-school quiz competition because she thought I'd do good. when she told me in class, I remember feeling so embarrassed because I was like how can you talk to me and say that I'm good at stuff (???) like make it make sense to me now. anyway, another kid jumped at the chance and I didn't end up going. i firmly believe that had I taken a chance then, I would have been the school magazine editor! \n- I had (and continue) severe social anxiety, especially when I was around peers. wouldn't get up in a class, would practice my lines if we were reading in class, would hold on to an apple core for three hours because I couldn't get up and walk to the dustbin in front of everyone. i remember we had a play in 9th grade, wherein I'd contributed to writing it a lot and had a medium-length role, which was freaking me out. i however contracted chicken pox maybe a week before the play, and my god, the relieve I felt at the time. I'd been having sleepless nights before that. \n- I always struggled with making friends. i would always hang out with people who were much much older (I had an auntie I'd walk with during the evening for whom I'd ditch my friends and wait for her in front of her house) or much younger (at summer camps, I'd play with my younger sister's friends, instead of my own)!\n- I was also, and continue to be, a compulsive nail biter.\n\nI used to lay awake at sleepovers and plot how I could escape and run away back to my house. I would pay attention on the drive over so that I always knew how I could get back home by foot if I needed to. One time at a sleepover at my next door neighbor‚Äôs house I really did leave not tell anyone. The social anxiety of group sleepovers was real. I hated that I was trapped there and couldn‚Äôt go to sleep when I wanted to.\n\nI would freak out and refuse to get out of the car whenever I had to go to anything - soccer practice, guitar lesson, play date, etc.\n\nAlways horrible stomach issues. Ripping my hair out, picking at my fingers, barely could do a sleep over- I‚Äôm ok with that one lol\n\nI was absolutely terrified of thunderstorms starting at age 4. If it was the slightest bit cloudy I would start having a meltdown. \nI think it stems from my school having a metal roof and the first time it ever hailed goofball size.\n\nI would get ‚Äútummy aches‚Äù and nightmares a lot. \nSome separation anxiety from my parents when they dropped me off at school.\n\nBreathlessness; feeling like I couldn't get enough air in my lungs\n\nI was scared of everything. From thinking that my ears were closing to terror of going to school to anticipation anxiety of anything out of my routine. Even going to the bathroom was horror. I was diagnosed with GAD at 12 years old.¬†\n\nI would hide in my closet and bite my arms until they bled.\n\n[deleted]\n\nRipping out my eyelashes at night when I couldn't sleep, which was all the time\n\nI threw up before school, terrible nightmares, trouble falling asleep.\n\nI‚Äôd chew holes through my long sleeve shirts, sometimes eat my hair, bite my nails, and bite the insides my cheeks.\n\ntummy aches, tummy aches, tummy aches\n\ngot diagnosed age 8. my stomach is still my most prominent issue relating to anxiety.\n\nNightmares, repetitive praying, vomiting, crying\n\nNightmares, fearful of being alone, and then it manifested as anger in my teens. My parents brushed it off as ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù\n\nI didn‚Äôt have any really besides not looking directly into someone‚Äôs eyes or talking to strangers! Now I‚Äôm a wreck though üò≠\n\nA big one for me was being terrified of something happened to my siblings. When my sister (who is now almost 18) was a baby, I had a nightmare that she got kidnapped that I can still remember pretty vividly. Whenever we would be in public and one of them would walk slower/faster than the rest of us I would always yell at them to stay with us (which my parents hated) because I was just so scared of something happening to them\n\nAnother thing was weirdly irrational fears. When I was 9 or 10, our furnace overheated and the fire alarms went off at like 5am. We had to get out of the house and the fire department came. But what I took away from this was- when my mom came and woke us up I was sleeping facing the wall. I always slept facing out towards the room, but this time I was facing the wall and our house almost caught fire. For YEARS after that I was deathly afraid of sleeping towards the wall. I thought that if I did, our house would burn down or something else horrible would happen\n\nSome of my first memories of anxiety were my horrible fear of storms as a child. I used to get nervous and get a pit in the bottom of my stomach if I saw dark clouds. When the thunder boomed and lightning flashed I would start to cry in panic. I‚Äôd always run to my parents for comfort, but nothing they told me could get me to calm down.\n\nI didn't have anxiety during my childhood, but I know exactly why I developed my health anxiety.\n\nMy mother would think ALL the time something was wrong with me. \"Oh you CERTAINLY have X\" \"Just wait, in my case it also only started when I was 24yo.\" \"You know I suffer from Y, and it was detected after 14 years, but I always have had the symptoms, I am CERTAIN that's the case with you too.\"\n\nEvery. Single. Day. Multiple times. \n\nShe would deliberately take me off school because I \"couldn't endure much physical stress\" because \"that \"makes me instantly sick\".\n\nWell, now, 12 years later, I am stil in PERFECT physical condition, but I wake up every night thinking I die of a stroke, or have cancer, or whatever the fuck my mind thinks. Don't have a single normal day.\n\nI used to follow the friends I liked around everywhere they went in school. I now realize this as an anchoring behavior because I was uncomfortable being by myself in social situations so I blended in with everyone else. It's the one I can think of off the top of my head but I'm sure there's more signs honestly.\n\nMy only symptom was fainting occasionally especially from needles. As an adult it expanded into fixating thoughts, hypochondria, hyper awareness of bodily sensations, insomnia, teeth grinding\n\nScared to sleep to be alone with an adult\n\nI would wake up in the middle of the night shaking and sweating feeling intense doom, but I was too young to realize why. One night I woke up in a panic thinking my throat was closing and that I couldn‚Äôt breathe, but I was hyperventilating from panic. My anxiety also affected my schoolwork. I was always afraid to go anywhere and dreaded going to school and to friends‚Äô houses.\n\nI was in therapy but from what I remember as a child it was me just talking about how I felt and talking about things that made me happy. I was never on any medications until my early twenties. I‚Äôm in my mid-thirties and still take an antidepressant and Ativan for my anxiety.\n\nDiagnosed at 11. Panic attacks. Extremely clingy to my mum\n\nI was always worried that my parents/grandparents would die. Also, I actively faked being sick at school at ~8 so my mom would come get me so I could be with her so she wouldn‚Äôt die.\n\nI also didn‚Äôt like sleepovers because I would get homesick/anxious with change in routine.\n\nI had chronic \"funny tummies\" as a kid. Nausea and butterflies. Stomach pain and constipation. I was very quiet. And whenever I had to go for a sleepover I'd cry because I didn't want to be away from my parents overnight. I also would have random intrusive thoughts. I remember having a bath at like 8 years old by myself, and just sitting in the tub crying because I got it into my head \"one day my parents are going to die, one day I'M going to die\". I didn't realize until I was around 19 that all of that wasn't normal."

    "all_comment_text": "It‚Äôs definitely gotta be the ‚Äúoh fuck am I having a heart attack?‚Äù\n\nI usually have that, but I get ice pick headaches and had a couple today so today's anxiety was mostly \"It's an aneurysm\" despite that I've lived with ice pick headaches my entire life.\n\nGOD they‚Äôre so scary. Like they‚Äôre super inconvenient and annoying but when your anxiety is bad they‚Äôre the devil.\n\nI miss when my panic attacks were uncontrollable crying rocking on the floor pulling my hair out. \n\nThey *sucked* but it's better than the heart palpitations light headed dizzy feeling.\n\nLegit. As soon as I hit 40 the fear of actually dying started hitting me\n\nIt's EXHAUSTING. Like surely by this age we'd know better or care less. Aneurism? Finally. Heart attack? Hope it's quick.\n\n\nYES!!!!! And even though you've felt this a million times before, it always feels like the first time\n\nThis. I tell myself every time that this isn't the first time I've felt like this but it never helps. It always feels somehow worse than all the times before.\n\ncurrently am struggling with this. i‚Äôm convinced i am having a heart attack, with chest pain that is inconsistent, tingly legs and it feels like i get dizzy and nauseous at times. i wish i could just know that it was serious or not. it‚Äôs terrible\n\nYep üëç that‚Äôs mine also - so scary üòü \nBeen battling this for years !!\n\nthe symptoms that are closely related to heart attack symptoms. or constant state of fear like at any moment i‚Äôm gonna die\n\nSame :( and the chest tightness lasts for days which gives me more anxiety. I can‚Äôt sleep thinking about this, which in turn gives me more anxiety.\n\nyesss the weird sensations that come from dizziness. plus chest tightness, heart palpitations/flutters, shortness of breath and dpdr.\n\nOOOOFFF i hate that my anxiety triggers my dpdr dailyyyyy\n\nThe dpdr fucks me up the worst because I feel like I‚Äôm actually losing it. It‚Äôs so scary to feel so out of your head and body.\n\nit‚Äôs realllyyyyy scary, dpdr for me is a daily thing that comes and goes so im mostly used to it but there was a time where i was sooooo stuck in a dpdr state for three months where it was so scary looking at people and it was terrifying looking in the mirror cuz i didn‚Äôt recognize myself\n\nThat sounds so scary to be in that state for an extended time, I am so sorry you went through that! \n\nIt‚Äôs a relatively new symptom in my adult life, although I do remember feeling this way as a kiddo. It‚Äôs comforting to know I‚Äôm not alone, but I‚Äôm bummed to know it‚Äôs something so many suffer with.\n\nwell just some advice! what got me out of that three month long state of dpdr was working out, spending more time outdoors, &amp;‚Äô breathing exercises! so there is hope in bringing down that feeling but ofc it takes time!\n\nThank you so much!! That is such solid advice. This past week I decided to delete my social media apps (other than Reddit) to see how that helps. It‚Äôs too soon to say but I‚Äôd like to think it‚Äôs making a positive difference, and encouraging me to get outside more. I‚Äôm also working on treating my PCOS symptoms with supplements and such, hoping that might also make a positive impact on my mental health.\n\nWhat is dpdr?\n\nits depersonalization/derealization. basically you feel like your out of touch with reality, as if you‚Äôre watching your life in 3rd person, it feels like you are watching everything behind a movie screen.\n\nThanks for explaining. Didn't know it was a thing! I experience it a lot and a while back I was telling my mom how I'm stressed because I don't feel like I exist anymore and nothing seems real.\n\nWait! That‚Äôs a symptom of anxiety?! I‚Äôve been feeling this way for months, it follows with feeling like I‚Äôm going to faint.\n\nheart palpitations are terribleüòî\n\nChest pain, nervousness, sweating, panicking, feel like im dying, cant go out iff i do i need to be home asap and even then symptoms seem to get worse\n\nChest pain is the worse. It sucks.\n\nI keep thinking im having heart failure, not nice at all, hope your wellüëç\n\nYes I dnt wanna go out the house for nothing . I just wanna stay in my safe place and that‚Äôs my room in my bed . I wasnt like this before I took thyroid medicine . Now I been like this for months ü•∫\n\n[deleted]\n\nExactly the same here\n\nI get that too. It started suddenly. I was terrified that it could MS or something.¬†\n\nThe intense I‚Äôm about to faint feeling that hits out of literally no where and makes my heart drop . Feels like my breathing stops completely and like I‚Äôm about to drop dead out of no where . Very scary BUT felt this way so many times the last 4 years I know it‚Äôs anxiety since by now I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd be dead if it was something serious the first time it happened\n\nomg that happens to me pretty often, which is weird because I‚Äôve never fainted but part of me is convinced ima faint\n\nThe high heart rate and chest pressure. I thought I was dying.\n\nI get this daily, its terrifying\n\nI got one yesterday when I accidentally greened out\n\nI have health related anxiety so I think I‚Äôm dying everyday w some new imaginary illness\n\nThe heart attack feeling is definitely very scary but recently I have a new anxiety , physical symptom that is scary In a whole different way. Recently I've been getting really bad stomach cramps whenever I have a panic attack. And last time I had a panic attack I nearly shit myself. \n\nI'm kind of terrified for the day that I have a panic attack in public and just shit myself now. Though as I'm sitting at home on a healthy head space right now I can't help but laugh about it a little bit.\n\nomggg my stomach hurts super bad when I panic so I hellaaaa get what you mean!\n\nMine are definitely the mental symptoms like being hyper aware of my thoughts\n\noof yea those aren‚Äôt fun either, I constantly worry about huge emergency will happen when im asleep so it makes it hard to like actually rest\n\nDude. Meditate.\nIt really helps.\n\nthe chest tightness.. not being able to breathe. always so scary\n\nI‚Äôve definitely had the crap scared out of me from thinking I was having a heart attack. \n\nStroke like symptoms - feeling like my body is instantly numbing and I can‚Äôt find the words.\n\nHere the past few days it‚Äôs been head related stuff. Headaches, immense amount of pressure in my forehead. Dizziness. My ENT actually just saw me and said the crystals in my ear are off balance so I have to get vestibular therapy. I am getting a CT of my sinuses next week since this has been ongoing but recently worse.\n\nomgggg meee! I‚Äôve had stroke symptoms on and off for like a month and then it made it worse after someone I know personally had a stroke. health anxiety is nottttt fun\n\nYES &amp; right now I‚Äôm in school and taking some medical classes and the whole section about strokes and heart attacks had my physical symptoms At an all time high.\n\nIt also sucks because my anti anxiety medication makes me feel like my face is going numb on one side and while I don‚Äôt take it that often because of that reason, it scares me when i need it enough to take it &amp; end up freaking out more\n\nOMG YESSSS!! I like hate hearing people around me to talk about it but it‚Äôs been a topic brought up daily rn, no all of a sudden I feel like my face is droopy even though it‚Äôs not. smhhhh\n\nThe other day I was meeting a new coworker and I noticed that she had major dark circles around her eyes but didn‚Äôt ask her about it because it‚Äôs not my business lol but she went on to say that she has extremely low iron and had even had a heart attack at work a year prior and it sent me into an internal panic .\n\nThe dropping when I walk or stand or lay\n\nI get really bad neurological symptoms. Tingling, numbness, chills, twitches, jerks‚Ä¶ I thought I had some kind of disease for the longest (still not convinced that I don‚Äôt) but doctors assure me I‚Äôm fine\n\nLiterally same. I was freaking out over possibly having MS or something. It's hard to think that it's just my anxiety.¬†\n\nNausea\n\nExactly same thing. I can't speak well when my anxiety is high. Like, I choose the wrong words, don't agree verbs with subjects, can't finish sentences and have to rephrase... it's a nightmare. I do get that this happens every now and then to everyone (well, some of it, at least), but when you're trying to have a normal conversation with someone and you can't make sense, it's hell. And of course, I get even more self-aware about my anxious state, which makes it even harder to speak. I'm pretty sure a lot of people think I'm just an idiot who can't articulate his thoughts.\n\nusually it's the feeling of impending doom. I also tend to slur my speech, which doesn't help in trying to get me to calm down because no one can understand me.. üòû but the feeling as if something really bad is about to happen and you're gonna die or you feel like you really need to go to the hospital is absolutely terrifying and it feels never-ending.\n\n the last time this happened, I was looking towards the sky at night really far away from home and I started to get a feeling that nothing was real. then the impending doom started and I felt like having a heart attack or something.. it was also at a McDonalds drive thru. üò≠\n\nDerealization my beloved ‚ô°\n\nThis group always makes me feel less lonely bc I swear people who don‚Äôt deal with bad anxiety and have bad physical symptoms don‚Äôt understand me and they cause me to freak out more when they want me to go to the hospital or doctor im just like no no this is my legit anxiety not only being presented mentally but also physically\n\nyesss! I have people say ‚Äúyou should go to a doctor‚Äù but that‚Äôs the thing I knowwww it‚Äôs anxiety it‚Äôs just scary and it makes me feel physically bad that‚Äôs all!\n\nI've been told it's a \"somatic disorder\", like our bodies turn it physical WAY more and much more intensely than the average person.\n\nDerealization- nothing will ever be the same again ive lost my mind\n\nhallucinations and delusions (like thinking someone is trying to murder me)\n\nface numbness\n\nImpending doom and being hyper conscious with my heart\n\nThe fact that as soon as I start to accept a symptom as anxiety, my anxiety creates a new symptom. Ie dizziness- took about a year to get used to. Then my heart starts doing flips. Took a while to get used to. Then I can‚Äôt speak right. Etc etc. it‚Äôs nuts and I hate it.\n\nMy body will start to feel like it buzzing right before my chest gets super tight. Scares me every time.\n\nFeeling like I‚Äôm on fire.\n\nI feel like I'm gonna die from a heart attack. It happens even more as I've gotten older which is scary because I can't tell if I'm actually having a heart attack.\n\nI‚Äôve sometimes felt like words weren‚Äôt particularly coming out of my mouth, like I knew I was saying and articulating them properly,but the lower side of my face was fuzzy not quite numb but ‚Ä¶blunt???? I guess that‚Äôs how id describe it . LIKE MY MOUTH WAS A POM POM  OR A PIECE OF FELT ????\n\nyeah I had a severe chest pain radiating to the back + shortness of breath episode last week‚Ä¶ went to the ER, turns out I‚Äôm fine and just anxiety\n\n[deleted]\n\nI also mix up my words and it takes me forever to spit out what im saying when i get really anxious. Sometimes I basically lose the ability to speak at all and physically can‚Äôt move or talk üôÉ also I get really really hot, like im burning all over. I hate that one!\n\nLump in my throat when I try to swallow. Whenever it reaches that point it's hospital time.  Happened couple times already. Feels like I'm getting choked out.\n\nI keep a pulse ox on me so I can see my oxygen levels. Feeling like my throat is closing spirals me every time. The pulse ox helps. I just keep it on the entire time I feel that way.\n\ndissociation and chest tightness\n\nParanoia, unreal feeling, then if i dont handle it, progresses to unstopable vomiting.\n\nLegs going out on me. Is that what u r calling dropping?\n\nmy throat getting so tight. and my chest, and just spiraling. why doesn‚Äôt my brain understand it‚Äôs just anxiety??\n\nTunnel vision and sudden fatigue that makes me feel like I'm passing out\n\nI also have a hard time speaking when I‚Äôm anxious. My words come out too fast and all jumbled up, and I start to stutter and lose my train of thought. It makes me wonder if people are wondering what is wrong with me which makes me even more anxious. I hate the vomiting, the feeling like I can‚Äôt get a full breath, but I think the worst symptom imo is feeling like I‚Äôm not real our like I‚Äôm out of my body, it really makes me feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. I‚Äôm practicing my grounding exercises to try and combat it but damn, it‚Äôs the worst.\n\nDo u guys have sharp pain on ur shoulders caused by anxiety\n\nSharp pains everywhereeee!\n\nwhen i feel like my heart is sinking as if it‚Äôs gonna jump out any second. also when i get really bad chest pain that it spreads to my back and i can‚Äôt stand, walk, or even drink water without being in pain.\n\nPinching myself so hard with my hands in my pockets. I have had proper bruises for the past 3 years.\n\nVision? Suddenly it's so weird talking to the people. It makes me feel like people are suddently too close, I am trying to pay attention but I miss most of the talk. I feel like I am going to faint any moment soon and it's unbearable at that moment. Like I need to be alone badly, that I cannot express this much. Mix this with I can't breathe properly, then Gosh T\\_T\n\nNot knowing if the symptoms are anxiety or real? Wtffff\n\nFeels like someone has their hands around my neck\n\nThrowing up\n\nThroat tightness and lip twitching\n\nRecently my eye has started involuntarily twitching. Thats a new fun one for me.\n\nCurrently for me is the racing heart with dizziness and immediately HOT like I‚Äôm in a fire. Sucks when you wake up from a dead sleep like that too or when your in public or driving\n\nI‚Äôve been getting flutters and tightening in the lower left part of my stomach\n\nTrembling legs , heart pounding\n\nSweating, stuttering and the stomach aches\n\nThey really are scary! ¬†I‚Äôm going to a wedding this weekend 6 hours away and I‚Äôm dreading the anxiety symptoms already.¬†\n\ndpdr\n\nmy most annoying one for sureee\n\nThroat choking, happend only once\n\nThe chest pain/pressure for sure. Especially when it feels like an elephant is on your chest‚Ä¶ while you‚Äôre standing\n\nThe thoughts of having any and all terminal illnesses. Just tired of it. Same ol loop of delusion.\n\nSuicide ideation\n\nI shake really bad when driving. Well I used to before meditation so now it only happens when there is a close call on the road. My legs would shake so bad that I couldn‚Äôt stay the same speed or when I would break it wouldn‚Äôt be smooth.\n\nNot my scariest - but I got let go from my job on Friday and for the first time in a long time I got the numb sensation in my legs (similar to that of panic attacks).\n\nHad to remind myself i‚Äôm in a better situation, but it threw me back to bad times and I started panicking a bit!\n\nI also relate to the tense muscles and stuttering - the latter of which also returned lately? Fun times having the reminder your body still behaves that wayüò≠\n\nHeart palpitations. I get them so often when I'm anxious and they scare me even though I know it's not dangerous.\n\nI kind of just freeze during an event, and after it has passed I have no memory or recollection of what I did or what happened. It's scary since sometimes I freak out because I have no clue what I said or did and it causes me to panic.\n\nI randomly can‚Äôt walk even when I‚Äôm not panicking. My legs just don‚Äôt work very well.\n\nMine is a cold flash I feel creeping up my head the moment I realize an anxiety attack is coming. What‚Äôs worse is that it usually follows with dizziness and/or nausea. it‚Äôs scary cuz it triggers my ‚Äòflight‚Äô mode and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm losing touch with reality‚Ä¶ :(\n\nMine is a chilly sensation I feel rushing to my head the moment I realize an anxiety attack is coming. It‚Äôs worse when accompanied by dizziness and nausea, it triggers my ‚Äòflight‚Äô response and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm losing touch with reality‚Ä¶ :(\n\ncardiogenic/vasovagal syncope, only being able to take short breaths that feel restricted, panic attacks are really scary too. anytime i feel something wrong with my heart, derealisation\n\nalso the overthinking. it‚Äôs the biggest problem because any time i feel sick i sit and think ‚Äòam i actually sick or is it just anxiety?‚Äô so then it‚Äôs a continuous cycle of thinking i‚Äôm going to die because i‚Äôm too scared to see a doctor just incase it‚Äôs anxiety and not actually real\n\nNausea. I'm emetophobic so it sends my anxiety into overdrive. Also I used to dry heave in the mornings for no reason whatsoever\n\nAnother scary one is feeling like no matter how deeply I breathe I'm not getting enough air in.\n\nDuring a major attack: shaking from head to toe with chattering teeth \nRandomly depending on the day: feeling of muscle weakness, heat in the legs, pressure on the tongue\n\nThis will sound kinda dumb but it‚Äôs def my stomach hurting , I‚Äôm really scared of stomachaches whenever I‚Äôm not home so even the slightest pain makes me panic\n\nmy hair falling out\n\nFor me, the psychical feeling of doom before a panic attack. It feels like I am being chased by a bear, or going down a rollercoasterüíÄüò≠  My heart pounds, I am paranoid, on edge, my chest feels super heavy, I get hot and shakey. \n\nI can‚Äôt even think about being social or in public at all if that happens, I feel like people are looking at me like I‚Äôm a crazy person or something is wrong with me, even if they are not. If this happens in public (worst fear) then i‚Äôm outta there asap, because at that point it‚Äôs too intense to try to ignore/mask. If i‚Äôm already home, i won‚Äôt be going out that‚Äôs for damn sure.\n\nOmg I didn't know other ppl had that awful walking feeling, like every step makes my heart drop into my stomachs.\n\nfun fact, last night I realized that if I drag my feet instead of walking normal it doesn‚Äôt happen!\n\nBeing unable to hear or understand people when they are speaking. Hallucinating and feeling extreme irrational fear.\n\nMines the dizzy loss of control feeling right now. \nSeems to happen when I‚Äôm in the shops far from an exit or on a motorway, so the ‚Äútrapped‚Äù scenarios. \nIt‚Äôs really scary and I find that the hardest to ignore or snap out of.\n\nIt‚Äôs the feeling of derealisation and impending doom. I‚Äôve also recently started having this thing where my hands claw up and I can‚Äôt open them. It is so painful when that happens\n\nMy main symptom is feeling like something absolutely gut-wrenching and heartbreaking is about to happen and not knowing what it is or how to stop it\n\nNot being able to digest food / acid reflux\n\nMine come out of nowhere; I'll be laughing with a friend one minute and the next I can't feel any air going into my lungs. I know I'm breathing, but I cannot feel it. \n\nThe worst feeling though is, what I've been told, the \"impending sense of doom\". \n\nTrying to explain to someone that it feels like I'm dying ten times a day doesn't cut it. \n\nI'm so sorry for what you're going through, and everyone else here. \n\nI try to describe it as a m*rderer coming into my house and I'm cornered with no way out and no way to defend myself. \n\nI know it sounds dramatic but that's how it feels... \n\nSo much love to you beautiful, I hope one day we all can heal and live our best lives ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI describe it as the feeling you'd get when you get a knock at the door, and standing there are a couple of state troopers with their hats in hand.\n\nThe heart palpitations and cold sweats, for sure. Thankfully, I can use some breathing exercises to help relax now, but before that, they were terrible.\n\nMy scariest symptom is when I'm laying down at night to go to sleep and my heart is beating so loud for no damn reason and I can't sleep. Then in the morning, my tracker tells me that my resting heart rate is high consistently and now my chest hurts so bad. Ugh I hate this.\n\nStarts with my heart is going to stop, and then it goes to a complete body numbness, face legs, arms, chest, everywhere. I'm now on the ground trying to control my breath in complete panic because I can¬¥t move my limbs are completely frozen and my stomach is tied by a rope.   \nThis sensation stays for like 10 to 20 min. and comes and goes for like 2 or 3h it can happen 2 or 3 times or more.\n\nOne other thing is waht I call Panic Limbo, where I¬¥m not in a panic attack but I¬¥m not ok either, is like something is happening in my body but I can¬¥t make sense of it, it¬¥s just wierd and frightnening at the same time.\n\nI¬¥m taking Paroxetine, and I¬¥ve never felt better. I can control anxiety and In case of a panic attack it just goes away with like a scream or forcing myself to focus on explaining what I¬¥m seeing in detail to myself.\n\n My scariest anxiety attack is when Im at my phone scrolling thru some random posts, when my world is swirling and spinning that I almost faint and my heart pounds so hard.  Anxiety attacks is scary anytime anywhere.\n\nThe room starts feeling like it‚Äôs going to turn upside down. It‚Äôs extremely scary and just makes my anxiety worse.\n\nHallucinations, especially at night while alone. I usually end up puking or literally screaming when my panic attacks get that bad. Freezing up and going mute is a hell, too.\n\nRight now it‚Äôs waking up already in a panic. Like wtf is that? Three nights in a row.\n\nMy head, hands and legs start shaking altogether and I feel like my heart is being crumpled up in my chest like a piece of paper. By far the worst symptoms I have experienced.\n\nIm afraid im going to die, so i feel everything. I feel my heart beat too fast making me feel like its a heartattack, or i feel like i cant breathe when  i choke on water when i drink ( i assume it went into my lungs) or My head starts hurting cuz i sneezed too hard and i think a vessel in my brain just imploded. It feels so real but its not. The doctors have cleared me from any health conditions.\n\nIdk if it's scary anymore because I'm so used to it, but the dizzy spells still are me pause. I'll just be walking  and oops am I going to faint? No? Oh okay that wasn't fun, let me just stay close to a wall or sit down just I'm case \n\nThe scariest I've had before is what I think was dpdr. Never want to feel like I'm in some sort of game show where everyone can see something in me that I can't again. That was vert disturbing\n\nDepersonalization!  It's so scary üò®\n\nIf I‚Äôm real anxious I got straight up non verbal, like I‚Äôll have the words I want to say ready to say and then they don‚Äôt come out\n\nI don‚Äôt know none of them are fun. I can‚Äôt breathe, I‚Äôm having a heart attack, etc. worst for me though has got to be when I don‚Äôt know something is anxiety. One time before a trip I had horrific acid reflux, I went to the doctor about it and everything thinking that I now had some type of stomach issue. Nope anxiety, as soon as I landed there and felt comfortable it was gone, never came back.\n\nHeart attack or feeling like I'm going to pass out\n\ndiarrhea because I can't leave the house. also my hands lock up which is great\n\nThe thinking I‚Äôm gonna die that gets so bad I put off going to sleep because I‚Äôm Afraid I‚Äôll have a heart attack but then the lack of sleep makes the anxiety worse\n\nthe nausea. its so threatening, even the slightest whisper and im terrified ill throw up in public. also the intense chest tightness that causes me to whimper/ almost cry. both scare me for the shame of obviously panicking in public. ofc its a vicious cycle, with the anxiety making me nauseous and the nausea making me anxious and the concerned looks making me wish i never left the house.\n\nAND THE SINKING GUT FEELING! its so painful i cant ignore it and if i think of anything slightly embarrassing ill feel the knife twist. it feels like being thrown around\n\nWhen I have anxiety, I feel like I can‚Äôt swallow and it‚Äôs so scary. And then I feel like I‚Äôm going to puke and puking is my number one fear in life üôÉ\n\nThe impending doom feeling. Randomly hits me. Everything goes silent for a second heart starts racing I start sweating. Then I‚Äôm fine seconds later. Tons of fun!!! 25 and been happening for years and been to multiple doctors. Nothing is wrong. Just good ole anxiety. üòÜ\n\nDry mouth and choking feeling\n\ndepersonalisation and derealisation definitely. feeling like you aren‚Äôt real is absolutely terrifying - i just go numb minus the overwhelming anxiety because i recognise that i can‚Äôt feel anything and am so disconnected from everything around me (like my body doesn‚Äôt feel real, i just feel like this consciousness unconnected to a person).\n\nwhen my heartbeat gets so intense it's like i hear it right in my ears\n\nMine is when my head has this \"rushing\" sensation. It's hard to explain, but it basically feels like my body is trying to escape itself and it cannot because it's stuck and then I get this horrible tight feeling around my head at the same time. It makes me feel like I'm going to drop dead.\n\nThis happens to me only it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äústabbing‚Äù pain and I instantly think I‚Äôm dying\n\nOof I also get the word mixup issue when my anxiety is high, takes all my focus and energy to put together coherent sentences‚Ä¶ this usually goes hand in hand with head pressure and blurry vision, which I find to be a bit more scary\n\ndefinitely nausea and stomachaches\n\nFor me, it's a tie between the anxiety diarrhoea and the whole body hot flashes.\n\nI have verbal dyslexia too and will ruin a phrase or any verbal interaction. I also have clenched my jaws so tight I crack teeth. Yea... anxiety is a bitch.\n\nNot ‚Äúscary‚Äù necessarily but I shake when I‚Äôm nervous and people often take it as me seeming guilty of something and if I try to explain it I just seem more guilty üôÉ which makes me more nervous I‚Äôm gonna get in trouble for something I didn‚Äôt actually do\n\nChest feels pressure and it jumps all over the place. Almost a fuzzy feeling. I‚Äôll get sharp pains in weird spots and they will disappear And it will kind of send me into a mental frenzy\n\n2 bumps on my vulva (haven‚Äôt been sexually active in a while, doesn‚Äôt look like anything bad but still going to check with the doctor next week so in the meantime I‚Äôm trying to be rational about it recently my hygiene hasn‚Äôt been great I‚Äôve been staying in my gym clothes for a long time and I‚Äôm overweight and have been a bit lazy recently)\n\nLast year I spent months worrying I had a kidney problem and when the urologist said \"Its not your Kidneys\" it honestly changed my life. Before that I could hardly eat and was so overwhelmed with fear. After he told me those words it was within days I was back to my old self.\n\nMy body overheats and I drip sweat, my heart is racing, and (often) I vomit once my anxiety hits the ceiling. Because I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe, I think I‚Äôm going into cardiac arrest. It‚Äôs terrifying. \n\nThe only thing that brings me back down to earth is sitting on the ground in front of my open freezer which cools me off quickly and the rest of my symptoms subside after that.\n\npuking for literal DAYS\n\nI do this too! It‚Äôs like my mouth has a small seizure and it feels so bizarre and awful.\n\nMental effects. How it can impact my memory, comprehension, and speech. Concentration and short term memory being impacted is scary and I‚Äôll do something then forget doing it or lose track of what I was doing. Even long term memory, I‚Äôll forget conversations or things I said that my partner remembers. I‚Äôve had both mental and physical symptoms and personally would prefer physical over mental 100% of the time\n\nHeart palpitations, the feelings of needing to cry but can‚Äôt, upset stomach, shaking, dizziness, muscle spasms, chest tightness, and feeling terrified. All of them are scary.\n\nI developed a tremor in my face due to a string of intensely stressful things in my life and at work.\n\nAlso have thing where.my brain forgets how to make words and I sound drunk\n\nI stutter.   So embarrassing üôà \nAlso have tremors which then makes me panic into a full blown panic attack.\n\nDizziness, chest pain/indigestion that feels sharp, and the feeling I can‚Äôt breathe (obviously my lungs broke unexpectedly)\n\nI faint, and cannot move.\n\nThat deep deep apprehension....when you're over tired but your too anxious to go to sleep. You need someone to rock you to sleep and tickle your back or something, but the thought of asking someone overwhelms you into yet another panic attack, so you just sit there hoping to distract yourself long enough to pass out\n\nHeart in my throat and sound sort of being sucked out of my ears like I'm going to pass out. üò¨\n\nfor me it's this really heavy, sinking feeling as if someone has put a weighted vest on me and i physically cannot stand. it quite literally forces me to lay down and is accompanied by some nasty dizziness. that's usually how i know i'm in for a big one. another symptom i get before a panic attack is a feeling sort of similar to when you get jump scared. my whole body just starts buzzing and it spirals into a tight chest, racing heart and this unbearable sense of impending doom.\n\nanxiety is a bitch, but man is it ever a creative bitch.\n\nWow that‚Äôs the least severe of my symptoms\n\nFeeling like I'm in a box and not able to move\n\nMines usually \"in not going to get off this plane alive\".\n\nmy heart rate suddenly speeding up and idk what‚Äôs going on then i start to think the worst happened to my friends and family before i realize im just spiraling but still those feelings linger\n\nMines shortness of breath. I've been experiencing it badly for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't gone away. Part of me is convinced it's something physical but I've been checked over by my doctor (it was a simple check over tbh) and says there isn't anything physical. I hate it so much\n\nRanked with worst at 1\n\n1. Skipped Beats (PVCs)\n2. Air hunger\n3. Lightheadedness/Passing out feeling\n4. Impending doom\n5. Chest pain\n6. Can‚Äôt focus vision/cant concentrate\n7. Hypervigilance (overly aware of bodily sensations)\n8. Shakes\n\nfatigue, throwing up and the impending doom feelings for sure. it‚Äôs so difficult to get on with life when the feelings are engulfing me\n\nI totally get what you‚Äôre saying, anxiety can manifest in so many weird and terrifying ways. For me, the scariest symptom is when my chest tightens up and it feels like I can‚Äôt breathe properly. It makes me panic even more because it feels like something is physically wrong with me, even though I know it‚Äôs just anxiety. That, and the sudden rush of dizziness that comes out of nowhere‚Äîit‚Äôs like the ground drops beneath me and everything spins for a few seconds. The muscle tension you mentioned is no joke either; it can feel like your body is stuck in this permanent fight mode. It‚Äôs so frustrating how anxiety can make you feel like you're losing control over your own body.  \n  \n**Here are some short tips for managing anxiety:**\n\n1. **Deep Breathing**: Focus on slow, deep breaths to calm your nervous system.\n2. **Grounding Techniques**: Use the 5-4-3-2-1 method (name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, etc.) to bring yourself to the present moment.\n3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tense and relax each muscle group to release tension.\n4. **Limit Stimulants**: Reduce caffeine and sugar intake, as they can trigger anxiety symptoms.\n5. **Stay Active**: Physical exercise can help release built-up stress and improve mood.\n6. **Talk to Someone**: Sharing your thoughts with a friend or therapist can help ease anxiety.\n\ni only experienced panic attacks so when i had my first anxiety attack which was just this monday it was definitely like gradually dying, i hate how i could feel the slow to strong dizziness on my head and the tinging voice on my ears that i couldn‚Äôt hear on my other hear, also the gradual cramps on my hands and feet and the feeling of not knowing what to do or whether if i might faint in my next blink or what\n\nFaint-like feeling;  dizziness + hot sweats  + jelly legs + sudden fatigue. \n\nDizziness, nausea, bowel movement problems‚Ä¶ these can seriously leave people not be able to walk down the road. If it wasn‚Äôt for them, especially dizziness, I believe I could beat agoraphobia a long time ago.\n\nHyperventilations. I always start feeling like I can't breathe and start hyperventilating, which makes it worse. Then my brain goes, \"your throat is closing! You're gonna die/pass out!\". I keep a pulse ox on me so I can show myself that my O2 levels are fine. Even when my heart rate shows at 140. üòÖ\n\nThe randomly not speaking well is my problem as well. Sometimes it gets so bad it's like my mouth wants to close itself and it gets so difficult to talk.\n\nGetting so tired that I lose my short term memory. Only happened once...but I remember going to a shop to buy some e-cig liquidate not being able to hold the information that the shopkeeper was telling me\n\nHe had to tell me the same into 5-6 times before I could make a choice about what to buy. Thankfully he was very patient with mr\n\nThe feeling of throwing up, please that's the worst\n\nMy worst anxiety symptoms are when I‚Äôm stuck in my head with racing thoughts of stuff I did wrong in my past then worrying about them till it feels like I need to be punished for them. I‚Äôm talking about memories from 10 plus years ago. I get the heart palpitations feeling like breathing is hard. It helps to smoke weed but only for awhile and I go for 5 to 6mi walks 4-5 days a week. It definitely is not fun.\n\nDoes anyone take anything for this anxiety? I have a lot of these symptoms and the doctor gave me Prozac but I‚Äôm so scared to take it . I feel like If I already feel like this what‚Äôs this medicine gonna make me feel like . It‚Äôs the scariest thing to deal with I get hot and feel like I‚Äôm gonna pass out .¬†\n\nUgh my health anxiety tied into my physical symptoms for a while. \n\nI have had covid 3 or 4 times and my lungs weren‚Äôt in great condition. I also need to quit vaping lol. \n\nOne day at work I was feeling anxious about something different and every time I breathed in, a spot on my back where my left lung is hurt very bad. It was a sharp stabbing pain when I breathed but was dull and constant otherwise. I had a coworker press on my back and apparently it was just a VERY tight muscle knot. I got a deep tissue massage and the pain went away. I was convinced I had a collapsed lung, but nope just a stressed out body‚Ä¶\n\n#1: tachycardia\n\nI had my worst attack ever today. I thought I¬¥ll get a heart attack, couldn¬¥t speak a single clear word yet a full sentence, strong nausea, pale face, muscle tension as if I was going to freeze. Head and hands were shaking too. Colleague even asked to call 110 but I declined. Very scary\n\nFor my it‚Äôs AIR HUNGER. I constantly gasp for air and feel like I‚Äôm body getting enough oxygen to the point where I‚Äôve been to the ER about it 3 times now. I totally get that walking on a boat feeling, is it just me or do you guys also have a hard time with fluorescent lights and feeling that dropping, confused, anxiety feeling?\n\nAnxiety causing a physical symptom that is so bad/new you go get checked out and for the 100th time the Dr tells you it's in your head and have you tried meditating and you leave feeling utterly destroyed and crazy. \n\nI want to hug all of you.\n\nChest. pain.\n\nUmmm definitely chest flutters aka heart palpitations üò≠\n\nhead related stuff - headaches, dizziness, just an off balance unsteady feeling\n\nAll day nausea makes me think I will die from malnutrition\n\nCrazy how a lot of us feel the same way internally. Almost to a T.\n\nDerealization can be pretty scary. Feels like you might die. I just try to remember I‚Äôm not in danger and resisting the symptom does no good for me"

    "body": "I‚Äôve been sober from any cannabis (even C B D) products since January 20th this year and my anxiety has cut down 75%. I no longer feel anxious on a day to day basis. Even since going through a hard break up since then, my anxiety has been SO MUCH better. I consumed everyday for 2+ years before I had a bad panic attack after smoking one night. After that panic  attack things were never the same, I would get them on the regular, and every time I would consume via smoking or edibles I would be a ball of anxiety, literally laying in bed thinking about my parents dying, all these horrible intrusive thoughts, I would be crying, shaking, literally sprilling everytime after I would use. It was horrible, but I literally couldn‚Äôt stop. I was so afraid of being alone with my thoughts that I couldn‚Äôt stop smoking. Well January 20th after my boyfriend I loved so much ended things, I finally said enough is enough and I stopped. And since then, even going through really hard times, even travelling abroad by myself, my anxiety is so quiet. I do have times I‚Äôm anxious like if I think I‚Äôm going to miss my train or flight, but hour to hour day to day I‚Äôm SO MUCH BETTER. If you‚Äôre a heavy consumer of weed I definitely would recommend trying to stop and see how you feel! It worked for me. \n",

    "all_comment_text": "Congratulations on quitting :) Well done.\n\nI smoked heavy for a few years when I was younger and I can deffo say that my life is better without it.\n\nThank you! I definitely agree my life is much better without it too.\n\nPretty much anything altering your state can cause some trouble or some relief. It‚Äôs a give and take. If you abuse it it‚Äôs hard to know what your baseline is without being sober for a good while. Good for you to know what made things harder for you. Sobriety can be boring but it really helps anxiety.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI need this\n\nSame! I liked it for many years. I don‚Äôt drink so it was the only indulgence I had‚Ä¶\nWhen I started SSRIS I stopped cannabis for 6 months or so just to try and work on my anxiety without anything else influencing my moods. When I decided to try it again I really noticed how anxious it made me feel, and it‚Äôs been ruined for me ever since. I don‚Äôt even want it anymore now that I‚Äôm not super anxious by default and I really notice the anxiety and paranoia when I‚Äôm high. Kind of a bummer, but I save a ton of money lol!\n\nCongrats! My psychiatrist suggest I quit, or take edibles since it‚Äôs processed slower in the body\n\nI'm in the same boat, but I only stopped a couple weeks ago.  I had been gradually slowing down and the last time I tried it, I was so overwhelmed by the negative intrusive thoughts that I was ready to give up.  That experience was good in a way because now I'm afraid to even touch it.  I'm still suffering from intense anxiety that really ramped up a couple months ago due to some real life issues, but I'm slightly better every day.\n\nHow long did it take for things to go back to normal. How do you feel today\n\nNever smoked , still suffer\n\nSmoking helped mine\n\nYeah same, it's really something that deviates so much between users. My friend with anxiety had to quit because it made his anxiety spike a lot, but I'm the opposite and find it helps me negate panic attacks and relax/sleep in the evening.\n\nAnd helps with the anxiety nausea!\n\nYeah but just that means this post isn't directed toward you.\n\nApples are not oranges. You don't need to tell everyone your experience if it doesn't correlate.\n\nThanks anyway?\n\nI usually take a tolerance break when I start to feel it cause anxiety attacks right after smoking or my anxiety spike. For some reason 3 months ago I just stopped all together. It was giving me some extra anxiety and I haven't gone back to it because I just wasn't enjoying it as much. I honestly don't really even feel any desire to start again. I'm not going to say never again but as of now, I won't be consuming weed anytime soon.¬†\n\n\nAnxiety over travel in that way, is totally normal. Funny enough, I have anxiety but have no anxiety over that type of stuff haha.¬†\n\nSame\n\nI hear you.  \n\nIf I smoke every couple of weeks, I can do it without increasing my anxiety.  More often than that and my anxiety starts to ramp up.  It‚Äôs actually one of my ways of tracking my anxiety.  When I feel I want to smoke more and more, I know it‚Äôs time to back off.  \n\nThe big thing is NOT smoking while trying to sort out meds.  Same as not drinking.  Can‚Äôt be self medicating while trying to get meds to take effect.\n\nI‚Äôm hoping we get much more research on weed now that it‚Äôs being reclassified. My ex always told me that marijuana use was associated with less anxiety in the short term but more anxiety in the long term. I didn‚Äôt think that would ever be me until it happened. Still working on cutting back but I‚Äôm proud of myself for making the changes I have so far.\n\nI actually got really bad edible withdrawals. There were physical and mental symptoms, including major distress and throwing up. Thankfully it was only a couple days. Be careful out there kids!\n\nThat‚Äôs definitely how I felt too, good in the short term but bad long term. I also hope more research comes out. I live in Canada so there‚Äôs a cannabis store on like every block and the stuff they sell there is SO strong. I‚Äôm a psych nurse and I‚Äôve seen the effects of cannabis related psychosis, especially in young people, and it‚Äôs actually crazy how most people don‚Äôt know the relation between the two (I didn‚Äôt before I was a nurse!).\n\nMe too. Have quit cold turkey a couple of times and the insomnia and lingering paranoia was the biggest thing. That insomnia. WOW.\n\nSame here! I stopped 55 days ago today and it was so rough at first but soooo much better now! Congrats!\n\nCongrats to your 55 days!\n\nThank youuuuu\n\nIve been vaping for about 5 years now due to chronic pain from an accident. Ive been thinking about quitting, but if it helps that much, i gotta do it.\n\nHow long did it take to improve significantly?\n\nA few weeks? I just remember one day I was like wow.. I haven‚Äôt had a feeling of panic all day. Now at month 3.5 I can‚Äôt believe how I used to just be anxious all the time, but especially right after I would smoke.\n\nThank you. On day 5 right now and feeling a little better but still panicky. Hoping that improves quickly! \n\nHow much/often were you using?\n\nIt gets better I swear! I also still had cravings for a good month or longer. \n\nI was never a super heavy user, more just that I had to use it everyday, in the evening. I wouldn‚Äôt smoke more than 2 bowls a day and even that felt like a lot. Near the end I was using a pen that was 3:1 C B D/ T H C but it was still setting off my anxiety pretty bad.\n\nWow we‚Äôre so similar lmao. I‚Äôve been smoking for 13 years but for the last half i only used it as a before bed sleep-aid/way to unwind at the end of the day. I basically only use the 1:1 carts (3:1 are like impossible to find these days for some reason in MA?), because anything else made me anxious and smoking in public did the same. For the last few years it‚Äôs been taking 1-3 pen rips before bed and that‚Äôs all. So, hopefully I‚Äôll see the same benefits you have!\n\nI hope so too! Keep me updated.\n\nI'm glad to hear others feel \"panicky\" after quitting. I can feel weed in my body even 3 days after ingesting. That fourth day is when I'm feeling the brightest and most self-aware but amxiety is subdued\n\nI haven't actually smoked in years, I stick with low dosage edibles.  I have pretzels that I enjoy on the weekends, but I do have to be careful with those as well.\n\nMy anxiety also goes way down when I reduce the drinking as well.\n\nThat's really interesting, I tried it for the first time two months ago and I've found even for a day after my anxiety is significantly better, am I on a dangerous path?\n\nI mean I think it‚Äôs a bit different for everyone but for me it was great until it wasn‚Äôt anymore. The first year or two it was amazing, I could finally sleep at night, it helped with boredom, but then when the panic attacks started after smoking it was horrible. My advice would be if you notice that you‚Äôre getting a bit anxious from it stop right away because it‚Äôs just going to get worse if you don‚Äôt cut back.\n\nComplete opposite‚Ä¶ Weed has helped my anxiety tremendously‚Ä¶. 1-5 bowl hits a day and I‚Äôm Gucci\n\nWoah congrats! Good for you! üëèüèª\n\nI‚Äôm sad though. They made this legal just to shame us. I‚Äôve been a patient for 4 years and have smoked since I was 18 off and on. I‚Äôll be quitting too because it‚Äôs not worth all the trouble. It was less a problem when it was illegal\n\nI live in Canada so it‚Äôs been legal here for awhile but the stuff they sell at the dispensaries is SO strong, it‚Äôs insane.\n\nI'm looking forward to the day when there will be legitimate, medically prescribed cannabis for anxiety. I don't think smoking it or ingesting it in recreational forms does great. But when the science can produce a cannabis-based anti-anxiety medication, man that'll be a great day.\n\nI‚Äôm really happy to hear that. Maybe will have to try\n\nI started smoking when I was a really anxious person, I still am but I‚Äôve worked on myself and it‚Äôs definitely decreased a lot. But I still consume nightly at least every other day (sometimes everyday). I wonder if quitting will still relieve anxiety.\n\nIf you can I would definitely recommend doing a break at least and see if it helps!\n\nEvery time I smoke it gives me anxiety even when I smoke the low THC High CBD stuff and even gummies does it to me also I try not to do it very much every once in awhile I do still take a little hit to help Aleve the pain of My bilateral total knee replacement surgery\n\nCBD would set off my anxiety too near the end. I‚Äôm sorry about your knee pain!\n\nSame boat\n\nYes man I swear as we get older like we have more things to think about in life it just doesn‚Äôt hit the same way it used to that‚Äôs for sure.\n\nThere you go! Weed ain‚Äôt good. I‚Äôm proud of you\n\nMy doctor told me pot makes anxiety worse. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre feeling better üôÇ\n\nCongrats on being able to stop. I pretty much only get a break from my anxiety when im high. I look forward to it every night and it def helps me sleep better as well. Ambien, lunesta, etc dont help at all, only thc.\n\nUgh same. Decided to take a tolerance break to reset and save some money and it's been a rough 2 and half months of not being able to sleep and getting random anxiety spikes during the evening especially.\n\nI actually started smoking because of sleep too, I had such bad insomnia and weed was the only thing that really knocked me out. And it was great until it wasn‚Äôt anymore. I still miss the sleeps I would get from weed but the panic isn‚Äôt worth it\n\nYeah same. Although I did smoke weed recently, it was a fluke. I got really scared thought I was going to die. Never again\n\nIt‚Äôs the worst feeling eh? I‚Äôve definitely had times I‚Äôve wanted to smoke again but I know it‚Äôs going to make me spiral\n\nYeah what‚Äôs scary is I kept forgetting to breathe when high I felt like I was going to suffocate\n\nGood for you! It's so upsetting to see how it's touted as safe, non-addictive, no serious side effects, ok to take with psychiatric medications, etc, meanwhile people are seriously struggling without knowing why. I'm proud of you internet stranger!¬†\n\nThank you and I absolutely agree. I‚Äôm a psych nurse and I‚Äôve witnessed a lot of people not only get bad anxiety from weed but straight up psychosis. It‚Äôs not as harmless as people think.\n\nDon‚Äôt know why you got downvoted. Probably by a stoner. It‚Äôs true - pot is not harmless\n\nThey say testosterone is a schedule 1. \nThe same as THC\n\nIt's funny right? Some people use it to unwind, and some it winds up. I used to use probably too much and it definitely gave me anxiety. \n\nEventually (long after I'd quit) I tried both THC and CBD oils (separately) and both caused tachycardia (increased heart rate). I was hoping to use them to mellow out but I guess I'll have to resort to the more natural stuff like meditation and physical activity (which has an insane effect on mental state).\n\nGood luck\n\nHow do I stop tho\n\nI went thru the exact same thing you did. I have been sober from weed for 15 days and I swear it‚Äôs been a world of difference. HEAVY on the no anxiety anymoreüëèüèªüò≠\n\nAnyone have tips to get through it, happened to me maybe 1-2 years ago have smoked for over 8 years on and off but 4 years ago started smoking heavily and loved it then it hit me one day out of nowhere, have smoked constantly since stopped 3 mounts ago but only for at couple of weeks and then I will take a couple of hite, want to stop for good to see if it helps, just happened out of nowhere was super social and loved talking now I am super quiet and never talk about anything not even to my girlfriends because I just overthink everything instead of talking about stuff, every time I smoke I get super anxious and start only thinking about the bad thoughts of it and never the good side it‚Äôs super stressful and have totaly fucked up my mentall\n\nIt literally says on warning sticker that it could worsen mental health."

    "all_comment_text": "Yes.  All the time.  Our brains are over active and hyper aware of our surroundings and body.  When we are calm we think something is wrong because our brains are so used to being busy and scanning.  Also, sometimes we are waiting for our next danger in my case symptoms, intrusive thoughts or panic.\n\nGod, I hate intrusive thoughts so much. It's hell delivered straight into your head without the option of returning to sender\n\nI legit thought I had lost control.  Until you understand the thoughts are not the problem and only our reaction to them is the problem.  I legit couldn‚Äôt go into the same room as my mom and I had to stay away from anything that could cause possible harm.  We are definitely not our thoughts at all.\n\nWord!

That sounds about right\n\nI got anxious because my blood pressure was high. Exercised, lost weight, got on BP med, and got anxious because my blood pressure was too low. Similar.\n\nSimilar to me. Mine is always low, been having some health issues and it‚Äôs high. So now instead of being anxious that it‚Äôs low I‚Äôm anxious that it‚Äôs raised\n\nCan‚Äôt win\n\nYup.

Whenever I realise I‚Äôm calm, everything is going nicely and I haven‚Äôt been overthinking for a while it‚Äôs like anxiety throws a punch in my face lmao. And then I start being anxious about not being anxious or find a new reason to be anxious for. Ugh‚ò†Ô∏è\n\nExactly!! Like damn can I just have some peace üò©\n\nYes 100%. Especially at the worst time too like if i have a wedding i‚Äôll freak myself out about having a panic attack when i am completely calm and then work myself up. i know exactly what your talking about your not aloneüíì\n\nMy brain is constantly looking for a reason to have it all the time\n\n100%\n\nthat constant feeling of waiting for the other shoe to drop \n\nthis was a big one to deal with for me early on in my panic/anxiety journey\n\nYou finally get a good day and can't really even enjoy that because you're waiting for something to go wrong again \n\nit's easier now for me than it was four or five years ago, but every so often when I will have an extremely off week and coming back out of that sets those spidey senses off again\n\nWhat helped you in your journey? My anxiety has been under control under a recent health scare and now I‚Äôve spiraled\n\nI just got really good at learning to ride out the bad days. I think of anxiety like surfing. You just have to learn to stay on top of the wave and not get crushed under it\n\nthe end of 2018 and all of 2019 for me was 17 months of constant panic attacks and full on anxiety even in the moments were I wasn't fully panicking\n\nI tried medication and the first thing that they put me on made me twice as bad as I was to start with. So I just kept pushing through it unmedicated\n\nI figured if it was going to kill me, it would have. But I kept waking up the next day. So I just started looking at things like those in alcohol recovery do. \n\nJust taking it one day at a time until I got myself to a place where the fog started to lift and I started to feel more like me again.\n\nevery person is different and every person is going to react differently. but the best advice I can give you is just keep going.\n\nit's going to be hard. Some days are going to be hell. Some weeks are going to be hell. Just keep living. Just keep looking for any little light you can find in the darkness\n\ngood luck in your journey. I wish you nothing but the best‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYup.  It‚Äôs like your brain wants you to be miserable. \n\nMy brain, during a rare moment of feeling relaxed: Hey, I feel pretty good.  I wish I could feel this at peace all the time.  Why can‚Äôt I?  Why do I worry so much?  Hmm‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôm worried about financial security‚Ä¶ and getting older‚Ä¶ and never achieving my life goals‚Ä¶ I should go grocery shopping but being around that many people makes me tense, and‚Ä¶. Anxiety‚Äôs back.\n\nit's like getting addicted to anxiety lol.\n\nThe first time, I felt very weird and wondered where my anxiety was haha the second time, I ENJOYED IT. But it's gone because mental health is like that, highs and lows ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI often get anxiety cause i think there is something I‚Äôm supposed to be worried about but have forgotten about it.\n\nYep. Recently graduated and paid off money I owed/paid people back and having no missing work is making me freak out. It's like I NEED something to constantly worry about or else my brain starts making shit up. I reassure myself that much stress and anxiety will await me in college.\n\nIm dwelving into the DARE ap as it was mentioned here. Also got the CALM ap. Oh my are they both so so good.\n\nToday he said anxiety is a paper tiger. You walk into your yard (brain) and see a ferocious tiger. (Anxiety) your adrenalin shoots through your veins in flight or fright mode. (Panic attack) \n\nInstead of being in an endless loop be curious about the tiger. Move closer to it. Examine it. Then you see...it was a paper tiger. Unable to harm you. Powerless. \n\nSome amazing meditations on calm as well. For insomniacs please get the ap for free week. \n\nI never realized how much anxiety and tension i always carry until i meditated and actually felt relaxed.\n\nEveryday.\n\nSo your not not anxious ???\n\nI have heart palpitations often. I'll get anxious when I feel my heart beating hard and/or when I don't feel my heart beating at all. My anxiety is so physical, it's so awful üòû\n\nOh yeah. As if the mind has become addicted to cortisol and just wants a fix. It's like waiting for a meteor to hit your house. \"when is it coming\". \n\nIt's just like when you wake up and anxiety is coursing through you and you don't.know.why!! So now I have to play 20 questions with my brain to figure out what we are afraid of today, because I basically have no idea what my brain is reacting to! It sucks!!\n\nYep. All the time.\n\nI don't exactly relate with that but lately they're trying to figure out if my anxiety is physical health related and if not they're starting me on SSRIs. I do feel like my anxiety has been around for so long that I don't know who I am without it.\n\nALL the time. Right now in fact\n\nI never know what my anxiety is directly related to anymore. It‚Äôs honestly just become a constant, perpetual state of anxiety without being able to isolate the variables. Sure, the amount of variables also makes me anxious, not knowing what causes my anxiety directly makes me anxious, and the thought of living this way forever makes me anxious‚Ä¶wait‚Ä¶\n\nGoddamn I really thought I was the only one üòÇ literally had that today, like I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôm feeling more relaxed than usual, but I‚Äôm also suspicious\n\nThat‚Äôs the perfect word. Suspicious lol like why aren‚Äôt you anxious?!\n\nYes sometimes I‚Äôm doing things and it‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh wait I forgot to be anxious!‚Äù and then it comes rushing back and I‚Äôm reminded why doing things is so hard üòÇ\n\nYup. That's happened to me before. Even recently I haven't had any anxiety. It's completely gone and a part of me thinks that it's quite odd how anxiety can just go away. Sure I've done a few things in order for that to happen but also at the same time it's not like I've done thaaaat many things but it's still quite strange though, not having any anxiety. I usually have body tensions and head pressures all day and night. It does give me anxiety sometimes because you never know if the anxiety will come back with force in the future but right now I'm just so grateful that I've been having a much better time. Life finally feels peaceful and calm üòå\n\nNot...exactly. but if i have a day with not an ounce of anxiety in it by the time its over a tsunami of worry washes over me for some dumb insignificant reason. Like all that anxiety just kept acumulating behind a dam through the day and someone finally set it free\n\nI never had anxiety, no trauma but a bad work burnout. Every morning my nervous system communicates that my life is in danger. Also starts while still sleeping. Extreme stress levels transformed in GAD. Maybe my subconscious. No medicine or therapy yet. I do Spravato now, let‚Äôs hope.\n\nI can‚Äôt sleep unless I‚Äôve listed all the things I have to be anxious about when I wake up‚Ä¶ and if I can‚Äôt find something, I get anxiousüò©\n\nYesü•π\n\nsometimes i‚Äôm worrying about something and then i forget what im worrying about and i worry about what i was worrying about\n\nYes! I was really anxious about a new job that I'm starting and all my physical symptoms basically disappeared after I started taking magnesium supplements. It was like my brain was trying to force me to be anxious. I was having these thoughts about bracing myself for the wave of anxiety that I was sure would come.\n\nYup\n\nYes lol then I‚Äôm  superstitious\n\nReason why i get nervous about even starting any sort of meditation. The thoughts of having no thoughts or have my mind be as crazy as it is, is honestly scary for me to think about.\n\nI‚Äôm feeling invalid the second I feel some sort of tranquility in my life even if it only lasts for a few hours lmao\n\nYes all the time\n\nYep\n\nYou found the key to anxiety itself. \nIt is in fact the fear of the fear that makes us anxious. It‚Äôs also the solution.\n\nYes. I feel like I need to constantly be worrying about the problem to feel like I have some control over it. If I‚Äôm not thinking about the worrying thought I can‚Äôt come up with solutions\n\nYep. My brain will tell, ‚Äúthis is too good to be true. Am i missing or forgetting something?‚Äù\n\nYes! Currently been on bus par for two weeks and my anxiety is decreasing but now I am worried that I‚Äôm\nNot worried. Why are brains like a prison?\n\nüòÇ yes. I feel some kind of discomfort when not anxious sometimes.\n\nYes because sometimes I get into a very numb state and when anxiety comes back it usually comes 5 times higher after a period of numbness.\n\nLmao yes ???\n\nYes!!\n\nyup. feeling like the other shoe is going to drop. i sabotage good things because it feels so strange. :(\n\ni feel this! like ‚Äúwhats  wrong with me i should be getting anxious by now ‚Äú it‚Äôs insane cuz anxiety is literally the worst ever but somehow my brain feels uncomfortable with out it\n\nyes cause whats happening?\n\nMe every time I become aware that I am worrying about-free : ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling too good today, something bad is going to happen‚Äù\n\nYes, the ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù or something‚Äôs got to go wrong etc.\n\nWhat you describe is the definition of an anxiety disorder.  It always ends up here.  Fear of the anxiety itself.\n\ngoing thru this right now and had just searched up the sub to see if anyone else gets it too.. ugh! im trying to remind myself i dont need to brace, nothing BAD is going to happen, i deserve to be anxiety free!!!!"

    "all_comment_text": "Not great, slept three hours yesterday and nil today, but thank you for asking\n\nKSM-66 (ashwaganda) helped me get my sleep schedule back on track. I don't take it every day anymore though - only when I catch myself slipping again\n\nHow much do you take\n\nI get the Nootropics Depot brand. 1 capsule = 300mg. Found that my sweet spot is 2 capsules an hour or two before bed, and I sleep throughout the night\n\nHello! I hope that anyone that is having a hard day today, has an amazing day tomorrow! I love seeing the kindness on here.  \nA product called ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù - magnesium powder works to help with sleep too. I have been using it for years. It has gotten pretty popular, so it‚Äôs easy to find in grocery stores (pharmacy area) and online.\n\nSleep is so repairative. For good mental health, it's the best thing. When it's interrupted, it doesn't let you body and mind rest and recharge. I understand.\n\nüëä‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nGood afternoon! \n\nI‚Äôm doing pretty well actually, my anxiety has decided to take a break for now and I‚Äôm living the life. I have zero idea what to do with myself, but I‚Äôm doing great. Schools almost out, I recovered from my cold, I got on the cheer team I tried out for, I have so many new friends that I‚Äôm comfortable with, and I got a job. Thank you for asking! \n\nHow are you doing, OP? ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nIt sounds like you accomplished some big things.  Good job and congratulations!!\n\nDoing amazing,\n\nNearly a month on my meds and I‚Äôm improving at a rapid pace!\n\nI‚Äôm excited for what the future holds!\n\nLove to see it\n\nMay I ask...what meds\n\nPaxil\n\nThis is lovely thing to say! \nI'm glad it's weekend now ha ha\n\nThanks! Last 3ish weeks have been pretty bad. Today was the first kind of ok day in a while. Plus my professor just graded my minor subject bachelor's thesis and I got a 5! (highest grade in Finnish universities)\n\nCongratulations!!!\n\nThanks! I've been doing that alongside with my master's and being a dad to a now 10 month old son while trying my hardest to keep sane. To say I've had a few grey hair over this during this year would be a huge underestimation. Master's is still a work in progress but this felt really good for a change.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not very happy today. I am feeling excited and hopeful in some aspects of my life, like the fact that I am entering a singing competition as recommended by a professional vocal coach when I went to a singing workshop recently, where I performed a song solo in front of people for the first time, and received really positive feedback. She said I just HAD to enter it. And she said she was excited by my talent and really thinks I could have a singing career. She described me as a \"perfect singer\" and was surprised to hear I never had lessons, and said I intuitively did everything right, and \"delivered the song beautifully\". Being told this by a professional vocal coach had me lost for words. Especially as I had never sung solo in front of anyone before, and was nervous I'd muck it up somehow. So I am really grateful for this opportunity to have my voice be heard and maybe even become a professional singer. It feels like for the first time, I'm not a failure and I'm doing something right.\n\nHowever, I can't deny the fact that I am struggling hilariously with depression and anxiety. The things that make me depressed is loneliness, (romantic loneliness and longing for my specific ideal person to materialize in front of me somehow), and setbacks regarding following my dream of traveling. I worry that my goal of traveling and the experience I want to have will never come to fruition because of things that are out of my control, and that I'll never get the chance to make it come true. It may seem stupid to other people, but it's really really important to me. And the mere thought of never experiencing this just sends me into a wave of tears.\n\nCongratulations on the singing part, I'm rooting for you!!\n\nThere's are a lot of people struggling with loneliness. You're going to find that special person one day, sooner or later, everybody has their person person somewhere in the world. I have a goal of traveling as well, in another country or in my own, I started last years to visit more, you don't have to go far from the beginning. Start with places close to you, places that you find beautiful and you've never seen in person. \n\nGood luck with everything and hope you're going to find that someone!\n\nThis sounds amazing.  I'm sorry you are lonely, but you're not alone. People all over the world feel the same.\n\nThat's very sweet.  Thank you.\n\nHope your OK!\n\nI am tired, but don't feel as exhausted as I use to.\n\nTurns out some of it came down to my job. Got another one magically, could not imagine a better fit right now.\n\nI dunno folks, things can go sideways in our lives but there is hope. It takes some work, like climbing a ladder. One step at a time!\n\nreally needed these words rn. :') thanks\n\nGodspeed friend! Typically skeptical of overly positive people myself, but 2024 has been kind to me so far after many years or a lifetime of frustration.\n\nI feel like I am finally in charge of my destiny and given the opportunities to shine. Always felt when I am down that something is just out of reach. And I have to give it that extra to get me there. Kind of beautiful in its own way! The universe will listen to you, just have to have patience, foresight, and a bit of style. Put yourself out there and you never know what may find you! (and it does, so unconventionally).\n\nI am a good cook around home and take pride in my crafts/food. When something sings, it means I've 'perfected' something more or less. Freaking beautiful IMO and it has happened fairly often.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have anxiety too. Attacks are more physical, like a sledgehammer across the chest for me. Seems to be a way through it though by 'just doing'. I hate to generalize, the best thing for me is to start somewhere and figure it out naturally.\n\nMy mantra: all good things come with time! Watch any regarded cooking documentary (arguably Stanley Tucci's series is fantastic in Italy!) and you can see the importance of high quality components to cooking. It's amazingly beautiful and resonating for me as an allegory to life and my pallette.\n\nMaybe this sounds strange, I get it. I think the world just pushes us too fast sometimes and we cannot control it. But, we control ourselves. \n\nBe like water, friend. Flow with it. Can confirm, it is OK on the other side. Let go!\n\nim studying to be an animator and i just finished a really difficult lesson as a beginner. and as you said, one step at a time, i am feeling a lot more accomplished today even if it took me the whole day to learn it. \n\nthanks and wishing you the best!\n\nToday is a lonely day for me.\n\nHugs.\n\nThank you ::hugs::\n\nHope your day would get better!\n\nSending virtual hugs!!\n\nThank you , I was doing great till back went out and heart started palpitating due to it . I just trying to remain calm and saying this too shall pass . Hope you are doing well .\n\nI‚Äôve been dealing with some heart palpitations today too üò≠ hope you feel better soon\n\nThank you and I hope you feel better soon as well.\n\nI‚Äôm ok. I‚Äôm going to call my friend soon and see what she‚Äôs up to. I‚Äôm kinda bored right now\n\nThank you for this uplifting reminder and asking!\n\nfeeling better how are u\n\na little bit tired but okay, thank you!\n\nme too, cant wait to sleep!!\n\nThank you ! \n\nAlmost flipped out because my car was running out of gas and I was already late to work .  \nBut I made it, I'm ok now\n\nHope all of you here are ok too !\n\nEvening from the Southern Hermisphere. I took lots of walks today. The weather was perfect. Got a lot of sun, did a lot of stretching...\n\nHonestly im running on 3 hours of sleep in the last 3 days, just finished a 14 hour shift so am to the bone tired. And also riddled with anxiety. But ill survive. Thank you for asking\n\nThank you for thinking of everyone, and I hope you're having the wonderful day that you deserve :)\n\nMy day has been rough, honestly, but I know that tomorrow is another chance for a better one.\n\nThank you!\n\nI like the way you think.\n\nBeing positive it's one of the best things you can do, it also helps with improving your mental health!\n\nYou're quite welcome, and I agree about positivity being so important. I even had a slightly better day today and managed to go out briefly, unlike yesterday, so I'm certainly feeling more positive. Hope your day has been a good one!\n\nFeeling a little better this afternoon after a tough start to the morning running around grocery shopping and running errands. Point is I went grocery shopping and did my errands. Afterwards everything had pretty much calmed down so today has been a good day. Thanks for asking OP.\n\nI'm doing fine. Thank you for asking.\n\nThank you for your kind words. This week's been really hard for me. It's just been a tough week for me. I spent Monday trying to get my windows open and fixed in the middle of hot weather with a father who has no patience. There's a show I watch on Tuesdays that I look forward to and they had their season finale this past Tuesday and it took a really dark turn which I didn't like and found heartbreaking, and it's still bothering me. Plus, I've just been under constant stress with no breaks from all the work I've had to do this week and this weekend.\n\nAlways take a break, even if it's a small one.\n\nDon't overdo it, always take care of yourself!!\n\nThis is too kind ü•π\n\nI feel very anxious. Recently went through a breakup &amp; I can't get it off my mind. Feeling down about it &amp; taking it bad.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that, hope you get better and find someone that would always be there for you!\n\nThis is something I needed very dearly! Thank you. My day just got a bit better. I've been exhausted trying to keep up with housework and my 7mo son.\n\nThank you.\n\nit's not alright :( having a bad episode of anxiety. currently off of work and still figuring out what my career path should be. debating between the creative and IT field. im afraid of not making it for doing my passion but at the same time im not smart enough for IT. feels like im spiraling into a dark place or maybe i close my eyes and be in a deep slumber for a long time. feeling so unworthy. is it possible for someone not to possess any skill or any redeeming qualities? i just hate it here...everything is so lonely and sad.\n\nI've dealt with the same feelings. I have always been good with art and design, but the reality is, people don't appreciate or pay for art. I, too, feel like I'm not smart enough for IT, but I have always loved technology and have done some work on my own computers. But coding and math-like smarts are my downfall. I'm the creative, hands-on type. I do like fixing things, though. I love science, but I am terrible at the math and equations.  I feel for you. I feel useless and abnormal here in my 50's. I've had jobs which were related to art or design, but never a career. Now I feel like I'm a sad shell of myself. I wish I could give you a hug and encourage you. I empathize so much.\n\nim so glad theres someone who could understand especially someone who is older. i have a stereotypical asian parents and they wish so much of me. i dont want to give up on art just yet.. i think the best way to have a career in art is to market yourself. it feels hopeless at times but i always have this miniscule of hope left in me that i can make somewhat of a career with art. because the corporate life was just so bad for my mental wellbeing.\n\nright now im learning every day on being an animator/illustrator and i hope to utilize the current media for my mission. currently, with the support of my bf i really hope i can do this. wishing that in the future we will be able to create something fulfilling for ourselves. sending love ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°\n\nI hope only the best for you. I still do freelance once in a great while, but no one wants a 55 year old graphic designer. I'd be better off doing Freelance. I should do It more. I have an old computer and still have Adobe CS3 I'm working from. UX is a big deal I hear. That may be a field you could settle into.\n\nAwe Thank you!! I haven't been asked that today no.  But I am doing really well right now.  I do have a looming homework and such, but my emotional self in this moment is happy, and that can be hard for me to get to sometimes.  I am learning that I have to take these moments of happiness when they come and live more in the moment.    \nHow are you?  What kind of day/month/year has it been for you?  Has there been ups and downs or mostly steady?  And thank you for your kindness.\n\nAlways take advantage of your happy moments because you never know when they would be back.\n\nI'm doing fine right now. I had my ups and downs, right now I'm trying to improve myself! Thank you for asking!\n\n&lt;3 !\n\nI'm doing good. My Zoloft has finally started taking effect, I haven't had brain zaps (knock wood) in a few weeks and a series of events that have been rough for us (dog had surgery, had to go back for more, wife and I got sick) are over. I have to have hernia surgery Tuesday but I'm not worried or anxious about it. \n\nTo all of you still struggling with anxiety, it gets better. There IS an end to it. For me it was a combination of medication and therapy that helped me both get relief from it and also get the tools I needed to manage it. \n\nYou got this.\n\nGood evening!  \nI'm suprisingly okay right now. My day was pretty bad but Im chilling rn\n\nThank you, I am going through a hard time, but this post genuinely made my day better :)\n\nLove this!! üíï keep smiling ü§ó\n\nThis is just the support I needed!\n\nGood afternoon. I‚Äôm going through a break up for the first time. It‚Äôs a tough feeling to grasp. I anticipate feeling better as the days move forward. I hope your day (whoever is reading) is full of good vibes and happiness. ü´∂\n\nYour a diamond, how very lovely of you. This has made a great start to my day especially how I've been feeling lately.\nThanks U most kindly ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nOn a bit of an upswing thankfully. From the outside I probably even seem pretty normal today. On the inside still pretty foggy and out of it though\n\nThank you üôèüèª \nI didn‚Äôt wake up as depressed as usual. But it‚Äôs still early. I will get in some argument with my husband before he goes to work . Sometimes he can be so supportive to me &amp; others times I don‚Äôt know who he is .\n\nUmm not doing good today.\nTravelling in a bus and fearful anticipation ruining my journey.\nThinking of popping a benzo rn.\n\nhi!!!! thank you for this!!! first off i hope ur doing okay as well. \nlife just feels like it‚Äôs moving too fast and i can‚Äôt keep up with it. a lot happening recently and i feel a lot of pressure. not sure how to destress so if anyone has suggestions i‚Äôll gladly take them :) hoping this will all pass soon\n\nSomething that I realised and a lot of people told me this as well.\n\nThe older you get the faster your life/time would fly by. \n\nOfc now it varies from people to people.\n\nyeah, growing up all the adults in my life said the same thing. i think it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre not as present in the moment as children. they‚Äôre exhausted and got things occupying their mind, on autopilot at work. it‚Äôs a crazy thing\n\nThe autopilot one it's so true, sometimes I do things without even realising how much I've worked/driven until I'm almost finished.\n\nThank you friend. I am good. Went and played football today, I was worried about palpitations almost non stop but made it all the way to the end and I'm glad I did. They are the bane of my life but I don't want them to stop me from enjoying things.\n\nHow about you?\n\nBe strong but don't force yourself too much, remember to relax from time to time and take breaks\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nMy baby‚Äôs first birthday party is tomorrow and I‚Äôve been cleaning and cooking for days! The end is near and the house smells like cupcakes, but my MIL has been vacuuming for 45 minutes straight and my brain is melting from the sound ü´†\n\nHappy birthday!!! üéâ\n\nBetter than last week and the week before. Drinking my water and starting to take a probiotic is helping. Deciding on taking a drive on Wednesday also significantly helped. I'll do another either tomorrow or Monday before the work week starts\n\nHappy to see you getting better.\nDrive safe!!\n\nStruggling post partum mama here‚Ä¶ one day at a time.\n\nNot doing good, but I took my meds and fed my cat. That's something good, I guess.\n\nHope you get better!\n\nBoop your cat nose, it always helps!\n\nI broke off contact with one of my interests/ partners? I'm polyamorous but I'm still VERY new, and it frightened me. He's a good guy but it felt too much like a relationship that went array and ruined me for almost a decade.\n\nBeen having an extra hard time recently mentally, physically and emotionally and to top it all off my dog is very sick with an ear hematoma and I can't afford to get her to see a vet :/\n\nCome by my office asap\n\nI'm sorry to hear that.\nHope he/she will get better!!\n\nThank you so much for asking. It feels so great to know that someone genuinely cares to ask. It makes me want to weep. My housemate is in her own world and is mostly oblivious to my feelings. Her heart is in the right place, but she just doesn't know how to listen. I'm struggling financially, and the drivers window on my car is not operating. I use my car to do about the only work I can handle, deliveries and some rideshare. I NEED this window to work, especially for working. It's frustrating being low income and tying to keep up an older car. My anxiety directly affects my ability to work. Then I get depressed and feel so abnormal. Snuggling with my kitty right now and trying not to fret about my car.\n\nhi there, I hope your day is going great!\n\nI don't feel really good today, my anxiety came back to me last month, and I'm trying to get rid of it. Me and my husband have been fighting this month, just about some stupid stuffs that I told him that it'd be nice if he didn't do it, but seems like he doesn't care much and blame me back. I know he has his points, and I might be too harsh about this but still, I feel really bad about myself. I started smoking again and having these thoughts about self-harm which to my husband, is \"cringe\". I hope that we could figure this out soon.\n\nDon't start drinking because it might make you start a road that you would never be able to come from.\n\nNever resort to self harm, try to find an activity that would take your mind from that, anything that helps, cooking, drawing, walks, music.\n\nHope you would get better, I'm rooting for your mental recovery!!\n\nthanks a lot :) that's really sweeet, have a nice day stranger üòä\n\nHi OP, hope you‚Äôre ok, and everything is going well for you. \nI‚Äôm trying to deal with the thought of losing my feline companion of 20+ years. She‚Äôs too old for an anaesthetic to get her teeth fixed and is having trouble eating. I‚Äôm spending most of my time looking after her, even though I should be concentrating on finding a new place to live.  She‚Äôs been in my life longer than any other animal or person, and it‚Äôs hard to imagine life without her. ü•∫\n\nYou're one of the best people on this earth, not giving up on someone like that. Thank you for caring so much.\n\nI have a canine companion that's around 14y old, I'm afraid of losing him but at the same time I know there's nothing i can do when the times has come, that's the course of nature. \n\nBasically they are a part of a family. \n\nYou are giving her the best life she could have. Thank you for that as well!\n\nAnd I'm sorry.\n\nI‚Äôm in a similar situation with my canine companion as well. She‚Äôs starting to have issues with her back and legs. We‚Äôre not exactly sure how old she is because she‚Äôs a rescue, but we‚Äôre keeping her comfortable with massages and painkillers, and hoping that she‚Äôll be with us for a little while longer.  Some people don‚Äôt realise how important our companions are to us. My dad gave me my first dog because he knew that I wouldn‚Äôt hurt myself if I had someone/something that was dependent on me. She was a very special girl who got me through some of my darkest times. \nI hope your canine companion has a long and healthy life and that you have many more good times together.\n\nMy dog is in ICU and my dad is in ICU as well due to cancer. I had 3 hours sleep due my super loud neighbors and I am always either at the vet or at the hospital. \nI have been prescribed paxera + mirtazapine or alternatively fluoxetine + xanax. And been looking at the meds so scared to start again after 11 years. They are sitting on the kitchen counter for the past 2 months. I have extreme anxiety and depression. I want my life back, but I don‚Äôt know how. I am losing my everything as well.\n\nWhat I'm about to say it's kind of basic but\n\nI'm sorry to hear that, hope they get better, I'll be rooting for their recovery. \n\nTry to use headphones that play soft/lofi/pink noice/any music you like or calms you down.\n\nTake it easy, start to do things that you enjoy, something that helps me a lot it's going to small walks through nature. \n\nIf there's anything that I can help you with, you can dm me, I'm always free to talk.\n\nThank you so much‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nThe entire second paragraph is triggering AF! I tell all of my family and employees never to ask me how I am. I either have to lie, or relive the horrors in order to share them.\n\nI apologise for that!\n\nDude I'm kidding. I embrace my anxiety! Thinking back, there was nothing better than having a gran-mal anxiety attack while juggling my Blackberry while trying to simultaneously talk on the phone and answer emails from elected and appointed officials while flying across seven lanes of Atlanta Interstate highway madness. It's a wonderful I never stroked out with my pulse rate hitting over 3 beats per second! Thank God for fast acting Xanax!\n\nI was fine in the morning, now I have a strange feeling in my left chest and I think it's something bad but I'm not feeling sick or in pain and I wasn't feeling like that before and both my blood pressure and heart rate are good, anxiety is terrible sometimes, literally the first thing I think is that my heart is stopping/failing, it's horrible to live like this\n\nDo you think about/see anything specific before that happens?\n\nNot exactly, it's just my daily fear of dying that awakens from time to time, even going to the cardiologist and taking tests I still don't feel confident in my heart, you know, even going to the gym awakens this fear in me for fear that my heart won't be able to handle the routine and I'm only 19 years old, it's practically impossible for this to happen and I don't have any blood pressure problems either, but sometimes I panic out of nowhere, you know?\n\nThx for asking but dm me if you really really want to know\n\nHey thanks, man, that was really nice."

    "title": "An Open Letter to Anyone Struggling with Anxiety",
    "body": "There was a time in my life when anxiety ruled everything. I didn‚Äôt realize it at first; I just thought I was overthinking or being cautious. But it wasn‚Äôt that. It was waking up with a racing heart for no reason. It was avoiding calls or messages because I was scared of saying the wrong thing. It was replaying conversations in my head, trying to figure out if I messed up. It was lying in bed at night, physically exhausted but wide awake because my mind wouldn‚Äôt let me rest.\n\nOne moment that stands out for me was during a simple outing with friends. On the surface, I was smiling, laughing, and part of the group. But inside, it felt like I was on a battlefield‚Äîheart pounding, stomach churning, my mind constantly scanning the room for imaginary threats. No one around me knew. I was good at hiding it. Too good.\n\nThat‚Äôs the thing about anxiety‚Äîit‚Äôs invisible to everyone else. You can look fine, act fine, and even convince yourself you‚Äôre fine. But deep down, you‚Äôre carrying this weight that no one sees.\n\nI remember the breaking point when I realized I couldn‚Äôt keep doing it alone. I was sitting in my car, too drained to even start the engine. I felt like I was stuck, but I also knew I didn‚Äôt want to live that way anymore. That moment didn‚Äôt fix everything, but it was the first time I acknowledged that what I was feeling wasn‚Äôt ‚Äújust how life is.‚Äù It was anxiety, and it was okay to admit it.\n\nWhat I‚Äôve learned since then is this: anxiety doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre broken, and it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre weak. It means you feel deeply, you care deeply, and sometimes your mind gets overwhelmed by it all. And that‚Äôs okay.\n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this and it feels familiar, please know you‚Äôre not alone. You don‚Äôt have to have it all figured out. Start small. Talk to someone you trust. Take a few deep breaths. Remind yourself that you‚Äôve made it through every anxious moment before this one, and you‚Äôll make it through this one, too.\n\nAnxiety may always be a part of me, but it doesn‚Äôt define me. And it doesn‚Äôt define you, either. We‚Äôre all stronger than we think, even on the days when it feels like we‚Äôre barely holding on.\n\nTake it one moment at a time. You‚Äôve got this.",

    "all_comment_text": "Thank you for this‚Ä¶ currently struggling right now and this was the encouragement I needed.\n\nI‚Äôm really glad this could offer you some encouragement. Struggling with anxiety can feel overwhelming, but remember, you‚Äôre not alone, and it‚Äôs okay to take things one step at a time. Be patient with yourself and trust that this struggle can lead to growth, even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it right now. You‚Äôve got this, and I‚Äôm rooting for you.\n\nYou described me perfectly. Thank you.\n\nI‚Äôm so glad it resonated with you. It means a lot to know that sharing my experience could help in some way. Remember, you‚Äôre not alone in this, and you‚Äôre stronger than you might think. Keep going you‚Äôve got this.\n\n[removed]\n\nYou don't owe me anything-you've already paid me by letting me know this resonated with you, and that means so much to me. Just pay it forward if you ever see someone in a similar situation, try to help them or let them know they're not alone. That's all I could ask for üôè\n\nThis made it easier to go to sleep tonight\n\nThis hits home, thank you for this.\n\nGlad it hit home. Sending you positive vibes\n\namazingly true, thanku...\n\nYou are more than welcome\n\nThank you for sharing these thoughts and kind words...\n\nGlad it resonated with you. You‚Äôre not alone in this\n\nThank you\n\nHappy this helped\n\nThank you for this ü•∞ Can I ask if you got on any medication or how you handle your anxiety?\n\nThank you for asking. I‚Äôve personally chosen not to take medication because, for me, anxiety has been something I‚Äôve learned to work with rather than numb. Medication can be a helpful tool for some people, and there‚Äôs no shame in using it if it supports your well-being. But in my experience, anxiety isn‚Äôt just something to get rid of‚Äîit‚Äôs your body‚Äôs way of telling you that something needs attention. It‚Äôs like an alarm, a signal that you‚Äôre stretching beyond your comfort zone or carrying unresolved emotions.\n\nWhen I started to view anxiety as a teacher rather than an enemy, it changed everything. I began to ask myself: What is this feeling trying to show me? Is it asking me to slow down, address something I‚Äôve been avoiding, or challenge myself in a new way? Instead of running from it, I started leaning into it, learning from it, and using it as a guide to grow.\n\nIt‚Äôs not easy, and it takes time, but learning to understand anxiety rather than suppress it has brought me more clarity and resilience. The key isn‚Äôt to escape the discomfort it‚Äôs to face it and let it shape you into someone stronger and more self-aware. Have you ever tried exploring what your anxiety might be telling you?\n\nThanks for this truly. And I hope I don‚Äôt come across as a negative Nancy, but how can I be patient with myself and take it a day at a time if the environment I‚Äôm living in is a big cause of my anxiety rather than it being mostly just internal and for no reason? That I can‚Äôt escape from anytime soon? If anyone wants a little more dets. Feel free to message and chat with me. Thanks.\n\nAnxiety is defeated by being kind to yourself. Taking care of yourself, indoctrinating yourself with positive words of affirmation, and doing the things you find difficult. Every time.\n\nThis was fantastic to read - thank you \n\nI‚Äôve been struggling with Anxiety ( health anxiety) for many years now , lots of tests - lots of Dr visits !\nAnxiety can trick you with new pains and sensations and makes you believe something else might be wrong with you - \nIt‚Äôs a tough journey-took me many years just to admit to myself that‚Äôs it‚Äôs JUST ANXIETY-!! \nHopefully some light at the end of the battle -\nGood luck to all here\n\nBeautifully said! I truly believe we will find peace in our lives!\n\nI had surgery a month ago and the anaesthetist was reviewing my notes. He asked if I still had problems with anxiety. He was referring to an op I had 10 years ago. \n\nI smiled and told him it wasn‚Äôt a problem any more. I think it‚Äôs the first time that I have truly realised that I‚Äôve beaten it. I was torn up by anxiety for 20 years.\n\nBeautifully written üíï\n\nThank you! Saving this\n\nThanks for sharing this. I had the same moment some years ago when I had my first panic attack out of nowhere.¬†\n\nI tried therapy, medication, etc and while now i'm generally much better, the anxiety is here to stay. I don't want to start on antidepressants again. My doc said we could try ketamine therapy, I might take up on his offer. I don't think there are many things I haven't tried yet.¬†\n\nwhy don‚Äôt you want to start antidepressants again?\n\nThey helped me to function and cool down when everything was spinning out of control, but generally they made me numb both physically and emotionally. I have troubles connecting to my emotions and my body and it just made the matters worse. The bigger reason is also the fact that starting and stopping it takes a huge toll on you. I don't want to go through that and have to calibrate how everything feels and works in my brain again. I feel my life is under control and Duloxetine has served its purpose for me. I need something else to help me let go, not numb myself. I can do survive without that thankfully.\n\nIf you feel you are in a bad place, then don't hesitate to start on it by any means. It has saved me, plain and simple. But I'm done with it after 5 years of taking it everyday.\n\nI have discomfort and pressure in my left ribs where spleen is located, my all medical reports even ct scan is normal but this hardness in ribs is not going away what can I do, anyone experienced this?\n\nYepppp. My body comes up with new symptoms every time I accept the current one. Really annoying, ngl. The body can be very creative! But it‚Äôs very simple. Anxiety = stress. Stress does a lot of things to our body. If it‚Äôs head, legs, chest, stomach- every region can feel weird because of anxiety. But believe me, you can trust the medical reports. Especially CT Scans. Imagine, if you would have something serious going on with your organs, it would also show in many other ways.\n\nI also did ct scan of abdomen its also normal no disease found everything is normal , so it's anxiety symptoms? Left ribcage discomfort, pressure?\n\nIf my reports are normal, I am fine and healthy? So it's just anxiety?\n\nPretty sure it is. Did you make blood tests?\n\nI have sent you dm plz check it\n\nEveryone on this sub needs to hear this. It does not define us. Beautifully put.\n\nRemember during the really hard times, you actually can and have got through it. That is my absolute light that I will have times (be it days/hours or months) where the anxiety subsides somewhat\n\nThis is how I feel all the time... Thank you for the kind words üòå\n\nLooks like my anxiety is mild compared to this post..\n\nThank you for this. Sometime I try and stay away from this sight because it gives me more anxiety. I have been telling myself for the past week that oh well it‚Äôs anxiety it‚Äôs uncomfortable but I will be fine. It will not run my life. I will run my life. I‚Äôm hoping to retrain my brain. God is in control AND IM IN CONTROL (trying) but I can do this. We all can do this. This is a season. I have had anxiety for 15 years. I can go a year with mild anxiety here and there. This year has been the worst but I know this will pass I have been under a lot of stress which makes it way worse. Sending prayers to all who suffer. We got this. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª\n\nThis is literally me\n\nYour words are really helpful!\n\nThanks for this. I am struggling with this.\n\nI can't do the talking part because everyone around me, online and irl, including near and dear ones, feel too fake and superficial when it comes to empathy and listening. Maybe it is an extension of my anxiety issues themselves. I just have myself, when it comes to these issues. And it has been comforting to me from time to time.   \nAll I have to do is refer to myself as \"we\". \"We can do this, we have done this before, we are strong, we can make it\". It helps me make my \"inner motivational voice\" and \"the anxious doubter\" and \"me as whole\" feel like a team of 3 that the former will lead to victory.\n\nJust came across this and thank you for putting this out\n\nVery much relatable and you're on point about thinking \"just how life is\" cause I find myself more often than not thinking \"it is what it is\", but I'm working on combating it now\n\n&gt;quoted text***It was replaying conversations in my head, trying to figure out if I messed up. It was lying in bed at night, physically exhausted but wide awake because my mind wouldn‚Äôt let me rest***\n|\n||\n|||\n||||\n||||| \n\nThis is my school life in 10-17, This is my work life in 20's and 30's, I stopped doing it in 40', what a waste of time, people don't even care or remember the tragedy created in my mind, it doesn't exist, it's called being insecure and stems from some sort of trauma, abuse, suffering, financial problem. Just being poor and seeing the rich have evrything, even people you hire for work like landscaping repairs treat you like sh*t, it just gets bottled up. I once exploded duing the covid lockdown, lost my mind and went crazy drinking. The world is not a nice place without money. I think this is my core of it all, no dads, no uncles, no outside family or friends, People are so terrible when they are your kin, they just don't care. Worldy people just use people who care and in turn the caring get sick with forms of anxiety and bodily health conditions.I stopped trying to figure it out and reason with cruelty and insanity, it helps greatly to detatch from people who you think are friends but you know otherwise, it's really hard, just say no and you will see their true side come out. It gets easy after that...\n\nDelete them from your life.\n\nThank you so much for this. I opened my eyes this morning and immediately felt anxious.¬† I e been sitting on the couch all morning trying to pull it together. People who don't have anxiety can't understand how debilitating this is.¬† I just read somewhere that low vitamin D can be a cause. I am willing to try anything. Once again, thanks for showing us we aren't alone.\n\nThank you"

    "all_comment_text": "The moment i wake up i get flooded with anxiety and my first thought is fuck im back to reality. It also starts to flare up around 3-7pm for some reason. After that i start to get pretty calm.\n\nUnless i get triggered and get a panic attack, that can last 24/7\n\nIdk why it took me so long to find out, but I discovered that the body hits you with alarm/stress chemicals to wake you up in the morning. To most people it's nothing. To you or I it's hell. But, by design, with no other influence, those chemicals wear off on their own.\n\nExactly the same!\n\nTotally same for me...but I got a prescription for propranolol and take it early when I get up to go the bathroom.muts helped with early morning panic\n\nHow‚Äôs this helping you? My Dr increased mine to 2x daily now.\n\nI now take 3 10mg a day......panic way down....I take one early in am....when I get up to use bathroom....then go back to  sleep .(..if u get up early take one in the middle of the night). \nThen I take one middle of afternoon; then one about 11pm...helps me relax.\nIt's helping to curb all the throat and chest symptoms of panic.. so since that's down I don't feed into it and re Panic myself!\n\n.I just do the slow breathing...also have noticed the throat symptoms are from GERD ..so I started taking a ppi.... doctors have told me this will heal in a few weeks.(And in the past I know this to be true...it happens when I drink coffee alot )..but now I'm not so scared!\n\nHoping my antidepressant keeps getting better like it has each week..\nI think the key is to take a very low dose more frequently......\n\ndoes it take care of the chest heaviness and like the surge of adrenaline or whatever it is for you?? I‚Äòm fine at night but I‚Äòm a couple days away from a public speaking event and I wake up in the mornings full of anxiety. I‚Äòm talking racing heart beat, probably elevated blood pressure and this feeling of dread and anxiety in my chest and stomach. \nDoes propranolol help with the chest anxiety?? I feel like my physical symptoms ARE the cause of my anxiety\n\nMy psych said this is what it‚Äôs good for too\n\nGood to know. I was skeptical about propanol, I‚Äôve never had it prescribed for anxiety. I will say my anxiety was unbearable, chest pain/ can‚Äôt breathe- it was horrible. Now it‚Äôs definitely down maybe a 4 daily compared to a 12 out of a scale of 10.\nI‚Äôm on 20mg twice a day\n\nMe too¬†\n\nSame. Comes on right when I wake up then it calms down a bit but comes back twice as bad around 2:30-3 pm. It‚Äôs hell.\n\nevery min of the day since i wake up i deal with\n\nMe too. But it‚Äôs worst in the morning for me\n\nsame for me!\n\nit‚Äôs like after resting all night your body resets in the morning with all of the anxiety that was dormant all night. and it hits you like a ton of bricks when you wake up..\n\nNights\n\nMe too. I‚Äôm so scared for tonight and it‚Äôs only 6:13pm. I‚Äôm supposed to start a new job tomorrow and I really need the sleep.\n\nPretty normal to feel that way before a new job\n\nNights for me too, usually during the day I try to keep busy and keep my mind occupied with tasks. But the moment I stop, that's when the thoughts and feelings and anxiety come flooding in.\n\nExactly the same here. I wake up feeling pretty good and productive. Thankfully my job starts at 5:30 AM. But I wake up around 3 AM so I can get chores done. And when I get home I‚Äôll get some stuff done. And take a little nap. But starting around 6 PM the impending doom thought start flooding in.  I worry about my parents dying, my self dying, my cats dying, bills, being homeless one day‚Ä¶ just everything negative‚Ä¶\n\nUsually I will have to take a sleep aid to go to sleep because the doom thoughts are so overwhelming\n\nThe morning is the worst. Then in the late afternoon/evening\n\nI just get this feeling of existential dread every single day. It‚Äôs getting so heavy to lug around\n\nI get the same surge. I‚Äôm finding that I‚Äôm stuck in a cycle.  It will last 3 or 4 weeks with varying degrees of anxiety throughout the day.  Then it literally disappears. I find listening to podcasts and meditating are helpful. Im reading a book called D A R E\n\nusually before bed\n\nBefore bedtime, I find myself working late into the night and then end up with insomnia. ü´†\n\nMine is definitely from when I wake up until just after lunchtime. It tapers off in the late afternoon and at night. Go back 10 years ago and that was completely the opposite. Sending you hope, we will get there\n\nmine is worst like between 1 and 3 pm but i pretty much have anxiety all day. if not anxious, depressed\n\nMe too..\n\nMorning, hate waking up and having to deal with everything once again\n\nIt also gets pretty bad when I can‚Äôt sleep at night, but it helps a lot by listening to music or something in my AirPods\n\nMe too\n\nMine flairs up at night, I just wanna sleep!\n\nFor some reason night time is the worst\n\nMorning. Some days I wake up dry-heaving. Usually, by about 9, I feel better. By noon, I‚Äôm ready to take on a dragon. The next morning, however, I‚Äôm sobbing and can‚Äôt get out of bed. No real reason why.\n\nNighttime, usually starts at midnight and then I can‚Äôt fall asleep until like 2-4am because of it. When everyone else is asleep and I‚Äôm the only one awake, my mind starts racing and I‚Äôll be thinking about any and everything. It‚Äôs the worst.\n\nAs soon as i wake up\n\nMorning is just brutal. Sometimes I wake up in a sheer panic and can't get out of bed since I'm so \"off\". Ugh.\n\nAll day baby üéâ\n\nI'm doing better now, but at my worst, it was from morning to night. I did not realize I was anxious because it was constant and it would never, never stop. I knew the panic attacks happened and it was bad, but they were random. I thought that was the only anxiety I felt. I'm healing now, and I realize that I was never really calm.\n\nDefinitely before bed cause I have so much nightmares I dread going to sleep\n\nMorning. Maybe has something to do with cortisol levels. By evening it‚Äôs usually settled and I can get to sleep ok. Unless I really get wound up about something that day.\n\nMine is the worst first thing when I wake up and usually gets better as the day goes on.\n\nNighttime for sure\n\nMost of the day but it really hits at night, especially as I‚Äôm trying to fall asleep. Cannot stop overthinking.\n\nI wake up in the middle of the night most nights at around 3 am with the most intense anxiety.\n\nSame! And it‚Äôs actually every night. Sometimes I lie awake until my alarm goes off at 6am. It‚Äôs so exhausting.\n\nMe it‚Äôs defo afternoon late or evening never morning morning is always the best\n\nAs soon as I open my eyes it begins.\n\nRight when I wake up, when I am around people, and the middle of the night\n\nMornings are worse for me..as soon as I‚Äôm conscious but ya know still kinda dozing off, I think about what I should be worrying about today. It sucksssss\n\nMorning and before bed are always really bad for me. Specially if I have work.\n\nLate afternoon/early evening, but it‚Äôs typically gone after sundown. And it‚Äôs usually worse in fall/winter.\n\nNight all the damn time, I wake up with my heart sinking¬†\n\nI wake up with it too and dread going to work\n\nFirst thing as I'm waking up, almost always in a panic. It sets the tone for the rest of the day.\n\nFrom late afternoon onwards!\n\nMine is so on and off I‚Äôve never really found a pattern tbh. I could be fine most of the day and then it randomly appears. I usually deal with some amount of anxiety at any point during the day\n\non and off, sometimes mornings sometimes evenings. it sucks that i'll take any small change in my schedule or just anything 'bad' that happens in the day and spiral until i have an panic attack. it sucks a lot and i've been considering going on meds more and more, for now it's manageable but idk what the future will look like\n\nYes.\n\nMornings, Nights and any meal time\n\nMornings, like the first 3-4 hours after I wake up (which is usually 6a-9a/10a)\n\nI feel the exact same thing!\n\nMornings are the worst for me as well. From the moment I wake up it lasts about 4-5 hours. I usually end up caving and taking a Xanax just to get some relief. I‚Äôm going to be upping my meds soon and hoping that will help.\n\nSeems like it hits before daybreak and mid to late afternoon, but I'm on prozac so it's been regular vs any old time when I wasn't taking anything.\n\nI think cortisol levels are at a peak in the morning, which could possibly attribute to higher anxiety levels in the morning :)!\n\nRight when waking up. And then for some reason, lunch time until mid afternoon. üòû\n\nMorning def the worst. Sometimes mid to late afternoon as well. \n\nNothing better in my day than 8 PM-midnight, when my body is the most calm.\n\nMornings, definitely\n\nNight time, I struggle to sleep and when I do, I have nightmares\n\nMy anxiety is so bad in the evenings. I wake up in the morning and feel amazing. So I try to get everything done as early as possible. Because after about 5 PM it‚Äôs almost impossible for me to leave the house‚Ä¶ \nAnd then after 7 its the impending doom thoughts start up. I finally just tried to go to sleep around 9 PM. And wake up the next morning feeling good. But the cycle begins again‚Ä¶ \n\nI wake up around 3am. Because my job starts at 530am. So I try to get all my house stuff done before I head to work..\n\nIt's worse on Sunday evenings.\n\nMorning....very typical sx of major depression....called diurnal rhythm as opposed to nocturnal\n\nEvery single minute\n\nMornings, and then afternoons. It sucks big time\n\nEarly afternoon for some reason ü§∑\n\nAll day. From the minute I wake up to the minute I go to sleep.\n\nI feel like mine peaks right before lunchtime (aka right before I get to have a break from interacting with people at work) and then again at night before getting into bed\n\nFirst thing in the morning, whenever I‚Äôm alone, every night before bed currently 11:36pm I‚Äôm exhausted but my anxiety is too high to sleepüòÖ\n\nRight when I wake up, until I realize it‚Äôs just phone withdrawals and it‚Äôll go away if I grab my iPacifier off the charger. Then late at night until I realize I should get the fuck pff my phone and put my sleep mask on.\n\nSunday night is the worst day of the week for m , because I feel completely miserable, bored, anxious, lonely and irritated, but then I drop some meds and say hello to the Hatman\n\nEvenings. I have more down time so more time to think and worry.\n\nMornings recently. Every morning I wake up at like 6:00am with pretty severe anxiety and nausea. I've developed a routine of forcing myself to eat either a banana or greek yogurt, drinking a bunch of water, making some mint or ginger tea (optional) and then taking like a 45 minute walk, jogging part of it if I feel up to it. On a good day, my anxiety starts to taper off in the early afternoon and I feel something near normal in the evening. Other days the nausea and anxious feeling persists all day. According to the internet it has something to do with your body pumping out cortisol in the morning in an effort to start the day strong, but in an anxious body it doesn't have the desired effect. Here's to hoping and praying that with care and time it will change. In the mornings I have developed a mantra - \"Don't believe the lie that the morning tells you. Remember the truth from the evening.\"\n\nAfter lunch\n\nYes.\n\nNight time, and sometimes in the morning but that's usually if I have to deal w/ something unpleasant that day.\n\nlunch time, like 11:30-1:30\n\nMornings right when I wake up, and then at night if I‚Äôm having trouble sleeping.\n\nafternoons/dinner time\n\nWednesday nights around 8:30pm\n\nNight time\n\nLate afternoon/evening through the night recently. Sometimes it turns into panic attacks right at bedtime and then I can't sleep. Going through a rough spell currently ü•≤\n\nright as I open my eyes it gets really really bad, then gets better and bad again, later at night.\n\nForever it was dusk, especially when dusk happens during normal day hours. The idea that they day was ending and I still had ‚Äúthings‚Äù in my brain paralyzed me\n\nNow, it‚Äôs middle of the night. I can‚Äôt sleep anymore and I lie awake thinking and so I dread like 1-4am\n\nWhenever i am hungry my anxiety levels always amplifies . I usually catastrophes everything in my life and loose hope in everything\n\nMornings when I get to work.\n\nThe mornings. I think it has something to do with cortisol levels.\n\nYes\n\nMorning by far\n\nIt can happen strong at anytime.\n\nAround 4-5pm\n\nMiddle of the night\n\nAs soon as I lay down when going to bed and even worse as soon as I wake up (mostly in the middle of the night around 3am). Racing thoughts and catastrophising sets it after five seconds and I can‚Äôt fall back asleep.\n\nMy insomnia is a product of my anxiety.\n\nThe moment I have to think about going to sleep\n\n3am-7am\n\nMornings are the worst for me. If nothing happens to provoke my anxiety, I'm usually pretty good by bedtime. I think that's because my medication builds up over the course of the day and completely wears off overnight. I usually wake up around 4 am and can't get back to sleep without at least 5mg of buspirone\n\nInterestingly, mornings I feel very good, because I am trying to tackle the day. But it gets worse towards the evening and during midnight if I wake up. I feel like I wasted my day and get anxious.\n\nNight time. I would frequently find myself feeling generally ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù and panicky\n\n3-6 pm\n\nI feel like it‚Äôs not the morning just bc of how slow I wake up. I‚Äôm physically up about a half hour after I wake up, but I swear my brain doesn‚Äôt turn on for a good two hours. When I used to start work at 11 I‚Äôd wake up at 6:30 and just start to feel normal when I clocked in.\n\nIt‚Äôs usually worse in the late afternoon and evening. By the time I go to bed I‚Äôm usually just like fuck it I‚Äôm going to sleep I‚Äôll deal with this shit tomorrow\n\nAs soon as I lay down to sleep at night ü´†\n\nInteresting most people say the mornings, one person mentioned that cortisol is the cause as it starts to build up to a peak from the morning and dies back down around 4.00pm. I think it's normal in most people, but when you have anxiety your central nervous system is out and it creates too much cortisol. Best thing I've found is to exercise it out. A 45 min walk or something similar. I k ow that's not a luxury we all have. But maybe it helps to understand what is going on. Oh and also anti anxiety drugs help too, but I find the walk is a definite cure.\n\nIt‚Äôs always a surprise!   It‚Äôs like a surprise party everyday!  Whooohooo!\n\nUsually around the afternoon, especially if I wake up late.\n\nAbsolutely in the night time usually around 9-11pm and it keeps me awake for hours\n\nUsually mid afternoon\n\nEvenings, especially on Sundays.\n\nParalyzing in the morning. Then around lunch it wears off. Have lost jobs because of it\n\nSame!! I‚Äôve called in several times in the past due to paralyzing panic in the mornings\n\nDEFINITELY past 10pm. Also, if I don‚Äôt get out of bed right away in the morning, anxiety likes to camp out all day in my body ü•∞\n\nNights, actually it starts as soon it gets dark, rainy days are horrible but yeah it's most difficult to deal with in the night. Falling asleep has become a struggle.\n\nMorning and sometimes night time before bed.\n\nRight when I wake up and late at night\n\n2-4am\n\nMost often upon waking.¬†\n\nMy understanding is that this is fairly common - in part due to rising cortisol levels.¬†\n\nEver since being treated with clonazepam 1mg twice a day (in addition to mirtazapine and propranolol) and undergoing CBT - I have far less anxiety in the morning.¬†\n\nEarly in the morning when I wake up and later once it gets dark out.\n\nnight by far. once the sun goes down, it‚Äôs like a switch flips.\n\nMy anxiety flares up an hour or two everyday before work, whenever have to talk to someone other than the family I live with, and when I have to leave the home.\n\nI hit the ground running from the minute I get up and I am so insanely busy all day at work that it keeps my mind busy and the anxiety mostly at bay. For me it‚Äôs night time, when I‚Äôve done all the things I can do to distract my mind, and it‚Äôs finally time to get quiet and settle down. THEN my anxiety rears its ugly head.\n\nWhen i was in high school it was in the morning and then some of my day. Now its when i should be sleeping. Idk if i can take it, i thought things would get better. But yk school ‚Äútherapists‚Äù.\n\nWeekday mornings. Monday morning is the worst. Each day towards the weekend and each hour towards the evening, it gets a bit easier.\n\nLike many have stated, this might be related to cortisol levels and definitely stress, and flight, fight, or freeze mode is part of this equation.\n\nI wonder if anyone had done more research about this, measures cortisol levels, or found out what can be done about this?\n\nusually night time, makes it very hard to sleep, trying to sleep is impossible bc my mind can't help but overthink\n\nMorning and night\n\nWhen i wake up and when i try to fall asleep\n\nI fall asleep relatively easily. Then I wake up around midnight and I'm up with anxiety through the next day. I want coffee in the morning but concerned it'll make me even shakier.\n\nSunday scaries every Monday morning and others sometimes. Def the morning when I want to hide away in my bed. I work from home so I enable myself to do just that\n\nI find going to bed gives me so much anxiety. During the day, I can at least try to distract myself, but laying in bed sometimes makes me get anxiety attacks. My mind just thinks up a bunch of awful things or conclusions for how I'm feeling and then I can't sleep at all. It's currently 1am and I'm fighting off an anxiety attack, but I seriously feel like crying\n\nAs soon as I open my eyes. Then 3-4p unless I‚Äôm working. \n\nThe worst time for me though is 9-12a. But maybe that‚Äôs the depression\n\nNight. It gets so so so awful probably because I‚Äôm starting to wind down/brain is going quieter.\n\nWhen I wake up in the morning and when I go to bed at night are tied for first place.\n\nIn the morning. Then I take my meds and it gets better.\n\nI would say early afternoon to early evening.\n\nNight time\n\nnot time of day but when i havent eaten. for some reason when im hungry my anxiety is at its worst\n\nWhen I am trying to go to bed (aka right now). My head goes crazy thinking of all the things I might have done wrong and trying to figure out what I did to get friends to ghost me. The conversation I had with a specialist who told me I had trigeminal neuralgia, which is also called the suicide condition.  He told me that people are in so much pain that they lose their friends, their family, and eventually their life. I have lost several friends, my husband said if things don't get better he see us getting a divorce (he has said it is better but truthfullythe pain is continuing to worsen. I just ball it all up inside, fake a smile, and try and act like I am not in excruciating pain). \n\nI keep hoping I will go to bed and wake up a pain-free or at least manageable pain, but it has been over 3 years of this.\n\nSorry for the ramble tonight is an extremely rough night. I am in beyond excruciating pain, wanting so much for some kind of relief!\n\nWhen I‚Äôm at work.\n\nI usually wake up with a jolt, heavy breathing, fast heartbeat &amp; all these worries come rushing into my head but it subsides once i get out of the bed &amp; proceed with my day.\n\nBut night time is the worst, as it darkens my mind begins darkening too. Everything seems scarier. It doesn't reduce but increases as the night proceeds.\n\nMorning for me. When it‚Äôs really bad, I wake up and a sense of complete dread about everything sets in within 2-3 seconds, and it‚Äôs an absolute battle to even get out of bed to push on with my day. \n\nI‚Äôve been taking magnesium biglycinate and ashwaghanda before bed every night lately which has been helping a bit - it doesn‚Äôt get rid of the morning anxiety but it softens it to a more manageable level. I definitely notice the negative difference when I forget to take it.\n\nMy mistake was expecting for anxiety disorder to just fix itself. It's not gonna happen. I regret waiting so long and I mostly regret reading horror stories because they were all just a lie for sympathy. It's intended to fuel into your anxiety. You think you avoid side effects by not taking the med? But then you just suffer side effects of untreated anxiety disorder which is life debilitating\n\nThe whole day!!!\n\nMorning and like 3-5p.m for sure\n\nMine is before bed..I‚Äôm up right now thinking about all sorts of stupid shit that stresses me out..I have zero control over -_- I don‚Äôt know how to shut this shiat off.\n\nAlso‚Ä¶.whatever you‚Äôre experiencing or feeling? It‚Äôll pass. Just remind yourself of this. ‚ò∫Ô∏èü•∞. I hope you feel better soon!\n\nThere are some Situations who trigger it.  \nEspecially when I have to ask someone that I need them to do or give me.\n\nBut mostly in the evenings. Once the day is coming down and I have time to process everything.  \nSuddenly tears are running down and I have no idea why and what¬¥s happening\n\nFirst thing in the morning (the second after I wake up is pure adrenaline ) and also at sunset. I don't know why the sunset thing happens but It definitely triggers a change in my state of mind\n\nMornings. Like someone opened the flood gates, one thought two thought‚Ä¶.. you get the drift.\n\nAfternoon, horrible disassociative melancholy\n\nMornings.\n\nUsually emd of the day. That's when all my coping skills start to wear off.\n\nThe morning takes a while to subside\n\nEvening/Night.\nEvery single day.\n\nBetween 7-11 pm\n\nAs I'm getting into bed, and when I first wake up. Hell of a way to end and start my days.\n\nthe morning is when i get hit with it the hardest. it tapers off from there. monday morning is like a nuclear bomb. i‚Äôve been anxious to tears some mornings. like this feeling that i wish i could just lay in bed and cuddle with my wife all day.\n\nIn the past year or so, I‚Äôve realized that when I have nightmares, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm getting overheated in my sleep, almost like my bodies way of trying to wake me up. I‚Äôm 19w pregnant and the vivid dreams/nightmares are definitely amping up so I‚Äôd say night time üôÉ\n\nWhen my redbull wears off\n\nFrom the moment I wake up until I get home from work. Life gets so hard, anxiety ruins everything\n\nEarly afternoon seems to be the worst for me. The natural lulls in our energy levels and such is what I partially attribute it to.\n\nIt used to be Sunday evening when I was younger. Then it became like before a major event. Now it‚Äôs Monday morning. I woke up again in a cold sweat at 430 and was so exhausted of just fighting the nausea and negative self talk. The rest of the week is fine but something about Monday lately is just soul crushing.\n\nHonestly my life is pretty slow normal and great my job isn‚Äôt bad at all. Taking some coding classes and that shit is hard. But surviving. \n\nI am in therapy. I feel like I am doing all the things and medication and boom anxiety still hits. I don‚Äôt get it.\n\nDefinitely mornings and midday. In the evening and nights my mind naturally calms down\n\nIt depends, usually night time especially if I‚Äôm alone. But as soon as I wake up if there‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been worrying about it hits me again.\n\nMornings\n\nAfter dinner, closer to bedtime is the worst for me.\n\nWhen I have to go to work.\n\nMorning &amp; late at night. If I wake up at 3am, my anxiety will keep me awake until 6am. Its horrible.\n\nMostly after eating lunch, idk why but I feel anxious for an hour or two\n\nNight time, right before I go to bed (sigh).\n\nEvenings, I always feel like there‚Äôs so much to do no time to do it\n\nAfternoons when I start to feel like there aren't enough hours in the day to accomplish every thing I want to get done\n\nFor me its the evening! I hate the evening because how isolating it is i need to put on music or a show or movie and cant stand the quietness where as in the morning it just feels like a fresh new day and usually im busy threw out the day so its easier for my body and brain to get distracted\n\nAs soon as my eyes open in the morning and sometimes during the night randomly\n\n5 hours into an 8 hour shift. Stopped once I put my 2 weeks in though. Kinda crazy. Also, as soon as it gets dark out.\n\nEvening\n\nFor me it's in the evening, the later into the night the worse it gets .\n\nNighttime\n\nSame, right now I'm having a hard time because I didn't sleep well, and it makes me anxious, also at night because I know I won't sleep\n\nRight before I fall asleep\n\nMine is worse in the mornings. It‚Äôs not until I get my mind busy doing something that my anxiety eases.\n\nI have always been a ‚Äú happy busy bee all day‚Äù and then a swift flips in the evening and everything that‚Äôs worrying me rears its head and I was always helpless to fight the waves. \nExtensive behavioral therapy is working wonders, more than meds ever have\n\nDefinitely when I wake up, even worse when I get up at 5am to go to work.\n\nThe moment I leave work. Somehow I can‚Äôt switch from how tense I‚Äôve been all day to relaxing. I end up pacing the first hour and it horrible\n\nMine seems like a buildup over the day. \n\nCalmer in the morning, worse as the day goes on, I start to overthink everything and then my mind is drowning.\n\nI have night anxiety for sure.\n\nMorning, early afternoon and before bed üôÉ"
