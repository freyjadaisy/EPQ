Breaking away from traditional sequence models, transformers employ **self-attention** mechanisms (more on this later) as their core building block, enabling them to capture long-range dependencies in data with remarkable efficiency. In essence, the transformer can be viewed as a general-purpose computational substrate—a programmable logical tissue that reconfigures based on training data and can be stacked as layers build large models exhibiting fascinating emergent behaviors.\n\n",

    "body": "Hey folks,  \nI’ve been building a small programming language called **Razen**, and I’m excited to share a big update. I’m 16, and this project started as a fun experiment — but it’s been growing steadily, and now it has its own **VS Code extension** to make working with it a lot more comfortable.\n\n# What is Razen?\n\nRazen is a lightweight, beginner-friendly language designed with flexibility and simplicity in mind. I wanted something that felt different from most traditional languages — more expressive, less rigid. It’s still in active development, but the idea is to make it both fun and functional.\n\n# What’s New?\n\n* **VS Code Extension** Now available with syntax highlighting and basic support. Makes writing Razen code way smoother.\n* **New Features &amp; Keywords** Added things like `razen:freestyle` for more open, dynamic logic. Also improved how variables work and cleaned up a lot of syntax.\n* **Core Improvements** Performance is better, codebase is more organized, and things are just more stable overall.\n\n# Try It Out\n\nIf you’re interested in language design, like playing with new ideas, or just want to see something built from scratch — give Razen a shot.\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/BasaiCorp/Razen-Lang](https://github.com/BasaiCorp/Razen-Lang)\n\nOpen to feedback, thoughts, or contributions. Still early days, but I’m proud of how far it’s come. Thanks for reading!",
