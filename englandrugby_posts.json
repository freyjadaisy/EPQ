    "title": "Plea to England Fans: Please watch the domestic game - and if you do, here's who to watch out for",
    "body": "\nAround the international windows, we naturally see a big spike in interest for rugby. There are so many England rugby fans who are big into the international games and that's great. \n\nHowever, for the sake of the game in the country, what's really needed is more eyes on the domestic game. If you're a new fan of the sport who's got into it for the first time from these autumn internationals or a regular watcher of England but not the club game, please consider giving it a go and try to get into it between now and the Six Nations. All the games are available on the same channel as the autumn games so, unless you've been sailing the high seas to watch, you've got access to them.\n\nUltimately, the England team we all support relies on there being a strong domestic game in this country, producing good quality players. The only way that happens is if we support the leagues, even those who may be neutrals in terms of club affiliation.\n\nSome of you will be England fans first and foremost and not have any particular interest in any club or player aside from how they may benefit the England team. **That's perfectly fine!** It's probably how the majority of English fans who weren't brought up supporting a club feel when they first start watching the club game. \n\nWith that in mind, I've tried to put together a little rundown of players to watch out for who England-only fans may not have come across and I feel may be challenging for international selection in the near to mid future. I've arranged them in order of club.\n\nI'm sure I've forgotten some people or maybe you don't rate some of names so please feel free to tell me I'm an idiot!\n\n-\n\nBath:\n\nGuy Pepper 21: Flanker - was involved in the England A side earlier this year. Would surely have been picked against Australia A but for picking up a knock a week before the autumn started. Turnover specialist and surprisingly strong carrier. One of the names I'm 100% certain has a future at international level.\n\nMax Ojomoh 24: centre (predominantly a 12) - Another who was picked for England A earlier this year but kept out due to injury. Very silky playmaking 12. Regularly plays alongside Ollie Lawrence for Bath. Not really a big body gainline monster but his all around skillset is excellent. Played some 10 and you can tell.\n\nBilly Sela 19: TH prop - Part of this year's England U20 S Six Nations and World Championship winning side. Looks a cut above almost every other prop in his age bracket. That U20s side's scrum monstered every other scrum it came across this year, even the likes of France and South Africa. Almost certainly has an international future.\n\nKepu Tuipolotu 19: Hooker - Previously captained the England U18s. Looks absurdly athletic for a hooker. Genuine pace, strength and excellent ball handling. Will 100% play international rugby. Also qualified to play for Wales.\n\nTyler Offiah 18: Wing - the son of the great Martin Offiah (played both league and union for GB and England and the player \"Swing Low\" was originally sung by England fans for). Made his debut recently in the prem cup. May not get much immediate opportunity due to his age and the senior guys ahead of him. One for the future.\n\nTed Hill 25: 6/ lock - Been desperately unlucky with injury. For my money hes been the best 6 in the league this season. Hard as nails, makes metres through contact but this most noticeable thing is just how fast he is. Genuinely winger quick. Should have been capped this autumn. He's long overdue.\n\n-\n\nBristol:\n\nGabriel Ibitoye 26: Wing - One of the most exciting players to watch in the league. Freakishly good offloading game. Very quick, strong through contact. Many people question his defence and the \"nuts and bolts\" of his game. Played for the England A team this autumn and was brilliant. My head tells me it's unlikely Borthwick ever picks him, but my heart wants to see it!\n\nFitz Harding 25: number 8 - Captains Bristol. In my opinion one of the most underrated players in the league. Can do it all as a number 8. With so many quality 8s knocking around I'm not sure he'll ever get capped but it could happen.\n\nJoe Batley 28: Lock - Been in red hot from this season. Really exceptional running and offloading game for a lock. Injury kept him out of the England As after getting picked.\n\n-\n\nExeter:\n\nGreg Fisilau 21: number 8 - Not the biggest 8 in the world but a bit of an athletic freak. Extremely fast, very good try scoring record and absolutely bangs people in defence. Played for England A twice. Another I'm very confident has a test future. May need to bulk up a little before then though.\n\nPaul Brown-Bampoe 22: wing - playing his first season of professional rugby after tearing up the university game. Has also played England 7s. Taken to it pretty seamlessly and has been a success story for Chiefs in an otherwise poor start to the season. Big, strong, quick, scores tries. One to watch.\n\nJosh Hodge 24: Fullback - Played England A earlier this year. Lightning quick and plays with a real swagger (can come across as very cocky which is no bad thing). Capable of pulling rabbits out of hats. Cannon of a boot and a very accomplished goal kicker too. Some people question his defence and his bulk but nobody questions how fun he can be to watch.\n\nRusi Tuima 24: Lock - Not the tallest but an absolutely enormous human. The closest thing to Meafou we have playing in the prem. Not hugely fast but his sheer size means that he's a very strong carrier and his offloading game is also very strong. Nose for the try line as well. Another who's been involved in both England A games.\n\nZach Wimbush 21: centre and wing - he's a 6'6\", over 110kg English centre. Been out with injury recently but has just returned. Frustratingly from an England POV seems to play most of his rugby at 13 and wing but can play 12 too. Supposedly also Welsh qualified.\n\n-\n\nGloucester:\n\nGeorge Barton 24: Fly half and fullback - Taken a little while to really break through but has looked very good for a much improved Glos side this season. Has recently moved to fullback. Has an absolute howitzer of a boot and one of the best goal kickers in the league. I'd be surprised if he gets a call up but stranger things have happened.\n\nSeb Atkinson 22: inside centre - Another English 12 who isn't necessarily the biggest bit of kit but an excellent play maker. Glos fans will tell you he should have made the England A squad and it's hard to disagree. With England's lack of depth at 12 he may well get capped in the future.\n\nJack Clement 23: back row - seems to have been around for ages despite being so young. Another ex age grade England player. Very strong ball carrier. For my money Glos always look better with him in the side.\n\nAfolabi Fasogbon 20: Tight head prop - another from the all conquering England U20s side. For my money the pick of all the front row from the team. A physical monster. 6'4\" and over 130kgs already. Very strong scrummager for his age and also a very high work rate. Played England A this autumn. You can bet your mortgage that he ends up playing test rugby. Genuinely could be England's starting tighthead sooner rather than later and then for the next decade.\n\n-\n\nHarlequins:\n\nCassius Cleaves 21: Winger - Hugely impressive at age grade rugby. Has unfortunately been unlucky with injury since and so not played as much for the first team as his talent deserves. Electric feet, extremely quick, deadly finisher. I think another who will be in and around the England squad before too long.\n\nOscar Beard 23: 13/ wing - Hard as nails. Quick. Scores tries. Can absolutely light guys up in defence. Positionally flexible. Imo could and maybe should have played at 13 for England this autumn. A matter of time until he gets capped. \n\nNathan Jibulu 21: hooker - rumoured to be off to Sale which is a pity for Quins fans. His lineout is pretty respectable but where he shines is in the loose. A real ball of energy and fierce in the carry. Could well play test rugby in future.\n\nWill Porter 25: scrum half - Seems to have pushed Danny Care out of the starting side at Quins. Extremely quick service and has formed a really nice partnership with Smith at 10. Played for the England A side and was excellent. With England's scrumhalf position being so up in the air behind Alex Mitchell, it wouldn't shock me at all to see him in the Six Nations squad.\n\nLennox Anyanwu 23: inside centre - Had to bide his time behind Andre Esterhuizen at Quins but this year has been their first choice 12. Not the biggest lad on paper but a really hard ball carrier. Also can really light people up in defence. Rumoured to be off to France next season which would be a crying shame from an England POV but may benefit him in the long term.\n\nCadan Murley 25: wing - Perhaps the most overdue cap on the list. Been involved in so many squads without ever being capped. Fantastic winger. Has been top try scorer in the league before now. Lethal finisher and built like an NFL running back. Best traps in the league. Been unlucky with injury and the fact it's such a competitive position but surely at some point he gets capped. 5 tries in 2 games for the England A side won't hurt.\n\n-\n\nLeicester:\n\nFinn Carnduff 20: back row - Captained the England U20s side. Seems like a proper workhorse back row player. Clearly has a bit of leadership too. Not the most exciting player on this list but in terms of someone to do the dirty work, he could be a great choice for the future.\n\nJoe Woodward 21: inside centre - No relation to Clive! Come into the side this season and seems to have pushed Dan Kelly down the pecking order and has even kept Kata out of the side at times. Taken to senior rugby like a duck to water. Another English 12 who isn't the biggest but his all around game is really nice.\n\nEmeka Ilione 22: back row - An ex age grade star. Been unfortunate with getting limited minutes at senior level. Athletically looks really good. Not the tallest which may have held him back from playing 6 in a set piece dominant team like Tigers.\n\nTom Manz 23: lock - Has just come into the club from The Championship and so far been really really impressive. Really big bloke, 6'8\"and pushing 130kgs. A lot of depth ahead of him at Tigers but so far he's been excellent. \n\nWill Wand 22: centre - recently joined from the championship and so far has looked very good. Quick, elusive runner, scores tries. Has some real test quality ahead of him in Izaia Perese but when he's played he's looked good. Unfortunately joined the club after Harry Potter had left which is a shame for commentary teams and headline writers.\n\nFinn Theobald-Thomas 21: hooker - Another ex U20s player. Athletically seems very gifted though needs to work on his lineout throwing in my view. With Montoya leaving in the summer there could be an opening there to really cement himself in the regular match day 23.\n\n-\n\nNewcastle:\n\nJamie Blamire 26: hooker - Unlike the rest here has been capped by England before. Been a shining light for Newcastle for ages. Arguably should move if he has ambitions of playing more test rugby in future. Really complete hooker. Good in the set piece. Quick around the park. Good carrier. They should build a statue of him to be honest.\n\nBen Redshaw 19: Fullback/ Wing/ Centre - Been regularly playing senior rugby for Newcastle since last season. Says a lot for how highly they rate him seeing as he's so young. Tough for any back to standout too much in what has been such a poor side recently. Been a star for England U20s and captained the side as well. Another who may need to leave to fulfill his potential.\n\n-\n\nNorthampton:\n\nGeorge Hendy 22: Wing/ Fullback: Saints are blessed with back three players at the moment (the entire back three Vs Japan were Saints players) but Hendy has been so good that he's really forced his way into the starting side. Big, strong, freakishly strong through contact, lightning quick, extremely ginger. Won man of the match in the prem final in the summer. Imo a travesty he wasn't in the England A side this autumn..\n\nArchie McParland 19: Scrumhalf - hugely impressive for someone so young in a position we're not the strongest in. Extremely quick around the park, very good support lines, good kicking game, fast service. Will learn a lot from playing with Alex Mitchell. Id expect him to become Saints' replacement 9 by the end of season. Played England A this autumn. Another U20s player and another I think will be playing test rugby in the next few years.\n\nHenry Pollock 19: Back row - Get excited. Probably the most hyped English player since Marcus Smith came through. Absolute age grade star. Injuries at Saints means he's played more this year than I think anyone predicted and hes picking up man of the match awards for fun. The guy could well go on to be not just a test player but a world XV candidate in his career if he can fulfill his potential. \n\nTarek Haffar 23: loosehead prop - played for the England A side twice now. Exceptional in the loose and good in the scrum too. Could well play test rugby.\n\nImmanuel Iyogun 24: loosehead prop - seems like he's been around for ages but been hugely unlucky with injury. Similar story with Haffar. Could potentially force his way into the first team squad.\n\nCurtis Langdon 27: hooker - Been the form hooker in the league over the last 12/18 months. May well have been selected in the Six Nations squad were it not for picking up a ban just before. Did play England A this autumn and scored the pick of the tries. Really explosive ball carrier and just plays with so much aggression. Imo should have been in the squad this autumn.\n\n-\n\nSale:\n\nJoe Carpenter 23: fullback - Toured with England in the summer. May well force his way into the England squad again. For my money a more complete fullback than Steward and maybe even Furbank though perhaps lacks a real standout quality. \n\nRekeiti Ma'asi-White 21: centre - been unlucky with injury so far in his senior career. Plays most of his rugby at 13. Not the biggest quy in the world but hard as nails and very strong through contact. Got that Polynesian strength. \n\nRaffi Quirke 23: scrumhalf - has been capped before but ever since has been absolutely dogged by injury. Desperately needs to put a run of games together. For my money England's most physically gifted 9. \n\nBen Bamber 23: lock - Huge bloke. 6'9\" and pushing 130kg. Late arrival to senior rugby but one to look out for, for his frame alone. He's not hard to spot. Been in and around the England A set up.\n\n-\n\nSaracens:\n\nTom Willis 25: number 8 -  Has been capped before but only for a warm up game. Player of the season so far in the prem in my view. Most metres made. Most defenders beaten. Most carries. Near the top in turnover won. Jack Willis' brother. Baffling that he didn't get a senior call up this autumn. I'd have thought he's dead cert for the Six Nations but I thought that this time.\n\nTobias Elliot 21: wing - In his first season of senior rugby and has barely put a fut wrong. Extremely skilful, quick, scores tries. Ex age grade player and could well force his way into the international set up at some point.\n\nSam Spink 25: centre - Recent arrival from Western Force in Super Rugby. Cant say I know much about him but theres a huge amount of excitement around him. Has been out injured but is back fit now. Can play both 12 and 13.\n\nOlly Hartley 22: inside centre - Serious unit, something we generally lack with English 12s. 6'4\", pushing 110kg. Not just a big crash ball 12 though can do some of that. Has very good hands and also a knack for scoring tries. Wouldn't shock me at all to see him in the England set up soon. Has already played England A.\n\nHugh Tizard 24: lock - Made the jump from Quins to Sarries (bro thinks he's Tevez...). Perhaps didn't make the impact expected at first. This season though he's been a man reborn. Earned his spot in the England A side and has been fantastic all season. We're not blessed with *loads* of locks behind our main three so could force his way into the England reckoning.\n\nNathan Michelow 20: back row - Bit of an age grade star and has captained the side. Really strong all around back row player. Has had a surprising number of appearances for Sarries at such a young age, especially considering their absurd depth there.\n\nPhil Brantingham 23: loosehead prop - Arrived from Newcastle in the summer. Hasn't played all that much due to injury so far but I believe is back fit now. Strong scrummager which is always needed. \n\nOlamide Sodeke 19: lock - formed one half of the partnership with Junior Kpoku for the England U20s side which has to be the most physically imposing age grade locking partnership I've ever seen. He's 6'9\", pushing 130kg. Unfortunate to pick up an injury before the England A game. Looks like a matter of time until he gets capped.\n\nLet me know who I've forgotten or who has no place here!\n\n**Edit: the importance of supporting the club game is if anything even greater at Championship, National 1 and below levels. The importance of the lower leagues is massive to the England team and shown by the sheer number of current and previous players who cut their teeth in the lower league. It was remiss of me not to mention that.**",

    "all_comment_text": "Hell of a post!\n\nI was very much purely an international fan until I got fed up of not being able to get England tickets and without any real knowledge went to the match at my nearest prem team and haven’t looked back! I’d definitely encourage people to take a chance on a day out at their local club (prem or otherwise), it’s a very different vibe to internationals, not just a jolly for people getting on the piss. Very easy to interact with your favourite internationals after matches too.\n\nFantastic post, thank you so much for the effort out in!\n\nSecond this. The Premiership is properly entertaining too this season. Especially Bristol, any game they’re involved in is worth a watch. (Not a Bristol fan).\n\nBristol Quins has 6-3 written all over it now.\n\nI’ve doomed it haven’t I? 🤣\n\nNice selection, and I'd say please get down and watch local rugby not just at Prem, but Chamiosnhip and Nat 1, where overall the quality remains high if you accept that the players a little slower and smaller. Local clubs need gate money and you'll find the welcome and great crack. I'm a season ticket holder at Bath, but reguallry try and catch Blackheath on free weekends. \n\nIn terms of the Bath selection, I'm not sure you'll get to see Sela, Tupolotu or Ofiah playing with the first team at right now but Pepper, Hill and Ojomoh are out on the hallowed rec turf\n\nProbably the most important post written this ANS\n\nAlso if you don't have a premiership club nearby you may have a championship club to watch\n\nVery true. Poor of me not to mention that\n\nFantastic thread, this has me hyped for the return of the premiership. \n\nIn a biased Saracens level, I’m really excited for Spink and Hartley. We’ve never had a consistent and powerful centre pairing so hoping this becomes a bit of an anchor for our attack akin to the Sprinboks using DA and Kriel.\n\nAre there any good highlights packages / shows to watch out for regarding the domestic game?\n\nAll the highlights are available on YouTube. There's also a weekly highlights and preview show on ITV called Premiership Unleashed\n\nAlso check out the Eggchasers podcast - they do a run through of fixtures from around the top leagues every week. Perhaps one for someone already into the game who wants a bit more insight rather than a complete newbie.\n\nHighlights are all on YouTube. ITV has a weekly highlights show on a Wednesday I think and TNT do one but you have to be a subscriber.\n\nITV have put together a new show this year - Gallagher Prem Unleashed. Released every Wednesday after the games and has highlights and fan interviews etc. quite fun and light hearted catch up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwheu2lrz83e1.jpeg?width=2175&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0ffaf89c033843510f3998b5bdf418fbbc69531\n\nHi u/away_associate4589, commented something of the ilk below but thought I’d ask you directly since you’ve clearly got a good understanding of this stuff; who do you think is best suited to being England’s centre partnership going forward?\n\nI can't say I'm able to give you any better answer than anyone else. Ask 100 England fans and you'll get 100 different answers!\n\nIf it were up to me I'd like to see Dingwall 12 and Lawrence at 13. I think that's the best performing English 12 and the best performing English 13. Although, I think Freeman's future may lie at 13 as well which would be interesting.\n\nThat said, in the long term if I had to pin my colours to the mast I'd say Hartley is the most exciting prospect there.\n\nIn my view we need to pick an actual out and out 12 rather than two 13s, even if that 12 isn't a superstar. I think it would add some much needed structure and understanding compared to the fudge we have at the moment.\n\nThanks, appreciate the response! I think I’m in agreement, Dingwall and/or maybe Freeman as our centres could do us well in the short term, and then I suppose we just have to wait and hope who comes good for us at 12.\n\nFantastic post Associate.\n\nCouldn't do better if I tried. Well done man.\n\nWell done, youve got me super excited about taking my 1yo to his firsr game on sunday 🙂💚💙\n\nYou should blog/pod this info. You might be able to turn it into a revenue stream over time\n\nJamie Blamire is leaving Newcastle for Leicester so that statue wouldn't last long.\n\nThat's why he's leaving. They refused the statue clause he wanted for his new contract\n\nI'm happy for him, he deserves better than us.\n\nId still give him the statue\n\nBrilliant posts, thanks OP. Think 3, 9 and 12 are the only real problem positions for England, hopefully some of the talent you’ve named here can make the leap. A settled club centre partnership  could be so valuable; Dingwall/Freeman, Ojomoh/Lawrence or Spink/Hartley could all be a great centre partnership but think this 6N is probably too soon to hope for that.\n\nI'd add **Callum Chick for Newcastle**. Think he could be a Mark Wilson type figure for this England team. Hard as nails both sides of the ball, relentless workrate, does the unfussy and unflashy and would leave someone like Earl to pick his moments in the wide channels \n\n\n**Arthur Clark - Gloucester**\n\n 19st 12lb and stands around 6ft 7in tall. Big, athletic, hard working skillful. England lack a bit of size in the locking stocks and Clark could add to that. Played well for England A\n\nCallum Chick is class. Deserves a statue next to Blamire's. Something about him always strikes me as a Leicester Tigers type player, surprised they never signed him. I just can't help but feel the international ship may have sailed for him now.\n\nArthur Clark is great as well. Definitely should have included him. Was probably the best lock in the A game.\n\nIt probably has. But I think his skillset makes the most sense if we don't pick T Willis.\n\nYeah I don't mind Isiekwe as much as others seem to. But Clark would probably be my 4th choice lock for the 6 nations. Just to see what he can add. If it doesn't work out you can go back to Isiekwe.\n\nT Hill is definitely a 6 for me but probably just loses out on his bench spot to CCS.\n\nHe is probably the most like-for-like in terms of skillset with Willis.\n\nWho'd be your starting 6? Chessum?\n\nDid a lengthy response this the other day and it's [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/englandrugby/s/KFIZy7Bbt4), I get people won't agree with every pick but I think I've reasoned my points well\n\nI used to only watch the international stuff but being hungry for more I ended up getting TNT sports with my EE phone plan it’s been great!\n\nI am a neutral with my closest club being sale but being to far from it to attend a game, shame the north isn’t invested in union like I wish it was.\n\n👏👏👏👏\n\nThat is all.\n\nI always do, is much better. I can't wait for the weekend's fixtures.\n\nWhat a brilliant post. Love club rugby and hope this inspires others to check it out.\n\nWorth a watch. Games are more entertaining, most teams kick for the corner, until they have got the 4 bonus point tries or it’s down to the last ten minutes.\n\nAlso games are very competitive. Except for Newcastle, any team can beat each other.\n\nUnless you’re Exeter 😉\n\n😥\n\nNeutral here, Exeter will come good - they have had a massive overhaul of players the last couple of years and so many of those guys playing for them are fresh out of uni (or in Feyi-Waboso and Ross Vintcent's case still in uni); Rob Baxter's a top coach with alot of experience nurturing young talent and I wouldn't be concerned abt them in the long term if I were a fan\n\nAs a Wasps fan, I just can't stay interested in the Prem. It still hurts too much\n\nI hear that. Hopefully the move to Kent becomes a reality and they can get up and running again. Maybe even back in the champ next season\n\nGreat post.\n\nOut of all the centres who do you think might be our solution at inside centre?\n\nCould someone tell me what dates the “seasons” are?\n\nGenerally how to watch them?\n\nWhat championships/leagues there are?\n\nAlso.. who is the best to support 😂😬\n\nThe seasons start in September time and run through until May.\n\nThe premiership games are on TNT Sports. The European games unfortunately are no longer in TNT and are now on Premier Sports.\n\nThe Premiership, the Championship, National League 1 are the top three leagues. \n\nWhoever is your closest team!\n\nI DO watch the club game every weekend and this is still useful for me.\n\nLove this. Great run through.\n\nAlthought as falcons fan, the Radwan erasure hurts!\n\nRight now I spend most prem weekends checking out our new crop of THs and any 12 who looks half big and half decent. I'm a sad, sad man.\n\nI honestly though Woodward was Clive's nephew. I have no idea why. Got high hopes for him, looks like he has the room to get over that 100kg, is powerful in contact and skillful.\n\nI feel a bit bad for missing out Radwan but I'd be pretty stunned if he ever plays test rugby again.\n\nI admire his loyalty to your boys but I can't help but think he could have been a 30-50 cap player had he played for almost any other side in the league.\n\nIf he played in the Top14 we'd all be shrieking for him to come back as the saviour of English rugby.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe could have had a Johnny May career of he'd been in the right place and been as willing to work on other areas of his game as Johnny.\n\nChance would be a fine thing. There is currently no way to watch the Prem from New Zealand. \n\nThe premiership site lists a bunch of places to watch internationally but the NZ one (Sky New Zealand) is wrong. Sky say they don't have them. I also spoke to an aquaintance who works at Sky NZ and they said Sky defo don't have the rights and they don't think they were even offered them this time around. \n\nWe've asked the Premiership directly but had no response. Anyone know why has the Premiership stopped showing in NZ? \n\nI was told the same is true from South Africa though can't check. Anyone else having this problem internationally?\n\nTo the high seas!\n\nPretty much\n\nI used to watch Prem here in the states on Peacock. Was quite convenient and enjoyable. It's on some small streaming site now, not paying yet another fee. Hopefully at least the 6 nations remains on Peacock in the future.\n\nHe's not new to the scene but I'd love to see Alfie Barbeary stay fit and get a chance at No. 8 for England\n\nI think he could work as an impact player but hasn’t been as good this year. Definitely has potential though\n\nFitness seems to be his issue, in more ways than 1...\n\nI really wish he’d stuck with it at hooker, he could’ve been a big weapon there.\n\nNo. \n\nI don't watch speed climbing apart from the Olympics."

    "body": "There is so much negativity around English rugby atm, some of it warranted, some it not. This is the chance to create some positive feedback following the ANS. \n\nTo be clear there are plenty of criticisms I have atm around selection, tactics and coaching but this is not the place \n\nHere is my non-exhaustive list of suggestions:\n\n1. Marcus Smith is clearly an international standard fly half and whenever he's been playing 10 for England they've put in more than competitive performances against some of the best teams in the world \n\n2. Ollie Sleightholme came into the ANS inexperienced and unproven at international lvl. 4 tries in 5 games and solid performances in every game show he is ready to start at international lvl if and when required\n\n3. Will Stuart has performed well this ANS and has firmly solidified the TH position. Might have AOF on his shoulder in the near future but he can hold his head high this autumn\n\n4. The width of a post and the catch of a restart change the entire narrative around England completely\n\n5. England now goes into the 6 Nations underestimated. Nobody expects them to win the tournament and the pressure is off to an extent ",

    "all_comment_text": "Itoje getting plenty of captaining experience, with George getting substituted routinely early in the second half of games, it looks to me that he's being prepped for the main job.\n\nAgreed i seem to remember Eddie Jones being quite critical of Itoje's lack of leadership vocality so it's gd to see he's built on that this ANS\n\nI’ll take Mark McCall’s view of his leadership qualities over Eddie Jones any day.\n\nDid he not take it back at some point?\n\nMarcus Smith has clearly cemented himself as first choice fly half. Almost everything good England did this autumn ball in hand, he was at the heart of it. Defensively he looks much much better than he did previously as well. \n\nWill Stuart has definitely improved, especially at scrum time. Training alongside du Toit and having a Saffa coach seems to have done him the power of good. I'd also say Genge seems to have improved in the scrums as well.\n\nSleightholme is clearly an international level winger. Carried over his try scoring form for Saints into the England shirt and you can talk about kick chase and extra jackal threats all you like but you can't put a price on a winger who just has a knack for scoring.\n\nSam Underhill as a machine. Would be my first name on the team sheet. \n\nOverall, we were a width of the post away from beating the All Blacks, lost to Australia ultimately from a fluffed restart in the best performance they've put in for *years* and were well in the game against The Boks. \n\nAlso, they don't get much credit but England have actually played some really lovely attacking rugby in all four games. I feel the \"Boring Borthwick\" label is still there and perception hasn't quite caught up to reality - a bit like we see with Sarries at domestic level. They play some beautiful running rugby but people don't really give them the credit for it and think of them as an ultra pragmatic side.\n\nI know the close losses are hugely frustrating but if just one of those goes the other way, people are looking at England very very differently. We're really not that far off being a very good side - the defence does worry me and it will be interesting to see if they change tack come the Six Nations, but even if they don't, with more time with the new coach you've got to hope it will get better.\n\nKeep the faith lads!\n\nYeah I think the fact we’ve had really exciting games to watch can’t be understated\n\nI genuinely think Englands biggest problem is the bench.\n\nIf Borthwick starts bringing on players like Hill, Pearson, Willis, Chessum instead of Isekwe, Curry and Dombrant it would make a big difference.\n\nThat and dropping Slade. Despite his hybrid contract, would make a big difference\n\nAgreed, we have been a bench away from winning so many matches this year. We’re asking Itoje and Martin to do the job that four SA locks do and it’s impacting their performance in the last 20 which has a knock on impact on so many areas. Chessum, I imagine, will start 6 with CCS off the bench so we could still do with someone coming on at lock still. Maybe Joe Batley, he’s certainly got the size. I hope Willis is given a shot because we need someone to help Earl with the carrying and he’s no slouch in defence either. \n\nI’d be happy to give Dingwall a shot, I’m not wild about him but I’m not sure how more many chances Slade can get. He was good today in attack but we need him regularly performing against better teams than a callow Japan side.\n\nerrm Borthwick brought Chessum in and he's only out due to injury. \n\nSlade was excellent against SA. He was also pretty good on tour this summer and fantastic against Ireland and France last SN. I just don't get the negativity. Anyway, it doesn't matter as he has a contract and so he will feature in the SN in some way. \n\nCurious though - who would you suggest bringing in? I just don't see a queue... otoh I see Freeman at 13 (plus a few others) as a big threat to Lawrence.\n\nThink his defense has actually been bad at times and he isn't the second playmaker option he should be. \n\nId go Freeman, or Dingwall.\n\nFreeman won't be a playmaker, Dingwall gives 5kg to Slade. \n\nI agree about the defence, but is it system or is it him? I dunno (of course - idiot on the internet) but he's a pretty smart rugby player and I think he's trying to do something that just isn't working. Anyway - he gave a snappy pass in the buildup to Earls try, was the provider for Freemans try that got scratched, pulled off a wonder catch and brilliant right footed kick (he's a natural left footer) on for Freeman to make his silly behind the head pass to Furbank. Tell me what other recent international center could have done that? I think Farrell, Jordie Barret... and then I can't think. Last weekend he was the provider for Sleightholmes try (with a lovely hold and pass) and also scored (but it got scratched). \n\nIn attack - I don't know what folks expect.\n\nI agree with Freeman not being a playmaker, although he is underrated in that. Respect.\n\nBut Furbank is, and we don't need three.\n\nHe has had some good moments, you are right. And has got some skills, just not sure on the balance right now\n\nOne telling thing is how much better the defence looked with IFW on the outside - they have a clear understanding from Exeter and IFW is an absolute menace in a blizz defence - he smokes peeps. But, there is something bad in what's going on with defence and England do not have a real point of difference in the center atm. On the other hand I just don't see an option until one of the big young uns makes a claim, or alternatively Makepeace-Cubitt turns out to be the second coming (although he is very small for a centre)\n\nI think Ben Curry was solid in limited opportunities. I would've had him today instead of his brother for the head reasons\n\nThe others I agree with u\n\nBen Curry is a good player, but not a good substitute, imo.\n\nHe's just not abrasive or powerful enough for me, I'm that role.\n\nSleights has been good... in attack. Some of his defensive decision making has been abysmal but I think I blame the system / coaching rather than him.\n\nStuart has, performed.\n\nI think Genge, Martin, Earl, JVP, Slade, and Furbank have all under performed. But we know what they CAN do, so it's Borthwick's job to get the best out of them.\n\nI am totally unconvinced that Isiekwe and Randall are international standard. Time to move on from Ford and Cole. And I think Dombrandt has had enough chances now, much as it pains me to say that as a Quins fan.\n\nYes I agree the system has made guys like Slade and Sleights out to be worse players defensively than they rly are\n\nAgree abt all of the ones you're unconvinced by. I'd still have Ford and Cole in the wider training squad but I think both Fin Smith and AOF have earned the opportunities to be in the 23\n\nBen Spencer also put in some promising performances (yes I know he's old) and for me would be the backup ahead of JVP atm. Good news as well for England that Mitchell is still to come back who will likely start when he's back to full fitness\n\nMitch is not going to lose any sleep at night about his place as the starting 9 after that stint of games.\n\nYes completely agree Mitchell should start with Spencer as sub imo\n\nSlade has shot forward out of the defensive line every international that I can think of so blitz should have suited him, I love him as a player but something isn’t quite right in the centres.\n\nAgree - and absolutely we need some positivity to help lift the boys - and yes Marcus is our ten. He’s going to continue to grow in terms of control and leadership, but he’s already world class\n\nI'd go as far as saying any England fan who thinks Marcus has been avg this Autumn needs their head examined - there's been moments where he's pulled this team kicking and screaming into competitive contests with literally some of the best teams in the world\n\nHe gets alot of hate from SH fans but I have no doubt if he played for SA or ABs he'd be rated even more highly than he currently is\n\nSmith good\n\nWings good \n\nItoje good\n\nWill Stuart good\n\nUnderhill good\n\nBaxter and AOF good \n\nOther Smith good\n\nWill Stuart good? He's not even in the world's best 5 tightheads.\n\nIdk what games you've been watching but Will Stuart has been good this autumn and I don't think that's a controversial take\n\nI mean that's a ridiculously high bar for the 8th best side in the world\n\nThat was his best showing for England and he more than held his own\n\nYeah sounds let's keep being 8th best in the world then, no need to expect any better\n\nBut we're not expecting, we're evaluating?\n\nWill Stuart was good this series, not exceptional, I don't see how that's controversial. If that's a difficult concept for you to understand then I can't help you\n\nWill Stuart’s pass miss pass was fit as fuck, and it will be completely overshadowed by Sleightolme’s unbelievable finish. Great try that.\n\nPetition to say 'fit as fuck' whenever a prop makes any achievement starts here\n\nIs nobody acknowledging Luke Cowan-Dickie's form? I think he's been brilliant.\n\nRandall and Finn Smith were both excellent when they came on.\n\nWe've got the spine of a good side \n\nHaving a solid TH is huge, we just need a couple more. Expecting Hats and Fasogbon to get a go in SN.\n\nBaxter still looks good.\n\nI actually think LCD being close to his best is good for us.\n\n\nMarcus Smith is legit.\n\nSleighthome and IFW will be a genuine threat. \n\nJust need some tweaks in attack and a complete rethink on defense.\n\nNah, nope. Not doing it, I'm comfortable with my misery.\n\nInterestingly if you score the home nations based on standard league points - including try and losing bonus points, it works out currently (with Ireland still a game to play)3 \n\nScotland- 14 points\nIreland - 5 points \nEngland - 4 points \nWales - 0 points \n\n(Apologies if my quick maths is out, just did a quick scan of results) and keep in mind we took on the big three SH teams where others didn’t. Yeah a win would have been nice, but Ford’s DG goes over and Maro takes that kick off and we’d be looking at 10+ points and second in the ‘table’. Had we played Fiji or Portugal instead of NZ we also might be sitting top of the table. \n\nFine margins is a cliche in this sport, but we were very close to an excellent Autumn series. Ireland should really be more disappointed - let’s see what they can do against SA! \n\nI feel good about the 6Ns.\n\nPlease get lost with your positivity, we're a mess and have been for 5 years."

    "all_comment_text": "He is absolutely right, isn’t he.\n\nHaving never been through the private school system, but going through the club system as a mini, junior, then trojans player I do wonder what the main difference is between the coaching at private schools vs rugby clubs and why that’s specifically a rugby problem?\n\nThe FA have really strong coaching pathways for volunteers and club members - does that not exist in rugby?\n\nIts not the coaching its the connections. I went to a high end state school, not private but basically was (took donations etc) and played 1st xv rugby. Our coaches were on first name freinds basis with the entire local academy. Often the case at a lot of these schools. The academies dont scout local games they go to the private schools because thats the easiest way to guarantee some talent.\n\nYup, I was on the opposite end of the spectrum - personally would never have made it professionally but even trying to crack into the county set up was essentially impossible. All the private school teachers were coaches all the way up age grade rugby, we barely had enough funds to scrape together a bus for away games once every  so often and generally coaching standards were in the gutter with little to no time given to us. \n\nIts gutting because you see some of the kids in private school rugby playing with polished lines and in settled squads and you know you some of you are genuinely much better than them individually, but your team is cobbled together from whoever you've managed to convince it will be a fun day out and essentially end up resembling a bloated 7s squad with chaos and vibes.\n\nIve seen a massive numher of players flame out at 15-18 who would be single handedly be changing game plans of private school teams making it very deep into national competitions. They just completely drop off the radar. This is in a huge rugby town too that has academy's dotted around everywhere.\n\nConversely I was a middling gk and just happened to be pushing a future pl gk for a starting spot at school and had a number of weekend teams literally come knock on my door just from what they saw from school games. Theres a level for everyone and a welcoming atmosphere we just don't see in rugby.\n\nIt's definitely this, I went to a private school and several people in my schools were being headhunted by premiership academies from early ages. From there is\nIt's as much about what they do in the academy as anything else since they get them in so early\n\nnot just a Rugby problem.\n\nI'd argue that outside of football many sports have the same issue. Even then football has quite a few who went to private schools prior to joining an academy.\n\nFrom the view of a different sport. In rowing, the UK youth scene is dominanted by a handful of big private schools (St Pauls, Eton, Westminster, Headington, Teddies, Radley etc). Once you get to senior GB international level there's a much better mix of schools with a lot of athletes who didn't learn at their school (and instead at clubs or uni) making boats.\n\nThe big advantages (at least for rowing are):\n\n - the funding, it ties into many of the other things but many of these big schools basically don't have a budget restriction with either the school funding it because it's what the school does or significant support from alumni via auctions/standard donations\n \n - the coaching, obviously ties into the money. But St Pauls for example have numerous full time member of staff devoted to the rowing program and earlier this week put out adverts for some part time coaches. They also have people employed to do the admin and the maintenance which allows the coaches to further focus on just the coaching.\n\n - the access to the athletes. Especially at a boarding school, but even just a non-boarding private school, you can get so much more time with the athletes, easy to run a good S&amp;C session at lunchtime when a club can't because the 20 minute commute to and from the club makes it unviable.\n\n - the parents. Simply put, parents of children at private schools, will, in general be able to provide more funding and time into the child's development. You're more likely to have one of the parents not in a full time job (and so able to ferry the kid about to training) and they'll in general eat far better too\n\n - the numbers. it's far easier for a school to find 15 boys/girls of the right age to field a team than it is for a club to do it\n\nYou do still get clubs who can shake it with the best of them such as Hinksey and Henley and you do get small boats from Lea and the big provincial clubs (Tyne, Bristol, Agecroft, Derby, Nottingham, Cambridge) that produce high quality athletes. But even then with St Pauls coming 11th nationally recently (racing against adult's boats) the standard the schools can achieve is just ridiculous\n\nWtf is trojans?\n\nThe country can’t afford to rely on private school talent either tbh. See what they’ve done with the place over the past 14 years!\n\n***The Telegraph reports:***\n\nEllis Genge, the England vice-captain, believes that rugby union’s class divide is hampering the sport’s development, as well as its ability to unearth talent.\n\nGenge, who started England’s Six Nations matches against Scotland, Ireland and France at loosehead, has long banged the drum for greater representation and diversity in English rugby union, bemoaning the lack of talent identification in under-privileged areas.\n\nAnd the 29-year-old, who himself grew up in Bristol’s Knowle West council estate, fears the sport is being held back by disparities in wealth.\n\n“Rugby union has definitely got a class problem,” Genge told William Hill’s podcast, Up Front with Simon Jordan. “I’ve seen it first hand over the years from when I started going to trials. At a younger age, which kids miss out on becoming a professional rugby player is massively dependent on the class divide in the sport – and I’m strictly talking \\[about\\] a financial divide here.\"\n\n**Read the rest of the article here:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/04/11/ellis-genge-english-rugby-cannot-afford-rely-private-school/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/04/11/ellis-genge-english-rugby-cannot-afford-rely-private-school/)\n\nI think what some are missing is a lot of the top talent aren't from privileged backgrounds but got scholarships to private schools. \n\nLooks at the Vunapolas or Courtney Lawes as prime examples.

    "title": "If Borthwick leaves after Japan then so should Bill Sweeney (RFU CEO)",
    "body": "IMO if Borthwick is to resign after the Japan game then Bill Sweeney should follow him out the door. Since 2019 English rugby has only gone backwards. A reminder this man is paid £684k a year. A short list of Bill Sweeney's achievements:\n\n1. Sacking Eddie Jones - interestingly not long after he made controversial comments about private schools. This could've been a positive but personally I think RWC 2023 was made to look alot better bc of the performance vs South Africa (poor performance vs Fiji and very lucky to beat Samoa) and I would've personally kept Eddie given his World Cup record\n\n2. 3 Prem clubs + 1 Champs club going bust \n\n3. A constant revolving door of assistant coaches - I accept Borthwick must shoulder responsibility for this as well but this was also a huge factor under Eddie Jones \n\n4. In 2019, England were World No.1 in the rankings they are now 7th \n\n5. Sold the naming rights of Twickenham stadium \n\n6. Lower avg attendance for Prem games (2018-19 season - 14,507 compared with 2022-23 season - 13,250) \n\n7. Non-existent promotion / relegation system for Tier 2 clubs\n\n8. No Prem club has made the European Cup final since 2020 (compared with 4 / 5 in the preceeding 5 years before Sweeney's arrival) \n\n9. More and more established stars leaving England for France (and I don't blame them tbh rugby is a short career) \n\n10. Declining participation in schools (particularly state schools) \n\n11. Virtually no effort to make rugby more popular in state schools (this has clearly worked wonders in South Africa with the likes of Mapimpi and Hendriske - even Kolisi grew up in a township)\n\nEngland obviously have reasons to be optimistic but and they're still firmly a Tier 1 nation but with all the resources the RFU has, rugby in this country should be growing not declining. Ultimately what I'm trying to say is what part of Bill Sweeney's work in the last 5 years justifies him to keep his £684k salary will the game declines?",

If you exclude Saracens from teams making the Champions Cup final, the last English team that made it were Saints in 2011. Chiefs are the outlier in a tournament dominated by French and Irish teams.\n\nSweeney is a walking disaster but would you resign from a £684k / year job?\n\nI appreciate its wishful thinking but I get the feeling not enough England fans rly know who Sweeney is and how is involvement in the RFU has coincided with the decline in English rugby\n\nI think the more ppl talk abt Sweeney's incompetence the more attention media scrutiny that he will be under and the more public pressure that would build for him to resign\n\nI don't get why point 3 is repeatedly cited as a bad thing. Eddie liked having short term consultants, a lot of whom were never meant to be permanent. \n\nAlso when he got the job he was given the remit if developing a young English coach to succeed him. Which was successful in Borthwick. But Gustard also got a promotion to be HC at a club. Vesty has been promoted to head coach at Saints. Mitchell is women's head coach. And Cockerill is Georgia head coach.\n\nAlso 5 is definitely not a bad thing. It's free money.\n\n6 is unrelated to the RFU tbh. The PRL is a separate entity and they run the prem.\n\n7, 8 and 9 you can also see 6 for.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I dislike Sweeney as much as the next guy. But a load of this stands up to 0 scrutiny.\n\nThere's some fair points here so I'll give some counter-points:\n\n3. All the best international sides, Ireland, France and particularly South Africa have settled coaching setups that don't change very often when they do the assistant coaches have been in post for years and have usually enjoyed success e.g Felix Jones\n\n5. One of the only logical arguments in favour of keeping Sweeney that I can see is that the RFU has increased its revenues even from pre-COVID lvls. If the RFU is the richest union in the world and the revenues are increasing then what's the argument for selling the naming rights to Twickenham? It has been met with almost universal critiscism (from both England and non-England fans) \n\n6, 7, 8. The RFU is the administrator for the PRL and the PRL acts at the behest of the RFU. If the RFU wants to change an aspect of the PRL, e.g promotion / relegation, they have the power to do so and choose not to\n\n9. This 100% relates to the RFU. By not helping to foster a more economically viable league, whether that be helping to grow the game organically at the grassroots lvl which would increase viewership or by not enforcing strict regulations to prevent club mismanagement and therefore administration you would not be incentivising players to go abroad even if it means ending their England careers\n\nA change in CEO may not immediately result in an uptick of fortunes but I can't find anyone who can justify that the RFU has been on some sort of upward trajectory since Sweeney's arrival\n\nI don't think they do. I think you just pay much less attention because they're not teams you support.\n\n\nMore money to invest in grassroots etc. everyone saying the English game is in financial ruin but also want the RFU to turn down free money. I've not seen a single valid criticism of the renaming.\n\nThe PRL is a board of club representatives. And then CVC bought a stake so they have a say too.nThey are a separate organisation from the RFU. Eg the RFU negotiates with the PRL for player release. They don't decide how much to pay themselves to get England players. The RFU cannot force the PRL to do anything. The RFU doesn't decide who can go up. The PRL, the clubs in the prem, set the minimum standard champ clubs have to meet.\n\nSame as before. Honestly one google will tell you what and who the PRL is.\n\nI reiterate. I don't care for Sweeney and id like him gone too. But half of this doesn't relate to him and the RFU.\n\nIf you have the stats to back it up then I'm willing to admit I'm wrong but from anecdotal evidence that's not what I remember. Take Ireland for example, that coaching setup has been settled for 4 years+ (Farrell, Easterby and POC just from memory have all been around since 2019 and before) the only departure I can remember was Mike Catt who himself had been around since 2019\n\nThe English club game is financial ruin. This is undeniable. The problem is the RFU is very wealthy and has not invested that in the grassroots effectively as evidenced by the declining participation numbers\n\nThe RFU cut championship funding to its lowest level in 2024 (£133k per club compared with £645k per club in 2019 - I accept COVID played a significant factor in this but when u consider Sweeney himself is on £645k a year its a joke). Even if what you're saying means the RFU have 0 control over changes made to the Premiership, it is clear the RFU aren't interested in developing the 2nd tier\n\nI appreciate your disdain for Sweeney is as strong as mine but I do think his choices as CEO are related to all of the above factors\n\nEdit: It looks like POC only came in 2021 but I'd argue this is offset by Easterby being involved since 2014 and Farrell since 2016\n\nSweeney has to go and all the old farts at RFU"

    "body": "Are we finally agreed that Marcus is the right man for the 10 shirt? It feels like this has been debated ever since Owen stepped down - and we’re being held back by not capitalising on a young, talented and exciting fly half that is a fast and hard to read player. We need to settle on a style built around Marcus as the playmaker. \n\nIf we had the right 9 (Alex Mitchell?) feeding him quickly and consistently and then a 12 who knows how to read whether it’s going to be a chip through, a dummy and go, a cross field kick etc… it feels like Slade is not the man to read this. \n\nWatching Marcus and Sleightholme yesterday, it felt like he thinks and plays on the same level - a 12 that could do the same would be a game changer for England. It would be interesting to see Oscar Beard getting some time playing outside Marcus and build his experience. \n\nThe thought of better linking CCS, Marcus and a third Quin in the centre of the pitch and the heart of the playmaking is exciting for me.

    "all_comment_text": "I am biased.\n\nYou always need to bleed in the number 10 Jersey. There is so much weight on it.\n\nMarcus is absolutely the best 10 in England hands down.\n\nHe also has real can do attitude. He's really good at motivating the guys and boy do England need it.\n\nIt’s either Smith or Ford but not both. Whoever it is needs to be an 80 minute man. Borthwock clearly wants it to be Smith but doesn’t trust him.\n\nI thought Marcus Smith was basically the only England player making things happen yesterday. He was involved in everything including in defence. The problem is that he doesn't have a 9 and 12 beside him on the same page. We've been missing Mitchell massively in these past couple of games, Lawrence isn't a 12 and Slade isn't a good fit alongside either Marcus or Lawrence. \n\nI think we need to stop having Ford on the bench and just let Marcus play. Find the right 9 and 12 to play alongside him and we'd have won both of these last games.\n\nI largely agree but I think the negative you get with Marcus is it's all about him, he struggles to bring the rest of the backs into it. Contrast that with a Ford for example who's the exact opposite - there's a reason we've seen very little of the outside backs in the games Marcus has started (very like DMac for NZ). He can win games on his own though...\n\nThis\n\nDingwall fits that role at 12 for Saints, shame he got injured cos I think he may have started if fit\n\nDingwall isn’t it.\n\nHe’s 25 and has 2 caps, think the jury’s still out on that one\n\nJesus is he only 25!? He’s been around for ages. Yes, should be in contention.\n\nYes, of course it is.\n\nThis 'he should play 15'/ 'it should be Fin Smith' is just the standard thing English fans do about whoever is playing ten.\n\nWhen it was Johnny, we talked about Charlie hodgeson and even toby flood (lol)  \nWhen it was ford it should be Faz and visa versa.\n\nHe can, and has, run games very well. He is not just the all-out-attack quins ten. The majour tactical fuckup today was from Ford (why call that move where Kelleway scored?). Also, it's been Ford and Fin that havn't been able to manage the last few matches, not Smith, yet no-one has a go at them for game management?\n\nHis cover defence is excellent and his speed off the line causes others issues.\n\nHe can create tries from nothing and has a great conestable kicking game. He also gets an unusual amount of 50-22s (more than other FHs in england i believe).\n\nHe has been the best FH on the pitch in all the games against NZ and Aus (apart from Barret's cameo in the first test). \n\nHis main weekness is a little bit of lengh on his kicks to touch,\n\nHe's the best ten in england right now\n\nDon't know if this is just me but I'm still not convinced. When we are on the back foot he never has the nous to play smart. He runs into defences when he really shouldn't and stay back. He goes down when a Ford or Farrell or F Smith would take a step back. That run where he ran into the 2 massive aussies led to a killing of the play. So no. I'd prefer him at 15 so that means he should be bench to be 10 and 15 cover whole Furbank I'd in the form he is in.\n\nYeah, so if he had a 12 who could keep up and read him, we’d be seeing fast flowing running rugby with line breaks and tries. Not this box kicking tennis where we wait for the opposition to make mistakes.\n\nThink we haven't had a 12 in like 5 years. Farrell or tualagi were the options. Smith at quins relys on Care or did rely on that beast of a Saffa at 12. We need smith to come on or I will forever be convinced we need a more pragmatic 10. Ford or whoever.\n\nBut we do not have that 12\n\nWhere else would points come from? We're ***** at set pieces, so we won't be picking up penalties.\n\nWho else is going to create anything?\n\nLawrence, Slade, Furbank, Freeman, Spencer, Randall, Steward etc.... not good enough.\n\nWhen does smith get on the ball at 15? On the game line? No! He's our best attacking threat.\n\nIs he perfect? No? But he is literally the last problem we need to fix.\n\nYes his kicking off the tea is shite but he's better than the  ham sandwich, ready salted crisps and bottle of water backs we have elsewhere.\n\nRFU at fault, jobs for the boys!\n\nThe thing is we aren't. We had one of the set pieces of the 6 nations and line outs. George was firing at 90% last time. We have such a good set piece We need to believe in it more. Our attack does look woeful agreed but I think the center pairing just doesn't work. But there still needs to be a 10 who doesn't run and get held up at crucial points of the game. The wingers who are being forced to be this ultimate defence means they can't focus on attack. Ford in the Ireland and France game did create some brilliance so it is possible and that's not saying Marcus can't do the same. He definitely can. But he too often does something silly and it ruins any momentum. His kicking off the tee has been amazing recently so I wouldn't even say that. But he isn't the answer to the 10 problem when he can't front up against the big teams.\n\nCompletely disagree, he created the first 4 tries, with 2 kicks and 2 by ghosting through their defensive line. We'd have lost by a much bigger margin if it wasn't for him.\n\nYes he makes mistakes and does stupid things but at least he creates stuff. I just don't get how out of all things, smith is the issue. Smith is the last issue, you could hear the fans booing when they thought he was being taken off.\n\nOf course he could do some of those things from full back but I don't see why you wouldn't want your best attacking outlet to not have the ball as much as possible. Yes he makes mistakes and gives away penalties but so do people like Slade and Lawrence, who are absolutely dog**** and don't create anything.\n\nPeople who are cosplaying as rugby players like Lawrence need to go, don't wanna see that geezer ever again in an england shirt.\n\nSet pieces are alright, scrums aside. The fact that Dan Cole is still knocking about is incredible. You may as well add 9 points onto their scoreboard for penalties he gives away.\n\nCan't stand Borthwick, he is the same old, straight out of the coaching manual.\n\nDon't know why you are getting down votes. \n\nHe made two bad decisions yesterday and one kick that was 5m short.\n\nIn every other aspect he was excellent. \n\nKicking game resulted in tries and field position.\n\nPassing game brought others in\n\nRunning game caused havoc.\n\nMultiple try saving interventions.\n\nEnglish fans.... 'maybe Fin Smith would be better'.\n\nFFS\n\nNepo babies who hate anything that's not by the book basically.\n\nOr people who basically have no idea about sport, I absolutely know I'm correct. Call it arrogance all you want but some bloke who's set up 4/5 tries is probs not to blame.\n\nHe's by far our best player (well that's allowed to play anyways)\n\nPeople who carry on with the whole Smith makes mistakes and is the problem,  are ironically the problem, seen at coaching at rugby and football. Text book readers.\n\ncan you explain how nepotism is at all relevant to people having doubts about Marcus Smith😂my feeling is he is excellent against weaker defences, but less effective against well structured sides. I’d rather have a traditional 10 for a Boks game, for example. I think Fin Smith might be the guy for those games in the future, but not there yet\n\nHe’s an excellent player but I’m not sure he’s an excellent fly half yet. He kind of reminds me a bit of Beauden Barrett in that regard. He’ll individually have a great game but very often fails to bring the best out of the people around him in the way Ford did with largely the same backline. Furbank was one of our best attacking weapons with Ford on the field but has been anonymous the last few matches, likewise the centres. Our phase play is also terrible, complete lack of shape but I don’t know if that’s a Smith issue or a coaching issue. \n\nIt may well mean we need some other personnel in those positions but I’m buggered if I know who. Maybe Northmore who knows him a bit better and Randall at 9 to give him quick service.\n\nReminds me more of DMac. Great individual player, but is he the best FH? He's always struggled to retain the starting shirt for a reason\n\nAs a Quins supporter I may be biased although when Faz was here I did favour him while Smith was a bit green so maybe not. I think Marcus is definitely the best 10 we have. He is very much on form and makes things happen in attack.\n\nThe recent losses were certainly not down to Smith, he has played exceptionally well. \n\nHe followed by Fin are the best options. Ford is not on form.\n\nI think what's impressed me most about Marcus Smith this last year for England is his work rate and dedication. Was always extremely talented individual, but he has really put his body on the line recently. You can see how much it means to him. Proper lead from the front player.\n\nCouldn’t agree more, he’s becoming a decent jackaler and isn’t afraid of a breakdown!\n\nMy feeling is that Fin Smith is the one. I think he will be the game managing, test style 10, with the excellent kicking game that we need. \n\nNot that I don't love Marcus and I particularly love it when he goes to 15. Despite clearly being immensely talented, and exciting to watch with his attacking qualities, I just don't ever feel convinced that he is in the same group of test level 10s like Faz and Ford (and Fin Smith will be in the future).\n\nI’m not a rugby expert so help me understand if the 10 role needs to be good in defence? \nSmith is clearly the most inspirational in attack but this England team seem to be way to open and I am wondering  if that is a part of the problem?\n\nIt’s got to be Smith. If we can get someone in at 9 to connect with him properly I’d be happier though.\n\nIf Mitchell was fit then it would be him"

The older I get the more I believe our understanding of achievement is because how we manage the game is flawed and out of date. Doesn’t matter who the players or coaches are if they’re in an archaic system.\n\nApparently -and I stand to be corrected on this- one of the performance metrics is that they simply calculate the pooled win percentage of the men’s and women’s teams to calculate his “on the field” performance. You could therefore argue that a key factor in his salary is not actually the strength of either of these teams, it is the relative lack of depth in the women’s game enabling him to weight wins the same as he would in the men’ game where test wins are far rarer for England.\n\nI'm afraid its worse than that - not only are men's and women's results pooled but certain men's results have seemingly been discounted on a whim to make the performance bonuses more likely\n\ne.g (and no one including the RFU seems to have produced a reason why this has happened) England's summer tour loses to NZ weren't counted as part of the win % for the year which obvs inflated the winning % to be higher than they actually were\n\nTakes £1m. During his tenure the England team have under achieved, 3 top tier teams have gone bust, attendances at England games has fallen (the price of tickets obscene and little access to the general public), participation rates at grass roots have fallen and he has sacked rfu staff.\n\nYes, mate it’s just clickbait."

I think that because he had a quiet few games during the autumn internationals the hype is dying down or shifting to the guys a year or two below, but I still think he is one of our brightest prospects.\n\nHe can certainly bang.

And I'm not hopeful. But let's take a beat.\n\n\nThe pros\n- He has had a tough schedule \n- we were very close\n- all the games are close\n- England are scoring more tries than before\n- he's picked some quality attacking players\n- he got a shit team to the WC semi\n- beat Ireland \n\nThe cons\n- the reason we've lost some of those games is directly related to his sub policies. Smith stays at ten, we win today.\n\n- it's great that he's loyal to players, but why are we still playing Dombrant, Cole, Isekwe, Ewels? Why doesn't Obano get a look in? Davidson? Willis?Pearson? Hill?\n\n\nHe cant change his selections before next week. Hopefully he can make better calls on the bench.\n\nIn the SN he can review his selections.\n\nSo I'll give him the SN.\n\nBut it's 4 wins or bye\n\nPersonally don't get what Underhill has done wrong. We could've used him today against their big ball carriers.\n\nThere was a suggestion that Underhill isn't there because they are still managing his return to play after his ankle surgery and he isn't ready for test level yet.\n\nI hope that's true, because it's the only possible justification.\n\nI hope so also, he would've been useful against the big ball carriers yesterday.\n\nHe's a starter or nothing plyer for me to be fair.\n\nI would have started him though\n\nLargely agree but when the alternative is Dombrandt I would also take him on the bench\n\nTo be honest we had a favourable run in the World Cup. \n\nWINS (4 home wins, 3 away wins, 6 neutral WC wins)\n\nItaly (h)\n\nWales (a)\n\nWales (h)\n\nArgentina (n)\n\nJapan (n)\n\nChile (n)\n\nSamoa (n)\n\nFiji (n)\n\nArgentina (n)\n\nItaly (a)\n\nWales (h)\n\nIreland (h)\n\nJapan (a)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLOSSES (5 home losses, 7 away losses, 1 neutral WC losses)\n\nScotland (h)\n\nFrance (h)\n\nIreland (a)\n\nWales (a)\n\nIreland (a)\n\nFiji (h)\n\nSouth Africa (n)\n\nScotland (a)\n\nFrance (a)\n\nNew Zealand (a)\n\nNew Zealand (a)\n\nNew Zealand (h)\n\nAustralia (h)\n\nSo basically anyone half decent we lose?\n\nHis record compared to other coaches records is atrocious... yet there's not a peep from the RFU.\n\nrfu cant afford to pay him off\n\nThat and the RFU have never ever had a clue.\n\nIf they had a clue, we'd have a setup like Rassie. We're half arsing our national team and that's kind of the end of it it seems.\n\nThat's because it's run by someone who's made a career out of.....?\n\nSecond Japan win was away\n\nThanks for the correction. I edited my post.\n\n*I’m genuinely exciiiiiiited about this grooooup and think we’ll improooove weeeek on weeeek*\n\nI think England are so very nearly there.\n\nYes the losses hurt but we lost to France and NZ twice by less than 2 points. If the ball bounces the other way, they are three _huge_ wins. We had the game all but won yesterday at the 78th minute. \n\nThis England team is still young, and full of guys who have not gone through the wringer at international level. They will learn from this, and if we do have to lose, I’d much rather be losing very close games than being a million miles off the pace like we often were under Eddie.\n\nCole slade george need to go\n\nI wanted to get behind him (English coach blah blah blah…) but he was never the right appointment. Compare him to any of the other top teams’ head coaches and he’s clearly lacking (tactically as well as personality-wise).\n\nI am pretty much in the same position as you. I had a bit of faith that we had some solid results to build on, add the recruitment of Felix Jones and the conditioning coach (who's name escapes me), i ultimately thought that we would be further ahead in our development.  But with those guys leaving, our clubs being in dire circumstances, and the RFU not having centralized control... yeah things look grim.\n\n\n Plus i did have a funny feeling that we would lose to the cons - and so we did! The saffas are going to eat us for breakfast!\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the alternatives if Bothers gets the sack?!\n\nPry Sam Vesty out of his Saints contract for me\n\nAs a Saints fan, don’t you dare!\n\nThought he was the wrong choice and have seen little over his tenure to change my mind.\n\nIt seemed like today we lost our identity. \n\nRecently it has felt like we are building towards something on the back of a really aggressive defence. Today that defence crumbled and I’m not sure what we were trying to do. Australia and Marcus thrived on the chaos, the rest of our team are not built for that. If we want Marcus to play that way then give him the backline to thrive- Slade and probably Furbank (not his fault) are casualties. The backline is currently built for Ford, look at how well he brought them into the game v Ireland and France, Smith isn’t that sort of fly half. Surround him like they do at Quins with strike runners- phase play isn’t his thing.\n\nNot an original thought but we need more impact off the bench. Chessum’s injury had been unfortunate, I don’t think Isiekwe is as bad as everyone makes out (lineout looked better on both sides of the ball when he came on) but Chessum is class. Same applies to Dombrandt, I’m sorry but we have bags of backrow talent in this country and he hasn’t performed.\n\nLastly 9, we need someone to back up Mitchell who isn’t perma injured Quirke. Spencer used to be a live wire when he came on for Sarries but his service is glacial now. Invest in Randall properly or Porter who is used to Smith at 10.\n\nI hate to say it too Paul but I think Jamie’s time might be up, he’s been a brilliant servant and his set piece is still phenomenal but I think we need more in open play from our hooker.\n\nWe look like a team who has lost Felix Jones. I mean, that feels really significant based off the recent performances.\n\nInteresting comments about the backs. I am a fan of our back three but remain unconvinced by 9, 10, 12, 13. Your comments are interesting as I didn't really think about the backs being based around the 10. \n\nI always thought that I'd rather have Marcus come off bench as an impact player and, in particular, I love it when he plays 15. I would prefer a game managing 10 like Fin Smith or an actually fit George Ford. \n\nAs you say, we have got backrow riches galore and I cannot understand how we are picking Dombrant, amongst others.\n\nI agree totally on the bench. For me, it is disappointing and I just don't see massive impact coming from the bench. I think it shows as we seem unable to see out close games. We have had so many poor last 20 mins lately.\n\nI don't feel great about 9 or 10 tbh, which is a worry really. I just don't know what the best combo is and neither does Borthwick, by the looks of it.\n\nI'm going to ignore the comment about Jamie. I think maybe you have been drinking or something.\n\nIt has to be said that this is a massive wake up call. We really are nowhere near where I thought we were based on this performance.\n\nI like all of our back three too but Furbank is wasted with a fly half like M Smith who is run first, attack the gap before passing. Every other English fly half will be closer to the line and look to play a forward or centre through or pass out the back to the 15 where Furbank can do his stuff. Maybe Freeman at 15 would be a better option for Smith considering how good he is in the air.\n\nYeah I was thinking about this yesterday too, Furbank hasn’t had the same impact in the last 2 weeks but I don’t think 10, 12 or 13 have been looking for him. I really don’t like Slade and Lawrence as a combination as they just seem unable to bring the best out of anyone outside them.\n\nJamie has had his time, he looks slow and has almost no physicality, we always hang onto players to long, slade also looks terrible\n\nSmall margins, young team. It’s not popular. If he’s given a chance he brings through the next 2003 team or as close as possible. But relax. He won’t be given the trust or patience.\n\nThe Aussie team was younger\n\nSorry to disagree. We should have won today and last week. Simples and\n\nSeems we always play to the standard of the opposition. It's not good enough. If not Borthwick, then who?\n\nDowson? Or maybe a foreign coach?\n\nSeems like England go backwards everytime they have to break for club competitions. I don't know if these systems are just too difficult for the players to jump back into without a 2 month prep period... Maybe Borthwick isn't the answer, but England have looked very good at points, maybe there is a chance. Frankly if England don't perform in the six nations then the results will do for Borthwick and he will probably be sent on his way, results at the end of the day are all that matters and he has had enough time now.\n\nThe next 6 months seem almost inevitable now.\n\nWe'll lose against SA next week, have a mediocre 6N and he'll be sacked.\n\nNah, it's the next 2 and a half years that are inevitable, lose against SA next week, poor 6N, RFU internal investigation, RFU board will back him, continue on for a year or 18 months at about the same level then sack him 12 to 6 months out from the World Cup in '27...\n\nAre the RFU really that clueless?\n\n[It is April 2021, after a difficult 6 Nations the RFU review backs Eddie Jones, there are 2 and a half years to the World Cup in France](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/rugby-english-rfu-backs-eddie-jones-after-fifth-place-again-in-six-nations/DKNHAN2AC323NXSYCWSOLVMB4A/)\n\n[It is March 2022, after a difficult 6 Nations the RFU fully supports Eddie Jones, there are 18 months to the World Cup in France](https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/60810339)\n\n[It is December 2022, after a difficult Autumn series where England are booed by the less than sell out crowds at Twickenham the RFU fire Eddie Jones, they ~~do not have much~~ have a concept of a of a plan to replace him, there are 9 months to the World Cup in France](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/63801857)\n\n[It is still December 2022, having sacked Eddie Jones the intellectual powerhouses at the RFU decide that the original plan can be brought forward and buy Steve Borthwick out of his contract with Leicester, once again fucking over the East Midlands club the RFU so hate.](https://www.skysports.com/rugby-union/news/30964/12770597/steve-borthwick-to-be-named-england-head-coach-as-rfu-reaches-agreement-with-leicester)\n\nEdited because I thought of a funny way to put the boot further into the RFU...\n\nGood lord! So they are just like the England Football Association then. Why in the world is there an epidemic of incompetent leadership, in positions of power, in this country?!\n\nI mean, I blame the incompetents in the media, it's 1000 times easier to look good when talking after the fact because you already know what did or didn't work and you just pretend that's what you would have done all along. This goes beyond sport even.\n\nI think you made a good assessment!! \n\nBut I think they will play their best game next weekend. For the previous games they seemed to have thought that can win without playing for 80 min. They will think Boks will be more difficult and produce their best game for 80 min. Borthwick will be a hero again!! All will be forgotten!\n\nIt's so infuriating at the moment watching England play because I genuinely don't know how good we are. At times the play is utterly embarrassing but then on other weekends the team will play incredibly. Even coming down to within games we seem to play really well for about 20-30 minutes before it all goes to shit again. I don't get it in the slightest how can we be so good &amp; so bad all at once?\n\nIt’s impossible to attribute English rugbys problem to one or two issues.  My opinion is that it’s a myriad of issues that some will disagree with. I think Borthwick may be guilty of trying to go too far to be the anti Eddie. I know is George’s clip yesterday was in relation to the conversion but I do think the fact he was joking at all from the bench in a game that was clearly not over does point to a particular attitude. I also don’t think England have that many world class players and even fewer who are in form. Front row is fine but aging. Itoje doesn’t seem to be making the impacts he usually does. I’m still unconvinced by Earl and Lawrence at international level. Back 3 are raw but nowhere near the best players in their positions. Similarly at 9. On top of that you’ve got all the usual issues with club vs country but I do think that lot boils down to the fact that the players are not as good as people seem to think they are. England is stacked with excellent club level players but very few who have that extra few % that separates the top end internationals from the rest. Centres just don’t work and after a decade of not having the balls to stick with either Ford or Farrell they are now repeating it with Ford and Smith.\n\nI just don’t understand why our attack looks so poor when it’s defence coaches we lost. We looked like we started to get some shape going at the end of the 6 nations and we’ve not really seen it since then.\n\nI remember from listening to Jim Hamilton's podcast that England were mainly focusing on the defensive side of the game in training sessions - leaving very little time to build anything even resembling a coordinated attack. Kick-Chase and all that...\n\nHis bench make up is poor, yesterday we had no jackal threat outside Itoje and on the bench no one to come on and slow the ball down. \n\nWe don’t need to change the 10, no other team with a settled 10 running the show does it. \n\nControversial opinion but I’d prefer to have Cunningham-South on the bench because he’d be such a difference maker in the last 30 minutes and I’d love to see Ted Hill start. That’s not me saying Cunningham-South isn’t good enough to start just that we don’t have anyone coming off the bench offer anything in the forwards at the minute.\n\nLaptop coach, very dull.\n\nDon’t worry guys, it’s all part of Borthwicks concussion addled plan.\n\nWe will play so shite that no one takes us seriously between now and the next World Cup then suddenly we will become great and take them all by surprise…\n\nOr we have till the 2027 World Cup when his contract ends and we can try someone else. \n\nIt’s going to be a painful match against South Africa as they are in form and not struggling with new setups like Australia or New Zealand.\n\nWe might beat Japan depending on how many injuries we get vs sa.\n\nThen it’s time to be brutalised by Ireland, France and Scotland in the six nations. \n\nIt’s not going to be a fun 3 years for English fans.\n\nAnyone else hole we get walloped by the boks so we can get rid of Borthwick and his ridiculous selection policy?\n\nI doubt that Borthwick gets sacked this year. We would have to continue our poor results into next year's Six Nations inorder to force the RFU's hands!"

It felt like Smith being substituted was a premeditated move; I would have kept him on rather than ‘close out the game’.\n\nDo feel Ford got a bit shafted with the drop goal attempt - Randall needs to be better for that to work\n\nRandall kind of lost his head.\n\nHard not to think Randall was told get it to ford whatever. Shit pass no doubt though\n\nDisagree. Ford got them set up in the right position and Randall absolutely fluffed the pass. A test 9 absolutely has to do better than that. Reckon JvP would’ve nailed it. Poor choice to finish Randall altogether imo\n\nYeah the pass to him was awful. I don’t think Marcus would have done any better - especially with his two earlier misses.\n\nThe kick to win the game was the one for me. if ford plays he has one job\n\nCracking assesment. Agree mostly everywhere. The moment we have a bench scrum that wins pens and a coach that backs form dynamic players to finish the game is the moment we win these games. Test rugby is so tight and it's these moments that make or break it\n\nIs this the end of the road for George Ford? Marcus Smith should've played to full match. Cunningham -South is an absolute beast!\n\n\nI'm still going to keep a little bit of faith in Borthwick.\n\nUnfortunately Borthwick has pre planned subs, and it’s a crying shame. \n\nFords time with England is over frankly and I say that as basically a culty fan but … it is. \n\nSome of his subs and selections give me huge Southgate vibes from Borthers. \n\nIf he loses to SA, I think we need to consider his position.\n\nI think we’re at a point where we should be winning those games but to consider his position if we lose to SA is insane imo. Still a very young and inexperienced head coach but shown plenty to suggest he’ll absolutely get there. Needs time and patience though\n\nWould he have subbed Farrell? If not then shows he doesn’t have faith in Smith fully\n\nWell it shows he has less faith in Smith than he does Farrell to close a game out. But that's not saying much.\n\nHe needs to trust Smith more though.\n\nI feel like we’re so used to Curry dropping 9/10s that even an 8 looks like he hasn’t done much. He was fantastic again\n\nI always find hes someone I have to rewatch to appreciate.\n\nIt's not that he does any one thing spectacularly. But he is, when he's on form, everywhere.\n\nApart from one Excellent but of defense I don't remember him doing much\n\nI had that exact thought whilst watching yesterday after that cover tackle but then it just occurred to me that we basically take for granted quite how good he is every game so it’s not as noticeable. I have a feeling we’d see that on a replay. Defo less prominent on the carry than usual but so good everywhere else\n\nBasically agree with you. I would like to see Borthwick take a bit more responsibility for the result. In the post match he just sat there smiling, deflecting questions and said, “We’re improving.”\n\nBut we’re not. Our attack seems to have regressed and acknowledging that the selection and subs were also a factor in the result would have helped to keep up the goodwill he has built from the 6N and the summer. As it stands, I think he’s probably blown it as far as this cycle of games is concerned...unless we have an absolutely epic performance against SA."

If that isn't going to happen then a simple, one sentence explanation of why he has been passed over would stop people like me from posting threads like this.\n\nAnd I'm sure stopping that is Priority #1 🤣\n\nIt is someone's job to manage the reputation of this outfit beyond what happens on the pitch, and that includes the overall narrative presented to the fans and the media.\n\nNot sure if you have noticed but the subs here are full of threads calling for Borthwick's head.

    "all_comment_text": "This doesn’t show the full story because whilst it looks like we have a problem at fly half we maybe have some of the best depth at fly half in world rugby\n\nDoesn't it also reflect that clubs view 10 as a very influential position and will go out looking for the best talent they can afford, including overseas?\n\nWe have 3 (4 if you include the prospect of a Farrell return) great options but after that it feels like a big drop-off to me? So great choices most of the time but would struggle in a major injury crisis (though you might ask who wouldn't?)\n\nI suppose Charlie Atkinson would be the next on the list. \n\nHis general play is pretty good, attacks the line really nicely and seems to be a decent athlete. Unfortunately, his goal kicking is absolutely terrible so it would almost certainly mean selecting another back to do that for him. Furbank can kick goals and Marcus Smith *can* play fullback but I'm not sure it makes the best use of him.\n\nJosh Hodge is a very good goal kicker I suppose but as a nuts and bolts fullback, I don't think he's as good as Furbank or Carpenter.\n\nSorry if I’m being thick but how is a mean calculated here? Surely there’s just the number of qualified players for each shirt number and that should be a whole number.\n\nPresumably it's the average number of EQP players taken across the 7 rounds so far\n\nIt feels like we have a glut of great wingers right now and this seems to back it up! Interesting at tighthead too, is it more that the options we have aren't good enough than lack of options?\n\nWith tightheads I think it's that there's a bit of a missing generation that this chart doesn't really show. \n\nWe have Davison and Cole who are both into their 30s (one, waaay into his 30s) and some very promising young players like AOF and Fasogbon who I think we're all confident will be test level players. What we don't have so much of are guys aged 24-28. Stuart and Heyes I suppose but there are question marks over each (even if Stuart actually had a very strong autumn).\n\nBut yeah we're stacked at winger. You could probably make a decent case for 5 or 6.\n\nYeah that's why I don't really buy the Dom Young from league stuff. Makes no sense to splash big on a position of strength. I don't see why we would dip into league unless it was for a 12.\n\nI'd love to see this data over the course of the last 10 years or so to see how the problem positions have changed. It feels like yesterday all we had were 6.5s and bemoaning a lack of 7s.\n\nDoes it mention in the article if the wings have been pooled or just happen to have the same number of starts by chance?\n\nThank for posting this btw. The hooker numbers seem ridiculously high. 5 non qualified starts out of 70 and only 4 out of 70 off the bench. Edit: Montoya with only 3 starts (and no benches) is helping this - rugby champs and autumn internationals having a larger affect in this first part of the year.\n\nThink this says more about where clubs will pay for overseas talent than English players. In salary cap world, people aren’t investing in back 3 or hookers, but are investing in half backs. Makes sense mostly"

SH coaches are just built different!\n\nNot necessarily. Just ask Eddie Jones ( from 2019)\n\nWould much rather see a 6-2 split with Spencer &amp; Furbank as the backs\n\nFinally freddie stewart , him on now the opened up channels for high balls will be insane ,but I believe he is two games late to the party sadly for this autumn series , come on freddie!\n\nWrong choice should of stayed with furbank\n\nI can understand the selection for either Furbank or Steward, I would lean towards Steward purely because of the new law changes. Contests in the air will become more of a thing, this is Stewards speciality. And counter attacks will fade out a bit because of the no blockers law therefore making Furbank less valuable as he specialises on counter attacks.\n\nGood point, but defensively Steward has been found out and the South African wonder wingers  know how to get round him: \"slow on the turn\".\n\nYeah a great point tbh, but I think the pros outweigh the cons however this is just my opinion and Furbank may be the way to go for this one.\n\nI've not seen much of Steward this year and he may have worked on his speed and turn to improve things. Let's see how he does but fear it's adding one strength and an equal weakness.\n\nI have been watching him at leicester his hunger under high balls has not faded I thought earlier in the season he must be close for selection borthwick missed a trick hes been fit and healthy\n\nThe England team does seem to be doing a lot of the “one step forward, two step backwards” thing. I just hope something clicks soon and we start to win some big test matches.\n\nYeah I agree too late to the party now\n\nYeah... we're in for an absolute beating! Bring in your first aid kits and bandages boys... it's going to be a bloody night!\n\nA lot of negativity here but what changes would you make, aside from Furbank for Steward? If you think that change will stop the saffa juggernaut then ice got a bridge to sell you.\n\nWe are going to get destroyed. Sad times.\n\nLargely irrelevant who Borethick picks, until they can coach the defence they will not be able to beat the top teams."

    "body": "Or to be more specific; are England not putting the right players into 12? \nFor a while now, the best 12s in the world (with a few exceptions) have acted as a ninth forward, a second number eight. Aki, Danty, De Allende, Esterhuizen and Tuisova to name a few.\nThe mould for most world class 12s is someone who can run hard, tackle harder, pick decent lines and chuck decent offloads. \nOutside perhaps winger, the position with England is most blessed is back row. Just in the past few years, our options for international 8 have been Earl, Billy Vunipola, Dombrandt, Mercer, Barbeary, Graham, Fisilau, Willis, and CCS (excluding/forgetting a number more). Considering our overwhelming depth in the back row and our lack of depth at 12, are England not being flexible enough at the youth grade to develop some of these upcoming players as inside centres? \nThe debate for Ben Earl at 12 will rage on; for my money, it’s too late for him to transition, but players like Fisilau or Pollock - dynamic, quick, hard hitting back rows; could surely be transitioned to 12? Better yet, let’s change how we’re developing players in the u20s. Let’s make sure that we’re not leaving gaps in our future squads. Our issues at centre are a tale as old as time, why not share the back-row wealth we have?",

    "all_comment_text": "If you asked this question seven or eight years ago, the question would be “Do England have a development problem at 7?”\n\nOur back row wealth of talent is very recent and a reaction to how poor our back row choices were for much of the 2010s. Even into the eighteen game unbeaten streak we were playing Robshaw and Haskell as the two flank options. Curry and Underhill first played for England in late 2018 as far as I can remember.\n\nThe current depth of talent was a direct response to that. England had no open side flankers at all and very few Test level flankers, so many youth teams trained up their best players in those positions to fill a hole. We now have a very good selection there.\n\nConversely, 12 is now a problem. As you identify, back row and centre share pretty similar body types in the modern game, so the back row gaining a bigger pool of depth impacts players coming through at centre. Couple this with Farrell and Tuilagi playing 12, there wasn’t much of a need to develop 12s for the national side until now where there’s a problem. Of the players you mention as back row strengths, many are in their mid to late 20s at least so can’t really adapt at this stage of their careers.\n\nIt’s cyclical - tighthead has been an issue for a few years but there are some younger players coming through now to fill the gap. When Itoje retires there’ll likely be a second row shortage followed by a ballooning. Positions become problems, youth coaches identify or are told about the problem, young players come through to fill that problem, that focus causes other positions to become problems.\n\nGood analysis, I had almost managed to forget our dearth of 7s in the 2010s. I think the one thing we can’t complain about in England is a lack of a playing pool; this cycle which you point out suggests a larger problem in development cycles. Perhaps the RFU should have more control at the youth level so as to steady the cycles and try to reduce the impact of reactionary picks. I agree that trying to adapt players who are into their mid 20s is too ambitious, but I think there’s time for some of the younger back rows; Fisilau in particular I think could be a fantastic 12, and could make room for someone with a bit more heft in the pack.\n\nAll of this is true, but we've had a dearth of 12s over very much the same time period as the problems at 7. Basically since Greenwood and Catt retired. We went through the 2000s and 2010s only developing guys like Shane Geraghty, Anthony Allen &amp; Olly Barkley, who were simply never going to be world class. All our other options were second-rate poaches, either from league or the southern hemisphere, or both. Henry Paul, Ricki Flutey, Andy Farrell, Shontayne Hape, Brad Barritt, Sam Burgess.\n\nThen when Eddie came in, he band-aided the problem by playing guys out of position: moving Owen Farrell from 10 and later when Manu was fit moving him in from 13. But we still didn't develop any 12s.\n\nIn the same time, we've developed loads of young 7s and now have a wealth of options there. But still we haven't developed a top-level inside centre. So I don't see it as just a cyclical thing.\n\nWe seem to have obsessed with a second playmaker at 12 for as long as I can recall while most other teams had the hard running beast mode option (some of whom also had mad skills). The last pairing that we had that were actually balanced and truly complementary as well as “proper centres” are arguably Tindall and Greenwood.\n\nNot even arguably - undisputably imo\n\nYou'll enjoy [this](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/11/19/england-centre-partnership-lawrence-slade-greenwood-tindall/) article.\n\nSome is bad luck. Some is poaching (Redpath to Scotland, Tompkins to Wales). I'd blame rugby league a bit too, there's probably a good playing league/NRL that would be world class at 12. Some is muddled ideology. England have favoured the dual playmaker system over a big physical 12. Farrell did that at a world class level so that kinda stifled where a 12 would be.\n\nNone of those back rows you mentioned have the hands to be a centre. Converting any after the age of 18 wouldn't make sense too. It's a positikn far more similar to being a 10 then being a flanker or back row Imo. People don't see the organisation required to ensure you can connect what's happening inside and outside them.\n\nYes, it comes from the current way that the game is played. 12 is boring (to play) and painful. Players want to play at 7 or 8 instead because it's more involved and less high stakes in terms of getting sat on your arse.\n\nCentre partnerships have always been a consistent issue for England, as they never seem to consistently want the same thing.\n\nWhen we had Manu, it was a fairly predictable first phase carry, and maybe the odd decoy line. His offloading game was only unlocked at all by Brian O'Driscoll on the 2013 Lions tour.\n\nWith Manus injuries, Farrell, for the large part, played 12. Good enough as he was there, he's a different type of 12, so the game plan and strike plays had to change with it.\n\nManu is obviously a one off for England in terms of the sheer power and raw ability he had, so finding a like-for-like replacement has been difficult. Lawrence, in my opinion, does not carry as well, and is out of position at 12 as he plays 13 for Bath. We've also recently switched Slade to 12, where he doesn't usually play, but he also defends at 13. A top level international team should not have their centre partnership swapping roles constantly like this.\n\nEngland don't have an 'out of the box' replacement for Manu, but they have players with potential that can be moulded to it. I personally think Lennox Anyanwu from Quins could be that player. They just need to have a clear picture of what they want, and consistently pick those types of players.\n\nPeople say this and skip over the fact we won 2 6 nations with Farrell 12 and Joseph 13.\n\nAnd some people skip over the point that England have been inconsistent with what they want from a centre partnership.\n\nYeah that's kinda an extension of that point. England probably favoured a 2nd playmaker more than most.\n\nIf a big man had that skillset they'd be playing.\n\nThe rumours are that Anyanwu is off to France, which would be a massive shame, because him/Beard are a potential long term centre partnership for club/country, especially playing outside of Smith\n\nHonestly even as a Quins fan I think Anyanwu is nowhere near ready for an England starting spot yet. He's a string prospect yes and has played some good games for Quins the focus should be on him gaining some more consistency for them before being in the England conversation\n\nHaving said that as u rightly pointed out it looks like he's off to France anyway which is unfortunate but understandable. The rumours are he'd be on abt £200-300k a year over there when he signs which I imagine is nowhere near what we can offer him\n\nI think he's still raw, yes, but I also think you need to be able to identify talent and expose them to a higher level as early as you can. Even if he's just in a couple of squads, he'll learn so much about what's required of a top level international.\n\nI think New Zealand did it perfectly with Ma'a Nonu. He was a beast and just used as a ram early on, but in that environment, developed a world class passing and kicking game.\n\nCan't give him that when you're making room for Lawrence\n\nI'm not entirely convinced we need Lawrence tbh given the options we have - Northmore, Beard and Will Joseph are all solid and I'd be inclined to give Bryn Bradley and Jamie Benson minutes from the academy\n\nNot saying Lawrence is bad at all I'd just rather see the wages we'd spend on him instead spent on convincing the likes of Jibulu to stay at the club - he's a real prospect and it would a massive shame to see him leave\n\nGiven the state of rugby finances atm, I'd agree \n\nAny potential replacement is going to be on a big chunk of wedge, and given we apparently aren't offering that to Anyanwu (300k has to cover a lot of other things like moving to a new country and England ineligibility). I'd rather we use it sensibly (cant imagine all these contract extensions so far have been cheap) and give Bradley, Kerr and the like more minutes\n\nExactly Jordan Turner-Hall is clearly a genius when it comes to the academy atm so why not dip into that resource again \n\nLooks like Lucas Friday could come good as backup for Porter in the coming years as well\n\nTwo years experience of top 14 could be great and then back to try for WC squad, the time in NZ didn’t do Joe Marchant any harm\n\nI heard that and hope he can be convinced to stay!\n\nFrom the boot room I hear he is definitely off; and with Riley having extended it is likely the rumours about Jibulu are also true\n\nThere's also a self-fulfilling element \n\nEngland don't produce 12s -&gt; Clubs look overseas for a senior, developed 12 -&gt; Potential 12s get moved to 13/wing/fullback because of said overseas -&gt; England don't produce 12s\n\nNo but they do at 9 and 3 !!!!\n\nQuestion.  Should Freddie Steward be playing at 12?  Big lad with skills.\n\nCertainly has the power game and would nullify his weakness of lack of agility when tackling, he could just bang people instead. Think the only downsides are a) Tigers won’t want to move him from fullback when they’re well covered at 12 already and b) his aerial ability and decent boot would be less of a factor."

That back row is gonna dominate the break down.

That being said I wanna see him experiment with Freddie Steward at 12 and Ollie Lawrence at 13 and this is the match to experiment with even though we need a win and it might not work but fuck it\n\nHow's Tom Curry's concussion recovery going?\n\nPassed all the protocols and been passed fit to play.\n\nPersonally though I think it's a pretty bad look, especially when there are so many other potential options who can play 6.\n\nI wasn’t expecting much but this is the least exiting that starting line up could have been. \n\nBy the numbers coach.\n\nBoring.\n\nI thought the exact same!\n\nLeast exciting? The most lethal club back 3 in the prem… if England manage to get the ball in hand to them. Big ‘If’ though under SB\n\nI guess u meant least exciting in terms of experimentation. Would been nice to get some newer players a start.\n\nTotally take your point on the quality of the back 3 but like you say let’s hope they get ball in hand and not just asked to chase kicks\n\nAgree, but back 3 aren’t the issue. England midfield not firing. Ford isn’t the future let alone now given his injury hit season. Not really blooded many new forwards. Opportunities missed this autumn fur sure. 👍\n\nDefo. \n\nFreeman to 13 should have been tried at some point and Finn Smith should have gotten time already. \n\nI’m a quins fan so this ain’t some Northampton bias kicking in!\n\nSo the only new player we’re going to see this autumn is Opoku Fordjour off the bench against Japan?\n\nThis autumn has been a complete waste of time.\n\nI was out of the loop for a while. \n\nWhere are Eliot Daly and Johnny May?\n\nI'm not sure anything can be learned from today's game. \n\nThe selection being the same as previous suggests that Borthwick is desperate for a win, but what does beating Japan at home prove? These players have shown they can't finish off games against the best teams, so why not shake it up and see what the next generation can do?\n\nIf the RFU keep Borthwick on the basis of beating Japan, what does it say about their ambition?\n\nI mean Bothwick is probably coaching for his job, no? So this team is pretty predictable. Would have been a great opportunity to try a few new combinations or players (another center partnership) but when he's worried about his own position he can't afford a bad loss or scrappy performance. NOT guaranteed those things don't happen anyway of course.\n\nThere’s no way they’re sacking him whatever happens this weekend\n\nYou're probably right, but a loss and a poor six nations?\n\nIf we go two from 5 again, I’d say he’s in trouble. Otherwise they’ll stick with him\n\nSlade???? Ffs\n\nHonestly I'm going to have a nosebleed if we keep playing him\n\nI am sure he plays with a comb in his sock"

Leeds Tykes (ex prem) in 4th tier if you fancy watching a cheaper local game every once in a while\n\nThis is honestly the best answer on here, the teams that want and value a new supporter as those in the Championship - preferably pick a club that meets the eligibility requirements to be promoted\n\nYep I agree. If I were this lad I’d probs support Sale in the Prem (northern solidarity) and Doncaster in the championship and try get myself to some games.\n\nTHIS is why a sustainable promotion / relegation system is so important though. With a full thriving pyramid, Leeds Tykes might still be a force in club rugby, and even if they weren’t watching a team like Doncaster would be so much more exciting. Hope to god someone can come along and shake things up. \n\nI’m in a similar position. Down in Kent though - so closest are the London clubs.  \n\nI just watched a load of games and eventually found myself gravitating towards particular clubs. At first this was Wasps, but we all know what happened there. \n\nI moved onto Exeter because I love what they did in getting up to the premiership and then staying there and kicking arse. Back in those days it was more common for teams to get up and then instantly crash, burn and get demoted again. \n\nI’ve also got a soft spot for Harlequins.  Though I hate their strip and would never buy a shirt. \n\nSo just enjoy the game. You’ll like who you’ll like.\n\nLooks like you *may* have Wasps coming to your doorstep\n\nA lovely thought, but still more like pie in the sky than anything else at the moment.\n\nNah it's pretty much confirmed\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/articles/cq6l0rd7yqgo\n\nProgress, but I’ll believe it when I see it…..\n\nIt's so much easier when you are a kid. What do you mean they have a remote-controlled car with a little fez that brings on the kicking tee? Fucking sold.\n\nI mean, if I wasn't already a harlequins fan that would probably still do it for me.\n\nPick the team that plays the way you like maybe? I can’t tell you how they all play, but Saracens are very serious, highly drilled and play a clinical game, whereas Quins play a loose running game - which I love because it’s high stakes, high risk, high entertainment\n\nI have to agree, I much prefer the creativity of quins and bears, I’m sorry but do sale play that sort of a game as I haven’t their game, next weekend I’m going to try watch them in the cup as they will be the easiest to watch in person \n\nI would say Quins are particularly loose and specialise in free running, improvised moments of brilliance from Marcus Smith etc… Sale not as much, but they’re also not a Saracens style team. Probably somewhere in the middle. I’m sure there are Sale fans on here that can give you a better overview of them.\n\nOften the style of team is dictated by the players at 8, 9 and especially 10. They’re the key playmakers - so look at George Ford as a guide I’d say. Solid, level-headed and experienced - not a showy player like Marcus Smith, but a strategist and distributor - and very skilled too. So their style is going to be more structured than Quins - but not necessarily as clinical as others. \n\nHope that helps. Someone from Sale chime in if I’m talking out my arse!\n\nI first started supporting Harlequins because of their attacking, exciting rugby. They've also got:\n\n\\- Lots of English players and local lads\n\n\\- Always manage to pull off a shock (Bristanbul, beating Bordeaux last year in Champions Cup quarter final etc.)\n\n\\- Always have sold out stadium\n\n\\- Marcus Smith\n\nI am biased ofc\n\nAt the end of the day you should support whoever u want and whoever appeals to u. The one team I could never support is Saracens. I feel they irreparably damaged the league to an extent with the salary cap breaches and Exeter Chiefs will never have to chance get those two titles back that we now know they lost unfairly\n\nSupport a team that you can realistically go and watch live.\n\nThat’s the thing, the closest team is around a 1 hr 30 drive both ways, it’s not easy to watch any team live every weekend although if it was it would be sale as the closest I believe, realistically I could make it once/ twice a month \n\nThen support a team in a place quite nice to visit! La Rochelle?\n\nGood idea 😅 wouldn’t mind a trip to France every weekend haha\n\nWe’re season ticket holders at Northampton (whole family x4) and 1h30 is our travel time so it’s (as in that length of travel for Sale) definitely viable as an option.\n\nSale Sharks\n\nI’m thinking them now, they’re easiest to watch (still a bit of a way) but I wouldn’t mind, how do they play usually, is it fast paced or do they always take points at the penalties as I prefer a good, fast paced game \n\nAggressive, attritional, physical in the main.\n\nCapable of playing some reallying nice rugby but it's not an objective in the ways Quins, Bears, or Saint's make it.\n\nSounds perfect 💪 I’m a forward so I like a physical game \n\nI've watched prem rugby on tv for a good few years now and have never picked a team to out and out support. I have vague hierarchy of my order of preference for teams (so I'm almost always in favour of one team winning over another when I start watching a game) but I've never felt the need to have a team, especially when the England games form such a significant and regular part of the season.\n\nWork out which clubs are nearest (which sounds like Sale Sharks and Newcastle Falcons) and then see which you like best. Think about how easy it is to get to a game so you have the option to go to watch your team.\n\nI think definitely pick a team nearby. You have to support rugby in the north! It will mean more to you then.\n\nSale sharks or is there a championship side you could watch that's close to you?\n\nI'm sure they wouldn't mind extra support and revenue and maybe far cheaper to watch you could always catch premiership games on TV if you got a bar with tnt or if it's European cup rounds premier sports\n\nI’m in the same situation as you. Been watching the prem for a couple of years now and what I’ve seen it’s a blessing and a curse kinda. \n\nBased on location it’s hard to see any sets of games regularly even in the closest places like Manchester for me. I just pick the most exciting fixtures of the weekend and watch them, Really I think if you watch a mixed bag you can see exciting players coming through into the England team.\n\nI kinda think myself of an England fan at heart and as an extension a fan of all teams which England players are involved in. Means when the champions cup rolls around you can just follow the best performing English team and not loose interest after your team is eliminated.\n\nKind of a null answer I know from me but the mentality and thought process works for me. When the fixtures roll out I’ll pick a side and usually have someone who I want to win going in based on a few factors like players and style but I’m never upset if they loose which is a bonus.\n\nDefinitely scaracens (from a non bias scaries supporter)\n\nDo you feel more affinity for longitude or latitude? \n\nNorth wise, sale are in line, but the war of the roses happened. So really you need to go Newcastle and represent the north east\n\nHow far away from Doncaster are you\n\nGlaws\n\nGLAAAAAAWWWWWWWWSSSTERRRRRRRRR\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's highlander rules there can't be more than 1 Sarries fan"

    "all_comment_text": "I haven’t listened to that pod in a long time but I distinctly remember them continuously calling Galthie a cowboy and he’s not been too bad for France. \n\nEl Abd was the forwards and defence coach for Castres when they won the league, to me that seems like a pretty significant achievement. Along with Oyonnax having hardly any resources to work with. I can understand Borthwick bringing in someone he trusts after being left in the lurch by two people he clearly put a lot of faith in. Personally I’m willing to give El Abd more time than a single block of matches where he’s been stuck with a fairly difficult system to implement. If we make yet more changes and bring in Rowntree (who has never coached defence to my knowledge) or Sinfield (who got found out as defence coach at this level pretty quickly) then it will cause even more confusion and damage morale in the squad. Hopefully Borthwick can get a head of S&amp;C sorted and then the coaching team can settle in and set a clear direction for the team.\n\nThe \"Borthwick's mate\" line, whilst true, is a little overdone imo. He is actually an extremely well respected coach in France. Oyonnax operate on a shoestring budget compared to many other clubs and certainly those in the Top14. What he's done with them has been extremely impressive.\n\nThe real problem for me is the absolutely cartoonish situation where we have a part time defence coach and no head of S&amp;C (not that much of a shock that Borthwick was complaining about the players' fitness). Rather than buying out the guys we want and getting them in, we've got this fudge which no other professional sports team on the planet would do. Not even the damn WRU operates like this.\n\nElite level sport requires an ungodly amount of focus and attention to detail to even be competitive, let alone succeed. Having a guy working part time, however good he is, is simply never going to work when youre playing other teams with just as many talented players and coaches who are working at it full time.\n\nI could stomach all of this a lot easier as the RFU plead poverty meaning they can't buy the contracts out if they weren't also paying themselves million pound bonuses on top of their already vast salaries. \n\nIt's an absolute shit show and heads need to roll.\n\nGoode was grossly unfair on Joe el abd. He has a very good coaching resume. Also note that this system isn’t his system, it was put in before his tenure.\n\nWhatever new things El Abd has brought in needs to evolve and improve. It's clear to see there's massive vulnerabilities there, it's obviously not going to go unnoticed by the coaches too.\n\nThis mindset of sack and hire someone new needs to get binned. Things take time to develop. The Felix Jones method took time to start looking good, as will this. Bringing in someone new just brings a new system, new ideas, everything's from scratch again.\n\nThere is something that just does not smell right about the entire situation. \n\nI can’t believe (well I can actually) that we have a defence coach that is only part time.\n\nI would like to think that he was only a stop-gap until someone was available on a permanent basis before the start of the 6N.\n\nThey're bound to do a performance review after the ANS. It wouldn't shock me at all if one thing that comes out of it is the need to hire full time defence and S&amp;C coaches now, rather than operate on this part time basis nonsense.\n\nIf Sweeney can afford a million quid bung to himself, he can afford to pay a damn coaching staff.\n\nHow much work do you think he actually needs to do to sort the defence?\n\nAlso who are the alternatives? Because of the style of the defence there's literally a handful of guys in the world that have coached the style before.\n\nBottom of D2 is a misrepresentation of his achievements too. He's a top 14 Winner. And he did it without being at one of the big boys.\n\nI get the Omar M shout but his CV is worse than El Abds. The last few sides he's coached have been absolutely sieves defensively and that's why he's been sacked in his last 2 roles \n\nRowntree isn't a defence coach. He's a forwards coach.\n\nI don't think chopping and changing at this point helps. Continuity and stability is probably what the team needs going into the 6 nations \n\nRemember they have 2 weeks of training before the Ireland game. That might be 10 or less pitch sessions. We can't reinvent the wheel here, we just need to execute better\n\nHow much work? \n\nAbout a years worth, not wholly convinced he can pull it off. \n\n\nI agree about chopping and changing, I'm just not wholly convinced by the initial appointment.\n\nI meant week to week. What would you actually expect him to do while the players are at their clubs?\n\nSilly question\n\nMost of the year players are with their teams, so why does it matter if the defense coach is in France at this point?\n\nI assume when you see Steve etc watching a prem game, they're not having an impact on the coaching then and there?\n\nI’d take anything Andy Goode says with a huge pinch of salt. Most of his hot takes are solely to get a reaction to generate more traffic to sell hair loss tablets, shit craft beer etc. \n\nAs others have said, choosing coaches he knows and who are less likely to jump ship seems sensible after what has happened. His record seems decent and if we want our own identity this is the way to go.\n\nSinfield is not a good coach, end of. We should not be comparing to him."

    "title": "Winners and Losers from the ANS",
    "body": "I've had a go at reviewing some of the lad's autumns and whether their stock has risen or fallen. Feel free to tell me I'm talking rubbish!\n\nWinners: \n\n\n- Stuart: has looked the best he's ever looked for England, especially in the set piece.\n\n\n- Underhill: in the endless back row selection debates he often seems to be overlooked. Reminded everyone what an absolute warrior he is.\n\n\n- CCS: Continues to improve. Still not sure he's an 80 minute man but has become probably England's most effective carrier in tight. Also developed into a really solid lineout option.\n\n\n- Marcus Smith: Nailed on starter now for England. Some may disagree but I think England's attack has looked in general much better than it has done in recent times. Has really leaned to pick his moments so much better and seems so much more comfortable at this level \n\n\n- IFW: Continues to be absolutely box office. Shame we didn't see him against the Boks and Japan.\n\n\n- Sleightholme: Just has a nose for the try line. Very strong through contact and absolutely lightning quick. Really should be in any match day squad either starting or in the 23 shirt moving forward.\n\n\n- Lawrence: Not his greatest series but when he's been able to get the ball in a little space he's been effective. I thought he was excellent against Japan. Physically dominant, great angles, lovely offloading game. Used too much like a Manu 2.0 and it's not really his game. Should be wearing 13 and playing there on both sides of the ball.\n\n\nLosers\n\n\n- Martin: for my money hasn't looked up to his usual level. Seemed a little short of match fitness. We know what he can do though so I'm not worried.\n\n\n\n- Isiekwe: One lineout steal against Japan and it's hard to think what else he's done. Doesn't offer anything like the impact needed. I'd like to have seen Alex Coles used at least in one game. Need Chessum back. It's not all on him by any means but I think there's a reason the last 20 minutes we've really struggled. The bench in general has been very poor.\n\n\n- Dombrandt: I've been an advocate for him for ages but ultimately I can't help but think he's had his chance now. Yet to really do anything in an England jersey. I'd be very surprised if he's in the Six Nations squad. \n\n\n- JVP and Randall: Its not ideal for them to keep chopping and changing at 9 but I don't think either had a good autumn to be honest, certainly nothing that will make Mitchell concerned for his space. I think we're crying out for someone to really put their hand up as his understudy. As it is, you could make a fairly unconvincing case for any of the 9s this autumn.\n\n\n- Slade: Decent showing today ball in hand and there have been a few nice touches. Defensively he looks way too exposed though. The lack of a proper 12 is really hurting us in my opinion and I think he should be the centre to miss out if England decide to select someone like Dingwall for the Six Nations. He also was clearly not quite fit which doesn't do him any favours.\n\n\n- Controversial take but Steward: Only played against the Boks but it in my view it completely encapsulated him as a player. What he's great at, he's genuinely world class. There's no denying it. What he's poor at that, he really is very poor at for a test level fullback. I think should be used going forward as a tool for a very specific job against specific teams but I don't think should be selected as England's first choice fullback.\n\n\n- Ford: We know how good he is but ultimately was involved in far more bad moments than good. Calls to drop him from the squad seem a little over the top but I think should be third choice at 10 moving forward. Another rushed back from injury and it didn't pay off.\n\n\n- Cole: Whisper it quietly but looks a step below Stuart now in the scrum. Offered very little in the loose as well. May well okay in the Six Nations but I can't help but think that says more about England's lack of depth than his performances. \n\n/ Wall of text ",

    "all_comment_text": "Love the write up.\n\nThink you are being kind to Lawrence, coughed the ball up too much for me. But agree with your other winners.\n\nId have Fasogbon off the bench in the SN. Only one side have a back up front row that could worry him. If Hays does well in Europe I'd say him.\n\nAs horrible as it is when Austin Healey says something you agree with, Alex Mitchell has done himself a load of favours by giving everyone else an opportunity to show they aren't quite up to his level.\n\nControversial one here, although he's captain Jamie George does not look himself in the loose anymore, he looks slow and lost all his physicality, we need to look at other options\n\nI totally agree, and if he’s there for his leadership then why are we taking him off after 50 minutes. There are at least 2 other hookers, Langdon and Oghre), who have been miles ahead of him in the prem for the last year and a bit and there’s no way he’s there in 2 years time through form and fitness.\n\nTommy Freeman had good games and quiet games, but Ollie Lawrence and Henry Slade failing to impress leaves space for Freeman to fill in at 13, which in turn would let us play Feyi-Wasboso and Sleighthome on the wings.\n\nAlex Mitchell and Ollie Chessum proved their value by their absence, none of the 9s really impressed and we could have done with Chessum in the scrum, lineout, and for his carrying.\n\nMaro Itoje, Marcus Smith, and Sam Underhill need to start every time against top opposition, and I think Itoje should be made permanent captain too.\n\nI'm inclined to agree on George. I think there's still a place for him in the squad but we're pretty blessed now with some really dynamic hookers in the league (Langdon, Jibulu, Dan, LCD) and with his age profile it does seem that his days as England's first choice are numbered.\n\nI also have some doubt as to whether he'll be around in 2027.\n\nPlease tell me, where does Will Stuart rank in tightheads worldwide?\n\nProbably the lower half of Tier 1 starting tightheads\n\nAgreed. He's got a genuine shot at the Lions tour I think. Furlong and Zander will be there. Then it's probably between Bealham and Stuart for the 3rd spot in the OG tour. A 4th will almost inevitably be called up after injuries. I'd say Stuart is more likely to tour than not at this point. Fair play to him. He's improved through England sticking with him.\n\nHe's looked bigger and better, a solid TH if not spectacular\n\nThe best we can hope for at the moment, we have a bit of a dearth there in contrast to every other T1 team.\n\nMartin came into the Autumn coming back from injury and shouldn’t have been thrown in with no warm up and shouldn’t have played every game. No surprise he looked a bit off the pace.\n\nIt's been really interesting reading all the stuff about Smith v Smith over the past couple of days. I do think Marcus is often the spark this team needs, but the point made on comms on Sunday about how he is often dummying and delaying the pass so late that the support over-run it was well observed. \n\nI also said the week prior how sometimes he just catches the support runners flat-flooted when he uses his footwork to go himself instead of distributing the ball. It's clear that if you let him play his game the folks around him need to adapt and we aren't quite there yet, whereas Fin offers a more conventional distributor role that lets the rest of the backline do their thing with a bit more confidence. \n\nBoth of them look best when they link up directly with the wide channels, but the midfield seem more comfortable with the Fin approach than the Marcus approach. Tricky.\n\nAnyway, I pretty much agree with you otherwise. I still think there is a role for Steward in this squad and that he can be an asset in the right sort of game. Freeman has been quiet sometimes, but pretty industrious. I think we need to get him more time on the ball and try to put him into space more. We all know he can carry through contact and chase kicks, but we seem to have forgotten that a couple of seasons ago he was scoring regular screamers in the prem and we haven't really seen that side of him much in an England shirt.\n\nScrum? Bring on the new generation of props...and the hookers come to that. What happened to Dan? Either we are backing him or we aren't.\n\nI think the number of folks returning from injury and the overall conditioning of the team were both significant factors this autumn...almost like we lost our strength and conditioning coach. I do think that the selection was ropey from the start as well, and that has impacted the performance across all four games. The strength of the bench has shown that we would have been doing better getting minutes into promising youngsters. I do still think the team are on the right track and the 6N will be better. It needs to be, otherwise I wouldn't put it past Italy to be a banana skin and we end up in 5th place."

    "all_comment_text": "Admirable of him to say this but the reality is in the last three tests (all against NZ) our bench has come on and offered basically nothing*\n\n\n*Ben Curry was quite good last weekend.\n\n***Telegraph Sport reports:***\n\nTom Curry is adamant that England’s players should shoulder responsibility for their habit of [falling away in the final quarter](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/11/03/england-new-zealand-all-blacks-twickenham-steve-borthwick/) rather than head coach Steve Borthwick.\n\nThe flanker admits that the squad “have let themselves down” with their indiscipline late in games as [England](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/england-rugby-union-team/) seek to relieve the pressure of only winning one of their last six matches against tier-one nations.\n\nEngland have held the lead in their past four matches against such opponents at the hour mark but have failed to see the job out on each occasion, suffering three successive defeats by New Zealand and one to France. They also led 15-6 heading into the final quarter against South Africa in [last year’s World Cup semi-final](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2023/10/21/england-v-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-live/).\n\nStats compiled by Opta Sports show that in those five games the cumulative penalty count is 21-8 against England in the final 20 minutes. That trend was all too readily apparent in their [24-22 defeat by the All Blacks](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/11/02/england-v-new-zealand-live-score-latest-twickenham/) last Saturday when they conceded five penalties after only conceding two in the first hour.\n\nAnd while Borthwick has borne the brunt of criticism, particularly for [the timing of his substitutions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/11/02/greenwood-marcus-smith-george-ford-borthwick-all-blacks/), Curry insists that it is the players who need to step up. “I think discipline-wise, we let ourselves down,” Curry said. “At 40 minutes, it was one penalty \\[conceded\\], 60 minutes, two penalties, then at 80 minutes it had built up. A, it was three points, but B, it gave them territory and they are pretty clinical. That is a big factor.\n\n“The last quarter, we as players definitely have to stand up. It’s about the full 80 minutes. There’s stuff we were doing in the last quarter that we weren’t doing in the first 60. We can’t be making excuses; as players we have to step up and be more consistent. We obviously made mistakes and we’ve recognised that. It is frustrating, but we just have to step up.\n\n“There’s nothing coming externally that we haven’t heard. The coaches… we’ve had all the right messages. We as players need to step up. There are no excuses. There has never been a question of effort. There’s never been a question of what we need to do as a team. It’s all about tying it all together.”\n\n**Read more:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/11/06/tom-curry-blame-england-players-not-steve-borthwick/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/11/06/tom-curry-blame-england-players-not-steve-borthwick/)\n\nThing is, after all the Eddie Jones revelations we know that we can't take anything that a current player says as being real. They are bound into a system that means that they have no possibility of saying anything negative without risking their mortgage and pension. Tom Curry just needs another year or so in the England setup and he's probably set for life. He'd probably quite like to see his brother pick up another 20 caps as well. There's no possibility at all of him saying anything critical of Borthwick.\n\nOotl, what were the Eddie Jones revelations??\n\nDanny Care (england 9 for a chunk under EJ) has published an autobiography and it's been serialised in the times. Of course, I've only read the serialized bits and Care says (on a podcast) that there's another side to the story in the book, so I better not write a summary here as it's probably better for you to read the stories directly. \n\nMade me feel pretty sick and angry though. I really hope to god that that has all stopped and these young guys don't have to go through it. In a way I'm glad now that England didn't win in 2019 as I am sure that it would have been used to justify more of the same. Now, I think it's clear that the regime was a bust and the players need to be treated better if they are to perform. \n\nOne issue (apart from the RFU employing lunatics) is that England have huge depth, but a pretty flat pyramid. There are lots of \"international quality\" players - but very few of these are \"worldies\" as in would make a world 36 - let alone a world 15. In the current team I can see maybe three (Itoje, M. Smith, Curry) and there are some younger players who could come through in the next year or so but to be honest France, NZ, SA and Ireland have a much larger contingent of cast iron stars. This means that no one is indispensable and tilts the balance of power very much towards the coach. The hybrid central contracts could change this because they may give the players more tenure. If you are signed on for a game and you have a row with the coach, you've got a problem. If you are signed on for three years and you have a row with the coach then the coach has a problem.\n\nThank you for the summary but you've alluded to the allegations. What are they?\n\nJust different examples of Eddie being a dickhead to players and staff.\n\n\nOne example Care described: \n\n\nEddie once shouted at a physio in front of the whole England squad. So later, to 'say sorry', he gave the physio a food bag and said it was steak for him and the missus. But when the physio got home and opened the bag, it was full of sausages. Eddie then texted him: \"You're fucking sausages mate, you're not ready for steak.\"\n\nNahhh - google them up for yourself, it's not for me to put them here.\n\njust stop rotating so much - the players on the bench are on the bench for a reason\n\nYou clearly don’t know how test rugby works.\n\nSo with this, are players going to be dropped? Are coaches gonna be sacked? There is no responsibility being taken by anyone."

His replacements didn’t go great, subbing on a George ford whose played 0 minutes for a month and taking off smith who was controlling the game and tempo. Also that whole front row replacements (Baxter,Dan,Cole) just didn’t work, all blacks absolutely destroyed them in the scrums. And finally taking Ben Spencer off too early, he’s a massive control factor, you see it every week for Bath. Maybe it should have been the other way round? Start Randall then have Ben as the finisher? As Randall is more attacking and quick so it could have been vis versa??",

    "all_comment_text": "Personally I think it was an extremely safe selection in general with the only real ballsy call being Stuart to start over Cole (Stuart went on to probably have his best game in an England shirt so that's something).\n\nI think Slade's inclusion was a misstep. He's played bugger all rugby this season and was fairly anonymous. Ford's inclusion was weird for the same reason. Isiekwe I understand because of Chessum's injury but the lack of any real impact from the bench was a worry before the game and so it proved. Sleightholme, Tom Willis and Fin Smith on that bench imo would have been much more impactful. Possibly Alex Coles over Isiekwe too. \n\nFrustrating but we were the width of the post away from beating the All Blacks. If that kick goes over, Borthwick's selections would be vindicated so I think some of the doom and gloom is a little over the top. Still, these close losses after leading are becoming a habit. Speaks to a poor bench imo.\n\nYou’re forgetting one player who should be playing over all those forwards players you mentioned. Ted Hill! How on earth is he not even included in the match day squad. In my opinion it’s been a bit of “favouritism” from Borthwick picking some of these players. Ted hill gets ahead over isiekwe every day of the week\n\nTed Hill isn't really a second row though to be fair. He's played there once for Bath but he's really a 6. \n\nI agree he should definitely be involved though. CCS did go well yesterday to be fair so I'd be surprised if it's against the Aussies.\n\nHis initial position is second row but has moulded into a really good 6. He can do a great job in both positions as he has great experience in both\n\nLet's go glass 1/2 full. \n\nEngland were playing with two scum halves who have very little on field time with the pack or the fly halves, this hampered them with Spencer dithering at times and Randall thowing wild passes. \n\nThe starting England front row were either holding their own in the scrum or a bit on top.\n\nThe defensive system worked and England created a lot of pressure with it. \n\nglass 1/2 empty \n\nThe line out was disfunctional, George messed up several throw ins and Itoje got out jumped.  \n\nThe replacement front row were monstered. \n\nEngland did very little in attack, they didn't create any pressure until the final few minutes and that was against 14 men. In the first half I remember a big overlap when Slade could have put a three on one through, but he ran it back into traffic. Lawrence and Slade both have huge talent, but I think that neither of them is a creative second receiver. Ben Earl didn't seem to get any change out of running the ball - only IFW's carries really looked penetrating, although I do remember Itoje getting some runs as well, but I think only in broken play. \n\nI fear for Baxter against the Saffa's but I think the other problems can be fixed. They need Furbank to join the line more and to lift his head up and pass a bit,  and they need to drill that line out.\n\nOn the Baxter point I wonder if the problem is more that he was next to a weak scrummager in Dan and a knackered Itoje behind him, as we haven’t seen this weakness before\n\nThe one pen cole conceded was with him coming in to try and save Dan (imo) as well so I think that tracks. Scrum looked solid again when George came back on as far as I remember\n\nThink I would put Cowan-Dickie in the 16 shirt against the Springboks for a bit of extra bulk/security\n\nThe fact that England did little in attack suggests to me they weren't  going for that as a game plan, and this is the biggest issue I have with Borthwick at the moment.\n\nI think we need to be playing champagne rugby with a varied attack to warrant the inclusion of Furbank. Not to say he isn't one of the best attacking fullbacks out there. But if we planned to play heads up, defensive rugby, which we seem to default to. We needed a fullback who is the safer bet in the air.\n\nThere are a couple of selections that would hint at wanting to play heads up rugby but the game plan seems to be percentages which just doesn't suit those selections.\n\nA top tier side gets a whole tournament to play before setting off on a tour.\n\nAnother top tier side have a couple of weeks together to play their first match in ages.\n\nThe second team didn’t win so… it’s the manager’s fault.\n\nGlass half empty says top side who's totally knackered and has flown half way round the world beat the side that's just warming up from its summer break. \n\nI expect Borthwick won't make any changes unless there are injuries though."

    "body": "Virtually every single player was outstanding as England women's team pulverised Ireland in the Women's Six Nations. But I thought Holly Aitchison in particular was inconspicuously excellent. When watching closely I always noticed she was always at the centre of England's dominating attacks. She was the metronome, the conductor of the orchestra and ran the whole match, only getting better as the match went on. One example: on 44 minutes she could have kicked or gone right on halfway, but instead decided to go left and the team were then running it in to score. Her passing, kicking, running was so great. It was genuinely enjoyable to watch her play rugby.",

She even got 9/14 kicks! But 10 is such a key position, if she didn’t distribute as well as she does, it wouldn’t work.\n\nAnd because every single player was outstanding, it seems unfair to pick out Holly in particular, but she was a big reason why every player was outstanding. She made the whole thing tick. I loved how understated, yet influential she was, playing some great rugby.\n\nHer and Heard were outstanding.\n\nHeard was simply world class. Great to see her playing so well given her struggles with injuries over the years."

    "all_comment_text": "I agree with this.\n\nYesterday was the best we have looked over this series -  despite all the problems.\n\nPeople are being hard on Steward. Why? We all knew his weaknesses going in. So did he. Yeah, he missed a couple of cover tackles against Kolbe and Arendse, two of the best wingers in the world. He also did exactly what he was bought in to do. Absolutely rock solid in the air, with a couple of other nice contributions. I would have liked to see a bit more in attack but give him time to get back into the groove and he's still a weapon if he is used in the right way.\n\nJVP was decent. It was his first time in the shirt for what...3 years? There were some dumb decisions about kicking from the base when you have Stretchebeth waiting to spoil things, but that was something the entire team should have accounted for. When we needed to go, JVP was providing the speed of service we needed. That's so vital I can overlook other errors. As above, he probably needs a chance to find his groove. I think he should be in our squad going forwards. I would take Mitchell, JVP and Randall (or maybe even Porter).\n\nMost of our 2nd row and back rowers were grand. Underhill must be retained!\n\nOur issues are:\n\n\\- Midfield isn't working. Same old problem. I don't know what the answer is. I am not convinced our guys are test quality...but they were up against the Boks.\n\n\\- Lack of impact from the bench. That's partly a selection issue. We have the wrong guys there because Borthwick was too conservative choosing his squad for the series. There's also an issue with the lost generation of props - when your bench is a guy who only recently turned 22 and another one who is pushing 40 you have a problem that can't be corrected overnight because the seeds were sown 8-10 years ago. That said, I don't want to be too down on the guys who were out there yesterday - they managed to pull a couple of pens from the Boks and that's no mean feat.\n\n\\- Coaching. I think we have seen more and more over this series just how much the loss of Jones and Walters have affected things on both sides of the ball. Borthwick and the RFU need to own up to this and put things right. The situation going into this series was not acceptable. It's probably the single biggest issue that compounds all the others.\n\nWe still need more creativity in attack - better off-loading game, using the width, getting the ball into the hands of guys like Freemo, etc. - but if you fix the problems above that should come.\n\nI am not nearly as dismayed about yesterday as I was about the previous two games. Those are the games we should have won. Yesterday, we gave the Springboks a scrap. I am not ready to give up on this team yet.\n\nExactly and I feel getting rid of Borthwick is not necessarily the answer. The team obviously like him (from what we see) and actually has made a solid culture. The problem is above and below him in terms of management. Senior England rugby have made it into a money making scheme and the coaches below him have been absent/ uncommitted/ generally poor. I agree, fix these things and things will slot into place. I would also like to see some more risk and capping younger players. We’re losing anyway so may as well blood the younguns. Look at CCS, was almost an unknown as to whether he’d perform last year and now is one of our standouts and about the only player other than Smith that you’d think is guaranteed a slot in the lions team. Sort out the management, play the talent and let them play modern fast rugby. If anyone can play a hybrid of set piece/aerial/islander/expansive attacking rugby, it’s this team! They just need to have the right players and the right management. But bloody hell it’s hard being an England Rugby fan at the moment!\n\nBang on\n\nAgree with all of this. Nothing \"Bomb Squad\" about our bench at all. Cole just trundled into every ruck and lost every contest. Cowan-Dickie threw a loose lineout in their 22, then gave away the last penalty that Pollard kicked.\n\nIsikwe and Dombrandt are the greyest men in international rugby. I couldn't tell you one thing they've ever done that stands out.\n\nRandall is an absolute talent, but playing in a system that just does not suit his skill set. He's brought on in a closing quarter where we're trying to close a game out. Ford has been class for England, but the time to evolve is now. He's going to be a brilliant coach one day, and that day should be brought forward. We have two brilliant fly halves how that we can build the team around.\n\nThe penalty wasnt against LCD and LCD did also win a penalty turnover.\n\nHe asked the ref if it was him, and the ref said yeah.\n\nNo he asked if it was him and he said no it was for offside.\n\nSA were playing with advantage by the time LCD made his tackle.\n\nOh my mistake\n\n\"Nobody told him it was him, so he asked the ref...\"\n\nYou have summed up my feelings exactly. I was at the game and haven't had a chance to re-watch it but for me this is spot on.\n\nAs a Saffa I thought your boys were great, and much of the criticism is unwarranted. I do wonder why Borthwick seems OK with his coaching setup, though.\n\nOn the issue of players not being eligible for selection if they don’t play in the country, what would you propose?\n\nI would like to see a balance between supporting the game in England by retaining talent here but also maximising the availability of the absolute best talent. \n\nMaybe something like only established players (50 caps perhaps?) from overseas leagues being eligible?? Or a maximum number of the squad being from overseas leagues??\n\nA la the \"Giteau Rule\" that Australia brought in?\n\nI've always thought maybe they could have a number of players who they can pick from overseas.  Let's say there are two spots from overseas allowed.  I think it would stop the majority of players moving as it probably isn't worth the risk unless you are elite and undroppable.\n\nWhen you say foreign player rule do you mean the residency rule or picking players in France?\n\nIf you're saying pick the French based players then thats ridiculous. One, there aren't many who would get in the squad; Willis who also didnt play well for England, Marchant, Arundell, Farrell? And two they all play in positions we're not desperate for. Only one who'd definitely start is Marchant imo so it would barely make any difference.\n\nI'm pretty sure Willis did play well for England...\n\nHe got dropped...\n\nNo he got injured\n\nHe did?! God my memory must be shot, I only remember him playing well.\n\nAlthough being dropped from England has not necessarily meant you're a bad player in recent times. Or being retained meaning you're a good one...\n\nHe’s an amazing player, not saying otherwise but he’s also a player in a position we’re stacked\n\nExactly, English players playing abroad! I agree those 4 would walk into the squad.\n\nI don’t think they all would get in and only Marchant would play so I’m saying I agree with the foreign player rule\n\nI feel like picking Steward was the wrong choice yesterday. JVP and Genge had absolutely shocking performances. But our first up tackles were poor also. Too many missed tackles led to almost 3 tries Genge and Steward to name two tries. Looking at our bench didn’t give me many high hopes, luckily they didn’t bring on Ford for once and just Smith shine at 10. So at least there’s a positive. Underhill coming off was a really bad choice to make as he’d been the top performer all game! I think it comes down to not enough strength in depth, poor substitutions and poor tackling for me.\n\nAgree with all. JVP I think however is our second best scrum half after Mitchell and maybe just needs game time. Steward just needs to tighten things up and he’s world class. Perhaps both need more game time. Wasn’t long ago people were saying Steward was the best fullback in the world! I also feel like he just shouldn’t be put in the position of being stepped by naughty little South Africans and he wouldn’t be if our initial defence was better. The bench is our biggest weakness, we need our own impact/bomb squad with solid rapid finishers, rather than bloody Isiekwe and Dombrandt!!\n\nHow do you not put a full back in position to be beaten by a winger - it’s literally part of his role\n\nBy actually defending in the midfield! Or at least be playing better territory so that those situation aren’t happening 5 metres out from the try line against the nippiest winger in the world.\n\nAll those things need to improve but he’s still going to be asked to defend 1-1 as all full backs have to do.\n\nThat’s my issue also as a fullback your whole game is going to be 1v1 against a guy breaking through. Which is the worst part of his game. He can catch a high ball, that’s about it.\n\nAgreed and I think given game time, he’ll be better\n\nNot convinced - it’s always been a weakness and continues to be. But if he plays it’s for what he can do (aerial prowess and being a sledge hammer in attack) rather than what he can’t. Same with furbank - if he plays it’s for his strengths as a playmaker and his vision and skill rather than his aerial prowess. To be fair though, there’s every chance both of them get stepped by fast wingers yesterday\n\nAgreed\n\nPeople keep saying Genge is missing tackles but ignoring the bigger problem. Why are we leaving our props one-on-one against backs?\n\nIf Genge had made the tackle on their SH for the try hed have to have done something incredible. No country expects their props to make those tackles\n\nTrue but he’s missed quite a few in yesterday’s game and last weeks. Most of his missed tackles have been as first man out off a breakdown. This is his bread and butter tackles coming off the fringes of a ruck.\n\nHe missed two against NZ and both were against wingers so no blame there.\n\nLike I say, the SA one was against their prop on his own. That is not bread and butter and no one expects him to make that tackle."

In fact I think that's what the Autumn Internationals should be for every year. \nMaybe not all four, but two games per year in Manchester, Newcastle or elsewhere in non-traditional Rugby territory would be hugely beneficial in my opinion. \nI think it would really help grow the game and dispel the belief that it's a posh southern game, for posh southern people.\nI'm sure it would benefit Premiership clubs like Sale and Newcastle as well.\n\nIt's just money. All of those venues would charge a pretty penny, twikkers costs the rfu every day it's empty.\n\nYep - 100% it’s this. I looked on the Twickenham events calendar for the year, and the pitch is being used on average less than once a month. Hence the much needed sponsorship from Allianz. I’d expect to see more gigs being hosted there now they’re the sponsor - they’ll want their money’s worth\n\nThe problem is the RFU and Richmond Council are not the best of friends and licensing for non rugby events is hard to come by. \n\nI am a local resident and The RFU have been pretty poor at managing relationships with the local community and the council. \n\nAn odd situation as the stadium adds a hell of a lot to the local economy but not many around here advocate for the RFU in anyway.\n\nPeople have cited the financial reasons which I think is fair. Should've moved the England A game to the Midlands/north instead of the Stoop.\n\nYes, that's the match that should have been played at a prem ground outside of London, use Franklin's Gardens or Welford Road (which are both brilliant places) but don't give a rugby match to a football stadium!\n\nBut ‘Allianz‘ is our Fortress. 🤭\n\nFortress we continue to lose at lately\n\n![gif](giphy|26tknCqiJrBQG6bxC)\n\nUnfortunately we cannot close games out frustrating to watch\n\nI'd love it if England played home games away from Twickenham occasionally, at least once a year, but there isnt really any financial incentive to do so. \n\nTwickenham is the second largest stadium in the country and, especially for games against tier 1 opponents, the RFU can sell it out with ease. Against the real big boys they could do it three times over.\n\nMainly though, the RFU own Twickenham so get to keep the revenue without having to pay Manchester United, Liverpool, Newcastle United etc for the access.\n\nIneos are now in charge of Manchester United and are also a sponsor of the All Blacks so my pipe dream as a United fan is that there might be scope to host some games in the new stadium when it gets built. That's years away though and chances are they wouldn't allow it anyway.\n\nFully disagree about the Prem final because that's a showpiece final and should be in the national stadium, in the same way you wouldn't rotate the FA Cup final away from Wembley (rebuild years aside)\n\nBut yes, the fourth autumn game or the third 6N game (Italy, let's be honest) should be played outside London and the southeast. To make it financially viable though they'd need to find something else to host at Twickenham to make up for the lost revenue and the cost of renting somewhere else for a game. The obvious answer is to grow the women's game so you can have minimum 2 Twickenham games a year with strong attendances and reasonably high ticket prices\n\nA year or two ago I might've agreed with you abt the Prem final but the Top14 have started rotating it including hosting a final in Spain (not suggesting England do that) and it seems to have been a success. Outside of rugby you could argue the Super Bowl rotations bring in more fans than they otherwise would if the final was held in 1 place every year\n\nAmerica's a big country though and the Stade de France is not the home of rugby in quite the same way (iirc then Spain finals have been due to football at the SdF, for example) so I don't think either is a great comparison here – if Twickenham is to be the home of rugby and the national rugby stadium I think it needs to consistently host the main domestic final\n\nAny statistics to support the ‘growing the game’ argument? \n\nMakes zero financial sense to move games from Twickenham.\n\nHow can one provide statistics for something that's never been done before, outside of a RWC?\n\nI’ve been to see Eng vs New Zealand at Old Trafford before and it was bloody brilliant. Granted it was in the 90’s when I think Twickenham was being redeveloped but it has been done before.\n\nThat being said the money they make from hosting games at Twickenham means it’s so unlikely we’ll see any men’s games being played up north.\n\nRugby league bring games down south every year…has done nothing for the popularity of the game down south.\n\nRugby League is much more popular than Union in the north of England so its not as if there's no appetite for the sport - the national team is (rightly or wrongly) far more popular than the club game across the country so why not build on that in an areas which clearly have potential\n\nWould make zero financial sense for them to do so though\n\nPerhaps short term, but long term for a sport that's arguably dying a slow death in this country?\n\nI think it would make precious little difference but cost them loads of money. That money could be better spent. I'd also imagine there would be contractual obligations with having sold naming rights to Twickenham\n\nAlso, this year and next year there are 200 odd professional players and staff who would benefit from being paid, as would their families. The money's not a long term thing for them.\n\nIf the game was in better financial health it would be a great idea.\n\nThis whole AI has been a wasted opportunity by England…"

Curry is an incredibly talented player but has a way to go from his injury recovery and comeback\n\nI almost feel like Curry got his contract as a thank you for breaking his body for England. \n\nYou might argue it’s been identified as a way to manage his game time better\n\nI mean yeah essentially, they’re banking on his previous potential. \n\nWhat do you mean by that last bit?\n\nI believe these elite player contracts give RFU powers to influence the S&amp;C training and game time. \n\nIn a similar way to how IRFU managed Johnny Sextons late career - he barely played for Leinster so he was fit for Ireland. Not a great comparison - I’m not saying curry is as important as sexton was in his prime (they also had more complete power)\n\nBaxter is a good shout, he did do well earlier in the tour. I can't remember if he was on the field when we won a second half scrum penalty yesterday, but we certainly didn't get demolished in the second half as we've seen in the past, so credit to him.\n\nAlthough Ox's injury obviously didn't help SA....\n\nYeah we got lucky with that, and the reduced impact of the bomb squad\n\nSleightholme has really emerged as the next cab off the rank in the wing slot. Genuine top end pace, powerful in contact and carried over his strike rate from Saints to the international scene.\n\nImo he should start for England alongside IFW and Freeman should shift to 13 with Lawrence at 12 but that might be a pipe dream.\n\nMarcus Smith has ended the debate about whether it should be him or Ford. Imo now the debate is whether Ford should give way to other Smith for the 22 shirt.\n\nLet's let Lawrence actually play in his preferred position. We need a proper 12 first.\n\nThink FS would get the backline moving better than MS albeit MS has more moments of individual brilliance.

Huge opportunity missed by Borthwick.\n\nThat I agree with. Criminal that he hasn't featured from the bench so far this autumn. *Has* to get minutes against Japan\n\nAnd I’m sure he will but what will we learn compared to how he might have gone with minutes vs NZ, Aus &amp; SA? Instead we get a cameos from an out of practice Ford that ultimately was a pointless endeavour. Genuinely don’t see how SB will get the best out of the attacking talent available to him.\n\nId have to say the guys who have been given a chance and really stepped up are: Chandler\nCunningham-South, Ben Earl, Marcus Smith, Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, Sam Underhill and Ollie Sleightholme.\n\nI thought Ben Earl has been really disappointing this series, especially compared to how well he played in the 6 nations. His missed tackle on de Allende yesterday was pretty shocking for an 8.\n\nBecause he's not an 8.\n\nWe have better 8s\n\nThe problem is that we also have better 7's. There's a noticeable drop whenever Curry or Underhill aren't on the pitch\n\nI agree. I don’t think Earl is an international standard tbh. He’s an exceptional athlete and a very very good club player but he is nowhere near the best of the back row players in T1.\n\nThat's rubbish, he was one of the best players in the whole 6N and had a good RWC. That might have been an outlier but he's a test player\n\nSorry, I don’t agree with that and it wasn’t the point I was trying to make. I think he’s a fantastic player, he’s just not had a good series by the high standards he’s set previously.\n\nHe was literally just the best player in the whole 6Ns\n\nAre you sure you’re taking about Earl? He’s been exceptional in an England shirt on multiple occasions\n\nCunningham south, to me at least, still looks like he isn't quite ready for a full 80 tbh.\n\nImagine if instead we had had chessum starting and Cunningham South off the bench\n\n100% this - I’ve said this in another thread - he’s the perfect answer to our bench having no impact. CCS coming on and giving it everything for 25-30 minutes would be brilliant\n\n100%. I don't think he's quite ready to start but is a hell of an impact player\n\nMarcus Smith, Sam Underhill, even though he seems to be the most droppable undroppable player we have, Sleighthome has done very well too.\n\nUnderhill came back in and had a great game, smartest forward on the pitch in attack and did his usual tackle &amp; turnover combo in defense. \n\nGeorge Martin was one of the few forward carriers able to make post-contact yards against South Africa, and had a good tour all round. \n\nWill Stuart had a good tour too, improved his scrummaging dramatically. He's been on form for Bath, maybe benefitting from playing and training with du Toit, but he did give away a couple of dodgy penalties in the loose yesterday. \n\nSmith has obviously been good throughout and I think we miss IFW yesterday, he's getting better and better, although Sleightholme and Freeman had good games. \n\nWe didn't see as much from Ollie Lawrence as I hoped, but then we didn't get the ball to the wide channels much all tour. He did put in huge defensive shifts earlier in the tour though, and hasn't made the obvious defensive errors that Slade has next to him. He can be quietly pleased with his performances. \n\nSteward did what Steward does, he's great in the air, good in attack, and poor in defense.

    "all_comment_text": "Article below:\n\nAmong the natural reactions to Sam Underhill’s absence from the first England team of a pivotal autumn was to wonder what injury he might have picked up in training. Because for the 28-year-old to be missing from a side featuring five back-rowers – six if you count Nick Isiekwe – is quite a shock.\n\nUnderhill had started all eight Tests in 2024 prior to this campaign. He has evidently worked on his breakdown spoiling, finishing second only to arch-poacher Will Evans for jackal turnovers per 80 minutes in the Premiership last season.\n\nWhen England needed an emergency lock for a scrum against Wales after being reduced to 13 men, Underhill stepped up. Line-out jumping is another asset that he has honed and he seems more comfortable than ever on the ball. Remember his one-handed offload to Maro Itoje in the lead-up to George Furbank’s try against Ireland?\n \nThen again, Underhill does often appear to be more expendable than one might think for a player who is widely respected around the world and, when fit, has put in commanding performances at the top level since.\n\nHe was discarded from last year’s World Cup shake-up at an early stage, to the bare shock of colleague Ben Earl. His name was not among the 17 to receive an enhanced elite player squad contract on Friday. Clues have been there, though for him to be dropped entirely, from a side that has a six-two split of forwards on the bench, is still surprising.\n\nRecovery from ankle surgery has compromised Underhill’s early season, restricting him to a single start and two more cameos for Bath. But he was sharp and imposing against Harlequins at the Twickenham Stoop and several others, such as Henry Slade and George Martin, have been picked despite enduring lay-offs.\n\nAnother potential factor is a desire on England’s behalf to load up on jackalling. This might have made it difficult to retain a starting back-row combination of Chandler Cunningham-South with both Underhill and Earl, because referees do not appear to appreciate the latter’s technique around the tackle area. More than once, at key moments in Test matches, Earl has been penalised for failing to support his bodyweight.\n\nNotwithstanding his improvements, Underhill is probably not quite as natural a scavenger as either Tom or, particularly, Ben Curry. Besides offering intuitive link play and specialist skills at the base of scrums, Alex Dombrandt is a crafty jackaller as well.\n\nDuring his first press call as Steve Borthwick’s new defence coach earlier this month, Joe El-Abd declared that there were ways in which England could improve. That was pretty punchy, given only 40 points had been conceded across two matches in New Zealand. But the All Blacks were cuter and more disruptive on the floor and emerged on the right side of refereeing calls.\n\n“The back row is important in that [defensive] system; how they get off the line, how they tackle, how they slow the ball down, how disciplined they are,” El-Abd said three weeks ago.\n\nWe have seen enough to suggest that Tom Curry will be catapulted into the England mix whenever he is healthy enough. His presence on the summer tour, on the back of a domestic season comprising just 34 minutes for Sale Sharks, underlined as much. Ben has been reliably excellent in the Premiership for half a decade. Can he translate that influence into Test matches? He is certainly a player with real poise.\n \nEngland harried the All Blacks in Dunedin and Auckland with ultra-aggressive line-speed, stifling the passing of their opponents. However, they perhaps could have threatened the ruck more consistently over the course of the series. Underhill’s omission, while somewhat startling, may hint at a bid to impede the flow of New Zealand’s attack more regularly in a disciplined and accurate manner.\n\nInvariably, the attitude of asking for forgiveness rather than permission is the way to rule the breakdown at the top level. Borthwick has spoken about this trend quite openly. Put simply, as long as their jackallers adopt reasonable body positions, teams tend to be rewarded for committing to the contest and pressurising the ball.\nAustralian Angus Gardner is in charge on Saturday, and will need to scrutinise a fierce scrap on the deck. England will hope that spoiling helps them get off to a winning start.\n\n***Telegraph Sport's Charlie Morgan writes:***\n\nAmong the natural reactions to Sam Underhill’s absence [from the first England team of a pivotal autumn](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/10/29/englands-autumn-internationals-squad-live-borthwick-team/) was to wonder what injury he might have picked up in training. Because for the 28-year-old to be missing from a side featuring five back-rowers – six if you count Nick Isiekwe – is quite a shock.\n\nUnderhill had started all eight Tests in 2024 prior to this campaign. He has evidently worked on his breakdown spoiling, finishing second only to arch-poacher Will Evans for jackal turnovers per 80 minutes in the Premiership last season.\n\nWhen [England](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/england-rugby-union-team/) needed an emergency lock for a scrum against Wales after being reduced to 13 men, Underhill stepped up. Line-out jumping is another asset that he has honed and he seems more comfortable than ever on the ball. Remember his one-handed offload to Maro Itoje in the lead-up to George Furbank’s try against Ireland?\n\nThen again, Underhill does often appear to be more expendable than one might think for a player who is widely respected around the world and, when fit, has put in commanding performances at the top level since.\n\nHe was discarded from last year’s World Cup shake-up at an early stage, to the bare shock of colleague Ben Earl. His name was not among the 17 to receive an enhanced elite player squad contract on Friday. Clues have been there, though for him to be dropped entirely, from a side that has a six-two split of forwards on the bench, is still surprising.\n\n**Read more:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/10/29/reason-england-dropped-sam-underhill-new-zealand/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/10/29/reason-england-dropped-sam-underhill-new-zealand/)\n\nIf they'd rather someone who is more of a natural jackler then will Evans\n\nMaybe it’s just rotation, unlike at centre and lock we have a wealth of back row options that are all top quality and very evenly matched\n\nhttps://archive.ph/YG7QR\n\nSo you don’t need to click the Telegraph link\n\nor, teddy came out of the pram over central contracts?"

    "all_comment_text": "I don't blame either side. Willis has to look after his family first and foremost. He's earning a packet in France and playing in arguably the best club side in the world. If he were to come back to England under the current deal, a couple of untimely injuries before the international windows (assuming he'd be selected) and suddenly those appearance fees don't materialise and he doesn't make up the shortfall in salary.\n\nAs for the RFU, they're currently in negotiations over the new PGA with the English clubs and a big part of their demands is more access and control over England players, that would be damaged by then making exceptions for England players who they will have no control over in terms of their club game. The prem clubs are also demanding increased funding from the RFU in exchange for the greater control and one of their demands is keeping the current eligibility rules to stop a potential talent drain to France. Also from an RFU perspective and prem perspective, the product is more attractive to audiences if the England team players are playing in the competition, with a new broadcast deal in the offing, that's very important.\n\nI really hope Willis comes back to the prem in time for 2027 (I'd be a little surprised though) but imo it's not worth the damage it could do to the league and negotiations to make a special dispensation for him now. \n\nAlso, as fantastic as Willis is, I remember very similar conversations around Mercer who has since come back to England and can't make the squad despite being eligible.\n\nGreat points and I'm still scratching my head about Mercer. Willis really is an exception, though, he didn't have any choice in Wasps folding. I would make an exception for all ex Wasps players.\n\nTbf, Mercer has been, at best, 3rd best EQP 8 this season.\n\nId have extended the special circumstances rule for all wasps/Irish players though.\n\nAgreed\n\nOf course we want England to pick him, we're England fans who want the best players available, and we salivate at the possibilities that combinations of Willis, Earl, CCS, Curry, Underhill, (Over)Hill, Roots &amp; Barbary might bring. \n\nBut the decision is made by the RFU &amp; the club, and it's entirely a commercial decision. The 4 Prem semi-final DoRs were interviewed recently and were unanimous that they don't want that rule lifted. Their fears are obvious. They don't want their most marketable players disappearing off to France, Japan or whoever else pays them more. It's the same fear the Welsh, the Kiwis &amp; the Aussies have. We can't deny it's not valid. We see Willis benefiting from playing with some of the best players in the world. The club's see someone whose name they can't put on their replica shirts and Instagram posts.\n\nCentral contacts will resolve this...the risk for international players will drop a lot.\n\nWillis had the big scare in that Italy game. He saw his career end in that moment. He gets to play in the best supported league in a successful team. He'll come back to play for England I hope before the next WC.\n\nI'm hoping you're right\n\nI agree with the other comments. Every world class player is a few minutes from career ending or tournament denying injury at any given playing/training time. We cannot make global decisions based on one players exceptionality that might destroy the league or playing pool in the UK. The player needs their income protected against those injury risks and the league needs protecting so it does not get destroyed. We cannot risk the entirety of a team sport that needs an actively developing pool for any one player."

    "all_comment_text": "Initial thoughts are something like: \n\n1. **Genge:** stand out loosehead in the current squad.\n2. **George/Cowan-Dickie:** straight shoot out for me between the two experienced hookers.\n3. **Stuart:** one of the few positives from this autumn, he's cemented his place as first choice tighthead.\n4. **Itoje (c):** goes without saying, and I'd make him captain too. He's been doing it in the latter half of games for a while, and he's an 80 min player unlike George.\n5. **Martin:** again, nailed on.\n6. **Chessum (Hill/Coles if not fit):** Chessum has been very good for England. If he isn't fit, I'd back either Hill or Coles to do that role.\n7. **Earl:** we need to support Earl with more carriers. Think a move back to 7 and a slight reduction in responsibilities would help him. \n8. **CCS/Willis/Fisilau:** Eight is up in the air for me. There are a few competing for it. CCS might have the nod currently given he's proven he can carry at test level, and we need carriers.\n9. **Mitchell:** he was coming into his own for England anyways, but he's been missed this autumn.\n10. **M Smith:** I think some of the criticism of him after Japan has been very harsh.\n11. **Sleighthome:** Room to work defensively, but a pacey try threat is always needed.\n12. **Dingwall:** nearest to a specialist 12 we have, and I think he only needs to be a 7/10 to open up the rest of the backs.\n13. **Lawrence:** last chance saloon. Poor performance and he's binned for Beard or Freeman.\n14. **Feyi-Waboso:** same as Sleighthome, you need try scoring threats.\n15. **Furbank:** give him second playmaker duties and get that Mitchell - Smith - Furbank axis working again.\n16. **Dan/Langdon/Oghre:** We need to start bringing through the next generation of hookers - the sub can be the best one available.\n17. **Baxter:** training on well.\n18. **Opoku-Fordjour/Heyes:** again, need to bring through fresh faces.\n19. **Batley/Tuima:** need a hefty tighthead lock on the bench to ensure we have Scrum security as the game goes on.\n20. **Underhill:** makes and impact when he plays. \n21. **Open:** I can't call it.\n22. **Fin Smith:** Backing the younger player, we do have to eventually transition away from Ford.\n23. **Freeman:** Covers the whole back line and 13.\n\nLove that. Very balanced.\n\nId have whoever of Hill/Chessum isn't starting at 19. And CCS on bench at20\n\nA proper 12 (Dingwall, Ojomoh etc.) with either one of the wingers or Freeman at 23 (too early for my Freeman at 15 masterplan)\n\nI'm not sure about Hill as lock cover and CCS on the bench. I'd be tempted to start one with Chessum on the bench to give it more balance. We lost so much power with the bench this series, and I think Chessum off the bench keeps the pressure on more than messing around with the pack after 60mins and  having a tired Chessum switching into lock\n\nI swapped them around a bit. Given the mess our defense is, I went for experience in the starting 15.\n\nI'd love to see T Willis or T Hill just to add some more ballast and carrying to the backrow, other than that I like your team bro looking good\n\nHave I missed some news? Seeing Willis mentioned a lot here - is he leaving Toulouse for the Prem?\n\nMissed the existence of his brother Tom, also formerly Wasps, who plays 8 and is brilliant\n\nThank you!\n\nWrong Willis.\n\nWe're on about Tom.

But I like it\n\nA bit of a baptism of fire for either and harsh to drop CCS but it's more an expression of frustration at neither of them getting game time this autumn really.\n\nGenge\n\nGeorge\n\nStuart\n\nItoje\n\nMartin\n\nUnderhill\n\nEarl\n\nT Willis\n\nMitchell\n\nFord\n\nManny\n\nDingwall \n\nLawrence\n\nFreeman\n\nFurbank\n\n\nBench -LCD, Baxter, AOF, Chessum, CCS, Curry, JVP, M Smith\n\n\nI'll explain the changes/controversial ones.\n\nM Smith has been great individually but has shown an inability to get the outside backs going. As a 10 you have to take some responsibility for that. I think commentary mentioned it too but because F Smith is more structured and conventional you could see the backs outside him were more dangerous and had more touches. [This article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/11/22/marcus-smith-england-10-analysis-steve-borthwick/) from Charlie Morgan discusses it at length.\n\nEarl has been good but not great. I think he's fatigued from the amount of involvements he's had. I would add T Willis to share the load around the fringes and let Earl do more things wider in space. Willis is also a lineout forward so helps there.\n\nUnderhill is an essential in this pack. You need your best tacklers in there to kill momentum early on and let the blitz get on top.\n\nFord is the best game manager and runs the attack for the entire team the best. Also this team needs experience to close out games.\n\nDingwall comes in for Slade. We don't have an outstanding 12 so I've picked someone who will do the dirty work and unseen work to allow Lawrence to be the superstar he is in wider channels. Also, he's a great defender and communicator so will help in that area.\n\nChessum at 6 is a temptation but I think the back row is too loaded and the 2nd row is relatively weaker. Being able to bring a powerful carrier on like him will help close games. 6 2 split is a risk but to add to that point again we need to be able to overpower teams. It's just a key fundamental if the Borthwick game plan. Think we have enough versatility in the backs to get away with the 62.\n\nI enjoyed reading your post, I disagree with your ideas!\n\nI love Ford, think he's a quaility player. But I don't think you can lay the blame for England's misfiring attack on Marcus. He's been quality, and that Fin Smith looked good agianst a tired Japan doesn't show anything to me. If England want to play this agressive style looking for turnovers, Marcus is the best 10. he's also the  best defensive ten we have. As much as I rate Charlie Morgan, even the examples he gives seem odd to me. At least one was down to the quality of the pass to Smith, and as much of the issue is, in my mind, the way they are trying to play not the ten. For example, against the ABs the plan was clearly to kick the ball a heap in teh first sixty, same as SA. it's not surprising Smith passed the ball to Furbank less.\n\nI'd be happy with Earl at seven, Willis at 8. But I think you need a proper Line out forward at six these days, and we really missed that even with CCS there. So It's Chessum or Hill for me. And I'm not sure you can drop Underhill right now.\n\nI'd be happy with Dingwall at 12. tbh. And I agree we could do a 6-2 effectivly.\n\nI wouldn't blame him solely no. But I don't see how you can excuse him when nothing happens outside of him with the talent available. if we still had Faz at 12 I'd be happy to start him. But the phase attack just doesn't get going when it's just him there and not an organiser type 10. The Japan game is one example but I think you saw the same both times Ford came on too. The SA game was the only game we looked confused or frantic chasing the game and there was no organiser 10 on.\n\nAlso Fin is the best defensive 10. He's a lot bigger than Marcus and he legit bangs blokes. There's been a few games over the years where he's been saints top tackler.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ofmeziju03e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f8fdb41370eb2eee4f745d3fd965e0b242eaffa\n\nYeah Borthwick is never gonna change the gameplan. Which is another reason why I think Ford/Fin are better fits.\n\nT Willis is like 6'4 so bringing him at 8 mitigates the need for a lineout 6. He'd be like. Keiran Read type jumping 8.\n\nId say Marcus cover defense is key for England right now..saved multiple tries this autumn.\n\nAlex goode made a good point. He said both Smiths rely on more of a cobtrolling 9 (Mitchell) and England don't have that right now. I do think we are 'cursed' with quality tens, so people are always wondering if the other one will work. There has been lots of times Faz, as good as he is, didn't get the backs moving too.\n\nPersonaly, if you have a ten that can break through international defenses, you keep him. As much as I rate the others.\n\nMaybe you are right about Willis in LO, but I just think you need someone a little better in the air (but I wouldn't cry if they tried him at all, CCS hasn't been terrible there, just think it limits back of the line out ball).\n\nListening to Goode now and he isn't really talking about defence when he mentions backfield. He initially talks about kick return stuff or counter attacking stuff and that's when he praises Marcus\n\nI wasn't either. Should have put a para in.\n\nDefense and the controlling nine were separate points\n\nI don't think Marcus is a good cover defender. He's quick and brave but he makes a lot of wrong reads.\n\nI'd disagree tbh. F Smith definitely runs the show at Saints. He does however have a great feel of when to go himself to generate momentum.\n\nWe've also had some of our best attacking performances ever with Faz in the team. I think people confuse gameplan with ability a lot.\n\nI'd keep Marcus in the 23 because he has that moments of magic. But there's a whole backline division out there too. You're a better team if you can get everyone going Vs just Marcus.\n\nBorthwick managed to make it work with a Vunipola Curry Underhill back row. Earl for Curry and Willis for Billy is in upgrade in that regard.\n\n1. Finn Baxter \n2. Luke Cowan Dickie \n3. Will Stuart\n4. Maro Itoje(C)\n5. George Martin\n6. Chandler Cunningham South\n7. Sam Underhill\n8. Ben Earl\n9. Alex Mitchel (ideally playing 80 the autumn series showed how much we need him)\n10. Finn Smith\n11. Ollie Sleightholme\n12. Freddie Steward \n13. Ollie Lawrence \n14. Manny Feyi- Waboso\n15. Marcus Smith\n16. Theo Dan\n17. Ellis Genge\n18. Asher Opoku- Fourdjour\n19. Ollie Chessum\n20. Tom Curry\n21. Harry Randal\n22. Tommy Freeman (covering centre if Freddie Steward Isn’t working)\n23. George Furbank\n\n1. Genge 2. LCD 3. Stuart 4. Itoje 5. Chessum (c) 6. CCS 7. Underhill 8. Earl\n\nThink George has played really well. But we need to be realistic. Are him and Cole going to make the next WC. Probably not. Think Chessum has been unreal this season when fit. Also think he’d make a good captain. Tempted to put him at 6 but then lacking some grunt off the bench which has been a real weakness.\n\n9. Mitchell 10. M Smith 11. Sleightholme 12. Lawrence 13. Freeman 14. IFW 15. Steward\n\nBit of a risk in the backs with no secondary playmaker. Maybe Slade at 13 if he’s fit and firing in the premiership. \n\n16. Dan 17. AOF 18. Fasogbon 19. Martin 20. T Willis 21. JVP 22. F Smith 23. Slade\n\nMix of experience and new guns on the bench. We really need to be bringing through the next generation of props.\n\nI can see Chessum as captain. Although id probably go Maro in this scenario.\n\nCan't get behind Steward over Furbank.\n\nAOF at LH over Baxter. Not sure I agree. \n\n\nLike the side, although id maybe put Hill at six and CCS on the bench. Although I see why you've gone the other way.\n\nI agree with the starting 15. I’d go LCD, AFO, Baxter, Batley, CCS, Willis, Randall, Northmore.\n\nFasogbon needs some more senior matches under his belt IMO. Everyone raved about his Bristol performance and it was good in parts but he didn’t get it all his own way by far. I worry that would be exposed and he has plenty of time to learn his craft.\n\nI love Ford and F Smith and I actually like Smith moving to 15 at times but having another fly half on the bench feels like a waste. It’s slightly risky but Furbank can cover if needed. Slade is probably the more sensible option but Northmore can have an impact especially with Smith staying at 10.\n\nI like the bold 6-2 call. But swap Hill for Batley,imo?\n\nNorthmore a good shout for cover too.\n\nAh Ted Hill? My mind went to Jonny for some reason. I like Ted and know he can cover lock but I feel we need a proper heavy lock to come on for Martin. We’re asking him and Itoje to do a massive amount of work and it’s one of the reasons our scrum fades in the last 20.\n\nTight head and Loosehead the wrong way round.\n\nI think I’d prefer F Smith to M Smith at 10. I feel like he can deal with the baptism of fire and while he would create less magic than Marcus individually, he would open up more for the rest of the team, if that makes sense.\n\n1.Baxter [2.George](http://2.George) 3.Stuart 4.Itoje (c) 5.Martin 6.Chessum 7.Underhill 8.CCS\n\n9.Mitchell 10.M Smith 11.Sleightholme 12.Steward 13.Freeman 14.IFW 15.Furbank\n\n16.Langdon 17.Genge 18.AOF 19.Kpoku 20.Turry 21.Earl 22.JvP 23.F Smith\n\nExceptional circumstances argument to get Junior Kpoku in and capped. If Turry's injury issues persist, then I'd fast track Pollock ahead of Hill, Pearson or Tom Willis. Likewise, I'd have Fasogbon in the training squad ahead of Davison, Heyes, etc.\n\nWow.  \n\nDouble converted centers. Bold. Choice.\n\nI reckon Steward should be given a year to convert.\n\nNo Earl? Id have him above T Curry as a bench option. \n\nCCS twice,btw.\n\nI love a lot of this though\n\nSorry. Earl was meant to be on the bench. I'll amend my post!\n\nObviously, it's out there. I think we need a centre who can get over the gain line though and IMO Steward is our best back for that. Jordie moved to 12 for NZ before playing there in Super Rugby. Henshaw was exclusively a 13 and 15 for Connacht when he became Ireland's first choice 12. Jamie Roberts first game as a 12 was for Wales.\n\nFreeman has played 13 for Saints and switched there for England midgame. Also, I think wing is the toughest position to defend in this system rather than 13. So that isn't as big a switch. I'd prefer Marchant there, but, Top 14 and rules.\n\nI just don't rate the Prem inside centre options that highly. Dingwall is a decent all-round player but has nowhere near the physicality for 12 in the current game IMO. I know he's nicknamed M1 at Saints because of his hard shoulders. Let's be real though. Standout defensive 12s at international level are built like back rows. Dingers is built like a budget scare crow. He's so slight that his head looks like it's nearer the camera than the rest of his upper body. I'd love to be proved wrong. I just don't see it myself. Before folk say I'm being harsh, I feel almost the exact same about Dan Kelly and I'm a Tigers fan. Decent club players but I just don't see what part of their game allows them to impact international rugby.\n\nI do think Steward should be made into a 12. I'd just give him the six nations off to do it with prem cup games and what not.\n\nOnly issue is, it would take time away from Woodward."

Maybe Powell should have started?\n\n**Overall Team Review - Scotland Match**\n\nWell that, was much better. Just a side note it's interesting to see the other 2 results this weekend, in particular, the Ireland vs Wales game. Shout out to Scotty Bemand, doing a very good job with Ireland, only 3 games in. We face them next. Wales... well it's looking like a 0 from 5 season, and the potential not to qualify for the world cup as it stands. Played their cup final against us, and it's not done them any good. If anyone gets to see D'Inca's second try for Italy, it's a must watch finish.\n\nThat was, a dicking. Now I don't mean in terms of the scoreboard, or whether I want to dwell on Scotland being unable to clear their lines effectively, I meant in terms of possession, territory and game management. We had a better read of the game situation from minute one in this game, unlike against Wales. Wales offered far more physicality than Scotland did, and the likes of Evie Gallagher and Malcolm who were so effective against France (who were rubbish) couldn't do a thing against the English backrow today. I don't think it's appreciated how good their attitude and work application is, from the start to the end. Other teams do genuinely struggle with it, but the mentality to keep a high intensity at pace, in that weather, and be so aggressive in the collision, win any collision they could and force positive events was impressive.\n\nIn terms of player performances, Ellie was given WOTM and I can't really argue with it but I had it slightly differently in terms of positive contributions towards the scoreline. Hannah Botterman, crowd favourite she is, was excellent all over the pitch. I think she gave one penalty at the breakdown early in the first half, which was unlucky but every collision she won, every tackle she sent her opposite number backwards, her work in the scrum was excellent. Wonderful platform for the team to use and create chances.\n\nAitchison's game management across the field was excellent, manipulating space and marshalling the girls into the right areas of the field. Breach possibly having her best 6 nations performance, excellent in the air, 2 good finishes, the 2nd was brilliant and she's coming into her own. Ellie was Ellie and Abbie was Abbie, every girl played very well and produced a good performance.\n\nAs for criticisms, few too many knock ons and handling errors, Rosie in particular from memory struggled. The discipline is a tough one - so England pride themselves on getting off the line ala SA men's side, in your face, close space, close the time the opposition have to make a decision and put their skills under pressure. Split second decisions but Cokayne was on the wrong side of them. Not an issue for her but that's 2 red cards, so it's going to take some time for the girls to upskill to this style of play, whilst maintaining discipline and structures. Thought our locks were a bit ineffective and whilst I thought our backrow went very, very well, Zoe at 6 I'll need to see for several games before making a call on whether I like it or not. For now... eh? I'm not sure of the overall upside to the team?\n\n**Ending Thoughts**\n\n3 from 3. Combinations coming together in certain areas, backs in particular are starting to gel slowly and it looks a nice balance. Meg Jones is a lovely addition as a footballer in midfield. Oddly I think Hunt suits this style more than Packer right now. As I said after the Italy game and then sadly I skipped the Wales game, the more time together the better we will get. It's about upskilling the girls to play a faster style of play, somewhat similar to a men's England or South African international side. The girls play a more attritional style mostly, in the Premier Women's 15s and if we are to persist, we need to give the coaching staff and players leeway.\n\nUp next Ireland. They had a fantastic result and looked great against Wales, but Wales offered quite literally nothing. Ireland had no test in defence against them. I expect in front of a home crowd of 50k at Twickers, and England getting better and better, hopefully in spring sunshine, we'll hit 70 or 80. I don't mean that disparagingly but we were a few knock ons, a few disallowed tries away from that with 14 girls in this game. Expect a few changes, perhaps in the back 5 of the pack again and maybe Packer at 9, but other than that, more of the same and better end product is all that's needed. Perhaps just time.\n\nThings look bright. Hope you all have a good week, and good luck to anyone who's got tickets to Ireland this weekend. It's going to be a treat.\n\nMC",

    "body": "\n\n\n\nI'm 14. I'm from Leicestershire and missed the Tigers DPP. Rugby is my passion, I always wanted to play professionally but I thought I was just being a stupid kid with dumb, unrealistic aspirations however now i'm realising i have a decently big chance. I'm being told there will be other opportunities but I literally have no knowledge of the 'other opportunities'. I've been playing since I was 7, I'm 6'3, ~80kg and play as a lock. I'm decently big and I'm also very fast (faster than a lot of my team's backs xD). I've been told by opposition coaches plenty of times that I am extremely talented for my age (although I have no idea how true it is).\n\nAnyway, now you know a bit about me let's get onto the question. \n\nConsidering the fact I missed the DPP (wasn't given an opportunity as my school doesn't have a team and my club's coaches selected their own kids) I need to know when these 'other opportunities' I'm being told about will be available to me and a bit of information about them. As I said, rugby is my passion and i NEED to know how i can get to play professionally.\n\n\n\nAfter a lot of nagging, my school has finally set up a team however I'm still too late for the DPP. We are going to be playing in the county cup so will there be any opportunities tied to this?\n\n\n\n\nAny help/advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks :)",

    "all_comment_text": "If you’re 6’3 and rapid then maybe have a think about changing positions. Leicester historically produce the best locks in england so making it there as a lock will be incredibly hard. Theres a shortage of big 12s in england so no doubt scouts will be looking for them so switching to 12 could be worth considering.\n\nFair enough. I did want to move to centre because I'm a very strong runner. I'll speak to my coaches about it\n\nDon’t rule out changing clubs either.\n\nI love my club and even if i wanted to move my parents wouldnt let me because A) i've been there for 7 nearly 8 years and B) They have very close friends there, as do i\n\nYour parents aren’t playing, you are. If you have inspiration to play in a position that your current club won’t let you, then you only have one choice. 6ft3 isn’t tall enough for a top level lock and that’s that unfortunately. There’s nothing wrong with being a solid club player, the game is built on those guys but if you want more you’ll need to switch. Even if it’s just to 6.\n\nthat's understandable.Because of my speed i'm going to speak to my coaches about moving to centre. Thank you :)\n\nLook at Coventry and other championship sides, they often have open trials for their academy thats how I got into academy rugby and thats actually how Tom Ball came through who currently is one of their best players. Obvs thats not prem but its a start, and if your as good as you say youll be able to be seen from there.\n\nOkay thank you :)\n\nI’m more familiar with the Scottish system but have a friend who plays second row professionally so can give some advice.\n\nBased on what you’ve said I’m guessing you’re not at a private school, which makes it more difficult to get noticed but not impossible. Keep training and make sure you play your best in games, especially in cups or tournaments as there are likely going to be scouts or coaches there who might try to poach you for their team. If you can somehow get a scholarship to a school with an established rugby team I think that would massively boost your chances of making it to an academy.\n\nObviously you’re still growing but it sounds like you’re at a pretty good size for your age. If you make it to 6,6-6,8 by the time you’re 16-17 and weigh well over 100kgs and have the strength to back it up it’ll be pretty hard not to get noticed tbh, whether it’s by a better club or a school.\n\nFor now, I’d stick with it, keep training hard (especially fitness - having an excellent bronco time would definitely be helpful) and look at getting into proper rugby focussed weight training, avoid bodybuilding type training as that really isn’t going to help you with your rugby.\n\nThank you!\n\nThere's always chances further down the line, you could get in county teams, or your college might have a team, and if you go uni you can get picked up from there. Just keep grafting and (if you're lucky) it could happen\n\nThanks :)\n\nUni BUCS league is looked at closely, Alex Dombrandt and Luke Northmore both went to Quins from Cardiff BUCS\n\nI'm pretty sure Ross Vintcent was/is at Exeter uni and got called up for Italy this 6 nations\n\nHave a look at the RFU ACE league and aim to go to a college that offers it, that is after your GCSEs when your 16. You'll have access to great coaches and very competitive fixtures that will improve your development. Good luck!\n\nOkay, thank you :)\n\nThe harsh reality of professional sport is that very few people get to play, and there are other factors other than talent that decide whether you get to play like luck or connections. \n\nI've got no advice other than to keep playing and train well in terms of your skills and fitness and take any opportunities if they come your way.\n\nFair enough. Thank you :)\n\nGreat advice given so far, and not something I can add too. However, I hate when the club coaches put their own kids forward!\n\nIts so frustrating because they're not even good players. The only player they put through that wasn't their own was our 10 who is very very good.\n\nIdentify local private schools that are serious about rugby, identify the rugby coach and the head of sport and write them a letter laying out who you are and what you want to do. Ask them if they will meet you and give you some advice. See what happens. Be frank about your situation, listen with open ears to anything (if anything) you get back, but you don't have to agree or do what they say if it feels a bad fit. \n\nOn the other hand - you never know. I know a lad who did this for cricket and got a scholarship. His state school didn't think he was all that at it either.\n\nThank you :D I'll definitely try this\n\nJust spent a quick few minutes on google trying to find good private schools for rugby near me... any idea how to identify them?\n\nLook for head or director of rugby on the school website. If you can’t find any contact details on the website you could try LinkedIn\n\njust looked at one near me... its literally a coach of my club's adult first team (who's head coach happens to be my dads mate... i think i just hit the jackpot)\n\nWell, just get a chat, make contact, don't over load or over index at this point. But - be respectful, pay attention and if it's not a good message ask for what you can do to get further. Remember, that kind of input can help you with the next conversation.\n\nfair enough. thank you :D\n\nJust keep playing rugby. I have experience with Sarries and Saints DPP processes, there is always more opportunities and they do watch matches and scout outside of the DPP. Good work on getting your school to put you forward, it maybe to late for this season but should be right for next.\n\nThat said, next year's DPP will come soon enough, so make sure you enjoy and get the most out of the rest of the season. Keep working on your basic rugby skills. Also work on communication and work rate as well. It'll come together in time and hopefully, you'll go straight to the PDG.\n\nThe only other thing I can suggest is play for a club team that is in the highest league you can find. For example league 1 games often run at a much faster pace and with more skill than league 4 matches.\n\nGreat! Thank you :D"

    "all_comment_text": "HEAR ME OUT. You mentioned that Marcus is the absolute key to our attack, yet also said how good George Ford is. Ben talked about putting Marcus at 15 and Freddie Steward on the wing to keep his aerial game, but I've had a thought that's a bit left field,\n\nWhy don't we try Marcus at 13? He's got the wheels to gas a defender on the outside, brave in defence, and still in a position to distribute to the back 3. He could still be the option out the back of an arrow head, or the next receiver outside of that to make the next pass.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n![gif](giphy|ukGm72ZLZvYfS)\n\n![gif](giphy|26ufdipQqU2lhNA4g)\n\nThe problem with being open minded is if you open your mind too much, your brain falls out. \n\nThis is a properly mental idea.\n\nI don't know what's so mental about it, I think it could work. What's the actual downside?\n\n1. He's been easily our best player so far this autumn at 10 meanwhile Ford has been dreadful in the minutes he's played. Why would you change it?\n\n\n2. Whilst his defence is a lot better than people give him credit for, he is in no way physical enough to defend in the most important position on the pitch.\n\n\n3. We have bucket loads of decent options at 13. Lawrence, Beard, Lozowski, Freeman etc who regularly play there (and play very well) for their clubs. What we're missing are 12s.\n\n\n4. He has *never* played 13 before.\n\nFord isn't a finisher I don't think. And irrespective, he won't be around much longer, and I like the way that Fin Smith plays. He has a lot of cohesion with the other Saints in the back line and offers a second playmaker option. \n\nLozowski should be nowhere near any England squad. Over 30 and having a decent patch at your club doesn't make up for years of being OK. What's he going to bring now? Nothing new, that's for sure.\n\nI know it's a bit out of the box, but it's just a different take. His skill set sits nicely in what's required of a 13. And we've played him out of position before, in a World Cup game of all things. Don't tell me about the opposition, the requirements of the position are the same.\n\nI personally don't see the downside. He's on the pitch, in a position where he's still able to have a massive part of the attack. Why not? We need a bit of out the box thinking sometimes!\n\nMarcus is a 10 we need to stop swapping people about out of positions. I hate utility backs and they are awful to watch. Steward is dog shit and his only pro is that he can catch high balls, that’s it. He’s poor in defence and poor in attack. He brings nothing to the match day squad. I’d rather us keep our attacking wingers like Sleightholme and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso all day long! Ford has had his time good and bad and we should be pushing the young blood through now.\n\nSteward really isn’t dog shit. He lacks a bit of gas but offers plenty in attack. He has scored a decent number of tries for England and always makes meters. His defence is also decent and his positioning is usually spot on.\n\nThis is a terrible idea.        \n      \n10 and 13 are really different positions. They require different skill sets and also different body build. So different than usually 12 can play 13 never 10. Centers need to be big and quick. 12 bigger but 13 quicker.      \n      \nMarcus Smith would just be destroyed in defense and would not have the natural speed to evade defenders in attack.\n \nI don't remember a single professional rugby player who played outside center and fly half.       \nLevani Botia played inside center 12 and flanker.      \nGiteau played inside center and fly half.\n\nAgree to disagree!\n\nMarcus at 13 would be exploited by attacking coaches, he is brave in defence for sure but not his strong point, which is fine for a 10 but not a 13, he bites in a bit too often and also isn’t physically imposing (again all fine for a 10)\n\nSlade isn't big at 13 either, I don't think his size is an issue.\n\nslade is one of the leading experts in the team on playing the blitz defence, so there is quite a significant difference. I also dislike using Slade as i think he lacks physicality, for me the solution is find another strong running fast ball player. We have huge talent in the Prem so shoving people into new places isn’t necessary\n\nWell he's not strong running, but that's what I'd want from a 12.but he's definitely a ball player. If though, I'm theory, he wanted to do it and committed to making the change at club level too, would you feel differently then? So that he's not \"shoved in\"? I can't believe this is being received so badly!"

There’s no way Borthwick is going to go full experimental, if he lose to Japan that’s him sacked. It’s too early for Pollock and it’s not like we have a bad backrow at the moment, expecially with Curry back in contention. I’d like to see Willis but also I don’t want him to get injured in a nothing match, hoping he gets picked for the 6 nations though.\n\nAgreed. I don't want there to be wholesale changes really. Maybe 3 or 4. I think the lads are in desperate need of going out and putting in a performance for their own confidence more than anything else.\n\nI'd bring in Ted Hill, play anyone but Slade, slot Furbank back in and give Fin Smith some long overdue minutes. Other than that, I'd probably keep it pretty much the same.\n\nI would like to see Willis though but then again I'm not a SarrIes fan!\n\nI agree - if England had won anything this autumn I think they'd be some experiments, but right now no chance.\n\nBack row is too competitive to catapult him in. If anyone it would be T Willis because I think his position and skillset is needed more.\n\nWould be a good time to rest Earl and give B Curry a start too.\n\nAlso with some if the disjointedness we've seen I think too many changes would be the worst thing to happen."

It may be an affront to history but the so-called feeble Australian scrum was superior for much of the game and really could have been awarded a winning penalty on two or three occasions in the drama of the closing stages.\n\nRead the rest: [https://www.thetimes.com/sport/rugby-union/article/england-australia-report-result-sleightholme-autumn-internationals-score-85gxdgfp8](https://www.thetimes.com/sport/rugby-union/article/england-australia-report-result-sleightholme-autumn-internationals-score-85gxdgfp8)\n\nGlad to read this, as an England fan I came out of that game disappointed but exhilarated after a thrill ride, give me that over a 9-6 win on penalties any time. Fun, dynamic performances on both sides.\n\nTime for Borthwick to consider his position...\n\nWe just don't have it anymore.

    "all_comment_text": "Twickenham is fun, you'll need to get there early to get 10 pints in, the beer will be expensive,  but bearable, but at least the burger vans are expensive too so it keeps it standard.\n\nThe nearest pub to the station is the cabbage patch or the William Webb Ellis across the road, the ground is a short walk from the station.\n\n At the ground there are bars and food joints, there is also the England rugby Store for your overpriced souvenirs.\n\nYou'll have a great time, fans on both sides are always in great humour win or lose\n\nIf you plan on getting there by train, be prepared. \n\nTwickenham is, for most of the year, a fairly small leafy suburb on the outskirts of London and has a fairly small leafy suburban railway station that is in no way designed to have 82,000 fans going through it. I'd recommend getting there early and don't be in any rush to leave after the game. \n\nI always prefer to drive these days because of it but obviously as a tourist that may be more difficult unless you have a hire car. Driving isn't so fun either as the queues to leave are grim but at least you're sat in a warm car rather than standing outside a cold station in the (probable) light rain with thousands of other people.\n\nDepending on where you are coming from, I think people should do Whitton, Richmond, Strawberry Hill or Fulwell and either walk or pub crawl.\n\nFree buses to Hounslow East too.\n\nI'm a resident! They Jack the prices up for restaurants around the train station. I would spend 5 minutes going into the centre and finding some nice places to eat.. Church street has good ones but you need to book now.\n\nOn the walk to/from the stadium take a moment to grab some food, my recommendation is the doughnut stall! It’s a family who run out of their driveway and I’ve been getting my sugar hit from them for 20 years now.\n\nAssuming you are coming in by rail, give yourself plenty of time to walk to the stadium, it can be slow going when the crowds are at their peak. On the way back, there are usually long queues. They move along, but you may want to just go to the pub for a bit instead. It’s all usually good-natured so no big deal.\n\nIf you’ve got your walking legs on, you might want to take the longer walk into Richmond on the way out. You can book in somewhere for dinner, like a traditional English curry perhaps.\n\nDon't bring a big bag, last time I went, we had to go and drop off the bags somewhere else. Not a big problem just time consuming\n\nAccept that it's going to cost you a fortune.\n\nAccept that you people will keep getting up in front of you to get beers or go to the toilet.\n\nAccept that Twickenham station will be rammed for several hours after the game so either stick around and drink late into the night or go to a different station.\n\nAccept that England will lose.\n\nOnce you've accepted the four above then you'll have a really good time.\n\nBTW, where are you staying? I live locally so I will be able to tell you if there is a better alternative to using Twickenham station.\n\nGet there early, head for your seat at least 45 mins before kick-off, you can always nip out to the concourse for a beer. Guinness was was about £8 a pint in February I think. There's a Spoons down the road for some cheaper drinks. \nDon't get too pissed and watch the game through one eye, We've all done it! \nHave a great day.\n\nTwickenham stadium has a good atmosphere on occasion (like AB’s games), as a matchday experience though it’s behind the times compared with the likes of Wembley etc. I would suggest hitting some of the local pubs earlier rather than getting to the ground too early and being forced to drink their overpriced sponsors’ brews. White Swan on the riverside is lovely, the ones closer to the main drag like Barmy Arms, Cabbage Patch etc are good fun if you can get in. Also the recent expansion of the railway station hasn’t really solved the logistical issues of getting so many fans back into London after the final whistle, so expect to be kettled for some time or head into Twickenham proper for a few hours to let the crowds dissipate. Or just jump an Uber (or walk along the river on light evenings) to Richmond and miss a lot of these inconveniences. It’s still a great day out, don’t get me wrong - just a shame my last visit was to watch us get destroyed by France pre-RWC…"

What pleased me was the cohesion. There was real intent in defence. Defence was nitted nicely with attack, Attacking fluidity I think is the biggest work on most women's sides can do, along with intensity, and the continuous selection of the backline, with Heard and Jones blossoming as a centre partnership, and the best back 3 by a mile in women's rugby currently. It's this fluidity in attack, the passing and correct decision making at the right time, picking the right options when it was on, that was the most promising thing about this match. It can be replicated again and again. Against anyone.\n\nI mean where to start. Scott Bemand said the first 20 mins were key. He was right, holy smokes we've struggled to get out the blocks early in each of the 3 matches prior, and I've always felt it was the continuity and fluidity/rhythm that were the issue rather than skill or intent. No slow down in the first half. Point a minute, much like the second half. Feel like we got our match intensity and emotion spot on for this particular game in front of 48k.\n\nIn terms of performances, every single one of them. I don't think I want to have a long team review because everyone was so bloody good, I could go on for eternity. Stand outs, in the pack... Zoe Aldcroft back to her brilliant best from 2020, and Alex Matthews who was outstanding as was Sadia Kabeya. In the backs, every bloody one of them. Kildunne was ridiculous, Dow is the most gifted rugby player in the side. She's one of the best at the breakdown, great decoy and running lines, silly fast, silly powerful, great decision making, uses the touchline to her advantage. She's a bit of a cheat code.\n\nThe centres is where it's most interesting. Heard and Jones for me are first choice due to getting a run of games together, and when fit off the bench will be Helena Rowland and Emily Scarratt, Big with good footballing skills and power, combined with pure brillance off the bench. Meg Jones, might be the find of this tournament though for England. She can do anything and her decision making along with her elusiveness is first class.\n\nIf I were to pick a fault, scrum was meh and lineout was meh... but frankly who cares.\n\n**Ending Thoughts**\n\n4 from 4. France up next. I expect for 50-55 mins this will be tense and very nerve racking. They have a massive point to prove and are desperate for any win. Away in Bordeaux, I think it'll be interesting to see if we can make this work away in France in a cauldron. If we can make it there, we'll make it work anywhere.\n\nOur skills will be under a lot more pressure from the likes of Konde? and Vernier. But if it clicks, the game will be over in a flash.\n\nSee you next week. A grand slam beckons.\n\nMC",

Memories are short on sport but the defence and attack were showing real signs of promise and improvement.\n\nWith the new staff in, new ideas or ways of doing things clearly have disrupted that progress.\n\nYip you can that they're not all totally up to speed with the blitz defence. Andy Goode was explaining that it's quite counterintuitive for a wing or a 15, especially if he's spent most of his career using a drift defence.  Btw  I missed the story of Felix Jones' departure. Given that they kept him on, albeit working remotely, suggests the RFU/Borthwick were mightily peeved about it.\n\nFor me you can see how he lacks direction with his squad selection \n\nCole, Marler, Dombrandt, Ford, Slade, George, Ewels, Isiekwe.\n\nThere are far better options and we just pick the same old players who aren't performing instead of getting the young guys in and getting them into the system. I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND HIM\n\nWhy pick Marler when he was going to retire before the match and can we stop picking Cole. He comes on for scrummaging and he's seriously not international level anymore\n\nHe comes on for scrummaging and struggles in the scrum he offers nothing else and never has. Its a bit of an indictment if he's one of our best props. \n\nLook at Australia, which aren't known for world class props, with Bell and Tupou who are wrecking balls in defence and carrying the ball.\n\nHow can England, with its money and playing population, not be able to put 4 international-level props out on match day? It boggles the mind. How many could France/South Africa/New Zealand select right now?\n\nWhere's Fasogbon, Ted Hill, Joe Heyes, Henry Pollock, Atkinson, McParland, Dingwall or Roebuck? The old guard your Marler, Cole, Ford, Slade should have been flushed out after the last world cup and yet Borthwick picks players that aren't international calibre anymore. \nI've certainly had enough of the Dombrandt experiment as well. Complete waste and simply not a Rose. \nThose in the England A SHOULD have been blooded in by now\n\nAll of those calls don't make sense you are dead right.\n\nBad time to be an England *and* United fan. \n\nI get to have my weekend ruined twice. Sometimes on the same day.\n\nIt's efficient, if nothing else\n\nLaptop coach.\n\nBorthwick is starting to look more and more like Gareth Southgate. A figure who came in time of turbulence, helped bring stability into the team, had a reasonable world cup campaign, but you overall have massive doubts about him having the ability to get England where they want to go to! "

Feels like we have too much talent to fit in at times!\n\nMissing Underhill is a big pain of mine as he’s one of my favourite players, but like you said the talent at our disposal at the moment is overwhelming. Arundell… meh to be perfectly honest, we know he has pace but I’ve never see him do ANYTHING else, unlike a prime Stockdale or maybe a better comparison is Will Jordan\n\nAgreed love Underhill, I feel like Arundell just needs game time and he has the potential to be one of the greats, done some great things in France recently too! I would love Freeman in the centres with Lawrence, back line of Arundell, IFW, and Furbank. That’s a dangerous and pacey back 3!\n\nBoys, I've looked at the teams so far. \n\nFarrell would play. \n\nHe's epic. You don't like him. He rode out Jones, he dragged England to WC23 semis. \n\nHe's got to be in this team.\n\nHe's just a shit Jonny Wilkinson.\n\nTo be fair, that's quite a complement. \n\nI wish someone would say that about me. \n\nMy wife says other things, they are hurtful.\n\nProbably not too dissimilar to Saturday's team tbh \n\nGenge \n\nGeorge\n\nStuart \n\nItoje\n\nMartin \n\nCCS/Chessum \n\nWillis \n\nEarl \n\nMitchell \n\nSmith \n\nFreeman \n\nLawrence \n\nSlade \n\nIFW \n\nFurbank \n\nBench \n\nDan (not overly sold on him but not many other options)\n\nBaxter \n\nCole \n\nChessum/CCS\n\nT Curry \n\nSpencer \n\nFord/Smith \n\nSleightholme\n\nGet slade out of your team, he's dreadful\n\nOverseas: Jack Willis is the only player I would bring in.\n\nCurrent injuries: Mitchell, Chessum, Dingwall \n\nPeople who are available and haven’t been picked: Langdon and Hill\n\n1) Genge\n2) Dan\n3) Opoku-Fordjour\n4) Itoje\n5) Martin\n6) Jack Willis\n7) Tom Curry\n8) Chandler Cunningham-South\n9) Mitchell\n10) F Smith\n11) Freeman\n12) Lennox Anyanwu\n13) Ollie Lawrence\n14) Feye-Waboso\n15) M Smith\n\nBench: LCD, Baxter, Stuart (until literally any top level TH is developed), \nChessum, Ted Hill, Spencer, Northmore, Sleighthome\n\nEdit: Random Reddit formatting cutting off half my post.\n\nNo Earl even on the bench is crazy, he’s consistently one of our best players and was one of the best players of the whole World Cup\n\nIt was tough to leave him out, but I feel that what he brings can be made up for by who is in. Curry's work rate is insane, and Willis and CCS's carrying are great. Willis and CCS are also lineout options, whereas Earl is a 7 playing 8.\n\nEngland also need to share the load of carrying a bit. Earl was by far our go-to carrier against NZ. Having Genge, Itoje, Willis and CCS as primary carriers is no bad thing.\n\nFair enough! For me Earl is significantly better than CCS (and I am a big fan of CCS) but to each their own, if we all thought the same thing life would be dull\n\nAbsolutely! I think Earl has amazing qualities no doubt, I just feel we now have an over reliance on him to spark something. But of course, what do I know?\n\nWoah some wildcards! Like it! I feel like come next World Cup, you may be quite accurate! I feel there are some very established players who will have to fall out of favour for this to happen though!\n\nI the forwards, I feel that gives us enough set piece, carrying and breakdown power. \n\nIn the backs, I like the idea of having both Smith's on the field at the same time. One's a hot-stepping, unpredictable playmaker, while the other has slick combinations with his Saints team mates.\n\nThe bench definitely brings dynamism and impact that I don't think we saw from the replacements on the weekend.\n\nAgreed! I think you almost need “better” players in a way to come off the bench and we just haven’t had that!\n\nI don't know if \"better\" is the phrase, but I feel they need to add something. For example I'd tell LCD and Hill to carry as much as possible to maximise the physicality they bring. Likewise with Chessum, his goal would be massive work rate at the breakdown in attack and defence.\n\nLooking back though, I may swap out Sleighthome for Furbank, only for his higher utility. It's a close one though.\n\nI just mean the last 20 minutes are more important than ever in international rugby, and having some pacey, hard hitting subs makes such an impact in games that are often quite close!\n\nAbsolutely. For the legendary status that Dan Cole has achieved, no ones thinking \"oh shit\" when he comes on. And I feel the combo of Isikwe and Dombrandt are easily eclipsed by Chessum and Hill. Spencer to add a cool head and control if needed. Randall looked way out of place trying to close a game out. It's just not his style.\n\nBang on!\n\nIf you know anyone in the England setup, I'm looking for work...\n\n😂😂\n\nI'd have beard over anyanwu\n\n1. Marler \n2. George\n3. Cole \n4. Itoje\n5. Martin\n6. Lawes \n7. J Willis\n8. Earl\n9. Spencer\n10. Farrell\n11. Freeman\n12. Lawrence\n13. Slade \n14. IFW\n15. Furbank \n\n16. LCD (2)\n17. Genge (1)\n18. Stuart (3)\n19. CCS (4/5/6)\n20. T Curry (7/8)\n21. Mitchell (9)\n22. M Smith (10/12/13/15)\n23. Sleighthomme (11/14)\n\nWould love a 6-2 bench, but think we’d be struggling if a winger went down and the starting pack have the ability to go 80. Just love the SA way of having close to a full pack coming on at 50 to destroy the opposition. This bench also covers 1-15 so you don’t have people out of position if someone gets injured.\n\nMarler &amp; Cole are the dream prop pair, I’m sure Joe would cancel his retirement for me (or I’d just clone him so he can play and be with his family)\n\nLawes is reliant on him being the same player he was before going to France, I’m sure he is but haven’t seen anything to say either way\n\nSpencer is my favourite English 9, think his control/kicking is second to none and gives Mitchell the chance to come on and add tempo at the end IF required \n\nThere’s a reason Farrell has the stats he has, if you set personal opinions aside you can’t deny he’s up there as one of England’s best 10s of all time\n\nSome proper old boys in your squad, dropping m Smith to the bench after yesterday's performance, naming retired players why?"

Lets take a look at who's coming through to keep an eye on.\n\nIdeally trying to get players around 25 with fewer than 5 caps, couple of exceptions here and there, but for the most part I'm trying to focus on players that have impressed me this season.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Position|Player |Club |Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Loosehead|Emmanuel Iyogun |Northampton|The big man is cooking, great showing in the last round looks great in the loose and at set piece |\n|Loosehead|Fin Baxter|Harlequins|Huge defensive shifts this season and I think he's well on his way to the top |\n|Hooker |Sam Riley |Harlequins|On the bench again, he's looked pretty good for my money his lineout throwing has been pretty good, I think he does look a bit like a Jack Walker 2.0, which is no bad thing |\n|Hooker|Seb Blake |Gloucester|I caught him a couple of times most recently against Sale and he's got tremendous workrate. Needs to work a bit on his fundamentals, but very promising|\n|Hooker |Curtis Langdon|Northampton |The guy is a beast, man of the match against Munster, it's nice to have stocks in a position|\n|Tighthead|Ehren Painter|Exeter Chiefs|I don't think he's it, but considering the paucity of options in his age bracket, he's got to be mentioned. Can being enormous make you a player? |\n|Lock |Rusi Tuima |Exeter Chiefs|Big man high workrate and good hands. I've got a thing for enormous locks and I think he can fulfill the large man backing up Martin role |\n|Back row |Greg Fisilau|Exeter Chiefs |The guy is a hype, on the bench again this week, but I think after such a busy season, he's earned a slightly less bruising time of it, I'm curious to see how he does against this Toulouse pack|\n|Back Row|Jack Clement|Gloucester|On the bench. but he's well worth a shout for 6, won the u20s 6 nations a couple of years ago, but has properly broken through this year high workrate and has a nose for the tryline|\n|Inside Centre|Seb Atkinson|Gloucester |He looks good, might be a couple of inches too short, but I think he has made a good enough case for being in the queue of 12s (I'd still take Hartley over him at the moment)|\n|Outside Centre |Oscar Beard|Harlequins |When he got called up to the 6 Nations squad I felt a bit vindicated, after watching him against the Ospreys I thought he looked like money and sure enough he's been great, difficult to catch and really good defensively|\n|Winger |Ollie Sleightholme|Northampton|He's the man, I don't need to say anything else |\n|Winger |Cadan Murley |Harlequins |Really promising, this Quins back three just don't stop, if they're going to beat Bordeaux, they will need all 3 unleashed |\n|Winger |George Hendy|Northampton|His two tries last week were superb, there's something very satisfying watching a ridiculously talented player bulldoze players like Crowley and Zebo|\n|Fullback |Josh Hodge|Exeter Chiefs |He's come back well from injury. As one user said get the Saints Strength and conditioning on him to just bulk up a little more and we're absolutely cooking. Good in the air, great counter attacker, I'm not sold on him as a second playmaker, but Borthwick has shown the ability to chop and change as needed, so  I think he's kicking about in his thoughts|\n\nObviously it's not everyone playing if there's anyone else you feel I should add give us a shout, who are you looking forward to watching? \n\nAlso any suggestions on layout etc. greatly appreciated!

I liked by club and position! \n\nSide note he's having a good game isn't he?\n\nHe is. Always nice when you back a player and he proves you right.\n\nLove the table.\n\nFrom an England prospect perspective im most interested to see how the front five players go against the French teams. If they can mix it with them, they can probably play test level.\n\nWould love to see Hodge do well in defense, too.\n\nTuima against Meafou is going to leave a crater,.\n\nBaxter is the one I'm most excited to see against that Bordeaux pack. If he doesn't get mulched I think he gets the fast track to England this year.\n\nIt's one of the great things about Europe. If a young player can handle the physicality of a top team, they can probably step up\n\nI know this is England prospect review. But too early to put Fin Baxter down for the lions?"

Every time I engage with it I feel dirty\n\n***Warren Gatland writes exclusively for The Telegraph:***\n\nThe [autumn Test series](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/0/autumn-internationals-2024-fixtures-nations-series-watch-tv/) before a British and Irish Lions year represent the first major testing ground for the players. In the previous three tours when I was Lions head coach, I would already be drawing up a long list of potential selections. I am sure Andy Farrell is doing something similar.\n\nThe players will want to have a good autumn campaign and the guys who are injured will want to get back in for the start of the Six Nations Championship, which will be the main platform for them to perform and impress. There will be a second bite of the cherry for players who are involved with their clubs in the knock-out stages but by then the bulk of the selection is likely to be settled.\n\nYou would have to say there is likely to be a large contingent of Ireland players in the squad and deservedly so because of the way they have been performing and as the world’s No 1 side right now. There could be anything from 15 to 20 Ireland players on a Lions tour, which would be remarkable. That is exciting for them, but also brings pressure. Not performing in the Six Nations could cost them a few places. That is what is fascinating about the next six months.\n\nTo get the ball rolling, having looked at the summer games, I have picked two players from each of the four home nations who have impressed me and who I think have a very good chance of making the touring party, for differing reasons.\n\n# England\n\n**Marcus Smith**  \nI have always been a big fan of his anyway but he has matured. His game balance and understanding is starting to come at the top level. He is still a real running threat and incredibly skillful but it is hard for people to understand how important the kicking game is at international level. I went and watched Bristol against Gloucester a couple of weekends ago and it was a fantastic game but one with very few competing kicks. At Test level, where everyone is bigger, stronger and more skilful, the game can become very attritional and that is when you have to get your kicking strategy right. \n\nHe is thriving having had a run of games with England too. I sometimes get criticised for being a bit stoic and not showing emotion but that is not who I am. I love seeing players who are different, and players who celebrate. I love seeing the emotion Marcus puts into his game when he scores tries, or when he makes a pass and his team scores a try.\n\n**Read more:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/10/08/the-two-lions-players-i-would-pick-from-each-country/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2024/10/08/the-two-lions-players-i-would-pick-from-each-country/)"

I don't know if he could have done much about it though?\n\n**Overall Team Review - France Match**\n\nStrange, strange match. So recently, home or away, the matches between England and France even though England are the better team, there's usually between 6 and 10 points in it, max. I didn't think England were particularly good, with or without the ball, for large chunks, and yet won by 21pts which comparatively, away from home in front of a parochial, tribal and the biggest french crowd to date, was an absolute hammering. Yet, I feel nothing?\n\nVery mixed feelings. I think most of all it's probably the disappointment to an extent that playing against better opposition, we didn't stay as brave. We moved back to the middleton approach which I think is instinctive for this group, it'll take time to stop being so maul heavy against the better sides.\n\nYet, I was impressed by some players and it also raised questions about others.\n\nIn terms of the good:\n\n* Amy Cokayne: Absolutely outstanding. I think maybe 1 bad throw, the majority to the back and she nailed them with ice cold precision. Her mauling and scrummaging were excellent, and she even was the first chaser in some kick throughs from the team. Her first fully intense game back since the last rugby world cup due to multiple injuries?\n* Morwenna Talling: My english WOTM (not the WOTM, that was Pauline Bourdon Sansus). Lineout takes, got through a mountain of tackles and a steal or 2, at every single ruck. Her tackling on the outside to bring down the fast french backs was mindboggling and she carried really well when given the ball. The talk was about Alex, who was excellent, but my pick was Morwenna. Her 3rd game back after major injury. Madness. 21 years old. Massive future and I can see why England persisted with her early. She also did all this whilst shrugging off an injury and then a clear head shot. Keep her in the side!\n* Holly Aitchison: Very, very good. The 10s shirt is now officially hers. Her passing was crisp, her game management generally was excellent, her kicking from hand was pivotal in gaining territory and suffocating the opposition into submission. Most importantly, world class goalkicking when it mattered. The england men's goalkickers would have been proud of that effort.\n\nHonorable mentions to Alex Matthews and Maud Muir. Muir got through a mountain of work in the tight, well scrummaged and scored a nice try. A rock this 6 nations for the team to build around. Matthews was outstanding. She was destructive at the ruck, lots of claims in the lineout and was spoiling France's maul and slowing it down at any time possible. But it was her timing off the ball and onto the ball for her 2 tries and around the park which led her from good to excellent.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Breakdown: I don't like how we use it. So if you break up the pitch into chunks, 75% of the breakdown's unless there's a point blunt opportunity and it's obvious we should target the ball, we just fan out and prefer numbers in defence than to pressurize securing their ball. We pile in, in our 22, but it hurt our tactic today. Interested to see if this changes going forward.\n\n- Lack of Attack: Tactically we looked a little inflexible somewhat. By fanning out, we didn't attack the breakdown. When we kicked for territory we waited for the opposition to make a mistake. With the territory we'd then build pressure and go through our attack repetoire. Or so, that was the plan.\n\nDidn't work out that way.\n\nFrance played with absolute abandon knowing they had nothing to lose and just retained the ball for long periods and you know what? It worked. Our defence withstood it saying that really well under pressure, but in terms of playing to our normal structure, this isn't optimal and meant it rendered our backs useless somewhat. We didn't attack their breakdown, they just kept ball for prolonged periods and the game took on a different feel. Need to tweak this just a bit.\n\n- Use of Backs: Went into our shell and that was a real shame. More route one, punch a hole etc. It worked, but we didn't try to get our backs into the game and the few times we did, we either passed a bit poorly so the player was caught in traffic and was ineffective. Now, we scored 6 tries, so I shouldn't complain we did that against probably the best team we will face (2nd best in the world ahead of the black ferns and Canada) but I think it's the next area we need to develop. To braver in attack in key games... how does it effect our shape, how do we get our devastating back 3 and Meg in space cutting lines? That's the next step. We showed the test of mettle under pressure in defence for sustained periods today and we will be better for it, but now we need to apply that to our attack.\n\n- Jess Breach: Her worst performance by a long way in an england jersey. She wasn't fazed by the occasion but she wasn't at the races. Struggled to hold onto the ball, looked limited and lightweight on the ball. kicked the ball out on the full twice? Had been mugged off on the first try by Menager because she can't tackle and then on the 2nd try was all at sea. It's these performance's comparatively that I hope Katie Buchanan kicks on and gets a shot. I'm aware that they may or may not read the comments and 99% of the time, they are very very good. But she was badly, badly exposed today comparatively to the usual.\n\n**Ending Thoughts**\n\nGrand Slam Champions - job done\n\nNext on the horizon is the finish of the Premier Women's XVs end of season which I implore people to watch, it's going to be an exciting finish. After this, 2 friendlies after France and New Zealand at home. France are the better of the 2. Then the Premier XVs kick in, the WXV1 in Canada and next year in the 6 nations (will Grand slam again) all leading to the world cup here at home in blighty.\n\nThink tomorrow evening I'll do an end of 6 nations review, where we're at, who's place is safe and who's is at risk.\n\nEnjoy the end of season in the men's and women's game. It's going to be epic.\n\nKind regards,\n\nMC",

They've won a grand slam at an average pd of 45.\n\nTo play devil's advocate I'd say they don't really need to think about changing their style of play. They are trying to play a high pressure defence to force turnovers they can then attack from. They need practice against teams that don't just give up shit turnovers, true, but that doesn't mean it's the wrong tactic."

    "all_comment_text": "There’s a thing called bucs super league (if that’s what they’re still calling it) that’s meant to be the top level uni league and be a sort of semi pro development league. I’m pretty sure Exeter have a good link with Exeter uni pretty sure that’s been a reason for some of the players they’ve poached from wales in the past so clubs will definitely look at university teams especially since they’re all broadcast online now. \n\nGetting into the university first team is likely to be your issue a lot of the players can often be recruited into the University already with plans to be in the first team.\n\nAh right, so it’s not like a school? You don’t turn up and train sort of? If that’s the case how can I get noticed by a uni as I’m based in Leeds which isn’t known for union really. No scouts will watch school as its state and its highly unlikely they do and the club team is very good although the same problem that I can’t see scouts looking at it.\n\nLeeds Becket is in the bucs super league. When the time comes literally visit the uni on open days and email the rugby coach explaining your situation and ask for more info about the rugby program. I did this and got my offer upgraded to unconditional. I didnt go in the end because I found a better uni and wasnt chasing pro rugby.\n\nAhh right, I assume that some unis are looked at a lot more than others though? It’s a while until I go although if I get good results then I’d like to go to the best rugby one I can\n\nYeah but ill be brutally honest. If your gonna go play prem rugby youll need to dominate your school year every year. Ive played with a couple of prem players and the difference is night and day. Im not trying to crush your dream because maybe your really good Im just saying if pro rugby is your dream then you need to be making it your life mission now. The best players always end up getting found one way or another if theyre good enough, look at Ellis Genge.\n\nYou do get players who just turn up and train and that’s the way for all the other teams and then obviously players will get promoted into the first team if they’re playing well but a lot of the big rugby universities will offer some sort of discount or deal to promising players and then they’ll get them down to pre season training even before the university year has started so obviously these players are going to get have a leg up in selection because the coaches and players are familiar with them. I played hockey not rugby at university and we’d contact players from good clubs who where coming to our uni and get them down to pre season which was about 3/4 weeks before freshers actually arrived. They’d stay in a senior players spare room and train and come out with us. We’d still have trials but naturally when picking that first team for the first games the players you’ve been seeing at training for weeks is going to be advantaged.\n\nI’m not familiar in the best ways of getting scouts to notice you in rugby tbh but I’m sure there’s some who could give you advice. As the other commenter said a big thing to consider is how much you’re dominating your side because the premiership players are just on a different planet\n\nYes, a friend at Uni got scouted from Uni by England 7s, which lead to being signed by a prem side also.\nI’ve also seen Bristol signed a few players from different uni sides\n\nAre your club able to push you through any of the county level development pathways?\nAt your age level that would seem the easiest and most likely way to start getting noticed by those higher up the rugby pecking order. It’s how it used to be anyway\nI know that’s how a few of the girls at my club have progressed into England youth teams with a few signing with bigger clubs as well having gone through the Yorkshire development pathways. I’d assume there’s similarities on the men’s side with clubs keeping an eye on those programs.\nHave a word with your club coach about it, they might not know a whole bunch but someone at your club will do.\n\nYorkshire isn’t exactly Unions stronghold but Sale do keep an eye out around us. As do Doncaster Knights\n\nI’m not sure tbh, it’s not really happened before, can you get scouted to join Yorkshire from just playing clubs or do you have to go to a trial? If so I might play a season and ask next as I’ve only just joined from my previous club\n\nI coach but not at an age grade that has a county set up yet so I’m not 100% but from speaking to other coaches at my club I think clubs are asked to submit names to put forward for county selection and development pathways. It’s then onto the trials.\n\nI coach girls rugby so it may be different (sorry made a massive assumption that you’re male) and I think the girls Yorkshire Player Pathways are asking for names to be put forward fairly soon. If your into pre season then ask your coach at your next training session, even if you’re new there they have hopefully already got a reasonable idea of your abilities and if they think you’d be suitable.\n\nAs for trials in my day it was a few bits of training then a game. All done in a few hours and was total bollocks. No one played naturally as they all wanted to stand out so there was no flow and so hard to read what might be going on. I got to county level and trails and some development sessions for the North were similar to the county trials but I was never going to make it further. \n\nThese days the county trials sound much better and it’s done over several sessions so you get a much better chance to show all round skills. \n\nI think schools can put players forward but if there’s no established rugby set up with links to the county at your school then clubs will be the best and mostly likely option.\n\nI’ve looked into it a bit more and have found that apparently, each club will have a scout that monitors throughout the season and towards the end of the season, if a player has been picked for Yorkshire they’ll get invited to train? Is that the case do you know? Also as my club and school are very close I’m not sure if they’d monitor there or not? Also, what qualities do scouts look for in a prop, I’m guessing the obvious bots like scrums, line outs, physicality and workfare but do they also look for things like communication and mindset or game management? Thank you \n\nHonestly I can’t answer on what the scouts are looking for as I’m not involved in that side of things. \n\nAll I know is in the coaches in the girls section of my club were asked for names of players they thought would be suitable for the development pathways and Yorkshire trials. Certainly for the development pathways they were being asked a couple of weeks ago to start putting names forward\n\nThe Head Coach at Exeter University is actually an Exeter Chiefs staff member, he was previously Chiefs' head analyst. \n\nLots of Chiefs current players are also dual registered at the Uni. In fact I think 8+ players in the Champions Cup quarter final were Exeter University Students. \n\nI imagine other clubs have similar links to universities.\n\nYeah just go to Oxbridge and play in the Varsity Game, easy life\n\nNot sure if this is a joke, but neither Oxbridge university are among the top rugby universities\n\nIt’s true, their teams just tend to get more mainstream media coverage than most other universities, even the sporting centres of excellence like Loughborough or Bath. Hence I imagine players find it easier to get on scouts’ radars via those teams? I am no expert, though\n\nI mean, they get some coverage around the time of the varsity match. But even that has subsided (see Varsity match being moved from Twickenham to StoneX)\n\nBut someone playing for a BUCS first team will play a much tougher fixture list throughout the year and get more eyes on them\n\nYou clearly know your onions better than I do and yeah, I guess I was confusing media attention with attention from scouts, thank you for re-educating me though! 🏉\n\nLook into the DPP for your region.\n\nhttps://www.bathrugby.com/club/academy-programme/developing-player-programme\n\nYou can indeed get scouted at university level, and this is typically easier if you attend a strong university side with links to a premiership club side (prem clubs will sometimes have young players or prospects at the university to study and develop).\n\nBut ideally you want to be on the radar earlier than that."

    "all_comment_text": "I think that George Martin will have to have a big six nations to make it, especially in defence. Chessum is more likely from the England player group, but there are big options in the Ireland second row ie. Joe McCarthy.\n\nI think Martin will be helped as the Lions will have lock options off the bench so he can come off before he tires and makes mistakes. I’d have him and McCarthy personally.\n\nI’m not sure about Kelleher at hooker, Sheehan will be fit by then and is much better. Ireland’s lineout has been poor for a while though, I don’t know if that is a throwing issue or something else but it opens the door for George and Lake IMO.\n\nI'd actually have Tomos Williams ahead of White if he's fit \n\nAs good as he is I don't think it would be fair to have Lawes in when he's playing Div 2 in France - not likely he'll be up to the standard of international play. I'd probably have Mccarthy instead altho I'd probably actually move Beirne to 2nd row and have J Willis or Underhill at flank with Mccarthy replacing Martin on the bench\n\nYou might be right about Lawes, you are right about Jack Willis, I wonder about young Owen though...\n\nOwen Farrell is a fantastic player with bags of quality and experience especially with the Lions (and I say that as Harlequins fan) - lets get that out the way first of all\n\nUnfortunately he faces a few problems:\n\n1. Injury - recently injured with Racing so could potentially throw his form as can happen with any player\n\n2. Competition - Russell is nailed on to start for me and M Smith has been the best thing abt England this ANS which begs the question do the Lions need Owen Farrell?\n\n3. The Andy Farrell factor - This is a lose-lose situation for papa Faz. Pick Farrell and get accused of bias; don't pick Farrell get flack from the all pundits saying the Lions will miss his experience (I will bet any money Clive Woodward and / or Stuart Barnes will criticize whichever way he goes)\n\nYeah all good points. The injury one is the biggest for me, because if he's not played much he won't have the form, and if he hasn't been bossing it then there'll be sniping and gossiping for sure. \n\nBut my god he's got the will to win (see q2)\n\nWith performances this Autumn taken into account, Schoman/Fagerson, Kinghorn, White, VdM should start (alongside your current selection). There’s argument for other Scots to be in the convo for the 23 (Cummings, Dempsey, Ritchie, Ashman, Jordan) - note in the convo not necessarily in the team.\n\nThat being said - I think the picks you’ve made are very realistic…. Unless Scotland wins the 6N with a Grand Slam, I can’t see them getting huge representation. Also their 4-yearly outrage is now part of the whole Lions myth… I do feel that in 2025 it will be justified :)\n\nGenge should be out have not seen enough of him play well in the autumn tests sadly"

How did Fasogbon get on (I'm obsessed with young English props right now).\n\nForgot about Pepper. He's class. could see him pushing Underhill/Curry in a year\n\nOne of the main reasons Glos were so on top in the first half. Absolutely had West on toast at scrum time. Seemed like every scrum was a Glos pen. You know the tighthead has done well when the  opposition loosehead gets hooked a minute or two after the break.\n\nSaints improved a lot there when Iyogun came on (as another nod to your English prop obsession!).\n\nThomas also had a big game for Glos imo\n\nYeah he was good.\n\nUnfortunately he has a terminal case of Welshness.\n\nOh my bad, of course he is!\n\nClark has entered the contest for England lock spots for my money. \n\nI also will die on this hill - Jack Clement needs to be involved with England\n\nSee on Rodd it looked like he suffered a bit early against Heyes. I only watched the first half though.\n\nHe did. But then her turned it around impressively. Same with AFO\n\nCool, I'm a fan of massive Rodds, wait a massive Rodd fan. That SA game will keep him in my England contention for eternity. \n\nOn a side note completely agreed on Tizard, going the Ewels route (needless red card) shouldn't be the way to get into England contention. \n\nThought Hill was very unlucky on his yellow, but Roots did catch the eye.

Freeman.\n\nOnly issue is Randall in this list\n\nI’d catapult Porter into the first team\n\nI just think the Japan game might suit him. Should be pretty fast paced (weather permitting). Who would you have instead?\n\nI’d stay with Mitchell or JVP. 9 isn’t a position we need to keep bringing in more depth in my opinion.\n\nIf I could have picked Mitchell he'd have been the first name on my list. Been such a loss this autumn.\n\nFor me he's nailed on at 9 if fit. Then in the wings JVP, Spencer and bring back Raffi quirke.\n\nAs much as I love Quirke (he has an endearing quality of looking like he's constantly about to burst into tears) and he's probably our most athletically gifted 9, the lad is seemingly made of glass.\n\nAmazing performance. \n\nSecond cap for England, scores a try against the Springboks, we win the game.\n\nQuirke rides off into the sunset never to be seen in a white shirt again.\n\nAgreed Mitchell should be 1st choice when fit followed by Spencer on bench, then JVP. Randall is not there atm but 26 he's still got time\n\nProblem isn’t depth as imo we don’t have good depth there.\n\nProblem is we have Mitchell who we knows good enough and pretty much no one else.\n\nJVP is yet to prove himself, same with Randall and you can’t wait forever for them. I’m not sure either will be top class international scrum halves\n\nWill be interesting to see how Archie McParland or possibly Lucas Friday develop over the next couple of years. We're crying out for someone to come along and really become undeniable. Whilst we have a good number or decent 9s behind Mitchell, there is nobody who's really undeniable as the next cab off the rank.\n\nOh to be France with Dupont and Le Garrec...\n\nIcl I don't understand what ppl see in Roebuck compared to Ibitoye, Murley or Muir, I'd possibly even have Daly over him but ik I'm in the minority\n\nRoebucks aerial game is elite, probably the best winger in the Prem for retaining kicks as well as just being a really good finisher, and a pretty big carrier by winger standards\n\nI agree he's a good finisher but no better than any of the other guys I just mentioned, same goes for carrying particularly with Murley and Muir. Don't get me wrong he's not a bad player but I'm not convinced his Prem form reflects better performances than the likes of 3 I've just mentioned\n\nI appreciate as good as Ibitoye has been he's not a Borthwick player and it's unrealistic to expect him to be included\n\nOh no I completely agree he's probably a weaker finisher than the other 3 but if you're picking him, it's mostly for his aerial game which is frankly better than Murley or Muir imo\n\nAt the end of the day, having 6 or so wingers that are all arguably good enough to start for England is a really nice problem to have\n\n1. Genge \n\n2. George \n\n3. Stuart\n\n4. Maro\n\n5. Martin\n\n6. Hill\n\n7. Earl\n\n8. Willis\n\n9. Porter\n\n10. Smith\n\n11. IFW\n\n12. Dingwall\n\n13. Lawrence\n\n14. Sleightholme\n\n15. Freeman\n\nI’m sceptical of Dingwall at test level and I’m not sure if he’s what’s needed for M Smith but he’s earned another shot. I like the idea of Freeman at 15 because Steward is too limited in several key aspects and Furbank hasn’t been used as a second distributor. Freeman is good under the high ball and a strong strike runner so I think he could work with Smith nicely, we could also chuck him on the wing every now and again for cross field kick. Willis is a no brainer and I’m hoping his carrying in the tight will provide space for Earl to start punching throw holes again, he’s been overworked in the carrying and is too obvious a target for defences now. Porter is another new 9 but knows Smith and has serious talent.\n\nI look forward to minimal changes from Borthers as he knows he’ll get the sack if he loses.\n\n16. Dan\n\n17. Baxter\n\n18. Heyes\n\n19. Clark\n\n20. Pollock\n\n21. Randall\n\n22. F Smith\n\n23. Furbank\n\nYeah I expect maybe 2 changes tops and he’ll be pushing for his first team to ensure they end the series on somewhat of a high. \n\nWould love to see players like Davison who have been in camp without even making the squads get some minutes but fancy that’s wishful thinking\n\nYeah fair call on Davison, I forgot him to be honest. I was being a bit sarky with my comment on Borthwick but a whole raft of changes would probably created a clunky display and have everyone howling even more for him to go.\n\nI'm not entirely sold on Davison. His quality seems to be similar level to Heyes, which is no bad thing, and I'd probably go with Heyes on that basis given its more likely he'll be at WC 2027 and beyond\n\nThat’s fair. Although it’s the old adage that you’ll\nnever know until they get given game time. Heyes does seem to be more sensible with his age working in his favour.\n\n1. Baxter\n\n2. Dan\n\n3. Stuart\n\n4.

I’d chuck some of the “A” guys in?\n\nFor the sake of argument, you can pick anyone from either squad.\n\n1) Baxter\n2) Dan \n3) AOF\n4) Martin\n5) Cole’s\n6) hill\n7) pollock\n8) willis\n9) Porter\n10) f smith\n11) murley\n12) Dingwall\n13) Lawrence\n14) ifw\n15) furbank (c)\n16) LCD\n17) genge\n18) Stuart\n19) Hayes\n20) Earl\n21) Randall\n22) m smith\n23) ibitoye\n\nPollock needs more experience at club and age grade lvl first, he's a good prospect and I'd give him his debut against a Tier 2 nation next year rather than this year if he's kept his form up\n\nJapan not a tier 2 nation? Makes sense waiting until next year but tbh I’d like to see borthwick roll the dice this weekend\n\nYes Japan is a Tier 2 nation but my point is I wouldn't throw Pollock into the deep against a Tier 1 nation when he's still young\n\nFair enough! Maybe take him to Argentina next summer\n\nTrue that could work even if he's just a squad player it would be great experience for him\n\nI would start Furbank and Ted hill and move freeman to 13 but I think this is more realistic \n\n1.

Roebuck\n\nThere’s two approaches in my mind.\n\nEither stick with the 23 (more or less) from SA game to give them more time to gel and experience a different style of game.\n\nOr experiment where there have been weaknesses, try Dingwall and Beard as a combo in the centres, or Freeman and Lawrence with Furbank back at 15. \n\nWould love to see Will Porter and Marcus playing together for England - great combo at Quins.\n\nAnd Murley. He's been in and out of the senior squad about three times already and missed chances due to injuries. The guy deserves a cap. He's straight up quality - maybe not first choice in the air, but a great finisher, puts in big defensive efforts and is surprisingly effective over the ball. If I had to pick England wingers who might be explosive enough to chase down the likes of Kolbe and Arendse then IFW and Murley would be my guys.\n\nTry Earl In the centre\n\nOr Ted Hill!\n\nBaxter Dan Stuart Isiekwe Martin B Curry Underhill CCS JVP Smith(either) Sleights Lozowski Lawrence Freeman Furbank\n\nGeorge Genge Davison Coles/Itoje T Curry/T Hill Earl Spencer Smith (Other)/Slade\n\nRest some key players. Blood some others. Still got very strong as this lot have a point to prove.\n\nFin Smith at 10, Marcus Smith at 15, Freeman at 13:\n\n1. Genge\n2. Dan\n3. Stuart\n4. Itoje\n5. Martin\n6. T.Hill\n7. Underhill\n8. Earl\n\n9. Spencer\n10. F.Smith\n12. Lawrence\n13. Freeman\n14. Roebuck (IFW if fit)\n15. M.Smith\n11. Sleightholme\n\n16. George\n17. Baxter\n18. Heyes\n19. Coles\n20. CCS\n21.

Lawrence\n\n13. Beard\n\n14. Freeman\n\n15. Furbank\n\nSubstitutes: 16. Dan, 17. Baxter, 18. Heyes, 19. Coles, 20. CCS, 21. JVP,  22. Fin Smith, 23. Lozowski \n\nAgainst teams like Japan the team should largely remain the same with a few changes. It's those lower Tier 2 and Tier 3 nations where you can really afford to ring the changes. Heyes or Fasogbun should be the most important player brought into the 23, new blood has to start developing instead of giving Dan Cole more caps. He's been a great servant to England but it's time to start developing a 3rd choice that will be around for 2027. Lozowski seems made for that 23 shirt given his versatility\n\nWho cares? Are you even going to watch? Why?"

    "all_comment_text": "Honestly with a fully fit selection of players Spencer is the fourth choice scrum half for me. JvP was purring before his injury so I'm glad to see him back.\n\nI think JVP is excellent, but I also think Spencer was doing a lot of unseen a game management - and that it isn’t a coincidence that Smith has looked at his best in an England shirt with Spencer alongside him\n\nInteresting - could be right, hard to know. Keen to seen Mitchell come back and see how they gel. Marcus has been growing in general.\n\nYou really sure about that now…? He’s having an absolute stinker at the moment!\n\nSpencer (like Underhill apparently) is seen as someone who either starts or isn’t in the squad at all. Randall, in theory, is a good option off the bench if we need to speed things up. Borthwick has a thing for doing this with scrum halves, he did the same with Mitchell at the World Cup and at Tigers.\n\nAgree with your view in Randall, but George Ford ain’t the 10 to bring on with him to inject pace.\n\nMaybe. I think if Ford was told to play fast then he’d play fast.\n\nYeah I agree, ford in interviews has said he’s happy to play ‘boring’ rugby if it’s what he and the team think is the best style to win that game. Not to say he would be a Marcus smith style player, but he’s happy to leave his ego and play a style that the system requires\n\nExactly look at how we played against France for an example.\n\nIt makes even less sense if England are to abandon running rugby in favour of a territory-based aerial contest. Randall, though dexterous, is not the nine I would bring on if you wanted to maintain that continuity in kicking.\n\nI guess we will see after the match tomorrow really. Hard to gauge at the moment but anything is better than the years of Ben Youngs….. 😬"

The RFU seem to be more concerned about making sure if you play in other leagues you can’t play for England and splitting home/ away fans. They need to prioritise the league more than the searing arrangements at matchws\n\nYou're massively overestimating the RFU's authority and influence. They don't have any power to make teams more competitive. And what would that look like anyway? \n\nThe RFU can't move players around between clubs. I don't know of any union that has that power actually. Even the IRFU, which can influence where players pay in Irish provinces does that for the success of Ireland, not the competition. \n\nThe RFU is only directly responsible for the England team. Rugby clubs are privately owned, any changes to the way the game is governed and run have to be agreed by the clubs. \n\nNewcastle need an owner with deeper pockets, a bigger stadium, and possibly for Newcastle United to stop playing football.\n\nBring back relegation and they might have to change their approach"

Thanks \n\nDan Cole\n\nDan Cole is probably one of the greatest examples of modern prop to learn from. Sure there are better props around (eg. Tadhg Furlong), but pound for pound, an excellent teacher due to his lesser size having to be worked around.\n\nAs much as I love Joe Marler, watch him and do the opposite.  Quite a lazy off the ball player\n\nIn terms of your positioning on the field. Usually you're close to the ruck, usually in one of those pillar, post, key roles so knowing those positions and their job in D will stand you in real good stead. \n\nFocus on your tackle tekkers and when to fold around the ruck in particular. And you'll be gravy. Never neglect your tight work, as so often coaches want tight-five guys to be so good in open play that can come at detriment to your skills in the scrum/maul. So always keep on top of fitness for that. But namely mate. Just enjoy it.\n\nYou're young. You have time to take it more seriously when you're older. For now just enjoy it and never neglect your basics. But overarching message. Just enjoy. Go well.\n\nYou'll likely just want to hover around the middle of the pitch, be the first or second man outside of a ruck, and hut anything that goes in front of you\n\nThe thing is, the game plan my team do doesn’t allow for forwards to be loose, I hang around the ruck as a receiver or am in the ruck and then it’s pretty much running with the backs, I hang around in midfield sometimes too though \n\nThat's interesting. Depends on where you want to play I guess too. As in which position. I started my illustrious career at tight head but quickly moved backwards to the 6, 7 or 8 roles. If you like running, and are built for it, maybe try those positions?"

It’s all about the local club allocation for big England games\n\nBy 'avin loadsamoney\n\nYou’ve been lucky to get a win. Not won in the ballot yet. You do get access to resale tickets ahead of the general public so keep an eye out. But without shelling out for a hospitality package you’re not guaranteed anything.\n\nI've never won a ballot but got an email about resale the other day and managed to get England v Australia tickets.
