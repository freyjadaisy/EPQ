    "title": "A way to increase lifting capacity, speed, or extend battery life.",
    "body": "The big 180 degree servo motors that I use in Robert are rated to have 13kg/cm torque at 7.2V, and the they only run at 5V. I thought that would be enough, but found out that it was just bearly enough to lift the arms at the shoulder joint. Then I had the idea to use bungee chords to pull the arms up so that the resting position is actually in mid air. This way the motor uses some of its torque to pull the arm down, and then it has some momentum when lifting an object, and does not have to spend energy on lifting the arm it self, since it is free floating. I did the same thing in the elbow joint. When I started to think about it then the normal working position of the arms, in most cases, is half bent, like the posture of C-3PO in Star Wars. Not hanging down by the sides of the body. By adding this feature either by using springs or some kind of elastic bands, then the motors have more usable torque, and they can therefore be less powerful, and consume less current, and still produce the same results. The end result of doing this is therefore extended battery life, since the robot needs less energy to lift a particular load. If the motors are not downsized then the result can be either increased speed, or more lifting capacity. Most tasks that robots undertake is lifting something, or carrying objects, therefore this makes perfect sense. They do not need 100% of their torque plus the weight of the arms when lowering the arms. The same principle goes for the legs. We should not get blinded by the shortcomings of the human body, and transfer them to the robots without thinking. In my opinion some kind of spring system should be used in the legs as well, to maximice the usable torque of the motors, or actuators. We normally do not need 100% torque plus the body weight of the robot just to squat down. In most cases you just want maximum force to extend the legs, and then it makes sence to use springs, or something similar, to cancel out the body weight of the robot. This is of course based on assuming that the same motor or actuator is used for both bending and extending the legs or arms.",

We chose a complex case where the tape is located on the edge, so you can't slide to it by the surface.\n\nThe robot acts like a human. It carefully scrapes and pokes at the film with micro-movements until it tears off a small piece. Then it goes deeper and bends the film so that it can be easily grasped with the other arm. The adhesive layer stays undamaged in the process.\n\nThis was the most difficult task to automate in our target product. Next, the plan is to speed up the movements and combine all the operations for an end-to-end fully autonomous product assembly. It will be a simple, but real commercial product sold on Amazon. ",

This is the third iteration of our robot, and it incorporates significant improvements based on our experiences from previous years.\n\nJerry 3.0 is equipped with an RFID reader (SPI-based) to interpret directional tags in the maze, three IR sensors for wall detection, and an MPU-6050 accelerometer for precise turning. Its movement is controlled by two DC motors using an L298N motor driver, allowing tank-style steering. The robot's chassis is 3D-printed, optimized for a 16√ó16 cm footprint and a turning radius of less than 17 cm.\n\nOne of the standout features this year is the integration of a web interface hosted on the ESP32 microcontroller. Using its WiFi capabilities in SoftAP mode, we can connect directly to the robot with a smartphone or laptop. This interface allows us to monitor real-time sensor data, adjust PID parameters on-the-fly, and load different operational profiles (e.g., \"sprint mode\"). This has been invaluable during testing and fine-tuning.\n\nThe competition takes place tomorrow (April 11), where Jerry will compete in challenges such as speed runs, maze discovery, and obstacle navigation. We‚Äôll share results after the event!\n\n# Links:\n\n* [GitHub Repository with Code](https://github.com/asimoq/Jerry3_ESP32_MazeSolvingRobot)\n* [Team Website with Photos &amp; Info](http://teamjerry.hu/)\n* [Official Competition Rulebook](https://kando-szakkoli.uni-obuda.hu/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rules_2025_v01.pdf)\n\nFeel free to ask any questions about Jerry‚Äôs design or functionality!",

Company B is a startup that develops ground robots and the role is for a Navigation and Test engineer. At \"A\" I would mainly write software and test on hardware but not develop anything new or more \"behaviour\" things for robotics like GNC or perception, at least at first.\n\nCan any of you discuss similar experience where you had to choose between a bigger company, with more experienced personal vs a company where your role is more appealing and \"fun\"?

They are generally used to pick up objects and place them in designated spots, operating across industries to achieve high throughput and streamlined workflows. Traditionally, pick and place robots depended on static programming, restricting their ability to adapt to changes in object orientation, size, or position.\n\nOver the past few years, however, state-of-the-art camera solutions have helped these robots unlock a new level of imaging intelligence. It has equipped them to leverage real-time data to analyze and interpret their surroundings before changing their actions.\n\nIn this article, you‚Äôll get expert insights on the role of cameras in these robots, their main challenges, popular use cases, as well as measurable business benefits.
