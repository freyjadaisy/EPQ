    "all_comment_text": "This is actually terrifying\n\nThe stare is just a terrifying, beautiful, and amazing.\n\nreminds me of Werner Herzog on bears: \n\n*\"And what haunts me, is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed, I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature. To me, there is no such thing as a secret world of the bears. And this blank stare speaks only of a half-bored interest in food.\"*\n\nRead this in his voice\n\nIs there an ability to read his quotes without hearing his voice? \n\nHe’s in my head! He’s in my head!\n\nI read that in Gilbert Gottfried voice.\n\nThis really cracked.  Alright, time to actually work.\n\nRead this in Paul F Tompkins doing Werner Herzogs voice\n\nThere never has been and never will be a documentary that I enjoy more than that one. Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia is a distant second.\n\nLol dude never saw brother bear\n\nThis animal is so much, and so interesting, and so vicious and horrible, and so beautiful in so many different ways—it represents such a big portion of the success of OP’s run.\n\nNever run up trail, me boys\n\n🤣🤣🤣\n\nnearly got outapexed.\n\nBut It's the natural beauty.\n\nWhat about sasquatch standing on the ridge line!\n\nMy first thoughts!\n\nWhadiyatalkinaboot\n\nEyyy ya feeling the Sassy food magic, eh?\n\nTrippa snippa\n\nYou look hungry mate \n\nI’ll cook you up a feed\n\nYou fackin druggo mayte\n\nLez mate\n\nFucking no good drug addict\n\nIt’s the brown thing with a face bottom left of the picture in the bushes. I zoomed on it here: https://imgur.com/a/mI06ghp\n\nNoo, that's a tree.\n\nTook me a second (or three) to find what OP meant, but I think they mean the mountain lion peeking out of the bushes in the lower left hand corner of the picture.\n\nLook for the splash of brown in all the green in that section.\n\nSneaky kitty\n\nBlursed cat distribution system\n\nConfirms the saying \"You haven't seen them, but they've seen you.\" As a woman on the small side, I'm rather alert running solo on trails in western US.\n\nI’m also a small woman and solo traveled out of a van, primarily staying in national forests. Countless times I’d be staring at landscapes and suddenly notice eyes. I started assuming there’s always a big cat watching. I’m guessing they were interested in my dog, but never had problems with them. We did, however, have a run-in with a bear.\n\n[deleted]\n\nTake it in baby steps. I'm not 100% sure doing it solo is for me. My gf and I did a quick PNW trip, stopped at 4 different parks, car camping the whole time. One night we stayed out in a national forest outside crater lake. That was the bar for me, I'm not sure I'll do that again. Fully willing to admit that I'm a total pussy lol.\n\nBut there are still other ways to get out and see the beauty without having to go full on nomad mode you know?\n\nMaybe start small? A campsite within an hour or so from home?\n\nDogs are great in the backcountry for attracting and antagonizing bears into coming to say hello up close and personal.\n\nDo you carry bear spray? After listening to Tooth and Claw it seems like a good purchase. Great podcast also.\n\nI don’t know that being a larger dude helps that much. But I swear it’s always the mountain bikers that get attacked.\n\nGuarantee you aren’t alert enough to deal with that lol\n\n😱 I also run in mountain lion territory, today I almost tripped myself because O thought I saw one while in reality, it was just a log.  I am sure they are watching us without us being aware of it.\n\nThey are usually nocturnal.  The photo appears to be taken either at sunset or sunrise so the kitty was probably just waking up or just getting ready for bed.\n\nYeah in the nw, we call it feeding hour lol\n\nCrepuscular. As is the case with the majority of animals that people think are nocturnal.\n\nOne point for knowing the fact, two points for knowing the word.\n\nGrew up very near a park with somewhat regular mountain lion sightings, and was always warned that dusk was the riskiest time. Granted, the park was \"closed\" at night, so if they were truly nocturnal the risk would be somewhat mitigated and dusk would be the closest to dark. But still. Never any attacks in my 18 years there and that area borders residential and gets a ton of foot and dog and small wildlife traffic.\n\nWas actually in the park once and found out later that there had been a sighting deeper in the park not long after I left that exact area. Was a little unsettling -- nothing like OPs experience\n\nThis is sunset.\n\nIf one decides to eat you, you’re already dead\n\nWell you’ll probably wish you were.\n\nthere was one a few years ago that was emaciated and attacked a group of hikers. Even in that weakened state it killed 2 hikers and maimed the 3rd\n\nThere was one a few weeks ago that attacked 2 brothers, experienced hikers/hunters.  A juvenile that still learned how to hunt.   I still ran a few times at dusk after the incident (3 hours away) but decided that my anxiety robbed the enjoyment of running.  No more dusk trail running for me.\n\nIt’s kinda like a plane crash, it’s insanely unlikely but if it starts happening you know it’s an almost guaranteed game over. Terrifying\n\nHonestly, mountain lions are pretty chill. Well, until they aren’t. Great capture.\n\nr/findthesniper\n\nYeah I posted there already. It’s my kids favorite nighttime activity trying to find the sniper.\n\nWhy am I the only one who can't see it? Not enough coffee perhaps?? Please give a hint!\n\nBottom far left.\n\nHey OP I don’t know if this is zoomed in or not but- super curious - how far away would you say kitty was from where you were standing? Terrifying\n\nAt this point, maybe ten feet. Then without knowing it was there I closed that distance and ran right past it.\n\nNope. Nope nope.\n\nYeah, when I first saw it after brightening the photo I was honestly nauseous.\n\nSometimes I feel like 🎶 somebody’s watchin meeeee\n\nWell, now you gotta find a running partner, a slower running partner.\n\nThey’ve found a running panther instead!\n\nThey won the photobombing competition.\n\nI run this trail 3-5 times a week. Now I’m rather freaked out.\n\nIt’s okay, just think about how they’ve been watching you every time and nothing bad has happened so far!\n\n😬\n\nYeah I think you’re right. But I am not sure this makes me feel any better. 😅\n\nI can’t get over how close the kitty was to you OP.   This is one of my anxiety dream haha.  Stay safe!\n\nDoes NOT help my wildlife anxiety! Been running trails, mostly solo, through kitty country for 15 years. Never seen one. Ever.\n\nHow many times have I been this close without knowing??? I carry bear spray but cats scare me way more. Reaction time would have to be milliseconds.\n\nYep!  I posted in here last month about the same fear.  I decided the best thing for me is to stop running at dusk.  I have since shifted to morning run.\n\nI mean you never know…maybe a young cougar, still learning how to hunt.  Maybe I accidentally tied my shoelaces and I looked smaller and it decided to hunt.  The anxiety took the enjoyment out of my run.  The fear started from the El Dorado incident a couple months ago.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAre you going back? No way I could.\n\nYes. I’ll be back there tomorrow. I figure it’s the only way to get over the nerves. It’s my favorite trail so I can’t let fear keep me away.\n\nJust fyi, mountain lions are most active in the dawn, dusk, and nighttime hours. Read up on your mountain lion safety. Never run away from one, they have an instinct to chase anything that’s running away (which makes trail running in lion territory super dangerous imo).\n\nAlso, it might be wise to post a hand-written sign/note near the trailhead that a mountain lion was spotted in the area with the date and time of the sighting.\n\nBe careful out there!\n\nWhat trail is it? I live in Sandy\n\nThe is Blacksmith Fork Canyon in Cache Valley.\n\nAh, blacksmith fork. I was thinking dry canyon, but I'm sure they're up in dry canyon too. Crazy you ran right by it.\n\nI also live in Sandy and saw one on the Mount Olympus trailhead at 6 am. It’s been 2 years but that trail still freaks me out every time I go haha.\n\nJust bring someone smaller and slower with you\n\nAre you going to take any kind of spray or noise maker?? Like, something please. Definitely a knoife.\n\nJust do it earlier. Avoid the kitty during its waking hours that way.\n\nJust getting closer...more comfortable...\n\nCount your blessings and hope that animal is well fed before your run.\n\nOk but I would not be so blasé about this! That stare seems more than casual 😨 That animal really could be stalking OP, especially since it seems he runs this trail regularly…\n\nSo far! ^^So ^^far! ^^^^So ^^^^far! ^^^^^^So ^^^^^^far!\n\nJust tap two stick together.  You’ll be fine.  😉… please tell me you also love the parent trap!?\n\nHaha, that takes me back.\n\nYou can't go to bars or hiking trails anymore. You're a peak attraction.\n\nmaybe it figured out you are too fast to hunt\n\nPeople say Australia has dangerous animals but all i have to worry about are snakes…\n\nTrail running for 5 years. Literally seen one snake in my entire time. It’s the orb spiders you have to watch out for!\n\nHow many mountain lions haven't you seen?\n\n1, because I live in Australia….\n\nTechnically it's all of them then\n\nCrazy! I live in Arizona and, since it started getting springtime-y here, I have run past a snake at least every other day 😰\n\nRight, I'll never understand this! I'll take anything we have here over a freaking LION any day tyvm\n\nAnd spiders, and kangaroos, and plants that hurt so bad they make you kill yourself,  and crocodiles, and and and… you know there is a lot more.  Don’t pretend it’s just snakes,  I watch documentaries!!!\n\npoint being there are no large land predators in Australia. its danger is played up for the media. there is no cat, or bear, or wolf, or anything of the kind that will stalk you out there. just don’t go sticking your hands down random holes and jumping in murky water, and you’ll be fine, which is true anywhere you’ll go in the world.\n\nThe dangerous spiders tend to be burrowers or live under stuff, they aren’t the ones that spread webs. The roos won’t care about you unless you get within a meter of them and the crocs is like saying you need to watch out for alligators in America, except there’s a lot less people in the tropical parts of Australia\n\nYou have to watch for gators and crocs in Florida.   Florida is the U.S Australia if you ask me. We just have wacked out druggies instead of Roos but they will still fist fight you.\n\nSpiders are fine, red backs will hurt you but nobody has died from a spider bite in aus for 40 years.\n\nKangaroos are 99.99% the most placid animals\n\nMost Australians live in sub-tropical areas so no crocodiles.\n\nI don’t know of any plants that can hurt me, other than maybe a falling tree limb\n\nAnd Bigfoot is just standing on the ridge overlooking…\n\n[deleted]\n\nnp! the tiger’s eyes on the left bottom in the photo. zoom it and you’ll see😅\n\n[deleted]\n\n😅\n\nStill not seeing it. I see a brown splatsh but no eyes.\n\nEDIT: son of an f-word. Looking on my iPad it was just a brown splash, now on my laptop I see the eye.\n\nZoom in to the bottom left of the photo, and you’ll see him looking right into your eyes. 🐅\n\nInto your soul, actually\n\nPuma*\n\nIf I saw one I’d puma pants!\n\nSaw a mountain lion in Millcreek Canyon on a trail I'd run dozens of times before. Only difference was it was just after sunset. I only saw it because its eyes rejected off my headlamp - was about the size of a lab. Safe to say I'm only running during daylight now, enjoying the blissful ignorance 😂\n\nAnd THAT is the reality of running in mountain lion country.  They do exist and you do occasionally encounter them.  Thankfully, the vast majority of the time we runners are just something loud and irritating to avoid for them.\n\nHaving run the US southwest for years I'm almost certain that I've been in the same situation and totally unaware of it...\n\nGoddamnnn that’s a fantastic and terrifying photo!\n\nReally good framing of the eye. I'm impressed\n\n Holy shit! This scares me from ever running or hiking out west unfortunately.\n\nMore trails for the rest of us!\n\nBut seriously, don’t be. Cat encounters are exceedingly rare, and we see how close OP was to this one – if it wanted anything to do with them, this would’ve been a very different post.\n\nOr not a post at all.\n\nMountain lions are not just found out west. They definitely live on the eastern side of the Mississippi, no matter how much state natural resource agencies try to brush it off as just \"roaming juvenile males\".\n\nInsane!\n\nWorst Where’s Waldo game ever!\n\nJEEEEEEZUS!!! \n\nThis probably happens way more than we realize. I saw a nature doc where they had tracker collars on Mountian lions. Even with the collar, they could get within 10 ft, and still not find em sometimes. \n\nThe only time you'll ever see a mountain kitty is when it wants you to\n\nImmediately lol holy shit\n\nI thought you were talking about the bush that looks like a Buffalo's head in the middle of the picture.\n\nSteve French!\n\nI live in the most densely populated cougar territory in the world. It's been years since I've seen one, but every once in awhile I feel like I'm being watched.\n\nFckn hell !\n\nOh my fuck you were almost dinner\n\nThat's a yikes from me guys\n\nFkn me that cat was sizing you up, the fact that you stood still there...\n\nNot a good omen that it took me 5 mins to find the cat in the pic. I guess I'd just die in real life.\n\nJeez, as soon as i spotted it i got chills. Way too close for comfort.\n\nHoly crap! Keeping a close eye on you\n\nThat is dangerously close.\n\nThat’s so much scarier than having one jump in front of you and be threatening. If you can see a cougar, just walk backwards till it fucks off. It’s defending its territory, not hunting you. If you DON’T see the cougar, it’s hunting you and you need to get the FUCK out of dodge. \n\nWow thanks for sharing. My nightmare 😐\n\nI thought I saw a puddy tat\n\nMeh if you are part of the dominant culture in Utah you’d probably get into heaven. It just might be a bit painful.\n\nSomeone replace the mountain lion with a random dude, we have a Tiktok to make\n\nDamn man… and i thought it was crazy when people were showing false bravado towards the lil wooden bridge now here they are claiming they would have no issue being stalked by a mountain lion. Ive never seen one but definitely had the feeling of being followed after dark. Not fun\n\nThere’s a cougar in the bottom left corner\n\nThat ain't Waldo.\n\nI spent a few years in the late 2000s working as a trail guide for a boyscout camp deep in the mountains of New Mexico. My job was to basically tag along with them for a couple of days to make sure they knew what they were doing.\n\nThe hikes at the beginning of the trails were pretty easy, with only 10 or so miles between camp sites. There were semi-perminant staff at each camp site to lead programs and activities. The camps always had groups of people coming and going all throughout the day, so most animals aside from ground squirrels and the occasional mule deer would be way too scared to even approach any camp.\n\nAnyeay, the way I travelled was very different from the people I was guiding. I did ultralight backpacking while the scout troop I was guiding did some heavy camping. Their packs were around 40-50 lb. Mine was maybe 12, at most. I also carried a good pair of running shoes as well as wearing my hiking boots. I also carried an axe handle, bear spray, and a very loud whistle.\n\nWhen the scout masters (the adult chaperones for the kids) inevitably asked why I wasn't hiking like them, I would always tell the the truth: I don't want to spend time alone on these trails, especially around dusk. Once I'm done making sure the group is prepped for the harder stuff later in their trek, I put on my running shoes and book it to the previous camps. \"Why's that?\" they would ask. Well, these mountains are chock full of brown bears, cougars, and packs of coyotes. Lone people are way more likely to be attacked by predators, so I want to minimize the time spent on the trail alone. The bear spray and whistle, they could understand. Every person who comes to the camp is trained on how to stow and eat food as to not attract bears and told often what to do if they see a bear. So, bears are the main big animal people worry about. But they would always get confused on the axe handle. \"Is that to hit a bear?\" Oh, God no. A brown bear is huge and it's shaggy fur is like armor. It would barely (ha) feel me hitting them.\n\nBears, you can see and hear coming. You can get a precious few seconds to get your bear spray ready to ward them off. Plus, they usually do a couple of mock charges to test you out. If they get a face full of bear spray, they almost always run off. Coyotes, same thing. You can hear and smell them from a mile away with all of their yipping and chittering. Plus, they don't normally go after people. One good kick and a coyote is usually either down for the count or second guessing his life choices.\n\nBut cougars...cougars you don't see or hear coming until they are literally on top of you, trying to chomp down on your head and neck. Unlike bears and coyote, cougars still view humans as valid prey animals. To them, we're no different than a deer or goat. The only, ONLY way to get out of being attacked (and eaten) by a cougar that is attacking you is to fight like your life depends on it. Because it does. The axe handle is for fighting the cougar off of you. And the running back to the previous camps instead of a leisurely stroll is to minimize the time alone on the trail. The longer I'm alone, the higher the chance that a cougar will find and stalk me.\n\ntl;dr cougars/puma/mountain lion are dangerous. If you live in an area where they live, don't hike alone. And if you do, be loud and prepared. Also a good excuse to get involved with a trail running club so you aren't running alone.\n\nr/findthesniper\n\nFake\n\nYeeeeah, if you zoom in it definitely looks more like a mediocre Photoshop.\n\nThe noise level of the face matches the rest of the image: https://i.imgur.com/HFQODRd.png\n\nIf it's edited, it's definitely not a mediocre edit. It's unlikely to be edited though.\n\nr/ThereIsnoCat\n\nI just chuckled, \"Woah-ho-ho-hooooo, kitty cat!\" From the safety of my locked car, in the sunlight, in a parking lot where the biggest thing around is a robin. \n\nThat is the glare of a primo hunter who would absolutely murder you. Terrifying, indeed.\n\nIs this in blacksmith fork? I live in Logan, terrifying!\n\nYes it is. This was two days ago. Likely we run near them more often than we think. I think I’ll start running a bit earlier. I love the sunsets on my run but I like living too.\n\nBro what canyon so I can be aware?\n\nJust hiked this trail a couple weeks ago, holy moly that's scary\n\nI take photos on Utah trails all the time. I can’t imagine how startling it would be so see something like this in one of my photos. Did you scream out loud when you spotted it? Did you rub your eyes, and then grab the nearest person and ask if you’re seeing what you think you’re seeing?\n\nCause you were running right past Pride Rock?\n\nWhoah that kitty is close!! I had one a bit closer than that while pacing at the Rio del Lago 100 a few years ago, right before crossing Highway 49. I had never been up close to one before, thought it was a deer at first because that's what I'm used to, and then I realized what it actually was. That one at least was a lot bigger than I imagined mountain lions to be.\n\nI’m watching you, Focker!\n\nI spy with my little eye the view of someone about to die.\n\nFun fact, mountain lions are very scared of us, every now and then you'll see video of one hiding as people pass closely by. Joggers and hikers really have no idea just how many of these guys they pass on the regular.\n\nr/thereisnocat\n\nPsp psp psp\n\nKitty was like: \"Can't even take a shit in the bush without ending in a documentary.\"\n\nOh my god!!!!! Where in northern Utah was this?!\n\nLogan Area\n\nIt’s been photoshopped in his face is a lot lighter\n\nLighter than what?\n\nThis is hella photoshopped 😂 come on now\n\nThis wouldn't be a surprising occurrence at all for Northern Utah.\n\nObvious shop is obvious \n\nWhat makes you say that? Nothing obviously photoshopped about it to me \n\nOP is a regular poster in this sub, why would he want an attention? This doesn’t look like photoshop to me.\n\nGot to be photoshop haha ?\n\nNo thank you. I'd rather run with snakes than deal with the big cats, bears etc you lot have.\n\n/r/FindTheSniper\n\nOH MY GOD!!! 😱🥹\n\nima puma pants\n\nAnd I se this as I’m about to head out on my run up a desert canyon.\n\nHoly shit\n\nI actually got chills myself when I found it!\n\nGrew up in ML territory, the older hikers used to always say that there is always one watching you, we just can’t see it.\n\nIt’s just a little cougar\n\nBottom left, jesus\n\nI screamed and dropped my phone. Jesus Christ. \n\nWhen I was little, we went camping up at Strawberry Reservoir. My cousins and I found a fresh paw print and we knew it was a cougar. It was only when I was an adult that I realized the cat was probably still there, watching us.\n\nWow! Wild\n\nDang that is a big frickin cat\n\nThis is why I run with a fanny pack. Just stuff a couple puppies in there - I see a cat, I toss a puppy and keep on truckin’.\n\n😉\n\nIt was a jumpscare when I found it 😭\n\nI don't know what's more impressive....that it happened or that you actually spotted the kitty in the pic. It took me awhile. \n\nI've seen cats on my run and friends always freakout when I tell them. I always say that if they let me see them they're not a threat. It's the ones I don't see that scare me. This baby was giving you the death glare!\n\nA Bush-buddy!\n\nWell that was worth the search.  I'm poring over ever odd thing in a careful search pattern.  What's that blurry thing in the dark spot?  Could that be something?  Is this bright spot a tail of something?\n\nOh!\n\nYeah, if I took that picture I would take the highest resolution version of it and print it large and frame it and see how many guests notice.\n\nGorgeous photo !  Looking for a snake in the grass or mountain lion but not seeing\n\nr/findthesniper\n\nThis picture made me crap my pants and I’m sitting on my porch in NY.\n\nit’s like instinct told you to stop and brain was like …to take a picture :)\n\nYea that’s hunting you!!!!  Fun!\n\nNote to self, add Northern Utah …\n\nDon’t wanna be that guy but it seems fake to me. The way the left part of the face is covered ses unreal\n\nMakes you wonder how many times this has happened huh? \nSneaky kitties are everywhere\n\nIs that a Bigfoot on the ridge?\n\nPSP psp psp psp!!!\n\nSeems crazy but if I were hiking solo I’d always have a big caliber handgun on me. You never know, and yelling at a bear or a cougar that is hungry will never work"

Moral of this thread, there are people doing unfathomably impressive things all around the world.\n\nMindblowingly so. Such dedication and drive to do these things. Incredibly impressive.\n\nThere's a woman in Belgium currently doing 366 marathons in 366 days to break that feat, she's 200 days in or so\n\nThese people are idiots. If they just signed up for virtual races, they could do all of the races at the same time! It's like serving your prison sentences concurrently.\n\nwhich is, as you know, how prison sentences are served.\n\nOr did you think you can do 10 robberies, get 2 years for each and only spend 2 years in jail?\n\nAre you not aware that it depends on a lot of factors? Many are served concurrently, many are sequential.\n\nYeah this is who I was gonna bring up. The 56 hours is crazy. He did that swim in the Yukon river, and that water is cold.\n\nHe would have gone through the 5 finger rapids on that route too.\n\nTo give a little context to that, 510km in 56 hours (it was 62 hours to be exact, but close enough) would be 9km/h. Nobody in the world can swim that, that's faster than the WR 100m freestyle pace. He just swam down the Yukon river, so feels a bit like cheating with the distance.\n\nHe did swim longer than the previous 'record', which was 137km in 61hours\n\nThe record he was trying to beat on this attempt was specifically the river record, which was 481km\n\nDude, WHAT?!\n\nTo give a little context to that, 510km in 56 hours (it was 62 hours to be exact, but close enough) would be 9km/h. Nobody in the world can swim that, that's faster than the WR 100m freestyle pace. He just swam down the Yukon river, so feels a bit like cheating with the distance.\n\nHe did swim longer than the previous 'record', which was 137km in 61hours\n\nSo you're saying I could swim probably over 300 km in 56 hours just by floating?\n\nMininum. You do have to stay awake and alive though.\n\nWell not neccesarily, but you get the point.\n\nI highly encourage you to watch his YouTube documentaries. This was his third attempt at the record, and there’s a full documentary video for each attempt. Absolutely awesome dude\n\nHere’s the link to his final (successful) attempt https://youtu.be/JDXmA3iwvpY?si=iWDSrLRn1ioG9U3O\n\nGreat humble guy. Loved the documentary\n\nNot that it isn't an insane feat, but come one, feat of the century, cool down a bit.\n\nImpressive but we just had Russ Cook run 9900 miles in 347 days across Africa, they are both impressive but one two completely different levels as far as endurance feats go.\n\nThere was that guy that crossed Antarctica.\n\nShe is an amazing runner and more importantly a super kind and genuine person. Just an unreal performance\n\nTara is seriously the best. I've talked to her at a few races we've run together, and by \"together\", I mean being at the start line together, definitely running together. I was at her first 100, and then we talked at Hellbender last year. I was death-marching to a 32-ish hour finish down a dirt road, and she was picking up her drop bags at an aid station or something after having finished several hours prior and drove up beside me to cheer me on. She deserves all the recognition she's been getting recently.\n\nI probably took pics of you, I’ve shot hellbender the past few years\n\nShe makes me want to eat more candy! 🍭\n\nCandy Mama is a beast! There’s no stopping her.\n\nA true superhuman!! She’s just incredible.\n\nIs it weird that I’m a guy but all my ultra running heroes are women?\n\nAbsolutely not, interestingly enough there are some studies that show women can outrun men when it comes to true ultra distances (like 195+ miles). Generally statistics show the longer the distance the shorter the gap in competition between men and women. We’ll never be faster than a man in a 100m dash but 200 miles and we’ve got a very equal playing field! I just think it’s so cool to see women motivating EVERYONE because of athletic ability, no matter the gender!\n\nI was at Umstead when Tara won first overall. She’s an awesome ambassador of the sport. Seems like these ultra distances are the great equalizer, as there’s way more to them than just physical strength.\n\nMust be that subcutaneous fat layer lol /j\n\nNope! You are so wonderful! Thanks for being here for the women's race (and women's FKT)!\n\nHats off. Well done.\n\nAmazing! GOTR is a great cause too!\n\nShes a BEAST! And she wom Umstead 100 a few months ago!\n\nI saw them coming through Unicoi on my way to work a couple days ago and was so inspired. I mean this is AMAZING! Her splits and just her joy of doing the thing makes it So So much more.\n\nDon't  forget the elevation changes.  Crazy good!\n\n[deleted]\n\nHell yeah! Thanks for clarifying!!\n\nWho was the prev. record holder?\n\n[deleted]\n\nJurek had a northbound FKT of 46 days. Speedgoat (Karl Meltzer) had a southbound FKT of 45 days. \n\nWhat’s crazier is that both of these were supported, while in 2017, Joe “Stringbean” McConaughy got a self-supported FKT of 45 days. Doing that without any help is just crazy.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo worries. Jurek has an awesome book, called “North”, about his attempt, while Speedgoat has a cool short documentary, called “Made to be broken.” Highly recommend.\n\nI wonder what she ate the whole time\n\nHer first post completion interview was on SingleTrak and she talked about all the good people would bring in for her. A ton of home cooked meals it sounds like. She ate like a queen (was being spoon fed by someone while she would tape up her feet every morning).\n\nI just got winded going up a flight of stairs\n\n😅\n\nWhat a beast\n\nHell FUCK yeah!!!!!!!!!\n\nHell yeah!  So impressive!!\n\nAwesome\n\nI just spent time trying to clean my screen because of your avatar - well played\n\nPhenomenal!  Strength of the mind, body and soul!\n\nWas talking with my brother about this mental strength. If you think about it humans are meant/built to move like this (not saying the rest of us can by any means 😂), but the mental strength to do it is such a special skill. She has a fortress for a mind.\n\nA high school classmate is married to the photographer who followed and documented this (Hi Christie) and I have been following this for the entire run.  Absolutely incredible.  Lots of great photos and cool little blurbs about each day.\n\nThe facebook page is [here](https://www.facebook.com/schreinertrailphotography)\n\nWhat a badass!\n\nMust be in contention for that UROY performance of the year award.\n\nFKTs are historically undervalued there.\n\nYes, of course you’re right. I think I was thinking of the FKT of the Year awards. \n\nAlso, I tried looking up past UROY results and it looks like the Ultrarunning Magazine website is pay walled now. Is that new?\n\nNew owners I believe\n\nYou probably clicked on the actual digital issue.  They do a different post for each rank in the top 10.\n\nAnd she appears to have made this incredible effort in Altras !\n\nThere must be something wrong with my Altras they only take me 8-10 miles and then they quit 🫠\n\nI’m actually convinced women’s Altra’s are completely different than men’s. I read complaints about them around these parts every day but my road and trail Altra’s just won’t die. And at least on my trail pair I am actively trying to kill them.\n\nDamn. That's impressive. Well done!!!\n\nCamille Herron had allegedly updated her wiki page already.\n\nHahaha that was good laugh for me to wake up to\n\nThat’s incredible\n\nOutstanding\n\nInsane\n\nIncredible!  What an accomplishment!\n\nWhat a damn savaaaage!\n\nI've got 300k to go before I get the garmin badge it's only taken me about 400 days\n\nHoly moly\n\nSo incredibly amazing, just incredible\n\nWonder if she took any zero days? So crazy!\n\nWhat mile pace is that, roughly, if she’s running 8 hours a day?\n\nAssuming only 8 hours per day, she'd be maintaining a 6-7 mph pace.\n\n15+hours a day more likely.  It's all up if you wanted to see, but that is standard.\n\nPlus another 10 miles because you need to get your car from the southern terminus.\n\nWow.\n\n\nWonder what she ate, how much she slept, and what she carried.\n\n\nAmazing feat.\n\nHer interview over on SingleTrak answers all of that! It was a fascinating listen.\n\nThere are impressive fears, but adding speed to such a trail...I'm not so easily  comvonced. 90 odd kms a day with that much elevation? The reported 465,000 elevation over 2168miles ...something doesn't add up. 214ft gain per mile. Yeah nah.\n\nIs this verified? Strava or something?\n\nStarting at the north end means this was all downhill\n\n/S\n\n[deleted]\n\nI bet her knees are in better shape than yours, even immediately after this run"

The town isn't much, just enough to be a decent basecamp, but the area around Kanab is so beautiful.\n\nSame reason I was there. I booked 5 nights in Kanab to make sure I'd have good weather for my R2R2R. Got it done on the first day and spent the rest of the week hobbling around the fantastic locations near by.\n\nMay I ask what's R2R2R?\n\nRim to Rim to Rim of the Grand Canyon\n\nThank you\n\nR2R2R is on my bucket list. Would like to find someone to do it with though. Working on getting more of my friends into ultras.\n\nYep, this area made me realize what people meant when they said that UTAH ROCKS! It surely does.\n\nStunning. Any specific trailhead recs? Was it  beautiful weather because it’s November? \n\nCan’t wait to go myself!!!! Awesome\nPhotos. Stunning.\n\nOne of my favorite places to run in southern Utah is Buckskin Gulch. It’s the longest continues slot canyon and it’s amazing. I have backpacked this one time ran it twice. \n\n[Just grabbed first video I saw on YouTube](https://youtu.be/JMLA0hensCg?si=U-9SUOEBZgjOcTaF)\n\n[Maps and Guides](https://www.roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/escalante/buckskin-gulch)\n\nGorgeous shots. We’re trying to figure a trip out of Phoenix in a few weeks and Kanab is definitely in the mix. Have you done anything else in that area in AZ? Any recs would be helpful.\n\nAbsolutely breathtaking ♥️\n\nI love Kanab. Went to the Wave a couple of years ago and did a bunch of hiking in the area, but didn't see nearly as much water as these shots. You went to some great spots!\n\nI’ve been following your posts for a couple years now. You always go on the coolest trail trips and I am quite jealous!\n\nThanks! I look forward to these trips all year.\n\nLooks magical \nCongratulations on such a treat!\n\nthis is fucking amazing. where is that bridge?\n\nBlack Bridge over the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon\n\nWhich trails?\n\nR2R2R, Squaw, Sand Caves, Belly of the Dragon, Mansard, Bunting, Pugh, Coyote Buttes North Loop via The Notch, Water Canyon Squirrel Creek Loop, Fairyland Loop\n\nBelly of the Dragon is a really cool stop anytime someone is in southern Utah. The rest of your pics and adventure look great too!\n\nStunning photos!! I have family in Kanab and went in February. We stayed close to the Bunting trailhead. Did you see the dinosaur tracks?\n\nIt looks like another planet compared to the Canadian prairies. Can’t wait to go back.\n\nThe sun had already set behind the mesa when I got down to the Dinosaur tracks, and I couldn’t make out a single print unfortunately.\n\nTrailfest? I went a few years back. I had an amazing time, but was pretty sore for a while after 30+ mi in 3 days.\n\nWooow that is amazing\n\nEpic photos. A cool morning run in that setting sounds perfect.\n\nCan you see pic 16 from Mesa Verde National Park? I saw something that looked similar looking West from Mesa Verde but couldn’t figure out what it was. Looked like a giant natural Castle from far away\n\nNo, it’s the Tower Bridge formation at Bryce Canyon National Park\n\nYour trail running vacations are top notch. Goals.\n\nWhat an awesome place!!! Will visit someday\n\nIncredible. Adding it to my list - and near the top! Thank you!\n\nWhich trail was your photo number 18 taken on? I’m putting that on my bucket list of rock formations to geek out on.\n\nThe Wave, Coyote Buttes North\n\ni never thought to do a vacation to run!! awesome\n\nWOW!\n\nWow!  I'm impressed you were able to access \"The Wave\".  It looks like you were there at a great time in the year.\n\nWow!!\n\nWell this just got added to “the list”"

Seriously though, happy trails man. The mountains are calling!\n\nThat’s my favorite mountain to run, I miss it! Nice one. Brings back fond memories.\n\nSuch a steep ascent that last 1.5 mile. I’m sure the mountains and spirits miss you as well\n\nYes. I’ll have to put it as a priority next time I’m in California. It’s such a fun one.\n\nIf you haven’t done San Juacinto in Palm Springs or San grogonio , those two are definitely worth it as well.\n\nOi bruv. I’m in Santa Fe. Ne Mexico lmaoo.

I wish I'd get laid off again.\n\nIt’s coming.\n\nLosing a job is considered a traumatic experience hang in there trail running and hiking will be good for you probably just what you need we had a child that passed away and trail running and hiking and I think just being outdoors really helped me\n\nI pray for your peace.\n\nIt's like a summer vacation,  but in the fall.  I've been unemployed once in my career and I was in a position where I could take my time finding another job.  It was glorious.\n\nSending hugs. Let the trails be your comfort. I know this is a tough spot to be in but sending hugs and all the good vibes to you. \n\nThe trails will always treat you well! ❤️❤️\n\nNice area to clear your head and focus on your future goals. Best of luck\n\nBecome mindful. Pause. Continue. You got this.\n\nWhen trail running your mind is making about 160 decisions a minute. Good way to forget about the past and focus on the future.   Been there.\n\nYou’re pretty much a professional runner for as long as you’re running while collecting unemployment. Congrats!\n\nLove the look of those mossey trails\n\nDon’t make any dramatic changes the first month- you can land a new job, stay positive and be kind to yourself ❤️ I was there last fall\n\nThis is easy for me to say but keep your head up and in the fresh air. I recently got fired, got sued for a quarter million dollars, and went through 6 months of little sleep, high anxiety, loss of appetite, and weekly visits to a therapist. One thing I made sure to do was to always find time to run in the woods. I can't tell you how much that helped me. \n\nIn the end, I landed the best job I've ever had with a company that values work life balance. I also tripled my salary. Keep the faith! The sun will always rise again!\n\nOuch! I Will get paid for three months and then I can collect unemployment money for almost a year I think. So hopefully I will land a new job before then. Nice that it worked out for you.\n\nUnemployment was what started my running journey. Did a lot of hiking the year that I was out of work. Told myself I didn't have to put in applications if I exercised and stuck to my diet that day. It worked until my savings ran dry. Shortly after getting back to work, I started running and *faster hiking*.\n\nLeaning towards this more and more.\n\nYou're making me jealous! In all seriousness, wish you the best!\n\nI trained for my first ultra while unemployed. It was a hard 6 months but getting outside and logging fresh air hours on the trails kept me sane\n\nLucky you! I wish I were fired too. More time to run! \n\nYayy\n\nrunning+nature=peace\n\nRight there with you friend. Summer was for climbing and road tripping with my teens, fall has been wet solo trail runs. Having the time of my life.\n\nturn it into a career\n\ni wish we could just move into the forest again\n\nThis is when you get an overuse injury and don’t have insurance."

Makes me wish a few things:\n\n1) I wish I was in New Zealand. I have got to plan a trip there! \n\n2) I wish I was your dog.  Your dog looks so joyful!  Like I wish I could experience the trail run from your dog’s perspective.  Running through the woods, smelling all the smells that only a dog can smell, finding the “perfect stick”, having an owner that takes me out running…\n\ngod damn, that looks so beautiful\n\nWow thanks for the share of photos!"

They got right up to my legs and I wasn't sure whether to start kicking or picking up sticks. I can't outrun dogs I guess. Luckily I was near a brook so I dashed into water and crossed to avoid them.

I’ll pass on night runs, kthx.\n\nRight…I look at the photo with pure jealousy.\n\nI always forget what an advantage I have in being a short stocky somewhat unattractive man in this world. I can run anywhere anytime.\n\nAnywhere*\n\n*dangerous places not included\n\nI (trail) run with a group of women at 5:30am and it’s lovely. Not scary at all, a good way to meet people, and we always get to see the sun rise. I’d NEVER go out by myself in the dark (morning or night) so it’s special to get to do so in the company of other women.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’d actually feel safer running on a trail in the dark than on the road. Less likely to see someone and slow passing cars on the road freak me out even during the day. There’s also the chance of getting hit by a careless driver. Regardless, I’m not running alone in the dark anywhere.\n\nI’m not sure what you mean by confined for the rest of the day. You’re still allowed to do other things besides your one run…?\n\n[deleted]\n\nI don’t run trails by myself in the dark. I run trails with other women in the dark, however. And I go out in the dark to do other things (like drive to the gym, pool, store, etc).\n\nI live in Colorado. Not Denver area.\n\nExactly. Male privilege to even consider running alone there.\n\nI don’t think it’s male privilege. It’s a very individual choice. Some people feel safe going for a night run, and some don’t. \n\nThe only problems I’ve ever had while running have been in broad daylight, whereas my husband has only had an issue at night.\n\nYeah my first thought. Would be cool\n\nI can hear the crunchy from this photo\n\nI enjoy running at night as well. It’s the only time that I won’t be interrupted/feeling rushed. Lovely picture!\n\nThis looks out of a movie or fairytale wow\n\nI'd love to do some more trail running during the evening, but where I live (some rural part in western Europe) there are no street lights near trails! Hell there are hardly street lights near roads. My trails are all in forests, with hogs and deers and badgers. As a woman, I'm glad that I don't have to worry about not being killed or raped in this area, but I would not like to mauled by an scared and angry hog. Night road running it is.\n\nThis is not a remote location and we don’t have many wild boar in the UK but I get the safety concerns for running when it’s dark outside.\n\nI generally prefer early mornings but weather has been absolutely shite recently and it’s hard to get up when it’s windy and raining at 5am so decided to switch things up a bit for the next fee months. Been loving it so far.\n\nI often run either late at night or early morning on trails with a headlamp. Not this time of year because there are too many leaves and I can’t see the rocks.\nI’ve come face-to-face with dear a few times we were not expecting to see me, honestly maybe more often than I’ve seen people at night.\nWhen there’s nothing ahead of you, other than the oval illuminated patch from your headlamp, definitely helps me zone out.\n\nI feel ya with the weather and the darkness. Sometimes it just can’t be worked around and you’re out there in the dark. \n\nThe only thing that super freaks me out is when I show up to the city trails at 5am (sometimes it’s easier to do that for me, rather than drive out to the mountains about 20 minutes away) and I’m the only one there and worry about someone breaking into my truck, or someone watching me get ready and me not seeing them and it ending badly. Sad I even have to have that fear but yeah. Sometimes it does just give me the heebie jeebies\n\nI run at 4am. And when I see someone else arrive at the trailhead at 5, my immediate thought is what is this psycho up to. Then I remember that I am the psycho for running at 4am.\n\nlol! I love this. I don’t disagree we are crazy for being out there so early. Do you carry pepper spray or anything?\n\nBut I did just get some bear spray and it is way lighter than my firearm so I’ll probably start carrying that when/if I get spooked.\n\nNo pepper spray. \n\nBut we have a LOT of coyotes and there are a few mountain lions prowling around so sometimes I’ll run armed. \n\nBut most of the time I just go without anything and just shine my light at the coyotes. \n\nThere was a time when my dog freaked out and wouldn’t take another step so for a few days after I went armed.\n\nYou are lucky to live somewhere where people do not steal the copper out of the streetlights like that. Looks like a cool spot.\n\nWhere are you that they’re stealing copper out of street lights?\n\n[Minneapolis / St Paul](https://www.fox9.com/news/streetlight-copper-stolen-sold-by-organized-group). Basically they strip the copper wiring out of the bottom of the post and sell it for profit.\n\nI understood why someone would steal copper. I just didn’t even know people were still stealing it like that. That’s wild. Scrap yards must be paying better for copper there than where I live. We haven’t had problems with stolen copper in like ten years.\n\nIt's nice this trail is lit up!\n\nThis is a vibeeeeeeeee\n\n[removed]\n\nAhhh. Nothing beats a few sneaky sneaky turds under them.\n\nGuessing the poster is a man, feeling jealous as a woman."

    "all_comment_text": "\\*Marin Headlands making a strong appearance. \n\n  \nBut, yes, great trails. Also, Mt. Sutro, Glen Canyon, Laguna, GG Park and Presidio are wonderful too.\n\nBeing a desert guy I’m partial to Bryce, Zion, Escalante NM, GC, etc. \n\nHowever, I was in San Francisco earlier this year for a conference and I went trail running twice a day because I couldn’t get enough of their beautiful trails. I was absolutely blown away. That being said I almost got into a fight with a guy who was literally dumping his empty beer cans and bottles out of his car and on the trail and down the side of the slope. I was pissed.\n\nCool! I did a couple of long runs in Escalante and love it! But when I got back to the Bay Area I realized my happy place is in the redwoods here\n\nThe redwoods make me believe in Ents. Like it feels like something is living there and that the woods have a soul \n\nHaha yes had to include the headlands! They always feel like a treat after my trudges over the bridge dodging tourists, bikes, and listening to the loud rushes of cars\n\nWhere is photo #1? It looks unbelievably nice.\n\nAll good guesses! It’s a snap I took from the Rodeo Valley Trail Run which is in the Marin Headlands just across the GG Bridge\n\nWhich run did you do? I just Google'd \"Rodeo Valley Trail Run\" and downloaded the .gpx file for the half marathon after seeing your pics. Def going to have to head up there and try it out next time it's a little too warm to trail run at my more local parks.\n\nI did the 30k. It was SPECTACULAR!! Genuinely the coolest run I’ve ever been on\n\nCool. I ended up downloading and saving that .gpx file too. Would much rather just run it solo than be in a crowd of other runners.\n\nVery valid! Definitely not a super popular race, but the beginning was obviously super congested\n\nThank you!!\n\nOne of my favorite races EVER!\n\nOr it could be Morning Sun Trail in Sausalito. You can pick it up on a loop or right off the 101 before the Robin Williams tunnel.\n\ni would agree looks like morning sun that shifts into sca trail leading to golden gate\n\nIf I had to guess I would say the Presidio? Maybe the lovers lane trail?\n\nI can’t think of anywhere near lovers lane that would have that elevation profile. Looks like Marin to me.\n\nIt looks so much like CGI! Is it really a photo??\n\nThat area of the bay is something, especially when the fog is there.\n\nTrails in San Francisco are awesome. Amazing wilderness in a big city.\n\nMiss it so much.\n\nVisiting SF next month for a few days and I'll have alot of time to run.  What trails are these?\n\nMy favorite place to run is the Presidio! Lover’s Lane, Ecology Loop, Park Trail, and sections of the Bay Area Ridge Trail are where my everyday runs are. A few of these pics are from right over the bridge in the Marin Headlands (the bridge is ~1.7 miles across)\n\nThanks! I will be looking these up!\n\nIf you find yourself on the Oakland side of the bay, go to redwood park, my favorite trails are there!\n\nI just ran Battery to Bluffs for the first time in about a year, and there's nothing quite like it. Stairs, steep hills, straightaways, and ocean views. Highly recommended, and for an extra challenge, start with the Sand Ladder at Baker Beach!\n\nFirst pic reminds me of the Mt. Sutro / Historic trailhead — same vibes on foggy days. Love getting there via 17th Street, dashing through the woods, crossing Clarendon, then resuming at the wooded trail that leads to Sutro Tower, and eventually snakes around up to Twin Peaks.\n\nIt's incredible all the gorgeous stuff that's so interconnected across town.\n\nOh man I’m gonna have to check out the Mt. Sutro/Historic trailhead. I used to work close to mt sutro and deeply regret never bringing my running clothes to work with me\n\nThe headlands are dreamy. One of my all time favorite places to run.\n\nPeople can shit on San Francisco as much as they want (literally or figuratively) but it’s a great city. Incredible urban trails, streets designed for people and not just cars, great food. Screw the haters.\n\nI love Buena Vista Park when its foggy.\n\nSuch an underrated park I feel. Yet one of the most beautiful!\n\nWhile the rest of the West coast was melting a month ago, the dripping dew felt like a light rain in that park at 9am. I'm so jealous of SF trails.\n\nI love walking my pup there, but I can say I don’t see many runners! It’s small and all elevation so maybe that’s why. Not hard to string it to the panhandle and GGP for infinite mileage though.\n\nI love my hometown!!\n\nThe whole combination of images could only make me remeber \"rise of the planet ofthe apes\". \nIt is so awesome\n\nReally nice! Made me miss my redwood regional morning runs 😭\n\nCan’t wait to hit the trails there sometime next year, especially in the fog\n\nDon't mind me...I am just jealous AF!  Awesome pics and thanks for sharing.\n\nTheres some nice trails on skyline around where page mill meets up with it, just south of san andreas lake - horse shoe lake area. Trail network goes down into big basin from there (skyline to sea trail included). Been dying to go stomping around in muir woods, tgats where your first pic is, right?\n\nOooh I gotta check that out sometime. And I’m honestly not sure, I took the first photo from the Rodeo Valley Trail Run last months\n\nBeautiful\n\nKnee deep in the hoopla\n\nWhat about Mill Valley? Any good trails up there?\n\nThere is a huge race through those trails in November. Golden Gate Classic I believe…\n\n\"Fake trails of San Francisco\"\n\nHuh? These are trails and this is San Francisco, what is fake about them?\n\nHaha, sorry OP. Didn't mean to troll. It's a reference to an Arctic Monkeys song and also looks too good to be true. Was hoping someone would get it. \n\nLove the shots!\n\nLol thanks for the clarification 😂 what’s the name of the song? I really like Arctic Monkeys!\n\nFake Tales of San Francisco XD\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b70Crpl2s2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b70Crpl2s2U)\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe city’s definitely not for everyone! But it harbors a cool crowd aside from the techies :)\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo. I work in education and do speech therapy home health visits. The furthest you’ll get from tech bro. Sf has public servants too!"

I usually run in road shoes on firm forest trails, but I’m wondering if trail shoes would still offer any benefits, even in the light conditions I have around here (also no big hills).

What if there’s negative average kinetic energy?\n\nyou don't have \"degrees\" kelvin, it's just kelvin\n\nGood point. I forgot that the title mentioned that.\n\nWow! And I thought our 28 degree run in the Smokies was cold! We did do a cold plunge in the river afterwards but I still feel you got us beat😂😂\n\nI didn’t dare do a cold plunge after my run 😂. Sounds like you had a fun day too!\n\nAny day running mountains is a great day!\n\nHahaha I was gonna say same because I ran in 28 degrees yesterday. Until you got to the cold plunge…..?????!!!!!! Hahaha\n\nIt wasn’t smart but it was fun😂😂\n\nI cannot imagine, but absolute respect to you haha! \n\nI mean I love a rush as much as the next person, but someone’s going to have to throw me in to get this one! lol if I ever make it to Alaska just surprise me haha\n\nWould it be annoying or useful to just run with ski goggles on at this temp?\n\nLots of people do that up here, I haven’t tried but I probably should see if it helps with the snowy eyelashes.\n\nI just feel like my eyeballs would freeze and crack, lol. Hardcore stuff! Good going!\n\nNever had any issues with cold eyeballs haha! And thanks!\n\nI’m shocked no one has asked about your gear yet! Any interest in sharing some of your gear?!\n\nIt’s a random assortment of things I already have but it works well for me: \n\nBottom: Two pairs of tights (a fleece lined winter running tight with a north face wind stopper tight on top) and a down skirt Top: merino wool long sleeve top, fleece quarter zip and lululemon running jacket (this is a men’s, it’s roomier than the women’s) Accessories: balaclava, winter mittens and darn tough socks Shoes: la sportiva blizzard\n\nSo nothing unheard of! I’m very impressed. There’s such a high level of anxiety and fear that I’d have to overcome to run for that long in that cold! The cold comes alive at that temp, like a beautiful demon trying to transform you into ice. Anything less than 25 degrees Fahrenheit scares me.\n\nI get that, I started off going with a friend on these runs because it’s so remote and so cold. I am used to it now and I feel confident because I know I can run the distance in these temperatures. I usually have my garmin inreach with me in case something happens. The cold is also a beautiful beast that opens up a whole new world of sounds and frost patterns.\n\nStill, that’s an incredible achievement! I bet it’s nice to be the only one out there though.\n\nLooks like a great place to run!\n\nIt’s beautiful\n\nWinter running is the best\n\nMakes me feel better about the 5 degree (F) forecast for my run tomorrow morning!\n\nThe thumbnail on a phone makes it look like you’re wearing a helmet.\n\nI just as soon stub my toe.\n\nDamn! That’s so awesome.\n\nHow do you even differentiate between negative 32 and negative 40? It was positive 50 here this morning and I chanced it with only one long sleeve.\n\n+50 is quite dangerous, it's not far off a literal sauna\n\nI didn’t know this was possible. 🤯\n\nIt gets colder than this 😉\n\nYou are a rockstar 🌟\n\nMy favorite comment here, so I’m just gonna reply to you to tell OP that I agree with luccsmom!\n\nYou are both super nice! Thank you ☺️\n\nLikely so beautiful! Sounds like a great run.\n\nSpeaking of sound -At that temperature snow has a fascinating snappy crunch to it. Like walking on very loud styrofoam.\n\nI've run in -40 ish in Northern Quebec and fully agree. It sounds like small Styrofoam bubbles scrunching.\n\nI just got frost bite thinking about that!\n\nReminds me of winters in Fairbanks.  Rock on.\n\nThat’s bad ass! How good did the hot shower feel afterwards?\n\nI spent longer than I needed in the shower haha\n\nIs this something you need special training for?\n\nNot really, you get used to it and with the right clothes it’s not cold at all.\n\n&gt;-32C  \n😬  \ni travel to japan during winters for snowboarding. \neven in evening/night as i do short runs, at most i experience probably -6C.  \ncant imagine -30C\n\nMan I thought it was decently cold on my long walk today (20 fahrenheit). Good shit though, looks beautiful out there!\n\nAnd here I thought trail running in the southern interior of British Columbia 12 months of the year was something.....\n\nHard core!  \n\nI usually quit running at less than -10C and quit hiking or cross country skiing below -22C.   Whimper, whimper.  \n\nBeautiful setting!\n\nThe coldest I’ve ever been on a run was running through the winter rain in Vancouver. I prefer cold dry temperatures any day!\n\nAbsolutely.  I grew up in Ottawa where the windchill factor compounded by humidity can be brutal.\n\nYou have such a strong will🙏 I am very impressed by your commitment! I wish you to have all the best running clothes and accessories to let you enjoy these winter runs as comfortably as you wish🙏\n\nThis is unreal! You are a goddess of running:-) Keep it up!\n\nThank you 🥰\n\ni think we would be friends\n\nKudos.  I tap out of long runs below zero f.\n\nIs this a joke -32 / -40?  Like are you being funny?\n\nCan you feel the difference between the two? And what happens if you start sweating?\n\nOh yea I can feel the difference! Sweat just freezes on you, it’s honestly fine.\n\nAwesome! 😀\n\nAlso a really beautiful picture! 🥰\n\nWould love to hear what running is like at those temperatures (think the coldest I've done is around -5°C) - that was very much alright (needed more warming up of the muscles I've found, and proper gear (merino layers and a shell, basically - what are you using I wonder?)\n\nHave a lovely Sunday!\n\nHonestly the main difference is that the air is cold to breathe so I need breathe through a balaclava. I wear a lot of warm layers, I am really not cold at all so my warmup takes the same time as when it’s warmer.\n\nFor gear:\n\nBottom: Two pairs of tights (a fleece lined winter running tight with a north face wind stopper tight on top) and a down skirt \nTop: merino wool long sleeve top, fleece quarter zip and lululemon running jacket (this is a men’s, it’s roomier than the women’s)\nAccessories: balaclava, winter mittens and darn tough socks \nShoes: la sportiva blizzard \n\nVery toasty combo!\n\nThanks for the reply!\n\nDouble tights plus down skirt does sound toasty 🙂\n\nI also am not cold at all, meaning I guess my body temperature rises quickly when I start running but my muscles do need more time so I can't just run out the door in winter I've found.\n\nAs a California runner; nah I’m good that’s gnarly. It’s 70 and sunny right now I’m gonna go run in that.\n\nI’ve climbed Denali and experienced the cold but having the drive to run in those temps is wild to me. Mad respect.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAwesome, I volunteered for that race (I was supposed to run it but got injured). I love the username 😂\n\nHow do you hydrate when it’s this cold? Does your water just turn to ice?\n\nI dont need to eat or drink for that distance. If I run further and I need water I just wear my running vest under my jacket and the water doesn’t freeze.\n\nHow do you keep frostbite at bay for the toes and fingers? Hot hands or electric gloves? 👀\n\nNo just warm mittens and socks\n\nI did these in Edmonton winters. I had to make sure my breathing was slow, otherwise I'd increase my risk of lung issues.\n\nI mean this is a treadmill run for me while adjusting the incline several times every few minutes....sorry.\n\nBadass!"

I was worried we'd get last year's temps you all had. The temps were maybe 40F-50F? Yes, we had some snow, graupel and rain, but not crazy thankfully :)\n\nThat’s perfect running weather. Congrats!\n\nYay! I know some folks were frustrated about amount of time on road due to necessary course changes, buts looks gorgeous.\n\nYes, we had a total of 10 miles on pavement, which was unfortunate (permit issues), but the rest 20 or so miles were just gorgeous so we had plenty of views to enjoy.\n\nBeautiful! Might now be a race I add to my bucket list!\n\nIt was indeed! They had issues with permits this year and the first and last 5 miles were on pavement, but the other 20 or so miles were gorgeous trails :)\n\nSweet! That one is on my list for next year!! What was your time?\n\n6:44 - slow compared to more than half of runners . The course was probably faster this year, because the first and last 5 miles were on the road ( it was my first time here)\n\nI love the area. So awesome\n\nwith views like that it'd be a crime not to slow down and just take it all in\n\nBad-Ass! Great job!!👏🏽\n\nThank you!!\n\nLove the Methow Valley, absolutely beautiful!\n\nLooks amazing!  This is one I have in the list for next year and your photos are making me more excited about it.  And congrats!\n\nBeautiful! I wanted to do the 20M but 10M+ on the road for my first trail race was a little disappointing. Next year!\n\nNever do! Congrats you two!!\n\nThank you!\n\nwhy all trees are dead ?\n\nSpecifically this was the [Cedar Creek Fire in 2021](https://www.nwhikers.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8035955).\n\nWildfires\n\nLooks like beetle kill to low intensity burn.\n\nBasically climate change is forcing pine forests out of lower elevations and lower latitudes in the Rockies and across the West.\n\nThe mechanism is the pine beetle but pine beetles have always been part of the local ecosystem. When the winters are cold enough, the population dies back. It's something like 30 days under 0C/30F for populations to die back appropriately. The Rockies are warming in the winter so they aren't reaching these lows. This leads to forest death.\n\nStanding dead is then very vulnerable to wildfires. The wildfires allow the standing dead to be recycled into nutrients. New trees eventually replace the pines. My experience here is that they are mostly being replaced by aspens. However, aspens use a lot more water than pines. So it'll be interesting to see how groundwater recharging is affected over time by this change in forest type.\n\nMore [here.](https://discover.lanl.gov/news/1122-bark-beetles/#:~:text=22%2C%202021%E2%80%94In%20California's%20Sierra,beetles%20do%20under%20drought%20alone.)\n\nThis particular area was hit by the Cedar Creek Fire a few years ago, which was a huge 50,000+ acre high intensity fire that took out plenty of otherwise fire-adapted big trees.\n\nhttps://www.nwhikers.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8035955\n\nOoo. Even better, actual facts! \n\nFires are part of the natural cycle as well but it sucks when they get so big due to previous fire suppression. \n\nThanks!\n\nI would also like to know!\n\nProbably a pine beetle or similar infestation. Out in Utah, mainly the Uinta mountain range, the pine beetles have decimated about 50% of the forest.\n\nThat looks lovely! 🥰\n\nAmazing. People are amazing.\n\nGosh that's pretty! I'd turn it from a race to a... whatever the opposite of a race is where you go as slow as possible in order to soak in the view.\n\nStunning photos! Thanks for sharing them!\n\n🤩🤩🤩 that looks beautiful!\n\nLook like Colorado? Amazing stuff\n\nIt’s washington\n\nAnd here I was trying to figure out which organic molecule you'd love enough to get it tatted on both calves... Until I saw pic4.\n\nStunning.. where were you??\n\nExcuse me. Did u just got up and ran a 50k?? I mean what has the world come to. That’s an achievement a not a reddit post."

    "all_comment_text": "That place to me is heaven. The slot canyons are my favorite. It’s just a massive playground for adults.\n\nbut no wolves\n\nThe Narrows is such a good hike. I got to do Angel's Landing a few times before it became a lottery. Most frightening hike I've ever been on - particularly the time it was iced over and snowing.\n\nNarrows are fun for sure. I love it but I am more of a fan of the technical slots. They’re just breathtaking.\n\nHoly shit I just noticed your username, AND just finished book 13. See ya on the trail fellow nerd!\n\nHave you discovered Dungeon Crawler Carl yet? If you’re a nerd like me you’ll love it.\n\nNope but it looks right up my alley. Thank you!\n\nHow was it? Any other runners? I do want to go to Zion but I haven’t even started researching it yet. I am not keen on some of the crowds I have seen but it still seems very worth it and I imagine there are strategies/times to limit crowds.\n\nThe crowds and the lack of long trails are what have kept me away, but I decided to say screw it and went anyway. Im glad I did because it is an epic park! \n\nThere weren’t any other runners, but we started early and were able to bypass most of the hikers going to Angles Landing via the West Rim trail (pic 1-3), but there were A LOT of people on the way back. Once you get past Angels Landing, you have the trail to yourself. Even with the crowds, this one is a must do and was my favorite. \n\nPic 4 was a really cool route and that was actually on the East Side of the park where there was practically no one. We took a shuttle from East Zion Adventures and were dropped off at the Stave Springs TH, then went and tagged Observation Point and ended at the East Mesa TH where we were picked up. Highly recommend this one if you want no crowds. It’s a little over 9 miles point to point.\n\nThank you for the info! I have done quite a few popular trails in my area where coming back I passed a city’s worth of people starting, lol. Sounds like a good time to me.\n\nDon't miss it! Feb and Nov are shoulder months for Utah so it's more affordable but all of these places are awesome during the winter too.\n\nUnreal beauty. Can you share some of your routes? Distances?\n\nPic 1-3: Stopped at Shuttle Stop #6. Went to the Emerald Pools and then went up the West Rim Trail and passed Angels Landings. 12 miles out and back @ 1900ft gain (3 for Emerald Pools, 9 on West Rim) but you can continue on the West Rim and make it longer. \n\nPic 4: Stave Springs to Observation Point to East Mesa. Point to point. Used East Zion adventures for shuttling. See my other comment for more info. 9 miles @ 1700ft gain. \n\nPic 5: Watchman Trail out and back from the Visitor Center. 3 miles @ 500ft gain.\n\nThis is Zion National Park, Utah, right?\n\nYes. And it’s amazing!\n\nHardly looks real. Beautiful. Thanks for sharing.\n\nLooks really beautiful.\n\nSuch amazing pics.\n\nI want there, I need there! 😍\n\nIt looks incredible. I wish I could go there to walk and run.\n\nI just ran the Moab trail marathon this last weekend. It was rainy on Sunday and I would’ve loved to go visit.\n\nWow!\n\nHad a  chance to visit the park five years ago... just a great place to be. Incredible!\n\nBeautiful"

    "all_comment_text": "Over here looking for the mountain lion lurking in the background of them.\n\nMountain lions, or as I like to call them ‘friends I haven’t met yet’.\n\nDarling, that’s very close to what they call you “snacks we haven’t tasted yet.”\n\nWe did find a massive freshly killed elk. It has had something eating it for few days. I have photos but I thought it might be a little too gross to share here.\n\nBloody corpses are better than bloody gates!\n\nI guess that depends on if you’re the corpse or not.\n\nExactly my thought\n\nWhere is the danger kitty?\n\nDidn’t see it today. I think we found an elk it’s been eating though which likely explains its presence. I have photos but they’re pretty graphic and my wife suggested I not share them.\n\nI think that would be really cool to see! Perhaps you can share on r/natureismetal or r/hardcorenature.\n\nHoly single-track Batman!\n\nOddly, my black labs name is Batman. So your comment is oddly appropriate.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt’s Blacksmith Fork Trail in Cache Valley Utah.\n\nI thought I recognized this as Logan area!\n\nOut here living in Boston but originally from Brigham City. Love seeing my old stomping grounds\n\nWas looking for the kitty too 😂\nBeautiful out there. Hope to try one day\n\nBeautiful\n\nIt really is. Very lucky to live here.\n\nWow!!\n\n… urge to hike/run the Wasatch rising.\n\nIm excited I’m heading up to Montana next week to get some running in. I’m pretty excited. I always see such amazing photos from up there.\n\nLooks lovely. I like it when people post pictures of the trails they run, so that you can see the variety. \n\nIt also highlights to me, here in the UK, how lucky we are that when we head out onto the trails/mountains, we don't need to worry about coming across any mountain lions, bears, coyotes etc.\n\nI was thinking about that last night. Is there a history of large predators there ever? Or was that just never a thing?\n\nNo, we don't get anything like this. The only large wildlife I see are deer/stags, the occasional mountain hare or foxes. But usually it's cows, sheep, birds of prey etc.\n\nIt seems crazy to me, when I read that people go on runs and carry pepper spray in case they come across bears. If I lived in those parts of the world, I'm not sure I'd be running the trails as I'd be nervous. I always run alone and I'm grateful that I can just head out and not worry about being attacked by animals.\n\nYeah we have bears here for sure. But they aren’t typically a concern. If you don’t startle them, get between them and their food, or between a mother and her cubs. If you are in an area where they frequently are just make noise and they’ll steer clear of you. And like anything else there are exceptions but that’s very rare.\n\nI assumed that bears were always a threat. Over here in the UK, if you get too close to deer and their young or during rutting season, you may get charged by them, but it's rare. As long as you respect their environment and space, the chances of being charged are rare.\n\nHonestly, the same is true here. Moose (and bison in my area and a few others) are significantly more dangerous to encounter on a run.\n\nIIRC, that was the range of the last Utah grizzly, \"Old Ephraim\".\n\nVery close. He was in Logan Canyon in the end which is 4 or 5 canyons north of this one. Though the do connect if you go north-east enough.\n\nOh my goodness I love this\n\nI don’t think I will ever grow tired running there.  Can you run year round there?\n\nIf you like running in snow sure. But also have to stay up on avalanche danger awareness and knowledge.\n\nThere are trails you can run all year for sure. However, as   u/TrailGains pointed out you’ll be in snow which can bring its own set of dangers and challenges. Microspikes, gloves, and a cap and you’re ready to go when the conditions are safe.\n\nMan that’s perfection. Envious on the east coast.\n\nThis is Utah. No coasts here unfortunately.\n\nThis makes me miss Utah. Enjoy it to it's fullest!\n\nI do every day man. I do consider myself very lucky to live here.\n\nBeautiful. I run and hike a lot in the mountains in Washington and this seems calmer and serene comparatively.\n\nThat’s funny to see here. My wife is from the San Juan Islands up there and she is always saying how much better Washington is. I think it’s normal to love where you grew up though. And the many times we’ve returned to her home and the nearby islands I have to admit it’s a beautiful state.\n\nDifferent types of beautiful! I’m originally from Nova Scotia which is also beautiful but very different from either Utah or WA!\n\nThat is a gorgeous trail!! Lucky you!\n\nBeautiful\n\nBeautiful!\n\nBeautiful\n\nAstounding Beautiful\n\nGlad y'all are getting some nice weather up there. I'm in southern Utah and keep talking to folks from up north being over the random snow and rain still hitting.\n\nYeah it’s been a lot this year for sure. But the rewards of the rain are well worth it. Everything is green, our lakes and reservoirs are full and running in the rain isn’t so bad .\n\nI am jealous of southern Utah though. I’m very big into canyoneering so I spend a good amount of time down there every year.\n\nThose trails are butter\n\nIs that a good thing?\n\nIt’s the best thing\n\nNice.\n\nSpectacular!!\n\nGot to run this trail last Sept but, unfortunately, it was an early start and kinda dark. ;)\n\nAwesome! Looks perfect. \nI’m new to trail running and love it already. There’s something about running (and hiking) in natural beauty.\nThanks for sharing. \nEnjoy your runs!\n\nI could not agree more with you. It does so much for my mental health. It renews me. I’m glad you enjoy it as well. I’ll watch for your photos of your local trails.\n\nFantastic"

The running and views were great.  There were lots of hikers and hippies along the way.  Nudity is so common there that it didn’t feel at all strange to be passing and in many cases talking to people.  I talked to several couples about my run and the soaked in some hot springs.   All in all this was my favorite nudist experience, and I checked the box for “run a nude half marathon on trails” off my bucked list.",

Dude’s got a Prince Albert piercing big enough to hang a bottle of water from.  That thing’s gotta be swinging like a giant metronome.\n\nAttach a Stryd to it for science\n\nThe new footpath feature would make an interesting diagram. Conversations with certain people resulting in stiffer movement, etc.\n\nLmao that thing is wild\n\nThat’s one way to help maintain a high cadence\n\nI'm glad I don't remember what that is. \n\nI think the simile you wanted was it was swinging like a pendulum but still effective and funny none the less!\n\nI can't be the only dude who runs in a kynodesme!\n\nI regret googling that.\n\nI appreciate you googling that for me.\n\nI just looked at Wikipedia...seeing a penis in a Wikipedia article was a first for me...do not recommend looking it up on Wikipedia.\n\nShould I google that?\n\nNo\n\nDo it and report back\n\nIt's a article of modesty (and maybe restriction--I didn't read that far) worn by ancient Greek athletes. \n\nThere is only one thing that’s loose, and we evolved for that to be fine on runs\n\nNothin’ boosts your confidence like seeing your workout dick.\n\nThat includes the attached hood ornament seen in other NSFW posts. \n\nSeems like a liability if any mild bushwacking is involved (no pun intended)\n\nTell me you're male without telling me you're male.\n\nThere's two loose things and they require significant engineering to be fine on runs.\n\nSing it, sister - chasing my cat around the apartment is pushing the limits of running without a  bra! lol\n\nI thought this was r/runningcirclejerk for a second.\n\nIt WILL be there.\n\nAs it should!\n\nShoes? The only way to feel more naked than naked is to be naked with shoes.\n\nI’m not ready to go that far.  I wore shoes.  It would have been hard barefoot with all the rocks\n\nYeah sorry man, not nude. You’ll get em next time!\n\nDoesn't count as full nude then...at least put an *\n\nOh I bet ;)\n\nThis statement is the most true of any here.\n\nShoes and his Garmin watch.\n\nI've never considered naturism, but the idea of running remote trails stark bollocks naked is actually really appealing.\n\nAs someone who runs with just shorts as often as possible I find it very appealing too, but the bug situation would be what would concern me. I hate pulling mosquitoes or some small insect off my sweaty chest let alone my sweaty 🏀⚾️\n\nThose balls are different sizes and colors. You should get that checked out.\n\nSir are you, by chance, British?\n\nTally ho, I find it a right smart idea to take one’s morning constitutional in buff, Tut tut!\n\nIt’s really fun in the right location.  In addition to this, I ran a beach marathon nude 2 years ago.  This was better\n\nSand!!!????!\n\nYeah, how did you avoid it getting everywhere?\n\nYou can run on sand with out it going anywhere except your shoes\n\nI tried early season at Island Royale for 5k round trip, and It was freeing but added another level of fall danger.\n\nRight? I’ve done nudist/naturist things before and am even a member of AANR but never considered a whole trail run. 🏃🏽‍♀️\n\nI knew there would be a massive cock ring, there’s always a massive cock ring. 😂\n\nWow, at first I thought you meant while trail running and how did it not fall off. Then I realized, not while trail running lol\n\nno, all the time\n\nOh, TIL haha thanks\n\nThe loose skin on my belly and thighs combined with my big swingers on my chest makes running nudes seem very uncomfortable for me. Very jealous of those with tighter bodies\n\nI just assumed OP was male because I could not imagine running without “the ladies” strapped down on my chest! Once I ran without headphones on, in a looser sports bra and I could hear my boobs slapping up and down. 😳😩\n\nYes I am relatively slim with average sized boobs but I still feel like preparation every run is just strapping parts of my body down so they don’t move 🤣 compression top, compression shorts, compression sports bra - just STAY PUT\n\nAfter a few years of running and drifting toward menopause, I can run with a slightly less serious bra (but usually still opt for the armor). Not sure I'm ready to go bra-less. I think I'd still rather go barefoot than barechest.\n\nSerious question (I’m okay with nudism and celebrate ppl finding their joy in whatever): have you considered blurring your dick rather than your face? I feel like you can have a greater impact and engagement with nudists/non-nudists alike by discussing the joys of your passion without all the emphasis being squarely on your junk, but rather on you as a person in society with some unique perspective to offer.\n\nHe hasn't because this is sexual for him. It's clearly about the exhibitionism. He posted those pictures across a ton subreddits.\n\nskin cancer is so retro\n\nL M A O 🤣\n\nSeeing a naked person running towards me on a trail 🫣\n\nIt would take some restraint not to pepper spray them on instinct!\n\nCan you wear shoes?\n\nI wore shoes.  I can’t imagine doing it barefoot given the rocks etc,  I also wore a watch.  If it’s not on Strava did it happen?  (Though I made it private so you won’t find it).  I have done shorter runs on the beach completely nude and barefoot.\n\nI have so many questions but this was definitely my main one\n\nRunning trails always reminds me of ticks and that makes me reconsider.\n\nI have plucked a wood tick off my pecker and it's not that big of a deal. \n\nThe main thing was wondering if that counted as a BJ.\n\nWatch out for ticks in unexpected areas\n\nRisky click of the day arrived early today\n\nI ran a naked 5k race once and suffered quite severe chafing\n\nI used body glide and had no issues.\n\nAfter looking through your post history OP, you seem to be one of the most unapologetically free people I’ve ever come across. You do you man! Seems like you’re leading a very happy life\n\nThanks!  But remember this is only one aspect of my life.  The nudity and running are definitely both outlets for me.   But I lead a pretty standard life other wise.  It’s important to have hobbies.  This is clearly mine.\n\nWould love to know where this is. May want to do this myself.\n\nDeep creek hot springs.  I can give you all the details if you want.  Dm me.\n\nThat was on my list of hikes when I lived in San Diego, but I never made it out there. Didn't  know it was a nudist area. Still wish I had done the hike. Next time I make it out to CA, I'll  make it a definite  part of my trip. I'll Dm you in a moment.\n\nEverywhere is a nudist area with the right attitude.\n\nDid you wear shoes?  If not barefoot , then you were only partially nude.\n\nAm afraid to ask where you put the gels.\n\nThis was no 5k ultra. No gels were consumed.\n\nPics or didn't happened.\n\nLook at the dudes profile, it's literally tons of pictures of him running nude.\n\nWhy did I do that \n\nSame\n\nThat piercing! Ughhhhhhh...\n\nMy day is ruined and my disappointment immeasurable.\n\nI mean…it’s just naked person, but OP, since you put it out there you are going to get my opinion: both the piercing and shaving your pubes but not the rest of your body hair look super tacky.\n\nI clicked before I even noticed the username. Totally deserved.\n\nI regret that decision.\n\nThank you for making this sacrifice so I didn’t have to\n\nI should have believed you before entering his profile.\n\nFUCK ME IN THE ASS. DAMMNIT WHYYY did i click on that\n\nThe real achievement is the amount of Reddit karma you can get from reposting the same activity as many times as possible.\n\n4K UltraHD video or it didn't happen\n\nRan on the beach yesterday and passed a lot of nudists. Didn’t feel compelled to strip down hah\n\nThat’s where you and I differ. :). But I get it.\n\nGlad you enjoyed.  \n\nMy chest hurts even contemplating this.\n\nSame\n\nMe, swiping the photos with apprehension…\n\nWhat an epic day out. Hope you 'wore' suncream though!\n\nProbably took 15 minutes applying it to one place and then was too tired to run.\n\nI’d be so paranoid about wiping out and smashing my you-know-whats\n\nI did partial fall on a really steep slope but it was totally safe in that way\n\nToo funny not to share on r/ultralight_jerk\n\nIt's on r/runningcirclejerk ..\n\nWhy nude?\n\nNovelty?  Going over a forbidden line?  For excitement?  I’m not sure why people are nudists exactly, but there really does seem to be something about it for me and others.  It gives me a feeling of total acceptance of my body and person.\n\nThe best I ever felt about my body was during the short time I went to the YMCA pool. The changing rooms had a hot tub, sauna, and steam room that folks used naked *all the time*. Spending quiet time around all those different bodies really shifted how I saw myself. I miss it to be honest.\n\nI don't even walk around nude in my own house when I'm the only one here. The only time I'm nude is when I'm changing clothes or in the shower. I'm basically a nevernude. There are dozens of us. \n\nBut whatever. Rock out with your cock out if it makes you happy.\n\nWhy not?\n\nSunburn in \"unusual places\".\n\nfew reasons from the top of my head:  \n- If you get injured, you will be rescued naked;  \n- you could hurt you penis by hitting something, spikes, rock, floor.:\n\n- bouncing balls might hurt after a while\n\nAlso: ticks\n\nYep, a tick on the ...     \nThat would really suck.\n\nI recently learnt a new word. I can't believe my luck that I actually got to use it so soon. \n\nDid you use a Kynodesme?\n\nI just learned a new word too.  But no, I didn’t use that.\n\nHaha sorry it was just a joke question. I don't have the balls (lol) nor the physique to even attempt to do something like this.\n\nCool but personally I would worry about chafe\n\nBody glide handles that\n\nSure as long as you only need one application or don’t mind carrying it\n\nWhere did you keep your camera?\n\nI have an arm band pouch for my keys and phone.\n\nHmmm ....\nThis would give new meaning to a      \n\"fanny pack\" ...\n\nNew Quest Added: Freedom Trail\n\nDid someone say \"Femdom trail\"?\n\nNever knew this was a thing\n\nAwesome . Ive always wanted to do this, but a lot stops me . I suppose in a location where I am traveling would be the most ideal for me. \n\nThe closest I’ve come to running nude would be barefoot , shirtless and bathing shorts with glasses of course lol. \n\nI THINK IN ALL HONESTY THE ITEM I WOULDN’T WANT TO GIVE UP THE MOST WOULD BE THE GLASSES LOL.\n\nNew goals!\n\nPics or it didn't happen.\n\nDid it take more antichafe cream than usual?\n\nWhat is this r/nakedadventures  (warning NSFW) now?\n\nIf only I had body like yours.\n\nDoes it really count if you wore shoes and socks?\n\nwell done. need this in WA\n\nDid this once with the San Diego HHH out east  of SD.  Was TOO fun\n\nGive me details.  I could use a next quest\n\nCan’t find the San Diego hash link, but here’s the camp site.  [nude trials and camping](https://deanzasprings.com/hiking-trails/)\n\nIs this on circlejerk yet\n\nCalifornian here! Greatly interested exactly where on the Pacific trail this was! \n\nAlso, this sounds so refreshing and beautiful. I got married on a clothing optional beach. We were all clothed.  My mother-in-law couldn't have handled it otherwise 😆😆😆 but also it was a bit cold! But I saw some people swimming in the ocean naked and it just looked so peaceful and wonderful. I bet running nude was awesome.\n\nHard pass, lol.\n\nWhen I was in college in the '70s, a streaker going in for a layup at a basketball game was described as making a flaccid attempt.\n\nBet ya got cool tan lines now\n\nI still have tan lines :(\n\nI'm going to be out that way (Vallejo) for work for a month, gonna have to run that trail... probably naked too\n\nDo you have a bad need for confirmation? \n\nI opened your profile and see you regularly are posting in different subs that you’re doing naked runs and including explicit photos of your naked body.\n\nGood for you, this is a great idea!\n\nI always say that running (and maybe swimming) is the only sport that doesn’t require a single piece of gear, clothes and shoes included! Okay maybe shoes depending on the terrain.\n\nThat’s gon be a no from me.  While I’m all for it at the beach and water, bugs love me.\n\nDid this topless once and got poison oak\n\nMy body doesn’t respond to poison ivy or oak which is an advantage.  Bummer that happened.\n\nWow you are naturally gifted. You have to be a nudist! Or is it naturist?\n\nHow sunburnt is your ass now?!\n\nI went early so I’m fine.  Also sunblock\n\nI don’t believe ya send pics or didn’t happen\n\nCheck my profile if you want them.  I wanted a broader running nerd discussion here so I kept it tame.\n\nIt’s grand I believe you\n\nSomehow, I'll believe this person.     \nI REALLY do NOT want to see pictures ...\n\nHow bad are your sunburns? Hope you put on some good sunblock\n\nI went early so I was fine. No burns\n\nA few years ago in my late 30s I did a nude 5k in Florida. Never really had an issue with nudity and went to university in Santa Cruz where we’d go topless on the rare nice days but hadn’t run naked before and it was oddly delightful. However chafing is a thing on my inner thighs so longer than that would be an issue for me, maybe a 10k at most.\n\nBag balm would probably solve the chafing issues\n\nBody glide solves that\n\nDid you run barefoot too for the complete experience?\n\nNope.  I wore shoes.  Rocks are hard on bare feet.\n\npics or it didn’t happen\n\ni would consider\n\nCool! I want to do this\n\nAwesome.  Feel free to dm me queations\n\nSalute to you for doing the activity that makes my dick the smallest in the nude\n\nStop advertising your onlyfans. Reported.\n\nYou gotta get to the Napali Coast someday\n\nOhh.  Tell me more!\n\nIt's about the most beautiful trail in the world...and most of it is clothing optional. It's specifically the kalalau trail\n\nWhere is it?  In Hawaii?\n\nYes, Kauai.\n\nRoadtrip\n\nSounds terrible.\n\nSerious question .. how did you handle chaffing.\n\nBody glide.\n\nThis looks amazing, where was it? Would you be willing to post your route?\n\nDm me\n\nThis is what night runners do here. Run naked, but at night lol.\n\nBut… why tho?\n\nr/ultralightjerk is becoming too literal\n\n[deleted]\n\nImagine David Goggins coming along as this was going on:\n\n\"STAY HARD!\"\n\nThis sounds cool. Would like to do… ah, I knew you’d be a male tho. I’m a B cup and I can still feel a bounce going quickly upstairs! Idk how I’d feel w/o some support from a sports bra. Did some ppl run it just skimpily clad ?\n\nBear, I choose Bear.\n\nName checks out. But a question:  you’ll run naked in public (so to speak) yet you blur your face in your profile…seems incongruent.\n\nNo one will remember me where I run, but the internet can follow you everywhere\n\nYes!!!!\n\nFair point.\n\nEwww, no snacks or water?  Weird flex but ok.  \n\nI had a hydration pack too.\n\nSo you were  basically shirt cocking with shoes on.   Sounds less like “running naked” and more like “running with your d*** out”.   Again, weird flex but ok.  \n\nI like the blunt way you put this."

    "body": "So I traveled 2 hours to upper northern michigan, got an Airbnb for the weekend. Drive to venue this morning to try to find race check in, see 4 others in race gear looking. Go to front desk of ski resort, \" there's more of you that haven't heard\", \" race was canceled last month\". Fuckkkk, I was upset, made this my A race for year. Tried calling event company that put on race, no answers,  emailed them, they emailed back said they posted on social media it was canceled, i still don't see it posted anywhere. They said we can pick a event on next year's calendar. I'm flabbergasted,  it was a 2 day stage race. Me and about 15 others showed up without knowing race was canceled. Delete if not allowed,  just upset ",

    "all_comment_text": "That sucks, really sorry for you.  I think you should name the race, some people just shouldn't be race directors.\n\nGreat lakes endurance,  you can still sign up for tomorrow's race on website lol\n\nTerrible race directors. The fact that they didn't email out the cancellation is awful. I would get your money back, no chance I'd do another race from these folks.\n\nAlso- I think calls to the individuals would be appropriate too. Guessing this race wasn’t huge so take the time to call everyone.\n\nThis is so odd. I’ve done a race with these guys before and loved it, and the race director kindly send me a replacement medal after mine was damaged. I checked their social media and website and it’s like you said, there’s no post at all about cancellation. Very strange. So sorry this happened to you.\n\nThere's a separate page for the event, and they marked the event cancelled. The only way to get a notification from FB would be to join the event on their page.\n\n**This race brought to you by the Meta Universe. Join us now before ***missing out***!**\n\n^(**missing out maybe include not receiving crucial information as your own despair**)\n\nI'm really bummed to hear this -- I've had a couple of their races on my bucket list. Sorry your race was canceled and the circumstances were crappy! I hope you find some fun things to do in the area. \n\nWe took kids to a water park near by to pass time,\n\nI did Grand Island 50k a few years ago and was really impressed with their organization. Big bummer to hear, sorry about your experience. if a race is cancelled you gotta have at minimum an email blast or something\n\nThe fact you can still sign up is wild lol. And yet they maintain they told everyone. \n\nDamn.  I've run Waugoshance twice, and though they're low key, they seemed to be on the ball.  \nSorry to hear that happened to you.\n\nthe 15 should run the course anyway\n\nAnd then should organise it properly the next year.\n\nFucking fuck em\n\nThey should have the decency to email directly to all that signed up for it.\n\nThey said they emailed all that signed up, had to be lies, I'm super anal with email, and get bored and check my spam weekly. Yet me and alot of other runners showed up, plus side, my fitness is crazy taining for trail race at ski resort. I'm upset with money spent, dragging family to middle of nowhere.\n\nIf most people didn't show up it would seem likely that they did notify people somehow.\n\nFacebook doesn’t count.\n\nThat’s my thoughts. Not saying OP shouldn’t be upset, but if only 15 or so runners showed up, it would seem most got notified. Either way it sucks.\n\nUnless the organizer didn't want to bother with the race because only 15 signed up.\n\nVery true.\n\nYeah. Unless there’s something major physically preventing it taking place then the main reason for a race cancellation is entry numbers so low the organisers stand to lose a ton of money, so there’s a good chance the 15 represent a big proportion of the entrants.\n\nOr if 15 = a significant portion (&gt;25%?) of entrants. If 30-100% of entrants didn't get the cancellation notice, I'd say it's on the race organizers. And what's the addtn'l cost of sending \"many\" emails vs. \"an\" email.\n\nOr very few signed up?\n\nThey also could be the case. Either way sucks to put in the work and not be able to run.\n\nI hate it when amateur RD's think social media is appropriate to make announcements. Not all of us have a FB account. There's literally no reason to not send all entrants an email.\n\nI've had this happen to me as well. Just me and another dude just looking around confused. The start location had been moved several miles away and it was only announced on FB. Several people missed the race that morning.\n\nEspecially on fb, followers don’t necessary get to see the posts. The organization has to pay extra for that. Fb sucks balls.\n\nOr post it all over their website \"CANCELLED\" on the website event is very simple to do. \n\nI looked it up and OP was right, you could have registered and paid for the event on their website.\n\nIronic considering this is one of the only race websites I've seen that has a \"Race Updates\" page.  \n\nThere's no mention of it on their website or their facebook.  That really sucks.  \n\nTrail races using active.com...I'll pass.\n\nOhhh that might be why you didn’t get an email, actually. Active.com you only get race emails if you’re subscribed to get all of active’s other spammy emails. It’s a bad system. Happened to me with another race a few years back.\n\nName and shame! This is really terrible.\n\nthe 15 of you should band together and email the race director. there were no social media posts anywhere? no facebook, no instgram or twitter, no emails at all? that's completely unacceptable. i hope you all at least get refunds for the registration or a free deferral for next year's race.\n\nThe director said their was an email that went out, I know I didn't get it. His follow on email said I can pick a race on next year's schedule,  cool and all, but I know I wasn't notified of this race being canceled. Just super bummed , the race fees are really the smallest investment I have in this,  but I'll be asking for a refund. Not happy with communication,  or lack of.\n\nAsk to be reimbursed for travel expenses. If they really want to make it right they’ll do it. But they probably don’t… but might as well ask so maybe it will sink in that they didn’t do their due diligence\n\n[deleted]\n\nAh yes spend 2k in legal fees to get your $500 back.\n\nDefinitely take the refund and not a credit for a race next year. Based on what I've seen from local races that have been cancelled last minute, it can point to bad leadership or financial insolvency and they may not exist in 12 months to host another race. So frustrating!\n\nI'd ask for him to forward the email to you showing that one actually went out when he says it did, and also showing that they had your email on the list they used.\n\nThat's what I'll be asking for today, I want to see what email went out that I never got\n\nOhhhh I wanna hear how that turns out!\n\nThat sucks big time. I am always nervous when it’s like a week out and I haven’t gotten any emails. Feel like that is not on you to check the Facebook event page to see whether it’s still happening, they should be sending emails to those registered.\n\nI was checking daily for fb updates, but saw past events they didn't post pre event, so figured it was normal. Sucks because now there's not alot of events with winter coming. I finally got climbing ability,  nooo\n\nCheck out the Hitchcock experience in Iowa. Beginning of December with a ton of vert. I’ve done the hundred twice and 50 three times. Great race, with great support.\n\nI'm sorry you went through this! I would be extremely disappointed if it happened to me. There's another reply about a race suggestion for early December, and I'll give another option: Crooked Creek 100 near Louisville, KY on Dec 7. There is a decent amount of vert and some challenging trail sections, the scenery is lovely, and there are a range of distances to choose from 5k-100mi.\n\nDispute this with your credit card company ASAP. This sounds like scammers\n\nI feel like I’d be more concerned about being race ready than the money, but I still agree either way\n\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nThey are definitely not scammers; they've been doing these races for more than 20 years. I think this was terrible communication.\n\nPosting to social media is not an appropriate step. They need to contact everyone who signed up via email/phone to let them know of the cancellation.\n\n\nAt least everyone will know to avoid Great Lakes Endurance Race in the future.\n\nCommunicating important information via Facebook only should be illegal, but yet seems to be becoming a normal thing. Just send a fricken email\n\nIf you can, try to reach iRunFar, Ultrarunning Mag, Mountain Outpost, etc. So the community can be informed about these organisers.\n\nEnjoy the vacation. Go take a run and see the local scenery. Then, make the choice to never do business with the race company again. Posting on social media as a way of cancelation is unacceptable. An email should have been sent as step 1 and a weekly post would have been more acceptable.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo reasons, course conditions here were good. I assume low sign-ups. I'm only upset I wasn't notified, and made a trip out of it. That and I want to run hills with my new trail shoes\n\n[deleted]\n\nGuessing at least parts are on private property that don’t have access to public.\n\nBummer. Sorry that happened to you.\n\nWow. Couldn’t send you a text message on the number you would have provided during entry. \n\nAs somebody else said, some people shouldn’t be race directors.\n\nSocial media channels alone are not the right way to cancel an event. I would expect a big banner in the website landing page and an email to every registrant. Minimum.\n\nI went to look it up. The used active dot com for registration. My phone had an aneurysm trying to load all the ads. I never signup for races that use that service.\n\nThis seems shocking. How would they not send out multiple emails? Do you at least get refunded?\n\nI'll be asking for a refund today, and see how they proceed.\n\nDamn, that sucks. Feel sorry for you OP!\n\nDid they give a reason why it was cancelled? Has this race taken place in other years or is this a new race or a new RD?\n\nSuper strange/suspicious to claim they posted it on Facebook over a month ago but you can’t find anything (and no email from them even though I see from responding comments that they said they emailed too) and no follow up reminder/confirmation email of the race being cancelled happened and that the race is still available to sign up for.\n\nThat is awful! Yikes, absolutely horrible communications management on their end. This is why holistic, inside out comms strategies are necessary: Emails (more than one, just to be sure), website updates, texts (if anyone opted in), etc. This idea that posting something on social media covers everything because \"everyone is on social media\"...wow. And I'm writing this as someone who's managed social media for a fairly large company. It is not the be all end all.\n\nI'm so sorry this happened; I'd be livid, too. All of that travel and the Airbnb! Here's hoping your next race goes smoothly and you set some awesome PRs.\n\nWhat a huge bummer. That's so frustrating.\n\n\nI grew up in Gaylord and have worked at Treetops (though I live in Seattle now). Since you made the drive anyway, there are some cool loops you can run in the area as a self-supported replacement. I'll always recommend Dead Man's Hill and the Jordan River loop: Jordan Valley Pathway on AllTrails\nhttps://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/michigan/jordan-valley-pathway--3?sh=pm0uti\n\nNice, thank you\n\nNorth country trail is also good for an out and back!\n\nI do see the cancellation on the race’s page (not the company’s page). Definitely still insufficient noticed, especially without any reason given\n\nYou and the 15 others should make a race amongst yourselves.\n\nWe should have , while I ran inside resort front desk, wife and kids were in car. If it was just me , I totally would have tried to pull something together\n\ni'm sorry, that really sucks. i would be so upset and yes, they should fully refund you AND give you a place in any race of theirs next year.\n\nThat sucks. I would be upset too. That’s a lot of time and money invested. \nThat surprises me. I’ve ran 4 races with them over the past few years. I thought the races were well run. They have a minimalist attitude about races that I like. \nI have always thought their communication was good. \nI did run the 1/2 marathon at the treetops trifecta in 2023. I think there were only about 20-30 people running it.\n\nYea, I picked that race from the reviews I saw from past years. Looked like a unique 3 race set-up\n\nCan you just run the course self-supported?\n\nI was signed up and actually wondered during my non race trail run this am, how many people showed up. I did get an email about 3-4 weeks ago that it was cancelled, but noticed the website didn’t mention it. You should be able to transfer to a different race for next year.\n\nThere may be an option to submit a claim under the benefits of the CC you used to book the reservations. I would take a look and see if this qualifies (unlikely but it is possible)\n\nThis is disappointing to hear. I’ve been eyeing some of their races but now am second guessing if this is how they manage everything.\n\nCan’t imagine the empty feeling rife with disappointment, anger, sadness and embarrassment (with the fam along). I’m truly sorry this happened to you. \n\nNot exact but similar has happened to me before and I’ve ended up doing “fatass” version of the rage along with the others who showed up for it. We modified it, made our own mock aid stations, etc. \n\nIt’s a raw deal no matter what but you’ve got all that A race fitness, find a use for it to help your headspace!\n\nYou can give them a bad review in Google. \n\n\nI'm in Michigan and I'm looking at their website. I'll make a mental note not to run one of their races. \n\n\nAlso their logo is blurry, so clearly they don't have their shit together. \n\nI've had my eye on this race, good to know they aren't reliable! There are no events on FB since 2021 from them, nor ANY posts about the race being cancelled.\n\nEdit: okay I found the FB event, but they literally only cancelled it, and posted NOTHING.\n\nI didn't find the event either, my wife did.\n\nThat's so awful! \n\nI ran a Great Lakes Endurance race last year so can confirm they are legit, and the race I ran was really well organized- but it was a marathon/50k that they've done for years, which isn't the same as a 2 day stage race. They are definitely a small operation so maybe they just got in over their heads. \n\nI'm really sorry you had this experience and put so much training and energy in for this to happen. I had a wonderful experience with my GLE race but this is not acceptable and I hope they make it right.\n\nThis sucks. \nI’ve become pretty picky with races because of things like this. There are some race organizers (South African, where I live) that I refuse to support now because they’re just not good enough. Basic things like having enough medics on site, not cleaning up route markings after a race.\n\nNet everyone uses social media. Everyone uses email.\n\nWow sorry to hear that...never been an RD but have had to deprecate product before (software) and I can tell you I have weekly outgoing communication to all channels leading to the deprecation.  You cannot over inform in this situation.  Even if you annoy someone by telling them the same things 10x you live with that to make certain everyone has received the message in what ever channel they use.  This is a failure and will affect all future events hosted by this group.\n\nWasn't it possible to still tackle the course, race against yourself,\n\nWas signed up for this race and did know in advanced that it was cancelled but they refuse to give a refund of the $94. Total fraud. \n\nMine wasn't refunded either , but it's on me for not buying the insurance. :( I feel yea\n\nDid you go for a run with the others? DIY stage race /backyard ultra from the hotel\n\nSorry about your race friend. At least you're in BEAUTIFUL country. Hope you're not too late for leaf peeping. Check out Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore or drive out to Bayfield, WI to take a peek at Madeleine Island and the Apostle Islands! And if you're into devils lettuce, Michigan vendors are practically giving it away."

Otherwise I really want to know about cats and churros.\n\nIm here for the cat churros\n\nIs that when you bribe them into the car with Churros? It'd probably work for me...\n\nMy cat has successfully conditioned all of us plus our dog to follow each and every instruction without questioning and she didn't even talk about Churros.\n\nCouldn't find this on Google. What is it?\n\n*Churu. It's basically Gu for cats.\n\nThat is the oddest thing I've seen in a while. But I like it  🙂\n\nThis is adorable \n\nHow long does your cat run? If it tires, do you put it in your running vest or just shoulder it?\n\nO we’ve only being doing this for two days. First day was about 1/4 mile, today was a 1/2 mile with a few roll in the dirt breaks. He down to do more but the bugs were eating both of us up.\n\nWow, 1/2 mile is pretty impressive\n\nI rekon 1/2 mile without stopping would be close to the max for a cat. They're not built for endurance and will probably overheat quickly. Nice to get out with your cat, though.\n\nThis isn’t healthy for cats and dogs… they are built for quick sprints not long duration running.\n\nHuskies and other sled dogs? Literally bred for thousands of years to run?\n\nWow is this cat a husky ????\n\nYou said cats and dogs ? lol\n\nIdk anything about huskies but what I do know is that for my job I have to hike with heavy gear and our k9 handlers would have Belgian Malinois and Dutch shepherds that would struggle to keep up over great distances. \n\nIn the North Carolina heat the dogs would be dying and have to get carried if we were hiking far or through rough terrain. \n\nBack in California I’ve witnessed someone run their pitbull into heat exhaustion while having it leashed to an e-bike.\n\nAs u/sluttycupcakes mentioned- that not true for dogs and not just huskies! It’s in their ancestry. Wolves routinely travel 30 miles a day- and usually at a trot which most dogs running with humans are trotting along. Adding to sled dogs- herding and cattle dogs as well as hunting/sport dogs need to move for miles and miles. Even smaller terriers will happily and easily run by their humans. Loads of dogs love and are built for running.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDude a 1/4 mile run won't kill a healthy cat. He's not bringing his cat for a 10k.\n\nMy cat does quick sprints and then rolls and flops while my dog looks on wondering why we stopped.\n\nNo but I want to badly\n\nSame. This would be like a dream to me 😭\n\nThink about all the cats out there that wish they could take their humans trail running, but their humans just roll and flop after a short sprint 😂🤣\n\nI saw a dude walking his dog (on leash) and duck with little boots (off leash) in Golden gate park last week. Truly an inspiration.\n\nI used to take my cat hiking on the trails, but now that he's getting older (15) he can't walk for longer than an hour or so, so we're mostly walking around the neighborhood. He still sprints up and down trees though!\n\nYo my cat likes to hike and Ive seriously contemplated this. I love having a little panther out in the woods and this looks so awesome. How dope would it be to hit a 5k with the kitty...?\n\nYou are my hero. Your cat too.\n\nAwww we used to have a couple of cats that would follow us on our walks.  They were down for at least a mile of walk/jog.  Thanks for the reminder!\n\nMy cat Milly loves to hike but never hit the trails with her. How far does your cat run?\n\nSome guy does this in Tahoe and he’s my hero.\n\nThis is a dream\n\nr/RunningWithDogs would probably appreciate this\n\nUnfortunately I go trail running around big ninja ones that I hope leave me alone\n\nI run with my service dog, we were doing a race at mount Fuji, and there was a lady running with her cat on a ruffwear leash...\nGreat seeing runners with their fur buddies.. \nWeirdest, dude running with a goat...first thing came to mind...hail satan ???\n\nWeird flex bro haha\n\n I am just drawing conclusions here but I’d check with your vet before doing this again. I read once humans and canines are some of the best distance runners in the animal kingdom. I’d reckon cats are built for short burst of speed, not distance.\n\nHow do you protect them from dogs?\n\nOoof man be careful. Cats are not built for endurance.\n\nSuper cute OP\n\nI love this so much\n\nOohh, now I’m considering taking my cat on a local trail where dogs are not allowed (nobody ever said anything about cats though!) Typically, he’s not great on leash, but we’ve been working on it, and I bet I could build him up to run 1/2 a mile, which would probably help with him leaving my dog alone instead of pestering him all day!\n\nI love this\n\nMy lil dude won't go at the same pace as me. Short ADHD bursts from one thing to the next, no consistency.\n\nOmg this is amazing. As a cat guy, I love this and am jealous but I can tell you any cat I've ever owned would NOT be down with this.\n\nBAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nThis is the dream!!\n\nI never went running with mine, but she would stay with me on walks around the neighborhood. It baffled everyone!\n\nThat's a cool cat if I've ever seen one\n\nDecades ago I took my leash-loving cat to a marathon to watch some friends, and we ended up running with them for half a mile. It was awesome.\n\nNo, a cougar would eat it.\n\nThat is a life goal of mine now.\n\nCat on lead wrong. It should be a dog\n\nSo cool! How long will she/he run for?\n\nAmazing. I had a cat who would go on long walks and hikes with me but I never thought to run with him!\n\nLove it!  Used to walk anywhere from 800 metres to 3 km with our cats but never ran with them.   Walking the cat only worked at night when there were fewer distractions (and threats).\n\nHuh\n\nCute! \n\nUntil a predator or off leash dog comes by. \n\nI don’t understand people trying to turn a cat into a dog. Like take ‘em outside to a park for an hour but cats like being lazy.\n\nRude\n\nThat's awesome but I hope you have some mace to protect your kitty from dogs on the trail."

I made the mistake of telling myself the first 10k “I’m not here for a fast time just a good time”….and well, I took that a little too much to heart 😂 Splits were right on track for the first two checkpoints, but the third section (only 6km of downhill) was brutal. The snowfields and talus were a struggle for us to run, and we should have allotted far more time. Made the halfway cutoff with 8 minutes to spare, but missed the final aid station cutoff by 10 minutes ….only 8km to go 😅 the energy was there to finish, but alas, we should not have underestimated those middle sections. \n\nTurns out a marathon on a glacier at altitude, lots of snowfields, and plenty of talus, stream crossings, and mud can really slow ya down!\n\n34 km (21miles) + 2275meters vert (7463feet) before we got cut ✔️",

Still smiling by the end (albeit slightly salty I lolly gagged the first bit) so at least that!\n\nDNF beats DNS every time\n\nWhat is DNS?\n\nDid not start.\n\nOr:\n\nDefinitely Not Sober (the night before).\n\nHey now what is beer if not liquid carbo-loading?\n\nThat looks really challenging! Nice work though\n\nIt was beautiful! But definitely underestimated the descent. The climbing was easier for me 😂\n\nThis is awesome. What were people doing for footwear/traction?\n\nmicrospikes are mandatory equipment\n\nExactly this! Spikes required for the glacier. I wore them on the snowfields for a few kms as well, but plenty people ditched them after the glacier. Snow was slippery\n\nDid you stay upright on the ‘cross country ski tracks’? I fell a few times but all in good spirits. I had a tendency to tense up on the snowy bits, had to make an effort to run normally/relaxed again on solid ground. The microspikes were fantastic on the glacier by the way, didn’t find that slippery at all. I was quite surprised by how effective they were.\n\nAh so rad you were there as well! And congrats to running it!! 🥳\n\n I took some spills, and had one near miss after the second climbing that freaked me out (I was in total fog and getting rained on by that point) but all good in the end! The spikes were great on the glacier! I dilly dallied just enjoying the view too much on that section. When I got to the first aid station, they were also out of water so we had to wait a bit for someone to run up to the hut and bring more down 😅 props to all the volunteers though!\n\nThis is SUCH a cool race! What was it like running on this terrain? How do you even train for this?\n\n10/10 recommend for the views and experience! To be honest, I ran way less than I would have liked because i found the terrain a struggle in many parts 😂 I am a pretty casual runner, but I hike a lot and do a lot of weekly vert typically…i had also done a trail marathon a few weeks earlier with a similar amount of vert and felt great so I just went for it! A strong hiking background has really helped though. Probably should run more than I do but too many sports to juggle 😂\n\nTrickiest thing to train for most people, i think, is the elevation. The race tops out at 3000m, much of it is above 2500. I live at sea level, so i went to the area a few days before. The public (mountain) transport in the region is free with hotel/hostel stays, so we zipped around the area, had a look at the corvatch mountain station at 3300m and did some easy runs on the other days. Great times regardless of the event!\n\nI found the microspikes surprisingly effective on the glacier ice, so that’s no worry at all. I agree with the op that the snow was slippery, would be nice to have some experience with that. But i understand this was an exceptionally snowy year, so possibly less of an issue next time around.\n\nThat is an epic and memorable DNF.  I’d be proud to tell this story.  Thanks for sharing your awesome experience OP!\n\nAhhh thanks so much! At the end of the day, I had a good time so I am happy for that!\n\nThose are insane views/trails! Makes me want to sign up!\n\nI highly recommend it! Anything around Engadin 🇨🇭is STUNNING! This race was a treat!\n\nThere is also a 30km and 16km, and 6km, different routes. 👍\n\nThat looks like a ton of fun.\n\nIt was!\n\nBe proud of what you completed. Sometimes things click. Sometimes they don’t. Next one, everything may align. Keep it up!\n\nThanks! I’ll be back next year for this one 😃🤞\n\nThis looks incredible! Congrats on the race! I knew nothing of this race and now I'm itching to do it. Can you share a little more info? How were the logistics? Looks like there's not really a convenient airport if you're not local. And can I ask what your road race times are like? Curious how brutal the course is.\n\nThanks! And again, congrats!\n\nYeah for sure! I live just a few hours away from the race, so it was an easy drive for us. It seems the majority of people running are Swiss + German/live locally(ish). Closest airport I want to say is Zurich? It is pretty easy to take a train down to this area though. Engadin St Moritz is one of my favorite places in the Alps, and well worth the trip ☺️\n\nAs far as road race times….I pretty much exclusively run on a trail since I live in the mountains, so I’m unfortunately no help there. I tend to run mid/back of the pack though (finishing 50-60% in the group). This race I was closer to last 10% 😂 I did a 43.5k with similar vert a few weeks ago and finished in 7hr 25 and my husband in 7hr 10….this one we got cut off at 8 hr 30 and still had 10km, 400 m vert, and another 600m descent….so it would have taken hours longer than the prior race trail race!\n\nThanks for these details--it looks and sounds incredible!\n\nFantastic photos!\n\nThank you!\n\nBeautiful. Did you keep going to do the last 5 mi and unofficially finish?\n\nI wish we could have, but everyone was required to charlift down the mountain because weather was rolling in so it was a safety hazard.\n\nWhich race is this? It looks awesome\n\nBernina Ultraks Gletschermarathon!!\n\nI just realized you had it in the description😅 I only saw the top caption\n\nThis was a great event indeed! Such a hidden gem! \n\nRunning on the glacier was so beautiful… part of it was like a glass trail scattered with rocks, soft blue light shining through.\n\nThe section between Lagalb (midpoint) and Languard was brutal indeed. After that steep climb it just continued to slowly climb across snowfields for much longer than i expected. In the end I did finish, a bit under nine hours.\n\nYou may have talked with my buddy, Pieter, who dropped out at Lagalb about 10 min before the cutoff. \n\nI don’t get why this isn’t more popular. Only 350 or so starters, it wasn’t even sold out. Great atmosphere (at least when you start the conversations yourself, the Swiss open up just fine but rarely take the first step it seems). \n\nAlthough the second half is as beautiful as most areas in the alps, the real beauty is the glaciers in the first part. So I could even recommend signing up with the intent to drop out at the midpoint. That’s the best 21k with 1200H+ i can think of.\n\nThis area is STUNNING! Have you been before? We go a few times a year to Engadin for hiking. It’s the best! \n\nAlso, if Pieter was the guy that said “I’m done climbing” at the aid station, then I did see him but we didn’t talk. \n\nI couldn’t agree more about the first half and the views- they really are worth that alone! Last year I did steinbock as my first ever race and knew I wanted to come back. All the routes are lovely (albeit steinbock is a much easier run) 😂\n\nThanks! It was my first time there, but probably not the last :)\nYeah the route on the glacier is just fantastic and is worth the price of admission. I can run trails by myself, but i’d never step on a glacier without a guide. \n\nGood job growing so quickly into bigger runs! Any more events on the horizon? I’m planning to fastpack roughly the Tour des Combins in September.\n\nCompletely understand not hopping on a glacier willy nilly. I’ve seen some crazy rock and icefall over there before and last year my husband fell in a crevasse during a mountaineering trip (no injuries thankfully)😅.\n\nTour des Combines looks GORGEOUS! We are in that region early August- such a stunning route. How long do you hope to do it?\n\nAnd race wise we had planned Wildstrubel 70k for September but due to some tendon issues we decided to hold off. The vert is pretty aggressive. But, I am sure we will do a couple more spontaneous races…Davos X Trails is in a few weeks and looks fun 😃\n\nI did the 30k this year. I can recommend that one too! Without glacier tho, but nice views and very technical downhills.\n\nAh so rad!! How did it go for you? I’ve hiked that route a few years back and remember the descent being tedious 😅 props!\n\nOh it was amazing. I love downhill running, so it was perfect for me! Maybe next year I'll try the marathon 😊\n\nI love your attitude.\n\nThat ultra found its way to my next years target list :-)  \nCongrats to the fun time you had!\n\nWhat race is this?\n\nBernina Ultraks Gletschermarathon:)\n\nBoss\n\nLooks awesome. I am in Switzerland currently and I noticed there is quite a lot of snow. More than I’m used to. \n\nI’m also running trails but much less exciting stuff. It looks great but also a bit scary.\n\nHoly wow!!!!! I have never heard of this race but we will for sure be talking about it on the podcast this week.  Congrats on the attempt."

    "all_comment_text": "Nice! Where’s that?\n\nAnswering for OP as she is certainly conked out asleep by now. [Western Austria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WozS9guQetnuq2K18), south of Innsbruck. I think this is the [event](https://www.stubai.at/en/kalkkoegeltrail/).\n\nThanks so much for responding- I was asleep indeed! And yes, it’s the Kalkkögel in Austria 😍\n\nI really do not understand why people do not add an explicit location.   Is it the \"I live at the centre of the universe complex\"?\n\nBut you can see the local place names on the map and look them up if you are curious ..\n\nYou are right.   Lots of effort on my part when clearly the OP is..... never mind......   I'll just pass.\n\nWow, you sound like a very lovely person. First of all I don't think there is any need to reveal a specific location, if you for example have issues posting personal information on the internet. And even if your motivation should be a more selfish one, where you just would like to keep your hidden gems secret or less frequented that's all your decision.\n\nNeverheless that's all irrelevant anyway, because you know, **the information is right there**, written on the map. Would you want OP's shoe size aswell with that, or what?\n\nYes, I agree.  Only truly lovely people use sarcasm.  BTW, the name of the nation state is not written on the map.\n\nWhat is it?  Parochialism meets celebrity narcissism on modern social media?   Whatever....\n\n&gt; the name of the nation state is not written on the map.\n\nOMG, I'm about to change your world. There's this app thingy Google has called *Maps*, and if you enter a word into it like Kalkkögel or Plöven it will *instantly* show you where in the world that is. Amazing!  \n\nDon't worry about thanking me. Just pay it forward.\n\nDo you have trouble understanding written English?  That is not the point.\n\nYou didn’t add explicit location of where you are complaining from?\n\nCongrats! Great race! And a beautiful dreamy landscape. Looks like a wonderful day\n\nThank you! It was really stunning terrain!\n\nAmazing place to run.\n\nNo bad places in the Alps, that’s for sure!\n\nIt’s the Kalkkögel Trail in Stubai! Small race, gorgeous trail. The route got cut and changed due to 20cm snowfall the night before, so I added on some extra kms after crossing the finish so I could still get my final marathon for the season in 😅😂\n\nNice, winter is coming!\n\nYesss! I am getting stoked for snow 🤞 Second proper snowfall this month 😃\n\nThat looks so cool I’m extremely jealous right now\n\nI can definitely recommend the event- well organized and in a gorgeous area 😃\n\nSuch a nice run! I did the 18k so only one round and absolutely loved it! Fun trails and very well organized. Nice to see some post from a local run\n\nOh so rad!! It was such a small event too, I can imagine it will grow in future years. Bummed the original route didn’t work out, so I’ll have to go back again!\n\nI think the next time I'm going for the 42k too, depending on which distances will be available. I just need a bit more preparation. I already know many parts of the course since this are local trails for me but the 3000m+ vert will be a challenge for sure. I hope the event is not growing too big. There are already a lot of big events around Tirol like IATF, PAGT and PIUT. I prefer the spirit of small races.\n\nHopefully everyone will be distracted by the million other races that happen during September. I was originally planning for Wildstrubel but life happened and we had to back out . This was a really happy alternative. The 3k climbing over a short distance is no joke! I am just over the border in Garmisch. Now I think I need to take more time to explore the Austrian trails though - you have some lovely home routes!\n\nGarmisch has a lot to offer too! I've been there often in the past (I'm from Bavaria too). I hope to do one of the \"shorter\" distances of the ZUT next year. Did you run there yet?\n\nYes- ZUT is an *amazing* event! My husband has run it the past three years and I did the Mittenwald trail this year. Next year we will do Leutasch or Ehrwald trails. Highly recommend it. 🥳\n\nI still have to decide between the GAP-Trail and Mittenwald Trail. Both are tempting\n\nAwesome! I'm guessing by the fact that you live in Austria, that you are no stranger to running in the snow/snowy conditions. I've picked up running in general and trail running again this year, and now that winter will be coming to Norway aswell, i'm looking for shoes to get for running in the winter. Do you have any recommendations?\n\nI’m just over the border in the German Alps, but unfortunately we haven’t gotten very snowy conditions the past few years 😭 I tend to just wear Altras (Lone Peaks) + add spikes once it’s icy! That has always worked out well for me ☺️"

    "all_comment_text": "Epic race, obligatory: you're a beast!\n\nThank you!\n\nThat's amazing, congratulations!!\n\nI really admire people who do ultras.\n\nWhat do you find most difficult about doing a race like that?\n\nNutrition is #1 most difficult for me, followed my feet management. I tend to get blisters so I’m learning more and more to mitigate.\nBut I’ve seen the most people drop (DNF) a race due to stomach/nutrionak problems.\n\nThanks for the congrats 😊\n\nI'm thinking about starting to do some longer distances in the future (31k next month, my current max in trail is 21k) and seeing posts like yours are inspirational. \n\nWhat you find more difficult about nutrition? Remembering/being able to eat or your stomach reaction to the what you eat?\n\nFor me, it’s my stomach’s reaction to what I eat. When I first started running (about 14 years ago) I ran only road and didn’t know what I was doing. I ended up running fasted most of the time by nature of how early I had to get up lol. So now that I’m doing long trail distances, I’m having to train my stomach to digest while running. Here is what I’ve learned works for me, take it as advice but everyone is different. \n#1- eat real food for as long as possible (gels/chews/electrolyte drinks too early really make my stomach ache). I eat turkey cheese on white bread sandwiches, small meat sticks, sunflower seeds, etc\n#2- eat something small sooner than you think. I’ve started eating about a fourth of a turkey/cheese sandwich on white bread, with some mustard. Sounds weird but my body loves it, and eating before you feel hungry is the key to helping start your digestive system before you’re too exerted\n#3- eat small, more frequently. Some runners I know go by time (ie every two hours) and that’s working for me. Even if it’s just two bites of something. Small and frequent is easier on the stomach than less frequent and more\n#4- I love base salt. This is basically salt in a little tube that I lick off my hand. Since I don’t handle electrolyte drinks well, incorporating base salt with my water consumption really helps. Especially if it’s hot or humid because I drink a LOT of water\n#5- save sugars for later miles. I recently learned that sugars too early make me nauseous 🤢. Later on when I’m really craving it, then I’ll start incorporating sugar. Usually jelly beans (I like pear) or a hi chew candy. Very small portions at a time. However, I do have a couple swallows of regular Coke or Ginger Ale at aid stations after about mile 20 or so\n#6- finally, I’ve started carrying Tums or similar antacid to help relax the stomach late in the race\nBest of luck in your 31k! Most importantly- have fun while you’re out there!\n\nI am super blister prone too! It’s the one thing holding me back from increasing mileage! What has worked for you?\n\nTaping blister prone areas with Leukotape is a solid choice.  It holds in place extra well if you first apply Tincture of Benzoin\n\nI totally agree with u/snollberger. Tape and tincture help, just be careful with how you tape. The smallest tiny bump can cause a big blister after enough miles. I have also switched to Injinji toe socks. And found a shoe that works best for me.\n\nHell of a pace! Get it!\n\nThank you!\n\nAwesome job! The event seemed so well organized, impressed with the race org. How are the trails the first half of the course? I've only checked out the second half parts shared with the 50k course.\n\nThey are mostly good! There is several miles of forest road, but it wasn’t too bad. The second half is prettier though. \nThe RD out together such an organized race! She was so detailed and nice, I had a great time 😁\n\nThey are mostly good! There is several miles of forest road, but it wasn’t too bad.

Congrats!\n\nThanks for being at Rhodies- you all are the best!!\n\nDamn girl, you're fast af on that crazy vert!\n\nThanks so much! Sooo much vert on this one\n\nIncredible!!\n\nThank you 😊\n\nThis race looks epic! Are the forests super old and awesome in those parts?\n\nThey are super awesome! Very green, lots of majestic trees and moss. Epic views at the top. Super humid though lol\n\nwow...nice view i bet\n\nSuper gorgeous- and luckily it was great weather all day! Rain and thunderstorms around 9:30pm, and there were still a few runners out on the trail.\n\nwhat a great life ....so cool to mind n soul...clean air ....so good\n\nCongrats! Well done!\n\nThanks so much!\n\nThat’s amazing! Well done and…fast! Did you stop to rest at all? Did you hike on the uphill portions? Any wisdom to share?\n\nI definitely hiked the uphills! Hardly any resting, I tried not to spend much time at aid stations. Some of them I barely stopped just to get a drink of Coke or ginger ale. There were two AS that I had drop bags at, and probably spent around 5-7 minutes at each of those.\nMy best advice is to figure out what you can eat. When I first started doing longer ultras my stomach would get really upset. I’ve added base salt to my pack. This allows me to drink lots of water but still keep my sodium levels up. I counter that with sucking on a hi chew or jelly bean lol.\n\nThanks for replying! I just recently purchased some salt pills because I’m about to up my running game.  Been experimenting with nutrition as I up my mileage-I see it’s very important.  I have been dabbling in some candy too lately :)\n\nMy goal is ultras.  You’re very inspiring! Especially if the “80” in your username is your birth year, as it is mine.\n\nCongratulations !\n\nAmazing\n\nNicely done! Was eyeballing this one but it was on my wedding anniversary… nothing better than running in the Olympics!\n\nIt’s so gorgeous! Congrats on your anniversary 😊\n\nGood Lord, that was fast…\n\nOh wow, this is nuts!! Congratulations!\n\nI didn’t even know people did stuff like this. Holy shit lmao that must have been one of the most challenging things you’ve ever done, no?\n\nIt was a challenge for sure! I think that’s part of the appeal for some of us crazy trail runners 😜\n\nIndeed 😁 I’ve never done any mountain style trails, but I live close by a nature preserve so that’s my spot. It’s super sandy so it’s like running on a beach almost but with uphill, downhill, rocks, bridges, streams, and trees. There’s even a small waterfall. I used to do it barefoot, but I’ve learned the rocks I don’t see can cause injuries. Probably a cake walk for you though. Peach tree rock nature preserve if you’re ever in this neck of the woods. It’s in the Sandhills region of South Carolina.\n\nSounds beautiful! And running on sand is hard. I joke that it takes three times the effort as running on smooth trail, but honestly it feels like it does\n\nIt definitely adds some difficulty. Some parts are soft like a beach while other parts are more compacted. Sand is easier on the joints too. I would consider this beginner level though compared to actual mountain trials with more rocks and such. I’m so thankful to live so close to this place. \n\nThe PNW is absolutely breathtaking, but I love the naturalness of SC and always encourage people to check it out if they can. There’s an old growth forest I visit as well, Congaree National Park. Not necessarily a trail spot but nice to explore and see the natural beauty of the southeast. There’s a documentary about the park on YouTube worth checking out if you’re interested in that sort of thing.\n\nCongrats\n\ncongrats, did my first 20k yesterday. Hope to get up to 50k soon\n\n[deleted]\n\nTotally accessible by regular car! There are some potholes, but the road overall is just a smooth gravel. Most people camped, I recommend getting there early Friday if you can be used it filled up. Luckily I was in a camper van so didn’t need additional space. It’s a great race- hope you run it next year!\n\nThat's a fantastic effort! Congratulations\n\nCongratulations 🎉 \nIf you don’t mind me asking what is the app you’re using?\n\nStrava\n\nYep- Strava. I have a Garmin Fénix Saphire watch which is connected to my Strava account\n\nAmazing! I want to follow your Strava!\n\nBarkleys ready"

It was truly epic - even though I know the area well, at some point I exclaimed out loud \"What the fuck, it's so beautiful\" and a hiker I was passing told me \"I know right?\"\n\nThat’s it. I’m moving to France. Screw a job I’ll just road bike the beautiful mountain passes and trail run all day.\n\nI mean who needs money when you can have free happiness?\n\nTrue. I can’t imagine anything more amazing\n\nLooks great. Is it along the GR 10 trail? Can you share the name of the lake/peaks?\n\nSuper close to it, not right on it. This is around Lac des Gloriettes. You can see the activities here (in 2 parts as I was crewing a friend for an ultra and I stopped to support her on the way): \n\nPart 1: [https://www.strava.com/activities/12221814226](https://www.strava.com/activities/12221814226)\n\nPart 2: [https://www.strava.com/activities/12221819196](https://www.strava.com/activities/12221819196)\n\nAnd plenty more place like this on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thomasbannelier/) as I'm a local to the Pyrénées!\n\nAbsolutely beautiful!\n\n😍\n\nQuality post, OP\n\nThank you!\n\nSo beautiful! Breche de Roland?\n\nI wasn't actually there but you can see it in pictures 1, 4, 5, 6 &amp; 7 - it is the fairly obvious hole in the distant mountain ridge.\n\nI'm  on the other side of the mountain hahaha, it's a small world\n\nEqually beautiful on the other side! I have memories from Ordesa and sleeping at the very top of Monte Perdido (which is forbidden now!)\n\nBreathtaking. I think nature has a different impact than just running on roads.\n\nDifferent impact on the joints that's for sure, but on mental health as well\n\nStunning!\n\nit would be a dream to run a trail and just see cows hanging out, but where i live, the trails are like, \"Nope, you get copperheads. \" :(\n\nDown south?\n\nDream run setting there! Props!\n\n100% dreamy. It's a 2 hours drive for me but well worth it.\n\nI spent a summer in Broto and looked at this range every day. Glorious!\n\nBeautiful place! You saw it from the other side!\n\nLooks amazing! I just arrived to Pyrenees for the first time and came across a very rocky trail so great to see something that’s not rocky and runnable! Any other areas/recommendations you have that is more runnable in central Pyrenees (French side)?\n\nDepends on your definition of runnable for this trail because a lot of it up high was high % slopes, 1700m of vert in 20 kilometers is not super runnable.\n\nOtherwise it's hard to answer your question because it is huge, central Pyrenees are like 250km wide with probably thousands of kilometers of trail, but yeah plenty of runnable trails in valleys like Cauterets, Luz Saint-Sauveur, Gavarnie...\n\nThank you!!"

    "all_comment_text": "Add it to the list of why the illusion of control is annoying.\n\nAnnoying is an understatement. I even made a spreadsheet outlining my strategy.. now the strategy is “finish”\n\nYou can do it, just hydrate extra starting now!\n\nThank you, and I will 🙏\n\nUse some honey and hot tea. It'll probably help ease the pain of a sore throat. Good luck to you in the marathon!\n\nI’ve had this same thing happen with a trail half in march. Injured 3 weeks before the race. Was just hoping to finish. But I came in 4th in my age group in a packed race. The person who came in 3rd was my best friend who I was just 2 strides behind at the finish line. I wanted to kill him.\n\nBut instead you settle for fourth? That’s loser talk. \n\n/s\n\nOr take a few covid tests between now and race day before you potentially expose others and overexert yourself? Plenty of former runners now have long covid because they overexerted. Don’t let a vascular disease end your cardio abilities.\n\nOf course I’m going to take some Covid tests.\n\nHope it’s nothing and that you enjoy your race!\n\nThank you 🙏first test came back negative! And so far.. no chest congestion. Just sinuses, sore throat, and the low grade fever that seems to have resolved..\n\nGet after it OP.\n\nI got super sick 48 hours before Berlin after travelling for 25 hours.  I slept an entire day and ended up with a PR.  Do what it takes.\n\nSame! Except I wound up DNFing and going to a hospital\n\nYou had a 50/50 shot.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPrecisely!\n\nThat’s sick. Literally. But also very cool\n\nwent to a pharmacy and stocked up on vitamin c and cold medicine.  Sometimes all you need is to just sleep LONG time.\n\nOktoberfest afterwards was nothing short of amazing.\n\nHell yeah sounds like a legendary trip\n\nI signed up for a half and broke my toe a month before. Was pretty bummed\n\nOof. I suppose it could always be worse.\n\nI don’t know, sounds like a Toe-tal disaster….\n\nYeah I did a half and rolled my ankle on the last km of my final training run. Completed the race but the ankle was strapped up and didn’t do it in the time I wanted. It happens\n\nThere is a local half marathon that I’ve been trying to do for the last five years.  First time cancelled due to Covid.  Second time dropped out to give birth (baby came early).  Third time dropped out due to broken arm.  Fourth time dropped out due to knee injury.  Fifth time… I literally strained my back the day before trying to pick up my kid.  I was like oh fuck no, I’ve been chasing this race for five years straight, so I sucked it up and got out there.  I PR’d and it was the best race I’ve ever run!\n\nAbout 5 years ago I got almost ten races in. This was followed by three years of ankle injuries, hip issues, and severe back/sciatic tightness. Each year it took me out of races and training for months. I finally got into supporting my running with strength training and I’m now stronger than ever and my running game… non existent because I had twins in March lol.\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m just so glad can run at all.\n\nHang in there man and enjoy it!\n\nEvery time\n\nSeriously. Months sometimes years of running without incident, then weeks before races: broken toe, shifted cuboid, COVID, first ever back issue, what else am I forgetting? I pretty much only do local races now because I expect something to happen.\n\nIt actually probably is every time. There's been some studies that suggest the immune system is in overdrive during periods of intense training.  So when you hit taper weeks, the immune system relaxes.  And then you get sick. \n\nSimilarly it's suggested this is why a lot of people get sick on vacation if they've been working hard for a really long time. \n\nBoth could also just be confirmation bias but [it seems experts believe there to be a link](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/sick-while-marathon-tapering#Runners-and-immunity).\n\nGood thing your legs aren’t attached to your throat. Because that would be awkward and running would be hard.\n\nI believe in you.\n\nYou make an excellent point. Thanks for believing in me. I’ll post an update Saturday\n\nSub 3hr first half attempt incoming? 🏃‍♂️💨🤙🏼\n\nGet some!\n\nHow did it go!?\n\nFinished in 2:34! It was brutal, the hardest physical thing I’ve ever done. But it was great, and I’ve already signed up for another next month\n\nNiiice work! 2:34 out the gate and under the weather is formidable. Congratulations.\nEnjoy the journey 🙂🤙🏼\n\nThank you!\n\nI dislocated my ankle a week before my first race. I could barely walk so there was no question about skipping the race. It wasn’t even running, just a casual bouldering session\n\nYou'll be ok.  Gargle with some salt water a few times a day, stay hydrated, and go run that sumbitch.\n\nI signed up for a mini triathlon and the day of i got noroviris and missed the race and also my second son was born and missed his birth woops\n\nI’ve got my first race next weekend and my partner is SICK right now, I’m masked up in my own home haha\n\nI got Covid for the first time a week before my first 25K. It was such horrible timing.\n\nHad food poisoning two days prior to my first marathon last april 🙃 Getting down gels during the race was a challenge to say the least.\n\nMurphy’s law\n\nMurphy was a major dickhead. I just temped at 99.6°F\n\nOP I hope you don’t have what I am currently still trying to get over. Wasn’t covid but it felt like it… Started with a sore throat then added a fever which  had for four days. Fever broke, sore throat mostly went away but now add congestion and fatigue. I lost my appetite the entire time and had awful cortisol making me anxious and unable to sleep. I’ve run twice in the 9 days I’ve had it :/\n\nI drank a questionable amount of NyQuil shortly after this post gained some traction and slept for 11 hours.. now I’m up and about, fever seems to have subsided from my last check at 100, but I’m going to take a covid test to be sure. I hope you recover and find yourself out on the trails soon.\n\nLast year I got sick the week before three consecutive big races. I decided to ease off the pressure and excitement about race day. I always was super planned/excited/anxious about the big marathons and ultras and I think my body sensed it and would force a break in there with the flu or a stomach bug or what not. Now I try to just get in great shape and crush races without worrying too much about it.\n\nI got sick before my first (and only) half marathon. I decided not to compete because it was an out and back trail race into some difficult terrain. Still ran on the day, but several laps on the streets near my house just to prove I could. My time was horrendous. Look after yourself. If you’re well enough to still compete, be safe\n\nI broke my collarbone and my wrist 3 months before London marathon, had a month of, didn’t put any pressure on myself aside from to finish, did it in 3:44. You got this, the battle is fun\n\nI did an epic year long training block for my first 50k. I was in the best shape of my life for that race. I tripped over a curb and broke my arm four days before the race. DNS.\n\nUgh.. that is devastating. I hope you got back at it and are still running 50’s (and beyond!)\n\nI booked a local half marathon last year then got sent away with work so couldn't go. Tried again this year and then badly pulled a muscle in my back two days before, couldn't stand up, sit down or lie down without being in pain. I move away this winter, so won't be able to run it next year, bummer.\n\nI have my half in 1 week and just got covid 👏\n\nAh shit. What are the current guidelines around Covid? Didn’t it change recently, lightening up? (At least in the US)\n\nPretty much up to you (in the UK), no requirement to self-isolate anymore. I hope it’ll go in 1 week, but not sure how would it affect my ability to run a race 😀\n\nHope yours will be alright!\n\nI think doing a half marathon while sick is fine as long as you don't have covid. If it were a longer race I would think twice but I think you are AOK. Just take great care of yourself afterward. Good luck and have fun. And once again, do NOT run it with covid\n\nIt's a mind game\n\nYou need your throat to run?\n\nOh yeah, flew back to a city where I'd lived for many years and was active in the running community. Ended up at urgent care with pneumonia. Obviously missed my race &amp; some VIP activities I was supposed to help with. It happens. Maybe it's just allergies...\n\nI feel you. I have a 50 mile on Saturday and got a stomach bug this week. I’m just starting to upswing this evening after a couple rough days.\n\nDid Pat's Run last month. Nothing special. But it is a fun run and I enjoy it and looked forward to it. Bronchitis the day before. I still did it, but man, it was no fun. \n\nJust now getting over it. Steroids and breathing treatment later. Have not run in nearly a month. Hate it.  Going back at it Monday, even if I have to cough the whole run.\n\ngot a fever like 15 minutes before picking up a rental for the joshua tree half\n\nHalfmarathon with 1200m elevation tomorrow.\nBeen sick at home the whole last week. Right now I’m thinking about hiking it..\n\nShit happens. Send it anyway. 🤙\n\nDrink hot tea with honey and rest up OP! You can do this!\n\nHad to drop my favorite race of the year, broken big toe from a work accident 3 weeks before the race. As of now dr. still wants me to wait another 4 weeks before running again…\n\nBefore my first 10k and first half I got sick the week of both times with congestion and a sore throat. I just stopped running until the race, loaded up on meds, and sent it on race day. \n\nTurned out ok for me, as long as you don’t have any issues below the neck like chest congestion you should be good to go! Just drink water like a mofo and rest up as best you can.\n\nI had this last January a day prior a 50k run. The start was at midnight. And at 30km I was still running, but having a bad fever. The first aid-point was at 31km. So I DNF'ed.\n\nThat's me about 50% of races I've signed up for and never have received a penny back :D\n\nUnless you run with your throat, just stay hydrated and run as per your original plan.\n\nDo the right thing, don't show up and race and spread whatever infection that you have.\n\nBreak the chain of transmission!!\n\n3 weeks before my marathon in 2017, destroyed an ankle by a burr oak acorn on the trail before sunrise. Did it anyway with a restrictive brace on.\n\nThis is my poor husband. Got sick this week... Is still running Quicksilver tomorrow (100k, crazy elevation). He's been training so hard and really wants to qualify for Western States. Send all the good vibes!\n\nYou don't run with your throat, no excuses!\n\nIllnesses aren’t real. It’s all in your head.\n\n-What I tell myself\n\nI had COVID 2-3 weeks (dead for 4 days) before a 800km mtb Ultra that I did around 48h with almost no sleep. Being sick doesn’t mean your race will turn out any different. Keep a winning mindset and get after it!\n\nBefore my first marathon, I got a flu like sickness a few days into my taper, and then food poisoning less than a week before it. Needless to say, I still ran it, plus I was well by like 5 days beforehand. But still not great timing\n\nbeen there: a week before Mexico City 2021 marathon, broken foot. a week before the same marathon in 2022, hurt back. I finally ran the 2023 version and improved my finish time by almost 10 minutes. so guys, \"never retreat, never surrender!\" 🏃🏻‍♂️🤘🏻👍🏻\n\n1 week to go before marathon. \n\nOne of the kids gets a sore throat. \n\n:S\n\nEver since having kids they seem to start coughing in my mouth every time a race approaches.\n\nClassic\n\nyou have it twisted, my man. you are not training to 'pursue running'. you are running. enjoy every step for it is a gift. take care.\n\nIt’s young Zuckerberg\n\n!remindme 1 week\n\nI will be messaging you in 7 days on [**2024-05-17 12:02:29 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2024-05-17%2012:02:29%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/trailrunning/comments/1cobqy4/seriously/l3f4ihp/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Ftrailrunning%2Fcomments%2F1cobqy4%2Fseriously%2Fl3f4ihp%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202024-05-17%2012%3A02%3A29%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Delete%20Comment&amp;message=Delete%21%201cobqy4)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&amp;message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&amp;subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|\n\nArmaforce, twice a day\n\nBruh.

    "all_comment_text": "From the Mittelland, northbound, crossing four ridges in the Swiss Jura mountains to reach a preselected public transport stop to make it home on time. \n\nTook a day off work, prepared lunch boxes and clothes for my two daughters, kissed my wife goodbye and took the first train. Started in the Mittelland in its famous thick fog. Missed the sunrise but up on the first Solothurn Jura crest, the views were spectacular.\n\n50 km, passed only one village, saw the first person on km 40. It is lonely in the Jura mountains and I needed that.\n\nHad my low point between d+ of 1‘800 and 2‘200. Steep (25-30%) grassy slopes on South looking, sun exposed hills are definitely not my specialty. Was able to refill my bladder at a farm with ice cold, tasty water (had another full bottle of isotonic drink still with me at the time). Water is scarce in our mountains, ruled by limestone and karst.\n\nSomehow, climbing the last 800 meters was easier than between 1‘000 and 2‘000. \n\nAt the end I could definitely carry on on moderate slopes. An additional 30% slope after 3‘000: nope.\n\nMy watch said: base training. But boy, it felt more than that.\n\nOh, and cows. Lots and lots of cows. And wild horses. Well, maybe not really wild, but that’s what I tell my daughters when I show them the pictures. And herds of Alpine chamois.\n\nCongratulations to people who are actually running the uphills of such courses. I am content to walk those sections, well, also in the distant future…\n\nI love this. Reading this feels like a mixture of a Lord of the Rings book mixed with a few modern conveniences.\n\nJust a nice run through the Two Rivers and Mountains of Mist\n\nIf only. Nothing like a Trolloc chasing you to help you beat the dark one’s own personal best.\n\nLol. The route *did* have a „bull on the pasture, be careful“ sign.\n\nThose photos are stunning! What a beautiful place to run.\n\nWhat a day and place to do it! Well done 👍\n\nSo beautiful!\n\nWow. That’s a great run.\n\nWow congrats! I can only hope to be able to do something like this in the future.  \nPerfect weather, too!\n\nWell, I mean my pace was far from great in the grand scheme of things lol…\n\nWishing you great success in your endeavours!\n\nCertainly wins for most photogenic route posted here! Congrats on the sick run!\n\n“Hey, what did you do on your day off yesterday?”\n\n*shows photos*\n\n“Oh…. Wow..”\n\nBeautiful run ! I’d be really thankful if you could give me a link or a GPX file. I’ve been planning to do something like this in that area.\n\nCount me in as well, trail looks awesome!\n\nHow can I share the GPX? It would be ready. I have many many more ideas…\n\nNice. Gpx wär highly appreciated!\n\nGPX would be ready:-) how can I share it?\n\nIcloud drive, google drive or microsoft cloud link maybe?\n\nI envy you. So beautiful. Bet that run felt amazing!\n\nShare the profile please!\n\nYou mean the route map or the elevation profile? Would love to do that but how?\n\nIn strava you can open the activity and scroll down a bit and you will have it under the workout analytics\n\nBeautiful.\n\nAmazing. Thanks for sharing the pictures O.P.\n\nOk wow\n\nBeautiful! I live in the area and have been looking for long runs. Thanks for sharing!\n\nOhhh e andere seeländer! Gratuliere krassi leistig\n\nDanke dir:-) also ich bin e Baselbieter, aber ha in de letzte Joor e zimligi Affination au für dr Jura Südfuess entdeckt!\n\n52km?!! Dang! You must be a relative of Iron Man (Marvel’s superhero)!!\n\nWell, not really. If you look at my elapsed time per km it is really nothing to write home about…\n\nHow do you manage to run here?!? I’d stop every 30 seconds to take more photos! :-) Congrats!\n\nYeah, I do that too. It helps in regulating the pace I reckon…to stay in zone 2 if possible\n\n😳 those are amazing pictures!! Thank you for sharing them!!!"

People of Switzerland tend to make fun of the so called Mittelland, which lies between the Jura mountains to the North and the Voralpen/Alpen to the South, because it is foggy very often. But hiking up the Jura mountains gets one out of the fog. \n\nTo the North, the fog seemed like a solid block of ice under clear blue skies. \n\nTo the south, the dea of fog was unbelievably thick (and I immersed myself in it on the way up and down again). \n\n„Sadly“, the Alps themselves (Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau; likely the most famous mountains of Switzerland after Monte Cervino) were rather hazy, so not the best views ever, but what do you gonna do…\n\nI want to go there one day.

But I don’t know who the other nine are.\n\n**Edit:** Whoever *is* on the list, #11 has to go to [Alan Francis](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/sports/21horseshoe.html), world champion horseshoe thrower.\n\nGood question. If we're talking all sports I'm going to give it a go here, in no particular order and men only:\n\n\nLionel Messi\n\nCristiano Ronaldo \n\nWayne Gretsky\n\nUsain Bolt\n\nMichael Phelps\n\nTiger Woods\n\nHafthor Bjornsson\n\nBabe Ruth\n\nMichael Jordan\n\n\nKevin Kiptum (RIP) probably had a good chance of making that list. That was much harder than I thought and I definitely will have missed some out just due to not knowing much about certain sports. It was also tough to leave out Nadal/Djok/Federer but I guess since all three are comparable they're not outliers as such.\n\nI'd pull back on Thor because his popularity comes from an era where he, Eddie Hall, and Brian Shaw were all big time players in Strongman.\n\nAs a suggested replacement, I'd put forward Lasha Talakhadze for the sport of weightlifting. The last time he was second place in something was the 2015 Weightlifting World Championships in which he came first in snatch, second in clean and jerk, and first overall. If you look at his overall, the last time he didn't take first place is the 2012 European Junior and U23 Chamlionships.\n\nHe's set 26 world records in a sport that has three categories (snatch, clean and jerk, total), and some of us are hopeful that he might be the first person to total 500kg.\n\nTo give you an idea of how strong he is, imagine a barbell with a pair of 45lb plates on either side of it. Think about the jump from one plate on either side to two plates on either side. Now imagine going up to five plates on either side. Think about how heavy that is. Odds are that 99% of the people in this subreddit will never even seriously consider deadlifting that much. Now watch Lasha snatch [that much weight](https://youtu.be/nrgnH9fTfGo?si=ztqC8WvLYQYkuTZb). If there are no more Lasha stans left in the world, it means I'm dead because he's top of my list for greatest strength athletes in the world.\n\nOkay, I'll give you that one just for the ridiculous snatch alone!\n\nUeli Steck (speed climbing/alpinism). Reinhold Messner (mountaineering). Alex Honnold (free-soloing).\n\nI feel like Adam Ondra is in with a shout - and Janja Garnbret by a mile if we were doing a women list.\n\nDefinitely Adam and Janja over Alex\n\nUeli Steck is a great shout. I'd probably argue against Honnold just because he is a mental outlier rather than an athletic outlier. There are a fair few comparable or better climbers, although obviously it's a grey area!\n\nMarc-André Leclerc would probably be a better example.\n\nTough to compare skills/technical based sports and team sport people vs physiology based sports like trail running/cycling (yes I know running and cycling still require skills). \n\nOf the ones you have there I would probably argue only Usain Bolt and maybe Michael Phelps are true peers, even then you could claim maybe Ian Thorpe could make a claim for that list (I’m Aussie, kill me)\n\nKipchoge could make a claim as well, I also agree Kiptum. Who else?\n\nYeah I was going off athletic meaning any sport that requires a decent level of physical ability.\n\nIf we're going off purely physical, I bet there are some track &amp; fielders that I don't know about. Kiptum and Kipchoge would definitely get in there, too.\n\nTo be honest, I don't even know why I bothered trying. There are just too many incredible athletes across too many sports to name just ten!\n\nYou forgot Secretariat\n\nI think Rich Froning or Matt Fraser should make the list (not a crossfitter) but the body of work they have both performed is pretty incredible. \n\nI think Ronaldo trumps Messi in athleticism not pure play soccer but in Athleticism. If that's the basis for the list then drop him. \n\nThen add Brian Shaw over the mountain and it's pretty solid. \n\nDamn, maybe Lebron over MJ. Bigggggg MJ fan but lebron is the better athlete. MJ the better ball player and goat\n\nI was going for overall outlier in the sport rather than specific athletic outlier, but if we are talking solely athletic then I agree with your amendments!\n\nObviously these lists are impossible, but Jim Thorpe and Jackie Robinson should be considered.\n\nI would say Tony Hawk should be on there as well\n\nYou missed the #1. Don Bradman\n\nThat'll be my zero knowledge of cricket showing.\n\nNo respect for Aleksandr \"The Experiment\" Karelin? Redefined his weight class, won 887 of 889 bouts, they literally changed the rules so he would finally lose for once.\n\nYeah, he definitely makes the list. That was an interesting read, thanks!\n\nCortney Dauwalter has to make this list regardless of odd filtering by gender.\n\nKipoge would be on there.\n\nBabe Ruth is a super weird addition... Ted Williams or Bo Jackson or Ohtani would all be better additions.\n\nLance Armstrong has to be on there, I get he cheated but still one of the most dominant athletes ever.\n\n[ Bjørn Dæhlie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rn_D%C3%A6hlie?wprov=sfti1#)\n\nSeems a fair shout, although I know literally nothing about cross country skiing!\n\nThorpe, Bradman, Bo Jackson\n\nOverall athlete? wouldn't put thor over other strongmen with much better careers (like brian) Phelps, Bolt, Ronaldo and Gretzky, 100%.\n\nWoods? He's good at golf, anything else? Compare him to Kilian or Phelps and both last mentioned will be Top 1% at multiple sports and disciplines\n\nAnyhow. Who cares.\n\nKelvin Kiptum*\n\nI don’t see Uncle Rico anywhere…\n\nBabe Ruth shouldn't be on that list \nYou probably have a better argument for Shohei Ohtani already.\n\nDoesn’t it suck knowing that Kipchoge would have been on any of these lists for lifelong achievement and now cause of Kiptums short lived race career Eliud has just been shelved\n\nJan Železný should be on there instead of Ronaldo.\n\nAlex Honnold is think is number 1.\n\nTook me 2hrs to do 7 miles with 1300ft of elevation 😆😆 and 8:30 for a 50k, this man would lap me 4 times!!\n\nCardiovascular freak. What I would do to experience running an ultra with his body.\n\nWithout his knowledge of how to fuel for every scenario, I’m pretty sure most of us would return his body broken after getting to use it for one race. Would be like driving a high end rental car lol\n\nHave you not seen the movie where he goes out for an all day effort in the mountains around his house and all he brings is three Snickers?\n\nThat is just sponsored. You might not know what he actually had.\n\nSponsored by Snickers?\n\nIt wasnt sponsored. By norwegian law that wpuld have to be clearly marked in the video.\n\nCrazy- what is the movie called?\n\nI would like to know as well\n\nTruth\n\nWhat would be the optimal way to run an ultra with his body though? Piggy back? Strapped to your front like a baby wrap?\n\nUnzip him Infront and jump in.\n\nLike a mech suit. Perfect.\n\nLike they say, it would feel a lot like running an ultra with your own body, it would just take a lot less time. \n\nSub 3 is a great accomplishment for a normie but sub 3 marathon with *6000* ft of vert is alien\n\nSometimes it's hard to wrap your head around the numbers/data of his athletic abilities so one of my favorite quotes about Kilian's fitness comes from [this article](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/climbing/ultrarunner-kilian-jornet-everest-controversy/):\n\n&gt;“If genes dictating performance are like a row of light switches, all of his are flipped on,” says Eric Carter, 31, a member of the U.S. ski-mountaineering team. “I’ve trained with him, working as hard as I can, soaked in sweat, and the guy is still in his down parka, chatting away.”\n\nImagine being *that* much more fit than someone on the US Skimo team. This guy is an elite athlete and he's redlining and sweating while Kilian is conversational in his down parka. The mind boggles.\n\nI can’t even run 4:14 on a flat road!\n\nThat’s absolutely insane.\n\nI'm a little upset he stopped 170m short.\n\nPythagoras the vert to it, he should be there right?\n\nMy mind cannot comprehend how this is even possible. what a beast\n\nI remember that there was a thread once about how kipchoge would still beat kilian jornet in a marathon with 2000m of elevation gain… yea no 😅\n\n[deleted]\n\nAnd Magnus is disguised as himself while shirtless\n\nHahahahahha I laughed so hard at this \n\nJim Walmsley runs a flat road marathon in around 2:15.\nI bet Eliud would be also very good in the uphills but for sure Kilian and Jim would be far better in technical descents…\n\nExactly but I would even go as far and say that kilian has kipchoge on a untechnical marathon with 2000m+\nYou need different muscle composition to run downhill as opposed to only flat.\n\nYes. And I would watch both from afar, while I „power“hike the uphills (plus taking lots of pictures) lol\n\nDefinitely possible if Kipchoge had trained for it\n\nKipchoge has never run a good hilly marathon. He excels on flat courses like Berlin and London. There’s really no evidence to suggest he could beat to this kind of effort.\n\nUh no he still would. Pro marathoning is another level in terms of competition. Look up videos of kenyan long runs, it’s like 4x4 roads a lot of the time.\n\nI don’t buy it. Kipchoge has choked every time he’s tried to run a hilly marathon course. Yes pro marathoning has more competition, but there just isn’t any evidence that kipchoge specifically would be the man to beat Killian at something like this.\n\nIt’s all about the 2000m downhill that would destroy kipchoge. He‘s trained for flat and fast. In order to bomb down a steep downhill you need a different type of muscular adaptation. Kipchoge wouldn’t stand a chance, especially not if there are two 1000m climbs each followed up by a 1000m downhill. Eliud would struggle really hard in the second climb and lose his lead.\n\nAll we need is to compare their VO2MAX\n\nWas he riding a car or what? Insane.\n\nActually riding a mountain goat.\n\nFor the first kilometer, then the goat rode him.\n\nThat's amazing, and that elevation!\n\nChrist, that’s fast! I mean, for most people a 5k at that pace is a serious challenge.\n\nIs that avg 6:48 min per mile?? Damn\n\nAlien confirm. \n\nThe goat strikes again\n\nCrazy.\n\nHe was probably in zone 1 the whole time too\n\nCrazy.\n\nIs that the elapsed time? Seems insane\n\nYeah just checked cos I couldn't believe it and the elapsed time is 2:59:47, outrageous\n\nCrqzy!\n\nIt's 175 m short of a marathon, start again!\n\nWhat a beast.\n\nIs the a 3.22 GAP? So equivalent to 3.22 on the flat ultimately?\n\nIsn’t the gap per km? So 3.22 * 42km = 141 minutes? Maybe you had a typo. I work on 1km flat for 100m elev gain as a rule of thumb which gives me 2:02\n\nThat conversion is too aggressive. It’s more like 200m to 1km for an elite athlete on less technical/steep trails. The GAP supports this at the equivalent of a flat 53km run.\n\nFair. It’s a rule of thumb which seems roughly right for me, but I am not Killian (far from it!)\n\nI generally use 100m for very technical/steep trails, 150m on average trail, and 200m for easy trail/road. To me it depends on how much you can open up your stride on the downhill to make up time and the steeper inclines have worse running economy\n\nThat’s not a marathon, that’s 62km (1k for 100m elev gain). I got downvoted in a different sub recently for saying that trail runners would transition to fast road quicker than vice versa, this makes my argument.\n\nWhy do you say that 100m elev gain accounts for 1k? Where does that calculation come from?\n\n&gt;(1k for 100m elev gain).\n\n\nYou say it like its some scientific fact. Its not.\n\nApologies, I should have said it’s a rule of thumb I read somewhere and it seems to roughly work for me, but I am not Killian. \n\nI think we can all agree Killian is a hero and this is an incredible time."

When he goes…I don’t even know. We don’t deserve pets. They are everything.\n\nI hope he keeps it up for as long as possible and never stops.  I hope he also kicks cancer ass and he can running for many years to come.  👍👍👍🤞🤞🤞\n\n❤️ 💪🏼\n\nBro is 98 and in way better shape than I am at 52!\n\nReally amazing! That's one lucky pup (or two), enjoying every moment!\n\nMen see this and be like hell yeah\n\nThis is awesome. I lost my running buddy abruptly in 2020. Miss her everyday. But my new buddy loves short runs\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt’s always Americans too. If you visit another country you’ll notice off leash dogs everywhere and nobody seems to have a problem with it. \n\nBut ah yes, America the nanny state needs to tell everyone how to live their lives.\n\nAbsolutely not true. If you have your dog of leash here in the Netherlands where it’s not allowed you’re an ah as well. Same goes for my visits all over Europe.\n\n\"Freedom\"\n\nLove your puppers OP! Wish I could post a picture, my guy Danny looks super similar to yours and has also gone through cancer and treatment. Still gets out on the trails!\n\nAnd don’t stress the asshats complaining about leashing your pups. You clearly know the area and and obviously giving them the absolute best life!\n\nI wish I  were more like a dog.\n\nPlease leash your dogs\n\nI understand the motivation for your comment. Off leash dogs are one of my pet peeves. I know that there are too many inconsiderate people out there who say their off leash dogs are friendly (doesn't matter) or have perfect recall (no dog does). I even understand how some people might have a measure of PTSD from bad experiences with off-leash dogs. in fact, both of the dogs in this video would be afraid of other dogs off-leash.  \nhowever, know the trails you run on. I have never seen another person or dog on this trail, and the sightlines are good enough that if I did I would have both of my dogs leashed before we were close.  \nthank you, though, for the reminder that leashing dogs on the trail is by and large the respectful, considerate and legal way to go.\n\nThank you for knowing your area. Even knowing that situation, it's still safer for you and your dogs and anyone you might run into to have them on leash. I hope your pup does well with chemo.\n\nThe sight lines are definitely not good enough for recall based on this video alone. You should definitely be leashing these pups if it's an on leash required area.\n\nok you people are officially making me very tired. I get it. People should leash their dogs. but you do not know the specific consequences of this context. stop it.\n\nDon't really care about the context. If leashes are required on these trails then your dogs aren't above the rules and should be leashed.\n\nand I don't care what you care about or not. get a fucking life.\n\nNo. Maybe this is in an off-leash area. Maybe the owner just wants to let his dogs run and play, as is their right as fellow creatures of this planet. Mind your own damn business.\n\nJudging how one dog still has the leash on I would assume this is not an off-leash area.\n\nI walk dogs on leash in off-leash-legal areas all the time. Maybe it's a foster dog, maybe it's a dog who doesn't have a reliable recall yet, maybe the dog is deaf or has high prey drive.\n\nactually, none of the above. she's my own sweet little girl and has great recall. I just leave the leash on her by force of habit\n\nNo worries,  I wasn't trying to start an argument with you. I just thought fettuccine8080's comment was a bit odd and wanted to offer some alternative explanations.\n\nLet's assume it's not an off leash area. What happens when OP's friendly dog runs up to a dog whose owner is responsible and has them on leash, and the dog doesn't respond well to having its space invaded? Then OP's already sick dog is injured, and it's 100% their fault. Or if there's somebody who's scared of dogs and reasonably expects that all dogs will be on leash? Then OP is responsible for ruining somebody's day, possibly giving them a panic attack, possibly responsible for their dog attacking that person if the dog doesn't respond well to somebody being scared of them. Chemo causes unpredictable behavior changes, even in well behaved dogs.\n\nIf it is an off leash area, then good for them and my bad. Still a good reminder for people to leash their fucking dogs where it's required. I love dogs, but off leash dogs on trails are rude at best, a dangerous menace at worst.\n\n&gt; Let’s assume it’s not an off-leash area\n\nWhy would that be the assumption on a video of someone taking their dog off leash? lol\n\nIt’s a big, crazy world out there. A lot of things could go wrong, but I’m not about to live my life in fear of what *might* happen. \n\nDo you ever drive 5 MPH over the speed limit? Because that’s inherently more dangerous, it decreases your reaction and braking time, and you could cause harm to yourself or someone else but I’m willing to bet you don’t think twice about it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's not an off leash trail. OP admitted as such in another comment.\n\nIck. Not an appropriate place for that.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI get what you’re saying, but it’s a post about an ill dog.\n\nWhy not just assume they are following local rules and etiquette before jumping on your high horse?\n\n[deleted]\n\nNone of the trails *where I live* are off leash... yet 75% of the dogs are.\n\nEdited for specificity.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNope. Was adding a personal anecdote to the discussion, as people do on Reddit.\n\n&gt; Please leash your dog\n\nIt’s not a personal anecdote, it’s a request to do something with 0 context on what’s going on. And you’re right, people do make assumptions and holier-than-thou requests on Reddit all the time and it’s annoying\n\nI never told anyone to leash their dog, geez.\n\nAhh, you’re right I thought you were the top-level comment. I apologize :( sorry\n\n[deleted]\n\nLOL at first glance I thought your handle was Historical-Hitler. need glasses"

Huge congrats on your first 1/2 marathon. Hope you’re excited for more. Keep up the good work!\n\nI find them both impressive, like I’m amazed by the people who are super quick, but the ones who did the full marathon and took 6-7 hour are heroes I don’t think I’d have the mental toughness for that.

I see what you did there\n\nSo the whole of humanity?\n\nWipe it off if it hurts you so deeply.\n\nChalk is washed away by rain, don’t be so dramatic.\n\nI guess it could be paint, but i had the same thought.  Isn't this just chalk dust? That doesn't seem destructive to me.\n\nThis is Reddit. Where people drive to and from the trailhead for 3 hours by car (one way, alone), obviously not detrimental to the environmen. Also, as if Big Trail (UTMB) doesn’t deface the environment, yet Redditors follow that race meticulously.\n\nNah, it’s leave no trace in Sedona. This is not cool whether temporary or not. People cone to enjoy the natural beauty not some dipshit’s birthday message.\n\nWho knows when it’ll rain. Banana peels take 2 years to decompose. Sure it’ll wash away/decompose, but no one wants to see that and it is defacing nature.\n\nGood job they didn’t draw it with banana peel then\n\nIf it doesn't rain in the next two years, a little chalk is going to be least of everyone's problems.\n\n&gt; two years\n\nArizona here. Yes, it’s an arid climate - but it’s not the Atacama. In fact, Sedona gets heavy (think 1 inch in 30 minutes) monsoon rains this time of year — so it’ll likely be gone soon. But yeah, it’s a selfish and needless act on shared public lands. Parents please teach your children not to do this.\n\nI'm not sure who's on the down vote parade but I feel many are missing the main take away, don't deface nature in the first place. Then we don't need to worry about what mother nature will or won't do. Oh, and the thousands of people that look at it don't have to eye roll and shake their heads at someone else's stupidity.\n\nYa I don’t know what kind of repercussions chalk has but my point is exactly that, don’t deface nature in the first place. It was chalky ALL over the summit and there was leftover confetti strands. Freaking pick up your trash and don’t leave a mess for someone else. Tacky and disrespectful.\n\nIt might have made the point better if you showed the trash and the nasty messages. It's a lot harder to be upset about a heart and a birthday message.\n\nThis is why petroglyphs make me SO ANGRY.\n\nOP’s smart phone wreaked more havoc alone in production\n\nIt's the equivalent of saying \"Well, if you get punched in the face, the bruise will go away\". Maybe we look at it as \"Don't destroy nature\" and \"Don't say stupid things\" and that prevents both things from happening.\n\nThats not equivalent at all…\n\nlol, I don’t know what to say to that except I hope your loved ones aren’t barraged by this kind on false equivalences. Easily washable chalk is not the same at all. No rocks were harmed in the marking of the rocks.\n\nImagine if everyone starts thinking, hey chalk isn't destructive and will wash off. Let's draw on the rocks out in the wilderness. And then we all get to look at that crap when we're trying get away and be out in nature. Yes, chalk will wash off. But it doesn't need to be there in the first place. People should show some respect and stop behaving like ten year olds.\n\nWell, we can say that Mary knows a douche. I hate that people feel the need to deface nature. Jackasses. Edit: And they forgot the apostrophe in \"It's.\" All-around failure.\n\nPenmanship is the real crime here\n\nI’d much rather chalk over pen or paint. Best of a bad situation\n\nDon’t worry it wil rain… in 9 months\n\nI think you need to cry more\n\nPlot twist: OP wrote it\n\nIf you piss over it, it is gone..\n\nThe use of durable / designated pathways and off pathways  helps mitigate negitive impacts due to foot traffic.   This is well within the ethos of LNT.\n\nThere are far better places to trail run in Sedona than the airport mesa loop\n\nI like the chock. But don't self incriminate  yourself r get death threats on this site\n\nHonestly people just like getting angry. Take half your water bottle and gently rinse it off. Would take as long as photographing it, then no one else has to ever see it. The things I see in the backcountry regularly, other posts I’ve seen on Reddit *today*, there’s is much MUCH bigger threats to the integrity of our wild places than some chalk. \n\nYou know, I hate to say it, but the people who do this kinda thing roll their eyes at people like us. People who clean up after them, who care at an emotional level when they see stuff like this. But then they’ll see a post like this, and may actually be justified in their contempt.\n\nKeep your eyes on the trail or else ……"

Your picture gets me hyped!\n\nCham is lovely but Courmayeur is nicer😅😁😁 enjoy your trip the mont blanc valley is simply awesome 😁\n\nCourmayeur is better!  I was there for most of a week and ran GTC 100k in July, loved it there!  Although I have to say I'm not a fan of Peroni beer, give me a Sierra Nevada or a Deschutes pale ale any day. . .\n\nArtisanal beers are the answer , even if I'm not really a birra fan, more of a gin guy 😅😁\n\nWow! I'd really lov to be there.\n\nOne day\n\nWhat do you do there for a living?\n\nI'm in the army\n\nNoted! But I don't want a beer (yet). I want to run around that scenery!\n\nIf you'll wait for me (I'm a slow guy) I'll happily show you around 💪🤟\n\nYou taking a piss into that trough?\n\nNo I've better places to piss around here 😅😁\n\nI happen to be in Maison vielle at this moment day 1 into doing TMB! I cannot believe you live here. This area is GORGEOUS and incredible\n\nIt is a lovely place indeed, enjoy your TMB it's one of the best experience you can have on the alps, the mont balc valley is awesome also in france and suisse, if this evening you're staying in Courmayeur don't forget toe get a Spritz for aperitif and enjoy a great pizza! Feel free to ask any info you could need from a local :)\n\nHere is beautiful!!\n\nI'll definitely put that on my list, might see you in ~2 years time 🍻\n\nI'll wait for you buddy, never too late to chug a beer with a friend\n\nThis picture made me really thirsty!!\n\nIs this close to heaven?!!! Looks serene🏞️\n\nHope not to close... Still have stuff to do down here😅😅\n\n😄😄 let's say heaven on earth 🌍\n\nHope to get into CCC next year!\n\nSame for me, I'm trying to train enough for it, this year I'll do the etc for the stone, I was lucky enough to close the gtc55 this year and I plan to do a race every month until next August (I'll try to do some.other umtb circuit races in the meantime), my dream is to be able to do the utmb in 2 years from now, and if I find someone crazy enough to tag along I'd love to do the ptl before I die 😁😁😅😅\n\nI got into CCC in 2020 (thanks Covid) but I did not maintain an index. I hope I will at least run the TMB in the next few years!\n\nAwesome place to live around.  If I ever was in the neighborhood, I’d give you a heads up.\n\ni'll wait for you :)\n\nGorgeous! Lucky you. I took the train from Geneva to Milan once and I think I must have passed close to where you are. The scenery was unforgettable.\n\nNot so close but close enough, italian alps are really something to behold\n\nRevising my nutrition plan. I will need all the carbs before the big climb to Tete de la Tronche. See you on Friday morning 🍻\n\n🤟💪🍻\n\nCome cheer us on when we pass by on Friday during the PTL 😉. Enjoy the weather should be another great week.\n\nI'll do, as I said the ptl is my dream in a closet, enjoy your run, it is the most awesome race of the Alps💪💪💪🤟🤟🤟\n\nDude it was epic. During the event I thought this is the last time. But now back home the craving has already returned.\n\nYeah that's how it goes, you insult yourself while running only to sign up for something else as soon as you get home :) i have another 20k in 3 weeks for the same reason :)\n\nDefinitely a bucket list destination for a run. Would definitely be keen to be in contact.\n\nAs i said earlier, if you're willing to wait for me while running (i'm slooooooow) i'll be happy to show you around :D\n\nI've sent a DM\n\nDid the TMB 3 years ago and recognized this immediately! Some of the fondest memories of my life\n\nThat's not a picture of the beer, right?\n\nNo we're not in America here😅😁 joking guys but your beers ARE light 😅\n\nCiao! I often go to Courmayeur to ski. Might take you up on that beer offer 😁\n\nAbsolutely, I'll wait for you on the slopes then 😁💪🍻\n\nIs that Mont Chetif I see in front of me?  Is this picture taken at Tiricorne?\n\nYes it is 😁"

Lol.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’d bring a Bluetooth speaker and play the Benny Hill theme while they speed walk after me running around the park.\n\nCareful about making any reference to using a BT speaker while out on the trails, pal.\n\nGotta go nuclear in response to stop this sort of thing.\n\nYou think the government cares about breaking the law? Pshh laws are for plebs.\n\nI have to say this sign is bizarre. Who is this trail for? You're clearly in an English speaking country would you feel terribly put out by telling us where this sign is?\n\nSign may have been provided by the Ministry of Silly Walks https://www.facebook.com/thejohncleese/videos/the-ministry-of-silly-walks-monty-python-/1400884020505434/\n\nThought of this for some reason https://youtu.be/RGJb2iLvOKE?si=gs4C5jyzUZtOZ7PL\n\nI have seen this in some nature preserves, generally because a preserve is supposed to be there for the animals more than the people.  Those places are usually off limits to doggos too.\n\nI am a human animal\n\nNon-native, which means you just need to find another invasive species and keep pace with it.\n\nTrail runs in Africa only\n\nThe lions will keep it competitive\n\nAnd the hippos will keep Runners like me feeling like we still deserve the pizza afterwards.\n\nHIPPOBOT 9000 v 3.1 FOUND A HIPPO. 1,780,145,122 COMMENTS SEARCHED. 37,083 HIPPOS FOUND. YOUR COMMENT CONTAINS THE WORD HIPPO.\n\nIf you went off trail and stepped in a puddle of diarrhea behind a knobby beech tree, that might have been bear squirts or it might have been human man squirts. Who’s to tell?\n\nIt’s actually pretty easy to tell the difference. Human poop is a lot grosser and bear poop is full of blueberry/blackberry seeds this time of year, depending on where you are. Consider digging a hole, and find a spot that’s at least 200ft away from water, streams included.\n\nRight, but they're saying it's OK to walk - just not OK to run. Doesn't really make much sense to me...\n\nDo the animals have to walk as well?\n\nIt’s totally fine. The animals are not allowed to run of make noise either.\n\nI actually ran there once, just to defy the rules. \nLater I was told that there is a local committee of rich ladies who oversee the manicuring of the grounds and they feel that runners terror up the trail.\n\nOf course it's old ladies making the rules, they are the only ones who dramatically jump out of the way when I slowly jog past them.\n\nAfter they first never heard you coming if if you are huffing and puffing like a steamboat?\n\nThe other day I exclaimed that I will be passing on the left, to no response. I continue to gain ground on the old woman and again say runner on the left. I finally get next to her and say good morning, and she fucking jumps away like I just pounced at her, and then tells me I need to be more courteous. Lady I told you twice, it’s not my fault you’re unaware of your surroundings.\n\nCurrently in the Swiss alps. People still don’t expect me. So I say ‘pardon’ nicely and slow down. Say ‘pardon’ again. \n\nIt’s beautiful out here though.\n\nIf I slow down any more I’d be crawling\n\nIn the alps / german speaking places i always do the super chipper “hallllooooo!!! ‘Schuldigung! Danke! Schönen tag noch!!”\n\nA cheery \"aus dem Weg, sofort!\" also does the trick, while conforming to the authoritarian streak in the national psyche\n\nshould be \"aus dem Weg... SOFORT!\"...\n\nNot just old ladies. There are a lot of people just not paying attention even when you yell to them.\n\nI was on a mountain trail once, came up on a couple older guys, called out, they moved aside, I pass. I then come up behind who I'm assuming was their wives a little further ahead. These ladies were chatting with each other (no earbuds etc) and I could not get them to acknowledge the fact I was behind them wanting to pass. I did the normal \"behind ya\" then the same louder, still no reaction, still just chatting and walking. I literally could not pass them because the trail was so tight. I ended up getting like 3ft behind them almost screaming and they still did not hear me. I ended up going \"HEY! HEY! HEY!\" I was sure they were doing this on purpose. Once I got to a wider bit of trail I was able to pass them and they acted startled. It was really almost unbelievable.\n\nUgh I have had to do this too. An older couple was snowshoeing, taking up literally the entire trail. They would not let me pass them. I did not have snowshoes on, and could not step off trail without sinking into two feet of snow. But they could. Did they? Of course not. Until I asked them, \"excuse me, would you mind please stepping off to the side so we can pass through?\" I KILLED THEM WITH KINDNESS.\n\nI'm just gonna start running with my portable speaker blaring yacht rock, that should do it.\n\n1000% but the only ones to get mad at me for them not paying attention are old ladies\n\nThere's a gal in my area who goes walking out on the woodland trail with sound-blocking headphones and a parasol. \n\nThe parasol stays UP, even when she's in the deep shade of the trees. \n\nI've been behind her, literally shouting an arm's reach behind her, \"Passing on your left!\" and she doesn't hear me. \n\nI've resorted to tapping the parasol to get her attention. This happens at least weekly.\n\nMy rcj brain says megaphone and bear noises but my normal brain says you need to figure out what time she goes and avoid that\n\nThere are actual black bears and mountain lions in this trail system, so I think she'd actually hoping for them at this point.\n\nPeople that wear sound blocking headphones in public are a different breed\n\nUse an air horn\n\nOh yeah! Or one of those personal running alarms. Damn, I am going to do that next time. Whoops, sorry it went off by mistake, I was just reaching for my Gu--\n\nI had this problem on a fairly well-used trail back in the day, so many old folks who can't hear and people on headphones! And the trail was relatively narrow too so I'd def be in their space while passing. I gave up on yelling and swiped my neices bike ringy thing, it has a loop that slides onto my finger, fits right in the palm of my hand, and it is plenty loud. Saved me many awkward situations and makes people laugh!\n\nI’ve found riding my bike on popular trails, people tend to freak out and get more in your way when you announce or ring a bell. Seems safer (on my end) to just go by without ding dinging because then people jump right in front of me half the time lol\n\nI had a lady get mad me at once in that exact same scenario and told me I should wear a bell, like I want to listen to a jingle bell for 20+ miles just because you are totally unaware of your surroundings\n\nSome of us can’t hear you. Have some empathy for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nYou don't wear your jester jogging hat with bells?\n\nAh this sounds like what I was thinking was happening. Drove to Percy Warner park from there and went through some super nice communities. I got some death stares from ladies for not slowing down and moving over enough when they were walking I guess? Didn’t seem like a friendly community.\n\nI'm not familiar with the area at all, but around here, the rules of the park are clearly posted on permanent signs with contact information for the governing authority.  This is none of those and really seems to be locals making up their own rules.  While I try to share the parks and trails around here, they are for everyone's use, not one particular group of people.\n\nEven when there are fixed signs or rules on paper behind plastic under a pitched roof kiosk, I've seen those plastic sandwich sign displays at parks - both with and without an official seal and contact info. It seems like it could be official and legit - just a stupid rule.\n\nTypically it's to better ensure those entering a trail will see the rules, to notify visitors about rules that are temporary (bees on trail, bridge closed), or to emphasize rules/guidance for safety (human/animal heat stroke risk, avoid bees).\n\nhttps://tnstateparks.com/parks/radnor-lake\n\nJust a Google away.\n\nThat doesn't really tell me if the local government typically does what I mentioned is done when I am.\n\nI don't know what you just said, but:\n\n&gt; The park is day-use only and the 7.75-miles of trail are strictly used for hiking, photography, and wildlife observation. Pets, jogging, and bicycles are only allowed on the Otter Creek Road trail.\n\nSo it doesn't seem like locals making up their own rules; it's the state park leadership making up the rules for the state park.\n\nProbably similar to homeowners who live on trails and work to disallow the parking that has always existed for access to the same trails.\n\nI used to park at a trailhead that now has a tall fence and a deadbolted gate. Apparently the people who lived there didn’t like people using their trailhead so they locked it up and gave themselves keys. I keep meaning to take my cordless grinder and teach some lessons. It just like when i lived at the beach and the homeowners would remove the public parking signs and put up private beach signs to trick people. They’d try to tell me it’s a private beach and I’d just tell them to call the cops. Never once did the cops come. And typically no one else was surfing there. It’s just assholes who think they own public spaces.\n\nI've heard this is a place frequented a lot by serial killers because their victims are forbidden from running away.\n\nThat makes me want to come back in cleats and do my best “fee fi fo fum” stomp around since that isn’t against the rules\n\nSo it's not actually against the law the only consequence is to piss off some already pissed off old farts? Sounds like you can run there without worries.\n\nRich ladies with too much time you say?\n\nMulch perfectly placed you say?\n\nWell then, I think I have a new project\n\nIf they think running will destroy the trails wait until the mountain bikers show up…\n\nThing is they'd have to break their own rules by running to catch you.  Just keep up the speed and you're good to go!\n\nTerror up and tear ‘er right back down; scary indeed\n\nOops!  I just noticed that I misspelled \"tear\". Did mean to plant \"terror\" in anyone's minds\n\nYet bicycles are not on the prohibited list????\n\nHa!  I was going to say there's a local park here that does it (Radnor).  \n\nTo answer your question from another post, all the homes in that area are multi-million dollars.  It's just the rich controlling people.  They did the same to a new trail that opened recently, and there's another park with the same rule.\n\nIf there is an actual reason not to run, I'm all ears, but I've never heard one.  There are a lot of choices made in metro parks that are pretty questionable.\n\nYeah that’s what I gathered. Oh well. Plenty of other places to run I suppose. Luckily I’m just visiting. Went to Percy Warner park and had a great run!\n\nIf you're still in town, Long Hunter is another option that's flatter.  Beaman is good, too.  Just depends where you are.\n\nThanks! Yes I’m staying near Vanderbilt for work for a fews days. I’ll check those out!\n\nIn our area, running is not allowed on any national wildlife refuge. \n\nRunning is thought to stress the animals by signaling flight or attack. \n\nBut also, on almost every national wildlife refuge around me there are large mammals that can be scared into attacking if runners appear out of nowhere. Common examples for this are herds of bison or solitary moose.\n\nThere are National Forests where moose are super common that do allow running but those tend to have less usage, in general. \n\nThe Rocky Mountain Arsenal, which has a herd of bison had 500,000 visitors to 15,000 acres. \n\nBy comparison, Medicine Bow is 2,200,000 million acres and had 658,000 visitors. \n\nThat difference is usage is one reason why trail running regulations differ.\n\nThis park in question is a couple miles away from a normal park where the deer will just as likely stare at you as run away when you run up on them.\n\nFair. Just answering your question in a general sense about why running is restriced in some areas.\n\nLol in Percy Warner and Shelby you can stand between a mom and her babies and she won’t even stop eating\n\nOh, those runners passed me and I had to scoot over for them. It was traumatic and inconvenient so from henceforth, no more running!\n\nLol. What are jogging steps going to do to a dirt trail that hiking shoes wouldn't. So petty and insidious.\n\nThere's a site on the coast of Washington like this, it's a bird sanctuary and a short trail, so I get it.\n\n\n\nWhat I don't get, is it's next to a small airport, and while we were there for 40 minutes, an army Chinook helicopter sat engines idling the entire time, you could smell the exhaust and even the grease 🙄\n\nI've never seen anything like this but, to be fair, they're also prohibiting three other activities. Dogwalkers are a pretty big constituency in my area.\n\nParks dept employee here. If we banned dog walking and jogging, we'd have like 10 visitors. Lol\n\nMaybe they should entirely close the trail to protect the animals. A bare path right through their area is more impactful than someone who runs by.\n\nSo it looks like people should hike on the trail, and have their dogs off trail.\n\nSounds like a nice day to me haha\n\nThey'll have to catch me!\n\nThat’s right because the fastest they are allowed to chase you is a speed walk! Lmao\n\nExactly!\n\nI'm like a whippet.\n\nI used to live close to here. This is a protected area where human intervention is strictly limited. For example, fallen trees are not removed except for specific sections that fall over the trail. Algae growing on the lake is left alone, causing a strong smell. There are numerous endangered species of plants that are studied by universities across the world. So yeah, they take it pretty seriously.\n\nThis park is an eagle sanctuary too iirc.\n\nWhy not just remove the trails? They look pretty plush trail for an endangered Species grotto.\n\nMaybe they should, but I bet they also figure a well-manicured trail discourages ad-hoc trails.\n\nI’ve seen something like this at a place that is well known for birdwatching. Runners and birdwatchers don’t mix well.\n\nFWIW, I've been a birder much longer than I've been a runner and this is the first I've ever heard about a conflict. Not to say it never comes up, but I've never heard anyone call it out as an issue. The big conflicts birders have is with off-leash dog people any maybe those goofballs with a bluetooth speaker trying to hold their own rave on the trail. \n\nI've heard more pushback on trail runners from some old school hikers who seem to think people aren't enjoying the scenery enough or are putting themselves at risk by not carrying enough safety equipment.\n\nI've been told off by hikers before. Literally had one proudly say, \"hiking isn't good enough for you?\" while running on the John Muir trail. I was having the best time of my life and soaked in all the scenery just fine. Never heard a complaint from a birder on a public trail. Though I'm usually cautious when I see them.\n\nThis even happens with faster hikers. I know of at least one popular Youtube hiker who had people giving him shit in the comments because he hiked the PCT \"too fast\". I think he was hitting \\~35mi days at his peak so not exactly sprinting north.\n\nI had a hiker complain about me running on a pretty technical and scenic trail before, saying I was wasting the scenery. I responded with “I’ll get to see at least 2 times more of it than you will, so enjoy your little hike.” He didn’t like that very much 😂\n\n&gt; Runners and birdwatchers don’t mix well.\n\nDude, what? \n\nI’m both and I’ve never encountered an issue with birders. Unless you’re running through a tidal flat full of resting shorebirds or crashing through tall grass where birds are known to be nesting, I can’t imagine a conflict. Those are things dogs sometimes do, though, which can be an issue. \n\nInvariably birders and trail runners are aligned on recreational issues, including trail access and wilderness conservation.\n\nAlso trail running as a birder is amazing. I can get through so many different habitats in a few hours. It’s one of those things that makes trail running even better.\n\nEDIT: the fact there are some wildlife refuges where running is restricted does not mean birders are fundamentally in conflict with runners.\n\nThere's a wildlife preserve in WA st (Nisqually Refuge) that explicitly bans any running/jogging on the trails (also dogs/bikes/etc).\n\nThe fact that there are sensitive habitats that strictly limit people’s behaviour doesn’t not mean that “runners and birdwatchers don’t mix well.” You’re cherry-picking an example. \n\nMeanwhile there are countless parks, forests, and public lands that both happily coexist in.\n\nThe loop trail that goes around Walden Pond in Concord MA has a \"no running\" sign. This is a very popular trail, and is the way most people get to the Thoreau Cabin site. You can run on all other trails in the reservation.\n\nsomething I don't see discussed enough in the trail running world is the shit we erroneously get. i was reading the guidebook for a 50 mile loop trail that said \"ultra-style\" attempts were not welcome as they are \"ecologically, economically, and socially destructive.\" it really pissed me off. they're saying runners beat up trails / leave trash and hurt the ecosystem, we move fast and don't stop at the stores and buy snacks to support local economy (lol), and we don't get to know ppl because we are soooo obsessed with moving fast (gimme a break, trail runners are the nicest ppl I know).\n\nI think it’s a jealousy/inferiority thing for some people. If moving is a grind for them how dare you be light and fast and happy! Some people hate to see others have fun.\n\neh, maybe. the folks who wrote the guidebook I was reading are avid hikers, but they're boomers and close-minded. they have the type of mindset where they think their enjoyment of nature is purest. runners move too fast and don't know how to truly connect with nature. it's BS. anyone who has spend significant time on the AT for example knows that you have to 'hike your own hike' - don't yuck other peoples' yum, there are different ways to experience and enjoy the world, etc.\n\nAs a noob trail runner I ALWAYS slow down to a walk when passing people in any direction, no matter how wide the trail, because of this type of attitude. I’m probably being too careful, but it often seems like people hate trail runners.\n\nJudging from [the state parks site](https://tnstateparks.com/parks/radnor-lake), I'm assuming it's due to concern about wildlife:\n  \n&gt;Radnor Lake State Park is a 1,368-acre park and is protected as a Class II Natural Area. It is unique due to the abundance of wildlife viewing opportunities, environmental education programs, hiking opportunities, and its location in an urban area. The park is day-use only and the 7.75-miles of trail are strictly used for hiking, photography, and wildlife observation. Pets, jogging, and bicycles are only allowed on the Otter Creek Road trail. The Lake Trail is accessible to people with all-terrain wheelchairs.    \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n  \n  \n  \n\n&gt;The park is perfect for nature enthusiasts to observe owls, herons, and waterfowl as well as many species of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals such as mink and otter. Hundreds of species of wildflowers, mosses, fungi, ferns, and other plants, as well as trees, shrubs, and vines, add to the natural ecological diversity of the area. Several ranger-led programs are planned throughout the year including canoe floats, wildflower walks, astronomy night hikes, nature hikes, programs on snakes, off-trail land acquisition hikes, and birds of prey.   \n    \nI've seen a few parks with restrictions like that. \n\nEdit: It explicitly says that on the [park's own site](https://radnorlake.org/park/faq/):  \n  \n&gt;Why can’t I bike, jog, or bring dogs on the trails at Radnor? Why is picnicking not allowed?  \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n  \n  \n&gt;These activities interfere with wildlife observation and upset the delicate balance of the sensitive ecosystem maintained at Radnor Lake. You can, however, jog, bike, and take your dogs on the road. Picnicking handouts and left-behind crumbs can also affect the wildlife and ecosystem in negative ways.\n\nIf you want to trail run in Nashville, don’t go to Radnor, go to Percy Warner Park. It’s 11 minutes away.\n\nUsed to live in Nashville but now live in Portland, OR. Sure, I’ve got good trails to run here but I do miss Percy Warner.\n\nIs it illegal to leave plastic signs out blocking the trail? Bunch of idiot busybodies\n\n[removed]\n\nSuper wide well groomed trail. Parking lot was full especially for a weekday but there was plenty of space on the trails. I think someone important doesn’t like trail runners ruining their walks.\n\n[removed]\n\nYeah but I found another park nearby and had an awesome run so it’s all good! I totally get not running around temples etc. only time I was told to turn around was when I ran too close to the Arlington cemetery in  DC one time.\n\nI run through our local cemetery. Never had any complaints from the locals. Quiet bunch in general.\n\nYou are keeping their spirits up.\n\nUrban yes but not more busy than the other parks in the city that have runners.\n\nI think it's about the perception of why you're there.  Walking=enjoying nature,  jogging=workout.  I've broken that rule in an urban park,  but it was pretty empty,  if I saw old ladies birding I'd probably walk until out of sight and then jogged again.\n\nYou might be right about what others think. I don’t personally agree with that because if I didn’t want to enjoy nature I would be in a treadmill in the AC. Plus I had an owl land in the trail to eat his catch right in front of me on my alternate trail I ran so I did some briding during my run! Ha ha.\n\nTorres del Paine National Park had a no running rule on their trails. I think it was more about minimizing the risk of injuries in remote areas where they had limited resources to extract people. \n\nI've only seen this in wildlife refuges where they dont want you startling the animals.\n\n\nHave definitely startled large animals while running. I get it.\n\nRadnor lake is notoriously uppidy for some reason. Someone stopped my husband running there once, which is bizarre IMO. I personally don’t feel like the trail there is that great anyway so I stick with beaman park (my fave) or Percy  🏃🏽🏃🏼‍♀️\n\nGreat insight BT!!!\n\nSign isn’t remotely enforceable, there is no section, code, bylaws or anything noted. But I’m sure ebikes are completely fine lol\n\nThis looks like Karen’s work\n\nlol exactly I would just jog that baby with my AirPods in and just wave the old ladies as I trot by.\n\nOften seen at wildlife preserves/refuges around here (in pnw) lots of migratory bird stuff I think I heard.\n\nWe gotta invite the old ladies on a group run. Get the Ultra runners out there. They go slow enough. I am not an ultra runner, but also run slow enough. Also, I am an old.\n\nGet some male models out there running shirtless. That will change those ladies ideas about running! Lol\n\nThat costs money. All my money goes to shoes and GUs.\n\nDon’t worry too much I work for beer!\n\nSomeone in TN get Hansel a beer!\n\nBut… Why male models?\n\nDid you ever think that maybe there’s more to life than being really, really… really ridiculously good looking?\n\nThere’s an animal preserve near my old city that had something like this prohibition. I believe it was meant so you didn’t disturb the birds and such too much. But I don’t know. Ran there only once, saw the sign, ran (no one was around), and never returned.\n\nI would consider tossing that ugly sandwich board in my truck to dispose of properly.\n\nIn wildlife refuges and nature preserves, I believe it's more of a sightseeing/bird-watching trail.\n\nI was told by a security officer there that I would be fined if I did not stop running 😂 Percy is a much better park for running anyway.\n\nHaha, saw the pic and thought it looked like Radnor. My wife and I have a joke that just parodies their rules. No running. No laughing. No joy. No snacking. No walking hungry. No fishing. No letting fish be. No smiling. No talking. Etc.\n\nRadnor is a pretty cool place for the lake view but if you're that close, PW all the way. God I miss hitting those trails. Work took me too far (the boro) to get out there but one day...\n\nEh, there are plenty of places that don't allow cars, dirtbikes, atvs, horses, or bicycles. I guess trail running is the next logical step down the line.\n\nDon't go where you aren't wanted.\n\nRunning in some trails may scare off local wildlife and drive them out of their habitat. The animals can’t distinguish a friendly jogger from a vicious predator when they hear something running at them or worse yet, they’d get accustomed to the running sounds and won’t run when they ought to. \nPark rangers or the good folks who tend to the local trails try to balance a delicate situation - respect their request, be kind.\n\nI'd love to see the bodycam footage of a cop giving a jogger a ticket for speeding\n\nI think I’d have to mount it on the wall with my race medals if they did!\n\nMaybe it’s to avoid startling wildlife, maybe it’s to avoid stepping on wildlife.\n\nSorry but I’m just picturing really fat squirrels that can’t get out of the way fast enough for runners! 🤣\n\nI’ve come very close to kicking various rodents - few times just walking at a brisk pace and not paying attention. \n\nBut more likely it’s to avoid scaring them\n\nI've seen something like that at least one or two times before,  they tend to be put up in areas by committees that maintain the grounds,  there might be a lot of older people that go to that area and complained about people running,  maybe someone at one time was knocked down and then after that it was game over for runners.\n\nLooks like a no fun trail...onto the next one! 👋\n\nI almost got a ticket from a park ranger when running at Radnor. They take it pretty seriously, the only person who has ever really consistently gotten away with it was the old Titans coach Jeff Fisher.\n\nIgnore it, just go.\n\nIf you go back to Radnor, head up to the Gainer Ridge Trail or the South Cove Trail. Good and proper Tennessee mountain elevations and no one there will bother about you running.\n\nHoly suck the fun out of the outdoors. It's like they don't want people to actually use the area. This is likely the point.\n\nJazzercise is permitted\n\nyou're wearing away the dirt.\n\nIs this Radnor? Yeah I thought it was weird too, but they say it’s to protect the eagles’ nesting sites. If it’s Radnor, there’s plenty of near-vertical climbs that’ll give you a hell of a workout, so don’t freak.\n\nRadnor has always been no dogs and no running. I’ve lived a few blocks away and have seen these signs for 10+ years. I’ve run a few times early but people will say something if they see you. It’s always been about the wildlife so everyone saying Karens is incorrect.\n\nImagine the running culture in Tennessee looking like the skateboarding culture back in the 90’s. Anarchy runners. Running gangs.\n\nIs this Radnor lake ? They Really will fine you . Supposedly it’s so protect the wildlife and such . It’s a shame because the trails\nWould be awesome for running.\n\nThe only place I saw a sign like this was at the Morton Arboretum in Illinois - also thought it was completely bizarre and could think of no logical explanation for it. Beautiful place with lots of nice trails, but running is only allowed on the paved road with the cars - go figure.\n\nSounds like a total borefest! A good time, prohibited. Any fun, prohibited!\n\nI've never run there but the story I heard is that all the local x/c teams were training there....\n\nRadnor Lake near Nashville? If so, it’s been that way for years.\n\nSome people are kind of aggressive exercisers. I’m guessing too many run-ins with that crowd has given jogging a bad reputation. I bet you’re ok with jogging up to a person and passing them quietly and respectfully. Maybe jogging lightly is the key.\n\nGrew up here. Trail running was allowed until mid-80s. Don't recall the specific incident/reason for the change, but wildlife is everywhere at Radnor lake and folks are pretty serious about preserving it. Runners shifted to the road or to other parks nearby like percy or edwin warner. I don't mind the hiking only now, it's kinda nice actually.\n\nYou are not allow to run on trails, but you can off trail I guess...\n\nI'll stop running on trails to not disturb the wildlife right after that ban all vehicle traffic getting to any part of the park. I'm a hell of a lot more quiet than a car, need proof just ask the squirrels I sneak up on nearly every run.\n\nSeriously, how is running that much louder than walking?\n\nIt's potentially more startling (to wildlife) than walking.\n\nNot at the pace I’m going 😂\n\nYou could skip (like kids) this section of the trail, it’s not running…\n\nThis is going to be an unpopular opinion but to all of the people saying it’s just rich busybodies trying to control everyone so you should just do what you want: people need to get over their sense of entitlement in assuming that the rules are just there to inconvenience them.  Whatever the reasons, those are the rules of that park and there are other parks where running *is* permitted.  Just because you want to do something doesn’t always mean you should\n\nSeeing that sign would make me want to run harder\n\nlol is it considered running from police if your already running before they get there?\n\nIt’s only considered running from the police if they catch you\n\nthat's crazy\n\nMountain bike it is then!\n\nFrfr\n\nIf it is a nature preserve, then yeah. I can see why they don't want you to run. Might scare off wildlife that people go there to observe. Just my two cents\n\nI don't read signs while I'm running, I'm not letting my pace slip for words\n\nIf it’s a nature / wildlife preserve and not just some local park, all but the last seem reasonable.\n\n[removed]\n\nRight! There should also be a weight limit. Lol\n\nDoesn't say anything like no off trail running, so problem solved.\n\nI walk that trail every morning, and as someone who loves trail running, I’m so glad there are places that are aren’t for trail running. It’s a beautiful place to walk and think and pray and talk with a friend. Getting bowled over by a huffing, puffing runner is the opposite of the vibe of that peaceful space. \n\nThere are other parks fifteen minutes away that are open to trail runs and have much better trails.\n\nI think also that Radnor Lake is a particularly fragile ecosystem and that might have something to do with it?\n\nIt's like when they shut the parks and trails down for covid. I saw the signs, but I sure as hell didn't pay attention to that nonsense.\n\nThey shut down your parks and trails for running during Covid? I’m grateful they were all open where I lived as that was about the only thing to do. I would have gone nuts!\n\nWhat about bikes?  Doesn't say you can't ;)\n\nCan I speed walk?\n\nIt’s weird. The only thing I can think of, if the trails are popular and fairly busy with people walking, then runners will tend to widen the trails when they pass walkers. But I’m grasping at straws.\n\nThey’ve gone to town on this!"

    "all_comment_text": "I have also been chased by a cow. Turned a corner a month ago and was so concentrated on looking for snakes on the trail, I didn’t see two calves and spooked them. What I assume was the mother did a loud moo that evolved into a scream and she started towards me. I turned around, booked it, and never looked back. The first few steps I could almost feel her hooves vibrate the ground. I have been back to that trail since but am on high alert for cattle lol. With all the wildlife around here a cow charge was never on my list of things to be concerned of.\n\nCow was just curious!\n\nI honestly haven’t even researched cow behavior. So, that is possible, lol. Not really an animal I considered being one I needed to understand. My old boss raises cattle and they told me I did a good job fucking off.\n\nLiving in the countryside in the UK I’ll semi-regularly see reports of people being trampled by cattle. Having had a couple of hairy moments too, you don’t mess around with them\n\nThe really young calves are so curious and playful. They just want to chase me like puppies. Then the Momma cow tries making them stop, and I feel like I can feel her frustration. \"My dumb kids won't quit chasing this person. If they won't listen to me, I'll just have to make the person leave so the kids won't be tempted.\" The mom just chases enough to escort me away, not real aggression. Luckily that stage of calving season is pretty brief. The older calves learn to stay away, after some scolding from mom I'm sure.\n\nBetter get mooving!\n\nUdderly traumatic experience\n\nCows are curious. If you are uninteresting they will ignore you. If you are running you become interesting. So if you are in a potential cow situation just walk the trail until you are out of sight of the herd.  \n\nA bull on the other hand… 🙏\n\nLot of videos here of people drawing a cow audience when playing an instrument.\n\nMy mom grew up on a dairy farm. Her reaction was “cows are so nosey”\n\nThe weirdest thing is when you step into a field of cows and they all turn and stare at you like they have some kind of hive mind.\n\nCan confirm: cows are way scarier up close when you’re in their turf. Was running in Scotland and a trail went through a pasture. The cows were chill until I got within 30 ft or so of them. Then they all got super interested in me. \n\nThankfully they weren’t coos.\n\nThe trick is to walk.\n\nUsually cows 'warn' that they might charge, they hit the floor and move their head aggressively. Source: Moooooo\n\n😂😂😂 I grew up on a farm and run with cows every time I visit my dad. Once they realize you're not a threat they're goofy and curious animals. Get between a mom and it's young calf or an aggressive bull and you'll have problems. In situations like this they'd probably take head scratches and then follow you until they get bored.\n\nCan anyone tell me what this mooosic is, please?\n\nIt’s called Free Cow.\n\n🤣\n\n😆👍 thank you.\n\nFree bird. Or maybe freebird? Someone else will tell us but I got you started.\n\nLooks like both spellings are acceptable.\n\nLove the freebird solo, this could be a series.\n\nlol they're just running with him\n\nI run through cows a lot. I get how they're statistically dangerous, but also think you've gotta be pretty foolish to get squished by one. These ones are spooked because they aren't used to people, causing them to run in random directions (they'll run off cliffs - very stupid). But if you walk through them about three times in two weeks, they'll start ignoring you.\n\nAdrenaline &gt; gels for that extra gear\n\nMwahaha. They can be pretty scary. Usually so friendly and slow. But like this….\n\nOne of my scariest moments when running:\n\nI came to a field where the path runes through lots of trees and bushes, someone is already in the field and their dog has spooked two cows (the path very well used so they’ll be used to people). These two cows then decide it’s time to chase me. \n\nCue the fasted 400m of my life absolutely pelting it away from these angry cows.\n\nAside from run like heck, how does one handle a cattle charge?\n\nThis post exemplifies the quality level I would hope to see from every post in r/trailrunning. Keep up the good work, OP!\n\nLove that you filmed this. \n\nI’ve been chased by a flock of cows and a flock of Roos before, the cows were definitely bigger and heavier but the roos were way faster and less predictable.\n\nIt’s funnn. They’re friendly and just want to be friend. Don’t feed them anything or you will have them follow to end of world.\n\nIt is very hard to work out how dangerous these situations really are when you are in them. I have been chased by herds before and it is terrifying. Someone I know was trampled to death a few years ago near me, so I know it *can* be dangerous. But I am also aware that some young cows just want to play and act like very large excitable puppies. \nBasically I hard avoid. Not worth the risk for me.\n\nsometimes you find motivation, sometimes it finds you\n\nCows LOVE Skynyrd\n\nThis is friend\n\nStop running dumb ass\n\nPR I guess ?"

I’d be a mess if I encountered this 😱\n\nI would NOT be going forward! No way I'm putting one foot in front of the other there. I'm leaving a trail of dust where my feet used to be and I'll\nSave the heart attack until I'm back to the car! lol! In all seriousness, I appreciate videos like this, it helps me prepare and educate myself!\n\nWe didn’t go forward either since we lost sight of it. We went back out the way we came in.\n\nGood move. They are hard to spot off trail and you don't want to find out how far they can strike.\n\nUhh you don’t really have a choice\n\nFortunately, it’s difficult for them to strike when they are in a straight line like this. Notwithstanding, I give them time to get away from the trail.\n\nMy first time was backpacking, just stopping tighten my shoulder strap and all of the sudden I heard a loud buzzing that I thought were those bugs (a click beetle?) that fly up and make that clicking sound on their way down.\n\nNope, it was a rattlesnake.  I was freaked out obviously, but also kind of annoyed that everyone told me it was a \"rattle\" sound, no...it was like an old school door buzzer.\n\nOh, jeez. That’s good to know. I’ve never heard one, but I know they’re around.\n\nChatted with a SAR volunteer here in rattlesnake thick southern Arizona once about snakes.  Asked him out of 50 years and over 2000 rescues, how many of them were snake related and his answer was \"zero\".  The state park near my house almost always guarantees a snake sighting or two within 5 minutes of leaving the car and in 40 years of being a park has only had one recorded bite.  They huff and they puff, but out on a trail rattlesnakes rarely, if ever bite anyone.\n\nYeah. I'm in NC and we have plenty of copperheads and rattlesnakes. One of the ladies in my hiking group is a nurse and she treats a few snakebites a year. How many from hikers/runners? Zero. All of the bites were from people who were doing gardening work and reached their hand somewhere they couldn't see. Occasionally it's someone who tries to pick one up because they're an idiot. But it's never folks who are out hiking/running in the woods.\n\nYep, my closest call with a snake was 6 feet from my front door.  Trimming up some bushes and hit a snake with my lopers.  He wasn’t particularly pleased about it.\n\nSimilar where I live. I’ve seen a rattlesnake on almost every trail run I’ve done in the last month. They’re everywhere! I’m friends with a couple of the rangers and have never heard of them having to deal with a bite. Don’t be stupid and antagonize them, but they’re really just interested in crossing the trail and minding their own business. \n\nFunny part of rattle snake bite stats I found showed a large percentage of the victims were drunk males that were agitating the snake when the bite occurred.\n\nUsed to teach a “Hiking 101” class and asked a few ER docs &amp; nurses to confirm this.  It’s a fairly accurate claim.\n\nI don't claim to be a herpetologist or anything but it may depend on the species... in rural PA I came across a timber rattlesnake in the path.  He looked straight at me, rattled, and didn't move an inch.   I said the path is yours buddy and turned around!!!\n\nThe timbers out here in Arizona tend to hold their ground as well.  \n\nWe have speckled rattlesnakes as the primary snake in some urban mountain ranges.  They are extremely chill.  Over the years I’ve accidentally stepped on them, watered one while taking a nature break behind a bush and strode within inches of them and never elicited a response.  \n\nThe Mojave’s are the mean SOB’s.  Get within 10 yards of them and they start cursing you out and threatening you.\n\nFrom what I've learned from local naturalists, venemous snakes for the most part don't want to bite in self defense. Venom is a precious community for them as it's how they take down their prey, and it takes a while to replenish. That's why they either go real still or act all blustery. They want to avoid an actual confrontation if possible.\n\nEncountered one on my last run. Discovered a latent talent for the hurdles.\n\nThis would be me and I'm a short 5' 4\"! Lol!!!\n\n😂\n\nJust one more reason I love Alaska.\n\nYeah, because bears are so much nicer and warn you to stay back right?\n\nBears don't bother me that much.\n\nOquirrhs?\n\nYes!\n\nYou understood that throat clearing sound?\n\nOh it was loud and it was pissed and mouth open\n\nVenomous snakes are all over Sydney and I go running a lot. Basic rule is to leave them the fuck alone when you encounter one. Admire these beauties from a distance and just enjoy your run\n\nI definitely stay at a distance, but I wouldn't call it admiration as much as sheer terror and panic lol.\n\nNice thats a big snake.\n\nDAAAAAAAAAMN. That’s a big boy\n\nOh, they get CHONKY!\n\nThat one would ruin your Summer. Ugg.\n\nman do you run with these ones out there? hahah omg im from spain and when people start speaking about bears, and venemous snakes, and pumas, etc. I just cant understand\n\nIt’s our backyard mountain trails!\n\nOh, I really dislike them danger-noodles!\n\nAww, nothing to dislike. They more often than not just want to get away and leave us alone so they can enjoy their snake lives. Plus, they are important to the health of the environment.\n\nI appreciate snakes but damn idk how yall get over running in venom territory. Noooo thanks\n\nThey're usually not out in the hot part of the day but I think right now is pretty close to their breeding season... \nHorny pent-up rattlesnake even worse than regular rattlesnake...\n\nDon’t use noise cancelling in your earbuds!\n\nNope rope. Nope. Nope. Nope nope nope.\n\nFirst time?\n\nShould have shouted \"on your right!\" Then stepped on him\n\nMan, I ran into the biggest copperhead I’d ever seen in my life the other day. Perfectly blended into the live oak. Jumped about three feet to the right just in time. Big ole’ nope rope right there.\n\nJust creepily slivering by\n\nThat’s a couple boots slithering by\n\nSod this and there is me worrying about dogs 😂 when out in the trails\n\nRattlesnakes are bros for the nice warning\n\nHR data?\n\nI ran past a rattlesnake in a bush a few weeks ago. I no longer trail run during “snake season!”\n\nOn your left!  Oops, my left.\n\nIn the summer I only run as fast as I can scan for snakes. No thanks\n\nTurning around\n\nAlmost stepped on it, but you got it on camera from several feet away as it was slithering back into the brush?\n\nYea I wasn’t recording when we almost stepped on it! We were running on the trail. Got safe distance then recorded it.\n\n👍\n\nWhich is why it's almost off the trail when he's recording.  Use your brain a little more.\n\nAww, is someone having a bad day?? If you weren't in such a rush to put someone down because you're feeling insecure, you'd see why I asked what I asked. Hint: stepping on a snake doesn't necessarily indicate which part. Now have the day you deserve.\n\nName checks out\n\nI hope you didn't take too long to come up with that. Lame AF.\n\nKill it.\n\nDipshit\n\nBaby"

We must’ve gone to the same running-and-critters class.\n\nI do high knees to avoid the snakes.\n\nI hate snakes\n\nI read this in a “Indiana Jones” voice\n\nI did as well! But it took me a moment to remember where the line was from. Thank you!\n\nTry growing up in an area that has 3 kinds of poisonous snakes: copperheads, water moccasins, and rattlesnakes. Listening for slither becomes second nature.\n\nTexan too?\n\nTry running in Devon and Cornwall with loose sheep on the trails 😅\n\nOh yes the Captain Jack Sparrow run. Big fan of that myself.\n\nI use the same thought process when running through rattlesnake country when it gets overgrown.  A very versatile trail running strategy it seems!\n\nI wonder how many tricks in the book are older\n\nI combine this with constantly running my hands down my legs to scrape of any ticks as well. It surely makes for a splendid sight!\n\nThe high knee strategy has been proven to double in effectiveness when coupled with just a few well-times hands scrapes\n\nThis\n\nIt's good that you're even aware of LD in this situation. Just make sure you check yourself afterwards as some ticks can be tiny.\n\nIt's also worth knowing the following: \n\n1. Only a third of people get the classic bullseye rash after getting bitten\n2. If you catch a tick after getting bitten, you can get it out safely and send it to a lab to check for LD.\n3. If the tick does have LD or you can't send it to a lab. You'll need 4-6 weeks of doxy antibiotics to kill any bacteria in the body. Anything less won't do the job.\n\nIf you're healthy and living your life, running, etc... it's an easy thing to not take seriously. But in reality, it can completely ruin your life for years, so it's good to be cautious out there.\n\nI got Lyme last year with a full bullseye and the urgent care doctor said it was something different.  I went to a second urgent care who called it Lyme and gave me a week of antibiotics, so I went to a third to get another 2 weeks.\n\nMy brother too got Lyme and had a full bullseye and the urgent care doctor said it wasn't Lyme\n\nI got Lyme way back in 84. No one really knew anything about it at all then. I was in the hospital for a month and not officially diagnosed until about 6 months after the hospital stay. Good times...\n\nUrgent care told me the same. My PCP said just go see him and he’ll give the meds. This was after a bout of Lyme. I’ll never go to urgent cares in my area again\n\nDamn, it's soo annoying urgent care agent educated about it. How are you doing now btw?\n\nI feel like urgent care is a borderline scam. As far as I can tell, they have three strategies for dealing with any and all problems.   \n   \n(1) send you to the emergency room.   \n(2) give you antibiotics.     \n(3) send you home.\n\nMy old roomate broke his arm and went to urgent care to do xrays before going to hospital to save money.  When he got the hospital they said they wouldn't take the urgent care xrays and made him do them again.\n\nThat’s so frustrating. I guess even ER thinks UC is full of it!\n\nYeah I agree. There is an overuse of antibiotics but they are needed here.\n\nOh that’s not exactly what I meant, although I agree. I was saying antibiotics are basically the only thing urgent care is actually good for. But their first strategy is to just send you to the emergency room instead, or do nothing at all. Unless I very clearly need antibiotics, I think urgent care is basically a waste of time. Their number one goal, in my experience, is to push you off on someone else. So I’m not shocked at all that the urgent care didn’t know what they were doing. That describes most of my experiences with them over the years.\n\nI'm fine now my symptoms were not that bad.  I'm in the woods a lot and am always wary of Lyme and knew to get it treated quickly and with a long enough term of antibiotics.\n\nAh really glad to hear you're well now\n\nWhat is wrong with these doctors? Just go straight to an infectious disease doctor.  Or demand the test.  And make sure they do the Western blot that takes a few days to get back.\n\nI’m not sure a doctor will want you to take antibiotics just because you removed a tick until you show symptoms.   \n\nAlso it’s believed now that it takes about 24 hours for a tick to transmit disease to a human, so even if it has LD it didn’t necessarily transmit if you removed it in time.\n\nFrom what I understand these scary multi-year sagas you are talking about happen when the patient didn’t know they had been bitten therefore Lyme wasn’t considered a likely diagnosis.\n\nI  am not any kind of medical professional though just a trail runner who pulls ticks off himself occasionally and tries not to overreact.  \n\nThis CDC page has lots of good info.  Btw it recommends against those lab tests: https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/after-a-tick-bite/index.html\n\n[removed]\n\nOh come on haha not sure how you can be so naive... It absolutely does exist. That's an insult to hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, who have the disease.\n\nIt's naive to not believe in a \"disease\" with no evidence of existing? It's not recognized by any mainstream medical body.\n\nIt's a collection of vague symptoms that people claim is an ongoing disease, usually to sell expensive snake oil cures. I know personally because I had a family member who got suckered into this whole thing and wound up spending tens of thousands of dollars on fake treatments for it.\n\nLyme disease is real and has real symptoms and real evidence to support it existing. Chronic Lyme disease has no evidence of existing and is rejected by most of the medical community. Those who don't reject it are probably trying to sell you a treatment. \n\nChronic Lyme disease is like some kind of religion where there's zero science behind it but supporters get real defensive when other people say it's not real. And I know I'm probably opening a can of worms for even leaving this comment, but maybe I can help at least one person not getting suckered into it. I personally didn't know anything about it until that family member claimed they had it. I just thought it was a legitimate illness until then when I looked into it.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_Lyme_disease\n\nYou need to differentiate between chronic Lyme after an actual diagnosis v never having tested positive for Lyme.\n\nSo how do you explain that people who have had debilitating symptoms for years or decades with chronic Lyme disease, get better with treatments designed to kill the Lyme bacteria? Are they all just making it up? I'm talking about anti biotics, Lyme herbs, etc\n\nI'm not a doctor or a scientist. So I don't know why they're having that response to treatment. All I know is there have been many studies on it and they have turned up absolutely nothing to support the existence of chronic Lyme disease.\n\nI can tell from the lingo you're using that you're deeply in that community so I know there's no sense in debating you. It's just like trying to debate someone's religious beliefs. I'm not interested in that.\n\nI'm just letting everyone else know to do some research on it from reputable sources. And the fact that there are basically no professionals who believe in chronic Lyme disease who aren't trying to sell you some treatment for it should be a big red flag.\n\nWhat are you even talking about? There ARE professionals, actual doctors, who spend their entire careers trying to make people with horrendous Lyme disease conditions better, and they succeed in doing so.\n\nAnd why are you even comparing this to a religious debate? I was just trying to spread awareness for what is a growing epidemic. Why don't you go back to living your healthy trail running life and stop spreading misinformation.\n\nlove that your reputable resource is literally wikipedia. try reading some recent scientific research. SPOILER: it’s real.\n\nYou could also try the CDC, NIH, or literally any major medical body on the planet. I linked Wikipedia because it has links to those sites and gives a high level overview of it for those unfamiliar.\n\nSpoiler: it's not real and the only professionals who say it is are those trying to make a buck off of it. Like I said, I'm not interested in a debate. I know you're not changing your mind. I'm just chiming in so the uninformed don't start thinking it's a real thing. I've had a loved one who lost thousands of bogus treatments and I don't want to see others taken advantage of.\n\n[removed]\n\nsnake dr &amp; capt monkey: \n\nplease don’t participate in these discussions if you’re not educated and updated on current research. spreading this misinformation is ACTIVELY harming the lives of chronically ill people who literally just need basic compassion and healthcare. \n\nI’m not going to respond after this cause I genuinely don’t know if you’re just trolling. \n\nthe CDC literally has an entire [page](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs-symptoms/chronic-symptoms-and-lyme-disease.html) on chronic Borreliosis and there’s substantial medical literature &amp; research into this issue. linking a bunch of studies that are all 9+ years old doesn’t automatically make your point. not all research is of equal quality and again, those are old and plenty of new evidence has come to light. \n\nas someone who actually works in the field earning a second graduate degree and with clinical experience, your ignorance and willingness to spread misinformation is ridiculous. don’t weigh in on something you clearly aren’t informed about. it is literally hurting people.\n\n[removed]\n\nFYI there’s no S in Lyme.\n\nThe CDC doesn't really believe in chronic Lyme diseases and has very out of date knowledge. You're correct, I'm not taking about acute Lyme disease, only chronic Lyme disease.\n\nhow prevalent is LD in the US? I've had ticks on me many times and I didn't even know that sending them to a lab to test for LD was an option\n\nWell I think around 400k people get diagnosed with it in the US every year, but thats not including the people who miss catching it.\n\nSo you can get bitten by a tick with Lyme disease and take antibiotics if caught in time, and it will rid your system of the disease?\n\nYep, the Lyme community and Lyme educated doctors recommend that you can get rid of the bacteria if 4-6 weeks of doxy is taken. That's if you catch it in time but it does take time for the tick to latch on apparently and for the bacteria to circulate into the blood stream.\n\nWhat do people do if it's been years and they didn't know? Late chronic Lyme? Bartonella babesia?\n\nAnd in case Lyme isn’t scary enough, look up alpha-gal. My boyfriend has it and now regularly has The Brisket Dream since he can never eat it again.\n\nHas he looked into the acupuncture treatment??\n\nIt sounds crazy but some people are having success treating their alpha gal with acupuncture treatment. I know of one person personally that had his alpha gal go into remission with it.\n\nHere’s a link to a study showing 96% effectiveness:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8729907/\n\nIt tends to go away. Mine did. I reacted for the first time in about 2009. I was my doctor’s first diagnosed case. I went a few years without eating meat and never reacted to milk or cheese. Eventually I got sick of skipping steak, so I just reintroduced it into my diet. I had a mild case so I didn’t always react and when I did (if I was awake) I would take some Benadryl and usually be ok. My last reaction was in 2019 the last time I was bitten by a tick. My doctor said research is showing about a tenish year duration.\n\nMy boyfriend has anaphylaxis so his case is pretty bad and he reacts to dairy so I’m not hopeful\n\nWell I hope it subsides over time, if for no other reason than his safety in the case of accidentally exposure.\n\nYikes - for a minute I took this as having a girlfriend that was the alpha and wouldn’t allow Brisket 🤣. On the bright side being forced to be vegetarian is an easy way to keep the weight off.\n\nNo need to go vegetarian: you can still have poultry and seafood. Mild cases often can have dairy too.\n\n&gt; mild cases\n\nThe page I read at Mayo Clinic on it indicated that other mammal based products including dairy might be an issue — so yeah, hopefully he can substitute some chicken wings in.\n\nI've been a vegetarian for a year and I'm the same weight. \n\nI think maybe the issue might be all the cake and snacks I stuff in my face, but there's no way to be sure.\n\n🤣you’re right that vegetarian doesn’t men low calorie. Nuts come to mind as high calorie, but yeah cake - yeah that’s not healthy.\n\nSorry for my english and for my ignorance, but what's wrong with this kind of \"trail\"?  \nIs it these \"weeds\" that can host the bug that can cause LD?\n\nIf so, what kind of plants are these?\n\nThe trail is great— it’s just that normally this area is mowed to only a few inches. In New England, (and really all over the east coast) ticks will be in the taller grass like this and latch on when a deer or dog or… silly runner brushes by.\n\nAny area with mammals will have ticks which is pretty much everywhere in the United States. Any plant you touch can transfer a tick. Therefore, going through a field like this, or through dense foliage will just about guarantee at least one tick, or a few dozen, will hitch a ride.\n\nI’ve lived in Texas Colorado and Washington and had only ever encountered 2 ticks in my life. Since moving to Missouri it’s a good day if I don’t have more than 5 on me.\n\nI use insect repellant that contains DEET. It works very well and keeps the ticks away\n\nI’ve hiked trough fields with grass that high and never got a tick once in my life. My dog meanwhile gets multiple on a single walk until use a repellent on him. I guess I just stink for ticks. \n\nCheck after your run. The faster you remove the tick, the lower the probability that the tick can infect you with a disease. Not sure if it is the same in all countries, but only 25% of the ticks has the bacteria that can cause Lyme.\n\n25%? Really? I can recall pulling out hundred of ticks during my summer adventures in eastern NC. With those odds, I should have been a goner.\n\nIt’s roughly 1 in 3, though that’s only for deer ticks and not wood ticks, which tend to be bigger &amp; more common. Additionally, the tick needs to be attached for 24-48 hours to actually transmit the bacteria so if you’re checking yourself frequently enough, you’re probably fine. \n\nAdditional info: https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/lyme/basics.html\n\nAh.. good to know. In eastern NC it’s really just deer ticks, but I’d go hiking/camping and pull roughly 20 a day. I suppose checking several times a day and removing them immediately helped mitigate the risk.\n\nIt's more so that it takes 24-48 hours for a single tick to transmit enough bacteria for the infection to take hold.  So if you get bit by multiple infected ticks, that time frame could be shorter.\n\nEven when bitten, there is a low chance of infection. Practically no chance if the tick gets removed the first 24 hours, and a small chance of infection the longer it is present. Improper removal of the tick increases the infection chance (old knowledge told people to dowse the tick in alcohol to make removal easier, but that actually increases infection risk).\n\nWhat should you do if you find one? Where are they likely to be? I could probably just Google this...\n\nIf they are on you and moving, you just pull them off and chuck them away. If they bite you and are meaningfully attached (or dug into the skin a bit) you can remove it and typically take a one time antibiotic dose to prevent risk. But it needs to be within a day or two of the initial exposure. But, like others have said, luckily, the majority of them do not carry lime… it’s just in certain areas, the risk is certainly higher.\n\n&gt;the majority of them do not carry lime…\n\nI know you meant Lyme but the mental image of a tick carrying a lime makes me chuckle.\n\nHa! Yes they’re very strong and sometimes they are seen carrying lime wedges into people’s vodka tonics.\n\nThe ones around me prefer tequila.\n\nYou want those ones to bite you; it will prevent scurvy.\n\nAnd it usually takes them a bit to embed, so I shower as soon as I can after trail running.  \n\nAnd as much as I hate Deer, lyme is worse.  I always keep bug spray with me.\n\nI probably have to remove 20 to 30 ticks from my legs every year. My wife has come to dread m requests for help to check my legs. Help does help (who'd have thunk huh?), ticks can be tiny and you'll have a really hard time check the back of your legs and knees. \n\nRemoving ticks faster reduces chances of contracting Lyme. Make sure your remove them the right way. Invest in a decent set of tweezers. Rotate and pull and make sure to check if you've gotten the entire thing. If you can't remove the tick or the head stays behind make sure to call your doctor.\n\nI've had Lyme once in 10 years of trail running. I was \"lucky\", because visable symptoms like the red ring aren't that common. Just make sure you check your legs.\n\nEdit: spelling. A lot of spelling.\n\nI have the tweakers remove my ticks but sometimes they are too strung out and I have to use tweezers.\n\nThanks to both of you. I agree— good to be aware but not paralyzed. I was just feeling ‘wtf!!??’ with this as the start of my run! Otherwise… had an awesome 19 miles of trail today!\n\nAnd just to be clear… So that I’m not sounding completely alarmist… I meant paralyzed with fear, not paralyzed physically. I know that Lyme can have some devastating impacts, but thank goodness those are extremely rare\n\nI’ve ran many trails in Northern New England like this and I really hate ticks. I always just stop after I’m clear of the ticky section and get them all off my legs while they’re still on my legs. \n\nMuch better than trying to find them later when they’ve had time to spread out all over your body. \n\nLast tick I had actually bite me was Jan of 2012. I didn’t check in the woods because I figured they all die in the winter. That was a dumb assumption that landed me a nice regimen of doxycycline.\n\nDeet, picaridin on skin. Permethrin on clothes/shoes?\n\nI had almost 10 ticks on me today.  It was disappointing\n\nas a gentleman with lyme, it doesn’t feel good!\n\nAlso try to avoid doubling back through grass like this, your CO2 and vibrations will get the Ticks in turbo mode.\n\nCheck yourself religiously\n\nI hear the ticks are worse than ever this year after a warm winter. I’m going to try and 0 chances if possible and save the trails for late fall\n\nI ran through a similar area today…May the odds be ever in our favour\n\nNoob question but… don’t long pants solve the problem?\n\nIn my experience not really. But they reduce the risk for sure. Wearing long pants in summer isn't as fun, though.\n\nI’ll KO from heat stroke before I wear shorts on trail for this reason alone. Im a tick magnet\n\nWe pulled out 7 ticks yesterday in the middle of our hike - this was kinda scary. I am afraid of them more than of bears and other stuff. One of them was so small, I couldn't believe it. And my biggest nightmare is encephalitis.\n\nYou can also develop an allergy to meat from ticks. Some people who develop it go beyond meat to milk and cheese too. \n\nAsk me how I know.\n\nTape a couple possums to your calves.\n\nI have Lymes now. I’m trying to work my way back into normal running again. I don’t know how long it will be before I have my endurance and strength back. It’s very frustrating.\n\nI’m really sorry to hear that. I know I sort of made this post jokingly in the beginning, but all the responses show how much this stupid illness can really impact people. hope you feel better soon. It will come!\n\nLyme disease sucks. I once came out of a field exercise and developed 13 separate bullseye rashes. My wife had picked 51 ticks off of me. It was about 5 days in the field, so no telling really exactly when it happened. They were everywhere…EVERYWHERE! I had to take doxy for nearly 3 months. I was not fully healthy for a year. Thankfully the symptoms were not serious because we caught it right away.\n\nAsk Avril Lavinge. Lyme made her bedridden for like 9 months. \n\nHead above water was written about the experience.\n\nAvril Lavigne is a member of the chronic Lyme cult. Like most people involved in chronic Lyme quackery, there is no evidence her problems were due to real Lyme.\n\n[https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/what-happens-when-lyme-disease-becomes-an-identity.html](https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/what-happens-when-lyme-disease-becomes-an-identity.html)\n\nThat article is both good and bad. I don’t have Lyme disease, but I know what it’s like to be dismissed by traditional medical doctors. . I believe some of these people diagnosed with Lyme have mental issues or some other ailment , but some have legitimate chronic issues related to Lyme. There a re bacteria as well as viruses that can remain undetected by medical tests yet still cause problems .People often have to get a biopsy or sadly an autopsy to see that there was still an ongoing infection. \n\nIn my case, I had doctors label me with anxiety and depression and likely hypochondria for a decade  years due to long lasting symptoms from  a head injury. My case was rather unique. \n\nI had a fellow 9th  grade student do a roundhouse with his fist against my neck when I was 14 standing at attention in P.E. class.  I suffered serious whiplash. I saw him do that to the kid next to me as well but he fell down. I stayed up and absorbed the blow full on. I had terrible mood swings afterwards, but crippling severe pressure like headaches happened 6 weeks later. Those headaches were non stop for 10 years. I never told my doc I was  assaulted as the major symptoms didn’t happen until 6 weeks later .Had x-ray, MRI, they all came back normal. I went to doctor after doctor and they all put me on antidepressants. I went on 7 and they did not help at all. \n\nI was a very smart kid before the blow to my head, I scored A’s on all my tests and studied less than an hour .My dad had a genius level IQ. Grandpa highly intelligent as well. I went from very smart to having ti take summer school to retake classes and barely graduated High school. I studied 12 hours or more to get a C in a test.\n\nAlternative treatment  Electro acupuncture is the only thing that took the headaches and chronic neck pain away. My mom recommended me to go  and paid for the sessions because a coworker said her lifelong back injury was cured  after seeing this doctor. I was highly skeptical but by the 6th session out of 10 my neck pain and headaches were completely gone! \n\n .I still have to take a crazy amount of stimulants and vitamins to function mentally, but the constant headaches and neck pain were affecting my ability to think at all. 20 years later and I very rarely get a headache or neck ache. So alternative treatment helped me whereas traditional medicine had no answers. I have been to a medical doctor les than 5 times in the last 15 years. I really find them pretty useless!\n\nNot every body’s bodies are the same. Someon could get bit by a tick with Lyme get the symptoms, get antibiotics and be 100% well within a few months. Another person could get the same treatment after a tick bite with Lyme and never fully recover. \n\nI’m moving away from New England soon and couldn’t be more excited. I love all the little lakes and streams, but Lyme terrifies me.\n\nYeah, it certainly gets in your head sometimes if you’re an outdoors person. The problem is… And not to be a negative… Even areas without lime, they have other fun critters like babesiosis and others. Nature is Lovely!\n\nThank you for the PSA. I have deer in my area and this is a reminder to stay away from the tall grass and bushes.\n\nIt’s not just vegetation. I was attacked by them on a wide fire road.\nPermethrin  treated socks \nI also lather my legs in shea oil\n\nAccidentally ran into a lane like this yesterday, while I wasn't wearing bug spray.  Been religiously checking all over since.\n\n I heard from someone who went to the ER with a tick borne illness (103 fever) and was told there were three other people in the ER at the same time.\n\nI just use Teladoc to get a 2-day course of Doxy prescribed if I see a tick on me. I’m brown skinned and the red ring/rash isn’t easily visible so better safe than sorry.\n\n[removed]\n\nWas in the er with an illness not just a tick.\n\nPermetherin folks...\n\nOnly on clothes or textiles. Does not stay on your skin like deet or picaridin.\n\nAnd snake bites!\n\nDon't ticks stay and live in shadowy places as they can't withstand so much heat ? \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but that was what I was told\n\nGuess who snatched a tick lately. And guess who got a strange looking rash and is on antibiotics now. Yes, my girlfriend. xD\n\nThe vaccine works.\n\nI only run trails like this is permethrin treated whiter leggings. Inconvenient but worth the hassle. You spot a lot of ticks this way and once you realize …\n\nWhy not get vaccinated? Lyme disease is hell.\n\nThere is no Lyme vaccine for humans available in the US\n\nOhh? Maybe I confused it with another tick born disease. Edit. Yes, I did. I thought Lyme means TBE but they’re different.\n\nYeah, same here. I just came back from a holiday with lots of hiking and trailrunning. Discovered and removed 30 ticks total over the 2 weeks.\nIt was especially after having to remove a tick from my scrotum that I was thinking \"I may need to find a new hobby\"\n\nI lost count of the number of ticks I had last year, I'm out all the time though and often sit for periods\n\nI contracted Lyme disease August last summer in the Sierra. We caught it early though (found the tick, swollen rings). The meds wiped out my digestive system and my energy for about 10 days. Lots of kombucha and yogurt and I was back to normal soon after. The disease has never progressed.\n\nEvery time I come across something like this I run through it as fast as I can screaming and then do a frantic tick check on the other side.\n\nHere’s another [tick-borne illness](https://concordbridge.org/index.php/2024/06/15/a-life-threatening-illness-a-tiny-culprit-and-an-uncertain-recovery/) to worry about.\n\nMe? I run/walk/work in tick territory frequently. I wear repellent (when I remember to), and scrub my body like I have OCD in the shower afterwards. I am SO clean thanks to my worries about ticks.\n\nIve honestly turned around on trails rather than go through tick paradise\n\n^[Sokka-Haiku](https://www.reddit.com/r/SokkaHaikuBot/comments/15kyv9r/what_is_a_sokka_haiku/) ^by ^SeekersWorkAccount:\n\n*Ive honestly turned*\n\n*Around on trails rather than*\n\n*Go through tick paradise*\n\n---\n^Remember ^that ^one ^time ^Sokka ^accidentally ^used ^an ^extra ^syllable ^in ^that ^Haiku ^Battle ^in ^Ba ^Sing ^Se? ^That ^was ^a ^Sokka ^Haiku ^and ^you ^just ^made ^one.\n\nLyme disease is not something that I would recommend. Thoroughly inspect your entire body after each grassy run and remove and kill the f”ckers if you find any.\n\nYou'll also get about 5,000 spider webs on your knees.\n\nShaded/humid field parts and as well as forest areas with lots of dry/fallen leaves is the best place to get bitten by the suckers. This trail seems benign, however, the area bordering with the forest is where the danger most likely lurks. But also, winter trail running is the best. :D\n\nAs someone who was diagnosed with Lyme &amp; Rocky Mountain Spotted fever, I am internally screaming\n\nBetter to get Lyme disease rather than lemon disease\n\nI've had mild success with carrying a light stick that has a few branches sticking off it and just holding it in front of me sort of waving it back and forth brushing the shrubs as I go. Obviously not sure-fire but it definitely reduces how many end up on me. Whether it just knocks them loose or triggers them to let go, I'm not sure but it seems to do something. \n\nThat or deep woods OFF. Just make sure you spray under your socks first, then hit your socks. Learned the hard way that, not so much ticks but chiggers, will crawl straight through the fabric even if your socks are coated. Then you get the luxury of not realizing they're even there until both your legs from the knees down start itching."

    "all_comment_text": "Matt Davis coastal trail 😘\n\nMatt davis all day\n\nOne of the few trails I'll choose over Dipsea.\n\nThat was my guess too. It’s awesome after going up Steep Ravine and then down Davis in summer a couple hours before sunset as the coastal zephyrs blow through the tall dry grasses not unlike an African savann… ok I’ll stop.\n\nOMG no you dont have to stop.  It's one of the most spectacular routes anywhere.  Instantly recognizable in a photo.  In my house we call it Matt Damon trail :D\n\nBeautiful. I'm extremely jealous. 90% of my local trails just seem like they are out to kill you between the roots and rocks. We've got barely any just cruising trail.\n\nWell, this trail is relatively narrow and has a pretty big drop off down a hill to the left. Smooth trail, but you don't want to go off it.\n\nYou know why hills are hard? Because the views are worth it\n\nHills are hard because gravity\n\nBut coming down a hill is beautiful.\n\nI thought it was because you don't do enough hills.\n\nBut vert isn't real\n\nYep, up hill will kick your ass but once you defeat the hill, you feel so good..  Flying high good until the next hill.  LOL 😆\n\nHills also Heal ✨\n\nlol that’s a beautiful trail.\n\nI have a tattoo that says “The hills will set you free”\n\nSo… yea…\n\nI'd love to see it. what style?\n\nHills only hurt in one direction and it's not the direction that people who don't run hills think it is\n\nLol so true\n\nI find this ascent and descent very forgiving considering its smooth and nice light packed for a lot of it.. it’s also only steep at the bottom\n\nI ran around to some off trails for the views. Mostly worried about my ankles the whole time since the sand can be slippery.\n\nLove that section the elevation gain out and back and exposure are a doozy\n\nNorth of San Francisco? I did Miwok 100k last year and this looks like that trail.\n\nYep! Matt davis\n\nDamn…we just don’t have these absolute bomber sections like this in Colorado🙃\n\nI always get excited when there's a short section like that on our CO trails.  Then, here come the roots and rocks!  I'm starting to think that most people would fall like me if they had to run on that stuff regularly (or at least that's what I console myself with).\n\nLove it, always wanted to get out there but never did. Love my east Bay trails but still haven't got back to those.\n\nbeen running hills this past month, ran flat ground today and was flying for like 4 miles, I don’t keep track of my times but that was definitely a record\n\nTrails like this make me feel so happy. I just want to run them and keep going forever. Thanks for the picture ☺️\n\nIt's so pretty, it looks fake. If I saw this in a movie, I'd say, \"Oh c'mon, at least *try* to make it look real.' \n\n[deleted]\n\nI cant move for a week hahahha\n\n[deleted]\n\nOh shit GET IT! what an achievement, id die hahaha\n\nLooks like Windows\n\nHurt so good.\n\nCome to Cornwall, we have many hills to choose from and they all start from any direction you choose 😁\n\nYep, up hill will kick your ass but once you defeat the hill, you feel so good..  Flying high good until the next hill.  LOL 😆\n\nDamnnn what part of the world is this? Looks awesome\n\nNorth of San Francisco\n\nI like how the trail just disappears into the abyss of trees\n\nI had a feeling this was marin\n\nThat is a damn nice trial. Wish I had some good trails closer to me.\n\nHey.... We don't have to be friends or any things.... This is why I run....views like this.\n\nLove to run that where is this?\n\nStinson beach Mt Tam trails!\n\nI ran that last weekend (Stinson &gt; Matt Davis &gt; Pantol &gt; Old Mine &gt; Dipsea &gt; Stinson). It is nice and steep coming up Matt Davis though (i.e. you are pretty happy when you get into those green hills).\n\nDamn, you're a beast.\n\nThe amazing views help a lot...\n\nThats cute.\n\nI would take that hurt any day!\n\nI posted this exact same picture in the exact location a couple of years ago on here. Nice!\n\nEast bay?\n\nMatt Davis Trail, Stinson Beach. So, close!"

He wants the front AND back view\n\nIt is california after all\n\nHey some of us carry water\n\nOk ya maybe like 1 out of 10 has a hydration vest\n\nI actually did a race and saw a guy who was dressed exactly like this and it turned out that guy was Travis Barker\n\nWTF? He’s a trail runner?!\n\nIt wasn't a full on trail race or ultra but yeah Travis is a runner, I think he has a partnership with On and he had a 5K at the Forum a few weeks ago\n\nA buddy of mine has run into Wes Borland and Tim from RATM on the trails but they were MTB, not sure which musicians are full trail runners besides Ben Gibbard\n\nAh, cool!\n\nIt’s been a looooong time since I read it but he had a write-up in Runner’s World a while back. I think he got into running as part of recovering from his plane crash and trying to get off drugs.\n\nNo water here\n\njust a life straw.. cant go wrong... until u cant find a damn creek lol\n\nYou will eventually look like this guy too, even if you’re a woman.  It’s the natural evolution of a trail runner\n\nMinus the mustache and mullet, I’m sold 😂\n\nNo guarantees, depends on how long you’re out on that trail.\n\nWhilst trail running, your hair only grows in the back. I suspect it's because running trails is all party, no business, but we're still waiting on the science to back it up.\n\nIt's from that constant breeze as you run down the trail-like one of those windswept trees on the tip of an island.\n\nHaha\n\nI worked with a guy once who wore 5 panel hats every single day and because of him I could never wear one ever in my life\n\nI'm intrigued by the fact that no runner, none of 'em, can seem to wear a cap the right way round.  It seems kinda pointless to wear one in the first place, especially if they're the plastic band type so not even mitigating sweat running down the face.\n\nIn Salt Lake City we have about 50 of these dudes per square mile\n\nYeah but pit viper specific sunglasses.\n\nYa pit viper or heatwave lol\n\nIt’s called fashion sweaty, look it up\n\nSweaty is appropriate here. Haha\n\nMaybe they're all running &lt;6 miles and, therefore, don't need water. You can hydrate pretty effectively before and after.\n\nUnder 10 miles I never bring water unless it’s 75+.\n\nLOLing from Texas where it’s 106 with 80% humidity. I don’t check the mail without 12oz of water and a salt tab\n\nIf this California it hasn’t been sub 75 degrees in sunlight for the past few months. Unless they’re doing sierra mountains or coast\n\nAnother reason I love Alaska. It rarely gets above 75.\n\nAnd you can eat the mosquitoes as a little treat while you run!\n\nI prefer the blueberries and cranberries personally.\n\nPNW is getting too warm, need to considering moving on up.  That said, everyone I've ever met from Alaska has been just a little.... off.  Nature or nurture?\n\nIs it because we’re friendly and don’t gatekeep everything? I’ve lived in WA before (I actually live in Spokane for one more winter) and the people there always seem off to me. Living in a place where nature can easily kill you and getting comfortable enough with that to become cavalier is probably part of what you’re noticing. Also, we think the term PNW is stupid because you’re a long ways south east of us. Also most of us kind of hate Seattle and the people there based on the long history of economic exploitation.\n\nThe coast hasn't been under 75F either unless it's like 5am. I'm happy if I manage to get a run in under 80F. I'm ready for November with all this sweaty ass running and chaffing.\n\nIt's definitely doable but it's been in the high 90s here daily, and even if I think I can go without water I still will think OK, at any time I could fall off a cliff and break my leg. The trails here are mostly single track, very exposed and cut into canyon walls, it only takes one missed step to fall off, and chances you can climb back up on your own are low. If I'm lucky search and rescue might get to me in 5-6 hours, I should at least have some water to get through that\n\nThis. I trail run 5ks regularly in the 90s with high humidity in the sun and I drink my water a little before and a lot after. It's never been a problem.\n\nAgree. Under 5-6 miles there’s zero need to bring water, and easy to properly hydrate before/after\n\nThe main reason ill bring it at that length is for emergencies. Something could happen to incapacitate me and leave me waiting to be rescued in 100 degree weather for hours, but also I may end up coming across someone else suffering from heat exhaustion and provide them with some water. \n\nIt's super common because of how easily accessible our trails are, search and rescue is in the hills here nearly every single day in the summer rescuing inexperienced hikers in that situation\n\n5\" inseam? veritable basketball shorts.\n\nRight? Those are Shortneys.\n\nNo Ciele cap? Are you in a poor neighborhood or are they already passé again?\n\nI didn't know the brand Ciele, but that's exactly the kind of hat I'm talking about lmao. I know those by the general term \"5 panel hat\"\n\nthey're like fancy runner specific hats that are super light and breathable I think\n\nnever tried em so can't confirm if they're actually anything special\n\nHonestly in my experience hats are hats, not a huge difference between a 10 dollar running hat from Amazon and a top of the line 60 dollar running hat, aside from if you feel the 60 dollar one looks significantly cooler\n\nI think you're right, it's one of those things where if you're a fantastic runner it makes a difference but it gets marketed to everybody so they actually make money\n\nI’m a not very good runner and I swear by running-specific hats\n\nCalifornia trend setters. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \n\nI wear a loin cloth. But I’m east coast.\n\nBeast coast\n\nPete Ripmaster and Charles Humphreys  the ogs of beast coast!\n\n[deleted]\n\nWe have exactly the same saying in my country. West coast best coast.\n\n[deleted]\n\nTrue\n\nYou dropped this: \\\\\n\nWhy such long shorts?\n\nCanadian here and this is not my experience, tho I wish it was as it sounds pretty stylish\n\nThe Canadians rock the full beard/facial hair, Ciele hats, Salomon vests, and at least 1 article of Arc’teryx.\n\nThis is exactly me, except it turns out Ciele hats don’t fit 😭\n\nHow is this so accurate\n\nArcteryx is like the Gucci of trail runners/hikers\n\nAlso Canadian, but I'd say this is pretty accurate - except - instead of just a mustache is is a full on beard and the mullet is twisted up into a topknot.\n\nDon’t forget tatted legs and ripped / sleeveless / baby tee to complete the look\n\ngunna need to see your style\n\nExtra wide brim sun hat with neck shade, REI sahara sun hoody, REI Sahara convertible pants, merrell MOAB. I have a 48L pack with at least 5 liters of water in it to pass out to trail runners succumbing to heat exhaustion on the trail due to not bringing any water\n\nI appreciate that. I stupidly didn’t bring enough water on a 12mile exposed trail run in SoCal and ran out… so that was a good lesson learned. Had to manage the last 2 miles without and was attached to the water fountain in the parking lot for 2 minutes straight.\n\nI was 90% joking with that comment lmao but I unironically do always bring more water than I need specifically so that I can help someone who might need it without risking running out myself. \n\nI'll also carry a small collapsible bowl so I could offer some to overheating dogs. People come up on the trails without understanding what they're getting into here a lot, search and rescue is out at least once a day, usually for heat exhaustion, and often it literally is to rescue dogs lmao\n\nYeah, I’m from norcal so used to more trees lol. Definitely learned some lessons that day!\n\nAny time I possibly can take a trip I go to places with real forests lol. I'll drive up to higher mountains on the weekends sometimes, cause ya when you're on trails in the socal Chapparal biome there is going to be next to 0 shade. \n\nThe one exception is these little canyon trails that run alongside and across streams and waterfalls, you'll be under a tree canopy the entire time, but you're also constantly either hopping across rocks or just slogging through the water and dealing with wet feet the wholentime. They're also by far the most crowded, filled with trash and people sitting by the stream getting drunk\n\nwe appreciate you. You're our last line of defense when all other hydration options have failed.\n\nI bought one of those Sunday Afternoon ridiculous hats for hikes with kids and beach stuff. it’s pretty great despite being convertible pants for the head.\n\nOk I legitimately do like wide brimmed hats as long as I'm not trying to look cool. If I care about looking cool I wear a baseball cap and sun hoodie like the cool kids\n\nIts clearly the right one.\n\n&gt; 5 inch running shorts\n\nI didn't realize California was so modest.\n\nSounds like me, minus the mullet, although you could easily mistake that if I were wearing a hat (which I usually do). \n\nI am about as far from California as it gets in N America though.\n\nof course I know him. he's me.\n\nWelcome to Southern California\n\nHey! I'm in southern Utah but I still look like this.\n\nI’m still working on the mullet\n\nDo you ever do things that aren't trail running? Because the mullet/stache thing is everywhere now.\n\nMaybe 7-8 years ago I was in Brooklyn for work and after work stopped in a random bar between the office and my hotel. I walked in and nearly everyone looked identical. Shortish hair with weird side part, long beard with moustache, thick rim glasses, flannel shirt. It was like the bar had a dress code.\n\nOk ya you know what, I dont really do anything in my free time except go to the trails. Not really big on bars or any large social gatherings. \n\nI really don't see the mullet snd stache when I'm off the mountain in real life though, but I'm probably just not going to the same places those guys go when they're in civilization\n\nHey bud I don’t have a mustache or a mullet and I’m slow as shit so I have to carry water alright god damn\n\nThis IS the way.\n\nBest post I’ve read in weeks.\n\nGo farther south….. you’ll see some different dudes out on the trails🤣\n\nIt’s a glitch in the matrix\n\nI have a man bun and always extra water THANKYEVERYMUCH \n\n(the rest is accurate though)\n\nYou described me but I always carry water and I'm in northern california\n\nDamnit, I want a mullet\n\nThis is the hill country texas trail runner uniform as well.\n\nit’s the same guy but he keeps changing clothes to get a fresh “hello!” from you like he’s scamming the snack ladies at Costco.\n\nIt’s funny because I didn’t even have to read your description\n\nI feel attacked\n\nSomebody educate me on the stache look.  Is it ironic, unironic, whimsical, true fashion statement, etc.\n\nI started seeing it everywhere years ago and assumed it was a fad. It doesn't appear that it's going anywhere.\n\nI know the mullet and stache was popularized by youtubers and tiktokers like iDubz and other similar dudes, but I don't know how it became so ubiquitous among trail runners in particular\n\nI used to carry water for long runs but i just bring a filter flask and drink at creeks.  Just gotta know there is a creek on course.  Saves me the hassle of needing a clumsy backpack\n\nYeah, its different in the Bay! I use a water pack for my little 10 miler\n\nAnd he’s wearing a plaid button up shirt\n\nI’m the non mullet one.\n\nI saw at least 5 clones of this guy at a bar in North Carolina last week.\n\nCrazy\n\n&gt;and absolutely no water\n\nThis part cracked me up\n\nI do approve of a good mullet though. I think it really suits some men (and women)\n\nI’ll have you know I try to be different! Tie dye, goofy socks, and Kandi bracelets. Lone peaks, colorful sunglasses and 5 panels are in my arsenal though. I also roll without water. Damn, are we all clones?\n\nMaybe I should get that look.\n\nWe’re in a club. It’s pretty cool actually\n\nI live in Boulder, and I also see this same man except instead of a mullet it’s a beard.\n\nCan’t be a nonconformist if you don’t wear the uniform!\n\nEvery comment now should be a pic of you in your trail outfit. Shorts longer than 3” will be removed.\n\nas others have said how dare you murder me with words so accurately? except for the altras (ew) &amp; water. hydrating is sexy! even Killian drinks water every 200 miles or so.\n\nA hater has entered the matrix\n\nI thought this was a pretty funny comment, idk why u got down voted so hard\n\nWhy do you care about what people are wearing?\n\nIts not like I'm saying they need to change their appearance, it's just an observation that amused me. If a trail runner stole your wallet they would be virtually impossible to pick out of a police lineup\n\nHmm, time to go try some *crime.*"

Why would he pause the watch? Time stops for neither piss breaks nor face breaks\n\nI thought that is the responsibility of incident detection... beside probably calling for help, of course.\n\nI’m currently trying to figure out if Coros has incident detection…\n\nDon’t be me (fell on a road run 10mi in, face first, put a bandaid and ice on it and started running 4 days later, unknowingly concussed - landed me in the hospital eventually, longer story). \n\nBe wise and go to an ER and get your head and neck checked.\nChances are, you are concussed. The neck is for the tingling, that’s a sign of a disc issue/pinched nerve around your spine.\nTell them you are a runner, in case they check your troponin levels and mistake them for a heart attack (part of my long story).\n\nUrgent care doesn’t do head injury, I was told.\nI’m not a doctor, just have a talent of getting injured.\n\n+1 to this. \n\nI hurt my head climbing and continued as if nothing had happened. Had similar symptoms — tingling in my fingers and a general sense of disorientation. \n\nWell turned out I’d had a concussion. Thankfully my then ex. was an ER resident and she immediately got me checked out. \n\nDon’t be me.\n\nHow do doctors treat a concussion? Recommend rest?\n\nThey had me take an MRI since I’d taken a whipper. \n\nThey check your eyes, see if you have symptoms like slurring or imbalance or tingling etc.\n\nEdit: Love your username btw!\n\nIt’s like a bruise to your brain. Basically you have to be super careful not to fall again, as it would damage your brain much more. It takes 1-3mo to heal.\nI basically was stuck with indoor training after initial 2 wk full rest. Was only allowed to train outside after 2mo/ no more dizziness.\nThey did a CT on me, but I guess worse cases get different treatment.\n\nI fell running and the whole way back to my car I was debating if I needed to go to the hospital. Eventually so many people asked me if I Was okay that it became pretty obvious I had to go 😝\n\nThen the resident who stitched up my face kept apologizing because she didn’t think she was very good at stiches. Lucky for her I’m ugly as shit so a good person to practice on!\n\nDude concussion is no joke. Please go to ER. 💕💕\n\nThis!\n\nCan you share what happened later on that landed you in the ER? \n\nI have not seen a doctor at this point. I have not shown any standard signs of a concussion (no vertigo, nausea, dilated pupils, etc). I feel much better than 24 hours ago. And the tingling in my fingers has faded after I submerged them in ice a few times. Tylenol and rest have worked well - and my wife has cleaned and dressed the cut below my eye.\n\nThe numbness and tingling is a reason to definitely get checked out, a neck injury could cause that. \n\nOuch! A tip for scar healing is to not let it dry out and especially don't let it dry scab. Use Vaseline or Aquaphor to keep it moist as moist skin heals faster and better than dry skin. When it has pink new skin you can use a skin healing baume like cicaplast baume in addition to the Vaseline to speed up healing.\n\nThis is helpful, thank you. Have you experienced tingling in your fingers?\n\nThe tingling in your fingers tells me you've probably got a [concussion](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15038-concussion). If you are at all able, please take some time off work and make sure to rest thoroughly to recover. You can look at [this](https://www.world.rugby/the-game/player-welfare/medical/concussion/concussion-guidelines#Managingconcussionorsuspectedconcussion) for a list of suggestions. Above all, avoid activities that give you headaches, dizziness, nausea and/or increases numbness and tingling.\n\nI just noticed the links you included. Thank you. I can truly say I have not shown any of the symptoms listed. Regarding the tingling, I am realizing I should have stated that in the original post that my hands (which I was loosely holding as fists in a high/tight arm carriage) took at least 50% of the impact of my fall (my chin and eye took the rest).\n\nI spoke with a friend who is a physical therapist. She said that tingling radiating into my hands would be a sign of nerve damage in my neck. But the feeling was only in my fingers and somewhat hands. So I am sure I do have nerve damage but in my fingers, not my neck. Just like I would if I punched a bunch of rocks.\n\n\nConcussion symptoms below for reference:\nplayer complains of severe neck pain\ndeteriorating consciousness (more drowsy)\nincreasing confusion or irritability\nsevere or increasing headache\nrepeated vomiting\nunusual behaviour change\nseizure (fit)\ndouble vision\nnumbness, tingling, burning or weakness in the arms or legs'\nslurred speech\n\nWe have a plastics doc that has patients do 50/50 hydrogen peroxide and water on a q tip to clean 2x daily followed by a layer of Vaseline as often as it takes to keep from drying out. Also, as someone who worked neuro icu for almost a decade, I would go get your head and neck checked out. I’d want imaging to make sure you don’t have any fractures/torn ligaments/bleeding or damage to vessels around your c spine (or at least an MD to say I didn’t need it and I’m being crazy)\n\nNot in my fingers specifically but I have clipped my foot on a root and knocked the wind out of myself. I felt tingling in my chest, arms, and hands after that for a bit. If you have any other symptoms with it you might want to see a doctor especially if you hit your head hard.\n\nIt sounds like you have peripheral neuropathy after a concussion, concussion really just means any hit to the head and technically most concussions don't require treatment. When to go to the hospital? Well, do you have a worsening headache or any headache at all? Dizziness, confusion, or numbness to the point of not being able to move or feel anything to the extremities? If yes to any of those then you should go to the ER\n\nThis was very helpful, thank you. I don’t want to disappoint everyone on this thread, but I have not seen a doctor. I have not shown any standard signs of a concussion. I feel much better than 24 hours ago. And the tingling in my fingers has started to fade after I submerged them in ice a few times today. Tylenol and rest have worked well - and my wife has cleaned and dressed the cut below my eye. \n\nIf anything, the weirdest side affect has been feeling fairly down and sad. Will be taking it very easy for the rest of the week..\n\nTo be honest with you depression after hitting your head could also be a sign of head trauma it can even potentially be persistent post-concussion but i dont want to fear monger. Have you checked your pupils to see if it reacts to light? Again though if you have no dizziness or Vertigo that is still a good sign.\n\nI mentioned the peripheral neuropathy because I get it frequently after several martial arts fights and kicks to the head, it's sometimes been a real bitch to deal with but was temporary each time.\n\nLikely you technically have a \"concussion\" which in itself means your brain received an impact and this is very likely based on your description of what happened but as I said before most of the time most of these minor concussions don't require treatment. Make sure to be very attentive to headaches and vertigo. I do want to stress however that you should see a doctor as soon as that happens if it does.\n\nYeah, I’ve had zero headaches, vertigo, or nausea. Or even much pain - aside from my fingers, which are feeling much better now. I just feel a little embarrassed and mad that it happened. Pupils also seem to be fine. \n\nTbh feeling sad might be from people on here telling me I’m dumb for not going to a doctor. But I know I was setting myself up for that with this post lol\n\nI noticed everyone hounding in you and I wanted to be as reasonable as possible, reddit usually errs on the side of caution which in most things is a good principle but really in most cases a hospital doesn't have treatment for this kind of thing anyways when it  is minor they would probably just send you home with a \"prescription\" of ibuprofen then leave you with a huge bill if you live in the US\n\nVery glad you're feeling better, take it easy on the inclines!\n\nI appreciate it!\n\nAhh this explains why I have so many scars. How does it heal if it never gets to air out? Doesn’t it stay full of puss forever?\n\nIt's not supposed to fill with puss or dry scab. Dry scab wounds will take longer to close themselves and the dryness will also inhibit new skin cell formation. It might have a light layer that looks a little like orange but not puss. Disinfect before adding the Vaseline if it's a deep cut but on minor scrapes just water is okay.\n\nthere shouldnt be any puss. You havent been disinfecting your wounds properly. If you are low maintenance dont worry about the scarring. Healing witg a moist barrier is high maintenance because you need to constantly wear a bandage to keep the wound from drying out. Its actually annoying. Just let it scab in a couple days then forget about it. Unless the scar is on your face no one will care\n\nYeah this works like a charm!\n\nI took a header on the trail and stopped myself with my face-knocked myself out briefly. My face was saved by the headsweats visor I was wearing. When I can down it folded down and covered my eyes and nose-scariest day I’ve had on the trail. \n\nAll that to say, I took a hard fall but didn’t have any tingling in hands or necks. \n\nPlease go see your Doctor. \n\nHope you are good. Be safe my friend.\n\nChiming in to advise you to get yourself checked over, you’ve obviously bashed your head hard enough for it to bleed, and the numbness and tingling may indicate that a nerve has been damaged or is being impinged. Don’t mess around with heads, if in doubt, get yourself to a doctor.  Have you got anyone at home with you?\n\nThanks for the reply. I haven’t had any headaches, nausea, light sensitivity, or dilated pupils. The tingling in my fingers has gone away finally after I plunged them in ice a few times today. The blood was from a cut from my glasses, not from head trauma and it’s already almost healed after my wife used some special bandages. So at this point I feel like there isn’t much left for a doctor to do. Definitely going to take it very easy for the next week+\n\nWilderness first responder here, seconding the idea of going to the ER. Tingling in your hands after an impact to your head could be a sign of a serious injury even if you’re not yet in serious pain\n\nThank you, yes!\n\nThanks for the reply.

Definitely going to take it very easy for the next week+\n\nI did a handstand in the middle of my run last week in an attempt to take an artsy picture.\n\nSomehow failed and back slapped so hard I had to call my roommate to come pick me up because I thought I broke ribs. My upper back still hurts when I breathe deeply.\n\nDefinitely head in to get checked out, anything tingling is not a good sign\n\nOuch.. so sorry.  What happened?\n\nI fell while going up a very steep and rocky incline, and my face immediately hit a bunch of rocks. The right lens of the glasses popped out and sliced the skin beneath my eye. But they also probably protected my eyes from the rocks. I’m honestly just glad I didn’t break my nose or any teeth.\n\nUnfortunately it was 3 miles back to the trailhead. Thankfully I had plenty of people stop to ask if I was ok and offer wiped for my face lol\n\nOh no :(.  Are you going to see a doctor to check for any possible concussion?  I was a fighter before so was somewhat used with bruises in the face (but luckily no cut).  I would take it easy on the brain too.  A lot of light activity.  Watch out for signs like headache, ringing in the ears, vomit etc.\n\nThanks for the reply. I haven’t had any headaches, nausea, light sensitivity, or dilated pupils.

I often fall right after a grade (flats after an up or down) or on a downhill. \n\nGet to a Dr fast if you haven’t already. The tingling would make me nervous.\n\nThanks for the reply.

If it scars you’ll always have a story to tell. Make stuff up even. Have fun with it. Happy running.\n\nOuch hope you’re ok\n\n[deleted]\n\nThanks for the reply.

I've eaten it before on a trail and fell on some rocks, too. No tingling feeling, though. Did you hit your hands at all? I'd follow up with a GP and see what he or she recommends, especially if you hit your head. Speedy recovery to you!\n\nRough fall. Glad you managed to miss the eyeball at least!\n\nOuch! I feel for you - somehow, falling as a grown-ass man seems to cause carnage, not just scraped knees like when we were six!\n\nMonday morning in the office:\n\nCoworker A: Oh my god what happend to you??\n\nOP: I fell while being out jogging....\n\nCoworker A:.....right.\n\n  \nWish you all the best, get well soon.\n\nbonus meme, thats the exact reason why the [german chancellor ](https://assets.monopol-magazin.de/styles/min_autox1000/public/2023-09/Bundeskanzler_Olaf_S_79228026.jpg?itok=-gTs6Ofd)was wearing an eye patch for some time, because he fell while on a jogg.\n\nHave you considered running with your clothes on?\n\nI wore my favorite green ASICS tank until it got covered in my face blood at mile 3.15\n\nHydrogen peroxide should get that blood out. Sorry about your injury.\n\nOuch, hope you heal quickly.\n\nI'm always worried I'm going to land on my ass hard coming downhill especially on slippy or loose gravel paths. Takes the fun out of it a bit\n\nRecover well man!💪\n\nI admire your commitment to the trade but please get your neck looked at. Definitely not an area to mess with. Could easily be a cracked vertebrae\n\nGlad you missed the eye!\n\nJust like riding a motorcycle, it's important to understand the limitations of the machine and the person and stay within them.  \n\nHeal fast...run faster!!\n\nHope your doing better\n\nFor some reason you’re not responding the most important responses, so just to pile on: go to the f’ing ER if you haven’t. There’s no glory in gutting it through an apparent head/neck injury and you’re just setting yourself up for some cold “I told you so”s\n\nThanks for the reply. I haven’t had any headaches, nausea, light sensitivity, or dilated pupils. The tingling in my fingers has gone away finally after I plunged them in ice a few times today. The blood was from a cut, not from head trauma and it’s already almost healed. So at this point I feel like there isn’t much left for a doctor to do. Definitely going to take it very easy for the next week+\n\nBackbone trail? If so, which section?\n\nYep. Was doing the section from the Kanan access point to Encinal canyon. It gets rocky in that stretch.\n\nYeah, I took a fall on the backbone in Zuma Canyon the other day and hit so hard I thought I dislocated my shoulder. I got lucky there weren't any rocks there.\n\nDamn! Yeah that’s close to where I was. You really can’t look away from your feet on some stretches\n\nUpdate:\n\nI can truly say I have not shown any of the symptoms of a concussion at any point since the accident (no dilated pupils, dizziness, nausea, etc). I have been resting and will not be running for at least a week. I appreciate everyone’s concert and support.\n\nI should have stated that the cut/blood under my eye came from the lens of my glasses (not sheer head trauma).\n\nRegarding the tingling, I should have stated that in the original post that my hands (which I was loosely holding as fists in a high arm carriage) took at least 60% of the impact of my fall (my chin and eye took the rest).\n\nI spoke with a friend who is a physical therapist. She said that tingling radiating into my hands would be a sign of nerve damage in my neck. But the feeling was only in my fingers and somewhat hands. So I am sure I do have nerve damage - but in my fingers, not my neck. Just like I would if I punched a bunch of rocks. The tingling has subsided and been replaced by a general soreness in my hands. Submerging them in ice regularly has helped.\n\nVery grateful it wasn’t worse. If I had fallen an inch differently, I could have easily broken my nose, teeth, or worse.\n\nOuch\n\nSorry mate\n\nOh man, sorry that happened, hope you have a speedy recovery. That was almost me a few weeks back, I was really in the flow and caught my toe on a rock in a super rough section, my momentum threw me forward, I don’t think I ever leaned that far forward without falling but pulled out of it, it would have been really bad if I went down.\n\nDang I’m so sorry! And so happy you are doing okay!\n\nYou look like you were lucky and didn't lose the eye if it was a little higher. Hope you have a speedy recovery\n\nJust a flesh wound.\n\nLooks like u tok a serious beating🤔🤔 Get well soon. I must also add that i would love to run in that area. Do u live close, or do u have to travel?\n\nI live about 30 minutes from that specific trailhead! Highly recommend. Do you live in LA?\n\nI live in Oslo, Norway. Love to run, and a have been til Santa Barbara and LA several times. Have always thought of running in the Mountains above LA. Beiing there i have just ran along Santa Monica beach. From the pier up along the coast. Nice, but I prefer nature trails...\n\nLife of a trail runner is always hard\n\nYou don’t actually have pins or needles in your face like some people do, you were just in pain for a minute. But as you typed this dramatic sentiment out, complete with multiple paparazzi photos of your minor laceration - you did in fact not have pins and needles, nor the passive sensation of them, in your face.\n\nFell so hard he lost his pants and shirt\n\nAnother reason I don’t run! It’s unsafe 😂"

Did you shuttle?\n\nof course! parked near mammoth mountain inn, took the YARTS shuttle to tuolumne meadows, took the john muir trail to thousand island lakes, then the PCT, then the river trail (the PCT/high trail is another option, but we opted to be closer to running water just in case) to agnew meadows. from there, took the reds meadow shuttle back to our car, then made a beeline to mammoth brewing co!\n\nWow, incredible adventure, I am thinking of doing the same thing. I assume you took the shuttle first due to timing of getting the shuttle on the return trip?\n\nyup! took the 6:45am shuttle from mammoth. we were mildly stressing about finishing in time for the other shuttle, but we made it with plenty of time to spare... whew\n\nThank you!\n\nA great taste of the \"most mellow\" section of the JMT!\n\nseriously! on paper, the elevation gain isn't TOO bad so i thought it would be fine. totally forgetting that the entire time you're between 8,600 and 11,000+ ft lol.\n\nSO SICK!! Trail running is so fucking cool\n\nFACTS\n\nThis is one of my bucket list runs. Thanks for the inspiration\n\nyes! my friend turned me on to this - i didn't even know the route was possible\n\nLovely video. Thank you for sharing it.\n\noh fuck yeah, gorgeous. I wish there was more footage of the trail.  These are fantastic videos. God that is GORGEOUS scenery!!!\n\napologies! wanted to include more but then the vid would be like 10 minutes long and nobody would watch it lol\n\nHere for it. 😆\n\nYouTube!\n\nI would\n\nI would absolutely watch it! Thank you for sharing!\n\nEVERYONE would - post it!\n\nTruly one of the most beautiful sections of trail in the Sierra. I backpacked it many years ago but haven't had the chance to run it since I started trail running. Got out for a Thousand Island/Garnett \"loop\" this summer though!\n\nooh i hear garnet lake is pretty - would love to try that loop!\n\nHow long did that take?\n\njust over 8 hours - we kept the pace somewhat mellow so we could stop for photos, filter water, etc.\n\nThanks for sharing this! What a haul!\n\nSweet. Been thinking about Tuolumne Meadows to Agnew TH for a couple years now.\n\ndo it!\n\nRad! Love that section around mammoth/thousand island lake. Can only imagine what a great route this is overall. Certainly adding to my list. What permits did you need? Or do you need any even if just running (day trip) it?\n\nno permits needed if you're daytripping it! only thing hanging over us was the reds meadow shuttle stops running at 7pm i believe, and we didn't want to walk the uphill 3 miles back to our car\n\nThanks for posting. Amazing run! How did the timing work out? Parked and what time yurts shuttle? Got On trail at what time?\n\nwe caught the 6:45am shuttle at mammoth mountain inn, which arrived closer to 7am. the shuttle also took an oddly mandated 15-min break, so we got dropped off at 8:45am, then walked from the tuolumne general store to the JMT where we started\n\n\\*Pure blisters  \nFixed it for ya \\^\\^, anyhow nice views!!\n\nOh my gosh. I need to do this.\n\ndefinitely on the bucket list\n\nSo beautiful, thank you for sharing! ⛰️\n\nYeah, I’m gonna be that awful nerd:\n\nNike Wildhorse 8s???\n\ngreat eye! they were fantastic - , super comfy, handled all the technical stuff like a champ, and i literally had no issues at the end.\n\nHa! I’ve got a pair, but they often get a bad rep’, especially on wet rock. But I love mine (and the previous iterations…although the sock insert thingy - and the Wildhorse up to #7 - seems to have morphed into the Zegama). \n\nMy Wildhorses do me just fine in the south of England. \n\nAaaaanyway, I absolutely love your posts, both food and trail vids. I always look out for them. \n\nHappy running (and eating)!\n\nyou and me both! i credit that to our proper footwork and the shoes serve to enhance it!\n\nand that’s really sweet of you to say - i appreciate you! one never knows how they will be received on social, so i tend to post with one finger on send and the other on quit this app…\n\nHome is so beautiful. I got into trail running last season after snowboarding season finally ended and for my big run I did 30miles out of rush creek trail head in June lake up past Agnew, gem and Waugh lake to the Yosemite boundary then back by thousand Island for the way home. It was late October with snow on the ground and I saw one other runner on the way back in the afternoon heading up to thousand Island. \n\nIt's insanely beautiful and absolutely incredible. Dream run stuff. Loved seeing the content thanks for posting!\n\nWow that’s awesome\n\nLovely stuff. Looks like an amazing trail / route to run.\n\nDo you have an alltrails or strava route link you could share? Looks amazing! \n\nEDIT: Also what's the permitting situation?\n\ni'm not on alltrails or strava but can send you the GPX if need be, otherwise the exact route is in one of the comments above. no permits needed if you're daytripping it!\n\nWhat a beautiful adventure. Looking forward to Mammoth Trail Fest in 27 days but who is counting?\n\nLFG - have the best time!\n\nThat does look beautiful, of course!\n\nOk- dream run here. Is there any heights to this run? Like heights that someone afraid of heights might consider turning around? Narrow trail sections with serious drops I guess. Didn’t see any in vid so hoping not.\n\neven though the entire route takes place at elevation, at no point are there any dropoffs or sections that would give you pause. for context, i did the kalalau trail (kauai) last year and there's a section called crawler's ledge, and even though that was much ado about nothing, there's nothing on this route that even comes remotely close to it.\n\nNice! Was this recent? Weather looks perfect.\n\nyup - did this on saturday!\n\nGreat vid! How did you film it?\n\ngopro9!"

Mile 18 has a mandatory rappel (unless you want to turn around and make it a 36 mile route). \n\nWe knew the rap was there when we planned it so we split up minimal gear between us to stay light. \n\nProps to Camp’s Alp CR harness which packs down to the size of a thin pair of socks and weights about as much.\n\nRad, looks beautiful! Just curious, belay device or munter?\n\nGreat question. I brought a critr as the belay device.\n\nLooks and sounds like a fun day out!\nAlways one in shorts that makes the rest of us look a little silly...💪🏻\n\nBuhahaha so true.\n\nLooks great! Is this a formal running group or some friends?\n\nJust a few friends who like to make long runs more complicated 😜\n\nLooks like a good group!  Where are tall based out of?\n\nYall\n\nSpread across Utah.\n\nThat looks fun!\n\nThat's super rad. Great shots!\n\nI would love to see a .gpx or at least a map of the route. Looks like a fantastic adventure!\n\nSure thing. Here's a link to my CalTopo. Feel free to download the GPX or just explore it right in CalTopo. [https://caltopo.com/m/N82S1VR](https://caltopo.com/m/N82S1VR) \n\nThere's a folder on my map called Trip Reports which has the actual recording from both my Garmin watch and my iPhone. Our goal was to get to Chasm Lake, the only lake in Zion National Park boundary, but we got cliffed out halfway up the water course. On our way up the shoulder to drop into Beartrap Canyon, we spotted a different approach that we'll try next time we run this route.\n\nThis is great - thank you!\n\nThat’s amazing and impressive. Love it.\n\nI need different friends.\n\n🤣\n\nThat does look like an awesome trip!\n\nWith my fear of heights that would have been an 36 mile run for me.\n\nHahaha so real. Although the previous 3 miles just to get to the waterfall, which you'd have to retrace, might cure your fear of heights 😝\n\nDid you filter water at the lake?\n\nThe short answer is no. The longer answer is we never made it to the lake, despite a valiant (and potentially dangerous) attempt. We attempted to climb the 400+ foot slot canyon that leads to the mouth of the lake but got completely cliffed out around 200 feet up.\n\nThat said, even if we had made it to the lake, we most likely wouldn't have filtered water at the lake for the same reason we didn't filter from any of the three rivers we hiked along: just about every water source in Zion has a serious problem with cyanobacteria. We knew this going in and brought enough water for our 9+ hour run. \n\nYou can read more about Zion's cyanobateria conditions on the NPS website. [https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/toxic-cyanobacteria-bloom-in-the-virgin-river-and-the-streams-of-zion-national-park.htm](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/toxic-cyanobacteria-bloom-in-the-virgin-river-and-the-streams-of-zion-national-park.htm)\n\nDid you bring one harness and just send it back up? Or did you all have one? Curious of the logistics.\n\nIt’s a great question, as weight was definitely a factor since we had to pack in all our drinking water as well. \n\nWe had two mountaineering harnesses, the Camp Alp CR and the Black Diamond Couloir, each tiny and lighter than a pair of socks. Two people went down, then we pulled up their harnesses, two more people, then lastly we sent up one for the fifth person. \n\nWe had some webbing and a quick link for an anchor but a smooth bark tree was literally right on the edge so we just went double and had a clean rope pull. If this was a common route, we would have made an anchor to protect the tree but I suspect this tree doesn’t see much action.\n\nAwesome. 2 makes sense just in case. Good use of a great mix of skills. Seems like something you’d see on mediocre amateur.\n\nFrick yeah. I’ll linger on a compliment like that. If only our run included iconic background music and drone footage 😏\n\nI only discovered in this forum and I really love this place 😍"

    "all_comment_text": "It’d be rude not to wish them a good morning\n\nYes, I tend to just say \"oh, hello\".\n\nI always apologize to animals I scare. And they totally didn't scare me. 😳\n\nOmg! I scared the crap out of a deer on this one and he ran into a fence!! I felt so bad! As he ran off I kept repeating \"IM SO SORRY!\"\n\nTwo fawn were laying on both sides of the bike path I was on yesterday. Only one jumped up but didn't run off. The other just picked up its head quickly to look. I said \"Sorry for waking y'all. Have a good day.\"\n\nLast weekend my dog and I scared a doe and two fawns. One fawn went right, the other went left. Momma stood on the trail panicking and I tried to calmly explain to her that we were no threat. She finally bolted to the left so now those fawns know who the favorite child is.\n\nYou need to run after them and shout loudly to make sure they hear the apology.\n\nYea, I sing to the cows.\n\nCows sure but moose? I quietly back away as I feel the air hit my bare cheeks because “the clench” literally ripped a hole in my shorts.\n\nI usually say goodbye to them as I back away, they probably appreciate it\n\nMoose??? North Americas most dangerous mammal??? That moose? I do not sing to moose.\n\nA fellow clencher I see.\n\nBig time 😂\n\n💯\n\nI tell all the bunnies I see that I love them lol\n\nI always say \"hi there bunny bun buns, be careful out there!\"  😁\n\nCame here to say this 🥰🐇\n\nSo glad it isn’t just me!! I always feel like such a weirdo but I can’t NOT tell them how much I love them.\n\nHell, I talk to the trees.\n\nI'll definitely talk to \"interesting trees\" and tell flowers they're beautiful\n\nI talk to more or less everything. \"Hello hill\", \"Hey there big hole in the ground\", \"Hey Mr. Branch. Didn't see you there\"\n\nFellow creatures of Earth!\n\nJust to the black bears, and I only talk to them out of necessity.\n\nHey bear!\n\nI “hey” everything… hey slug! Hey marmot! Hey shrew!\n\nGlad I'm not the only one who does this.\n\nSo cows are \"hello moo cow\" accompanied by a moo, deers are \"helloooo deerskees\", moose are \"hi there moosers\" (and plenty of space given), birds are \"birdlet!\" and elk are \"look at your elk butts\".  And people with dogs, I just mainly talk to the dogs, \"hi there pooplet!\"  Why yes, I DO talk to every animal I pass.  I was just chatting with a few cows this morning, as a matter of fact.\n\nAbsolutely, with joy! It's an important part of a happy run.\n\nI make sure to thank them for letting me cruise through their space. If someone ran through my living room, they could at least say thanks.\n\nOn a bike tour in Iceland last year I talked to like every sheep… there’s a lot of sheep in Iceland.\n\nYes, sometimes also to bugs and worms. I noticed, especially when running during the night, how many more insects you notice and how busy their life is!\n\nAbsolutely.   Everyone gets a \"hey buddy!\".  Sometimes even the trees, or big rocks.\n\nI typically wave and grüezi, while the other runners/hikers look at me confused.\n\n“Say hi to your mother for me”\n\nI knew this would be here 😂\n\nHey, happy cake day!\n\nThanks!\n\nI yell ‘moo’ at cows that I pass. I think they appreciate the greeting in their native language.\n\nRed dead redemption voice “how you doing girl”\n\nThe other day, I said, \"Hey deer,\" to a deer. And a guy I didn't initially see said, \"Yes?\" It was kind of awkward at first, but he laughed it off and said he often does the samething.\n\nI named a rabbit this morning. Mr Ears. \n\nI was 13 in, not my best work.\n\nPretty well. I’m always particularly nice to magpies, as it’s important to have them onside when it comes to swooping season!\n\nMagpie is my wife's favorite!\n\nSo glad to see this post and all your replies. Here I was thinking I was the only nutter that speaks to all the animals on my runs!\n\nIf we're all nuts that means that actually none of us are nuts right!?!\n\nAbsolutely. On my last few runs I’ve seen tons of quail,  wild turkeys, a garter snake, banana slugs, and came around a tight bend to see a black tail deer like 10 feet from me. Had to stop pretty abruptly as it sauntered off. All of them get the “hey there lil bubby” treatment.\n\nYes every animal. Birds/prarie dogs/snakes/rodents/etc get told what type of animal they are \"You are a rabbit\"\n\nSneaky moose/bear/elk get an \"Oh shit hi\"\n\nAlways. Snakes, foxes, cows, deer, moose\n\nI may or may not have got in a heated debate with a random cow I passed. I can only assume she was talking crap as she saw how absolutely dead I looked after grossly underestimating the grade of a hill. \n\nUnfortunately, pretty sure she won our argument.\n\nYes, and despite not really believing in any higher powers I often pray and thank all the other living things around me for allowing me to visit. For some reason it makes me believe I won’t get eaten by a bear or a mountain lion lol\n\n\"so sorry for frightening you quails!\" and \"good evening turkey family!\" and \"get the fuck off the middle of the trail you MF cow!\"\n\nI speak to all the creatures!\n\nI love the picture and I love the post! Beautiful scene!\n\nTLDR: I make turkeys gobble.  \nI used to travel to Kensington, CA for work. I’d always stay at an AirBnB as close to Tilden park as possible. I’d start my run with a headlamp at 5am and run to Tilden. Once I got into the park trails, I’d start intermittently gobbling like a turkey. The turkeys, all sleeping in the trees, would all gobble back. There are a ton of them and they are loud as a chorus, so I would bet I woke up more than one household with these early-morning shananigans.\n\nNo, I just keep on mooving.\n\nIf it's bigger than a squirrel, sure. Typically not the deer, but definitely a horse, cow, bear, sheep, goat.\n\nBut if it's a flock of 200 sheep, isn't rude to only talk to a few of them?\n\nMost. Except the barking dogs chasing me.\n\nYeah but it's always the same \"hey bear,\nHeeeeey bear\"\n\nAbsolutely \n\nYes.\n\nThe cows that don’t try to bite me, yeah.\n\nneigh\n\nI chat with the deer and pretend them fleeing is them just pacing me when I start to flag\n\nYes. Stops the getting aggy and don't get chased. Sets the vibe that I'm cool with them\n\nYes. I give a nice “hey bud!“ and keep going\n\nYes. Of course.\n\nI thought it was illegal to not at least say hi to each one?\n\nHi! Click click click hey! Click click click hi!\n\nGotta be friendly with the neighborhood!\n\nDefinitely, I do.\n\nOnly if it seems they are up for conversation…getting the cold shoulder from a rabbit doesn’t feel good.\n\n“Hey, cow. How you doin? How’s ya mutha?”\n\nMost definitely. I can’t not talk them.\n\nYep. No exceptions. Even the human ones :)\n\nI absolutely do!\n\nGot to\n\nAnything larger than a squirrel.\n\nI thought it was just me! Rabbits: Bun Bun! Deer: “Oh Dear!” Fox: Foxy Fox! Groundhog: Dirt Beaver! Chipmunks: MonkMonk.\n\nYeah every animal except the snakes 🐍\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nsmart dinosaurs depend encouraging rude fretful oil smile insurance zonked\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nI saw a snake and ran as fast as I could.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever felt so seen. \n\nI try to get their pic too if they are willing to stick around long enough.\n\nYes and I make some kind of flippy, \"I tip my hat to you sir\" gesture with several rolls of the hand\n\nyes\n\nI greet them “Hi” or “Hello” and then follows a whisper of ^please ^dont ^attacc ^me\n\n“Well hello there bun!” x10 on every run.\n\ni always say hello. maybe more.\n\nMorning Mr sheep morning Mr cow morning Mr magpie\n\nSo happy to see so many of you talk to the animals! I think how you act around animals tells a whole lot about who you are.\n\nYea I always say \"hello mr. deer\" or something similar, and sometimes I tell them I love them and wish them to have a nice day.\n\nAllways salute the cows, you never know when you'll need their help\n\nYes"

How did you like the trails?\n\nGreat trails\n\nGreat lakes\n\nCheck out r/runningwithdogs\n\nGood lord you guys, she’s wearing a harness. Leash was in my hand. Snapped a photo at the end of the run. There wasn’t another soul on the trail.\n\nIs this a Golden Irish?\n\nMy guess is the field Golden Retriever? And now… we wait for OP to tell us who wins! ;)\n\nShe’s a golden! With a very red coat.\n\nDisregard the clowns. Great photo, glad your dog and you had fun. As for everyone crying about the lack of leash, your gel wrappers are forever, this dogs impact is negligent. Again PLASTIC IS FOREVER maybe think about that before you try to shit all over an animal existing without a leash for a few hours 🙄\n\nJust ignore them, the Reddit self-righteous anti-dog circlejerk comes out in force on any post of a person doing a fun activity with a dog. The top commenter’s last post was them feeding wildlife from their hand. Keep living your life and having fun with your pooch.\n\nPSA: Never post a photo of your dog in this sub lest you be berated from all sides. \n\nGod forbid a guy take the leash off for a photo\n\nMine loves it too!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/X3npDhM](https://imgur.com/a/X3npDhM)\n\nLeash your dog because [Sleeping Bear Dunes requires it.](https://www.nps.gov/slbe/planyourvisit/pets.htm)\n\nLeash your dog so it doesn’t run off trail and have a wildlife encounter\n\nLeash your dog so you actually see when it poops on trail and then pick up your dog poop\n\nLeash your dog so it doesn’t scare the endangered species in the area that nest just off the trails\n\nHere is the awesome [SparklyPets Hands free leash](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K513BN6?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) that I use when I run with my dogs\n\nLeash your dog so it doesn't get hit by a car\n\nLeash your dog so it doesn't get into a fight with another dog\n\nLeash your dog so it doesn't get startled by me running the trails also and trigger a fight or flight response\n\nLast one happened, leash your damn dog.\n\nDogs should be leashed where required. Yes. Your latest post is literally feeding wildlife which is never ok. Maybe you should work on your own leave no trace and trail etiquette. Glass houses and all that\n\nThere are a few folks in my running club that use a hands-free leash like that, it seems to work great.\n\nBut yeah, OP sucks. OP needs to leash their dog.\n\nYay northern MI!!!!!\n\nLeash your dog in public.\n\nIf I’m on my family’s 300 acre farm, my dog’s off-leash. Anywhere else, he’s leashed. And you know what grinds my fucking gears? When I yell out “Can you leash your dog?”, and they say “He’s friendly!”; well, my trauma-ridden dog will explode on your dog, and nobody wants that. He’s the sweetest boy in the world, but strangers and dogs are very triggering for him. So yeah, leash your fucking dog\n\nMy response to “he’s friendly”: “Well I’m not!”\n\nThat’s my go-to too! Like do you not see him trying to assassinate your dog?\n\nAlways wanted to but they always do short bursts then walk lmao\n\nMine does that too… which completely matches my current fitness so it’s all good. I take a neighbour’s dog to the trails once a week and she just drags me like a rag doll.\n\nI’m so glad that you’re able to then! Something I’ve always wanted to do with my pups as well 🫶\n\n^[Sokka-Haiku](https://www.reddit.com/r/SokkaHaikuBot/comments/15kyv9r/what_is_a_sokka_haiku/) ^by ^Glum_View_9572:\n\n*Always wanted to*\n\n*But they always do short bursts*\n\n*Then walk lmao*\n\n---\n^Remember ^that ^one ^time ^Sokka ^accidentally ^used ^an ^extra ^syllable ^in ^that ^Haiku ^Battle ^in ^Ba ^Sing ^Se? ^That ^was ^a ^Sokka ^Haiku ^and ^you ^just ^made ^one.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/c30WXvA.jpg\n\nI love running with my dogs. Our club regularly has a dog or two with us on the pack runs. Pun intended. \nThey even come with when we do trail maintenance.\n\nLove it. I’ve a 1.5 yr old Belgian Mal. He’s great !\n\nI love her\n\nDog took me out once while I was running down a trail. Owner didn’t say a thing.\n\nI do. I have a 3-year-old, light and energetic female mixed dog breed with long legs and she loves running.\n\nCanicrosser with a passionate runner jagdterrier here.\n\nCute tongue! Looks like she had a great time!\n\nMy pup LOVES running too! He’s in such good shape now that it doesn’t tire him out like I’d hope it would. Oh well. It took us a bit to figure out good strides so I wasn’t stepping on him and he doesn’t pull, but now he’s so good! Stays right next to me and runs his little heart out. It’s the best\n\nMy dog loves running! I have done distances up to 16 miles with her. Looks like you had a great day. Beautiful pup. Also, you can check out the r/runningwithdogs sub for inspiration.\n\nI love your pupper!!\n\nThanks! If she ever meets you, she’d 100% love you too.\n\nIrish setter? Love those dogs and greyhounds too!\n\nGolden?\n\nI’m thinking it’s a Golden Irish, which is the next dog I want.\n\nYep! Golden with a red coat.\n\nEither or, not sure\n\nI’m pretty sure it’s the most recognizable dog species on planet earth, a golden retriever.\n\nAnd I’m pretty sure you’re a goddamn fucking asshole you fucking prick that’s the most rust colored golden I’ve ever seen dickweed\n\nFox red lab?\n\n[deleted]\n\nSleeping Bear requires leashes, subject to a fine.\n\nLetting your dog run free on trails with other people is a pretty big faux pas and in most places is against the law\n\nAnd you never drive over speed limit right … ?\n\nWhat is the point you're making here?\n\n\"You shouldn't murder people\"\n\n\"But you never jay-walk, right?\"\n\nBig “you criticize society yet participate in it, curious” energy.\n\nThe dog is wearing a harness. I'm assuming OP just dropped the leash for the picture, otherwise there'd be no reason for the harness. \n\nPossibly... but you could say the same thing about a collar...\n\nPeople hate to see dogs having fun off leash😂😂😍. Youre literally in the woods.\n\nYeah, it's great fun for trail users who don't like dogs, are allergic to dogs, or have a history of being bitten by dogs. Forcing other people to worry about and deal with  your animal is great fun.\n\nI live in a big hiking area, and at least once a month someone will post in a local facebook group about losing their dog while hiking. Someone will always ask \"how did you lose your dog, wasn't it leashed?\" and the person says \"no my dog is well-behaved and always comes when called. but he saw a squirrel and ran after it and now we can't find him\"\n\nBoo-fucking-hoo, your dog deserved better and now he's going to starve and die in the woods because you're a moron.\n\nYup.\n\nWhat if the dog is trained to stay away from people and other dogs, as a person would? Is that acceptable?\n\nOf course not. I should not have to worry about your dog and your dog is not my responsibility. If you are making other people concerned or inconvenienced by your dog, you and your dog should stay home.\n\nWhy would you be concerned or inconvenienced if you have no interaction with the dog at all?\n\n[deleted]\n\nWell if it behaves the same as a dog that was on a leash, and the interaction is the same as if the dog is on the leash, is that so bad really?\n\nIf it's beside you, as if it's on a leash, just put a leash on. The rules apply to everyone.\n\nAlright then\n\nThe point isn't not liking dogs off leash where they are allowed, the point is they are not allowed here. Applies to every dog, good, bad, trained, or not.\n\nNo, OP is on a public trail\n\nOn leash or off?"

I don't jog, I run, so it doesn't bother me :)\n\nIn the sovereign citizen arena you are just “traveling”\n\nCame here to say this 😂\n\nNo Crushing!!! haha\n\nCareful, if you go too fast the lifeguard will blow their way you.\n\nRunning is not allows on Pond Path around Walden Pond in Concord MA,  but it's allowed on all other trails. It's because the path is so popular and runners have a reputation for not wanting to stop or slow down when passing. Except for the far western edge of the pond by the railway tracks the pond path is easily avoided by  making a wider loop. And rangers just remind you to move off the patch when you're through if they see you running on that part\n\n[deleted]\n\nFor some reason, this reminds me of the press release from Colorado SAR stating that they are seeing far more mountain runners calling on SAR after getting themselves into trouble in remote areas. \n\nNot that there's anything inherent to running being a more dangerous activity in the mountains than, say, climbing or peakbagging; unfortunately, I think the implication was that they were seeing disproportionate issues with runners just because so many of them were unprepared and didn't bring adequate gear. I guess they thought they were special.\n\nIt sucks, but -- although most runners are awesome -- there's a strain of arrogance among some runners that I feel like applies to what you just described. It's worse among cyclists.\n\nWouldn’t runners be less equipped and underprepared on average than the hiker who has water, food, and possibly even a shelter on his or her back? I think if you’re going into longer distances potentially at altitude, running probably is a higher risk activity.\n\nHaving water and food has more to do with the distance then it does the speed.  \n\nThe main difference in gear would be that runners almost never have shelter with them and probably too often don't have warm clothing for emergencies.  \n\nBut if I had to guess why runners would be more prone to accidents, it would be because they are more likely to become exhausted and less likely to take a break if they do.  \nYou are a lot more likely to make a mistake while exhausted.\n\nWarm clothing is a critical factor. In June I set off on a run up a peak here in Washington. I had an ice axe, crampons, trail runners, layers and some other essentials in my light running bag. But the rain came down harder than expected. Ended up getting so wet cold\nI had to bag it and turn around. You kind of have to pack light and count on running to stay warm. That does bring another level of risk though.\n\nCyclists are the horse girls/boys of the outdoor world\n\nSigh. I remember the good ole days when running was allowed around the pond but the trails beyond the railroad tracks are better (and less crowded) for trail runs anyway!\n\nI agree. I have a state park pass, and I like to use the reservation parking lot. But I like to run out to Mt Misery and Fairhaven Bay from there\n\nVisiting there recently, I noticed that the path has wire fences on both sides to get folks on the path. There is not much room to maneuver. Also: very much enjoyed my visit to Walden, seeing a replica of Thoreau's cabin and later visiting the site off the trail.\n\nI just had to double check what sub I was on when you mentioned Walden Pond 🤣\n\nSaved it to run there *\n\nI love Walden Pond, but there are seriously too many rules to that Pond Path so, sadly, I to avoid it.\n\nI just get on the path via the woods and ride my bike on the path\n\nI’ve ridden my bike on that path no problem.\n\nWith how slow I am on some reasons, it's nearly speed hiking.\n\nlol just keep one foot on the ground at all times and you’re good\n\nThe trick I learned in elementary school is keeping your arms super straight by your sides. It is impossible to detect running if you do that\n\nWorks at the pool too.\n\nMade me cackle…😂\n\nAre there refs in the trees handing out warnings?\n\n\"Flag on the field - unauthorised running, 2 yard penalty!!\"\n\nThere's a huge marine bird sanctuary I visited once that had these signs, western Washington \n\nIronically, next to an airport. \nAnd the entire 45 minute walk we did there was an idling Chinook helicopter parked on the tarmac not far away :|\n\nMust be the one in Hoquiam\n\nHad to Google it, but yep! We were out in Ocean Shores for a stay vacation\n\nAayyyyy! I went there once bc I was traveling and needed to get in a run bc it was mid season just to find that sign lol.\n\nhonestly it's probably to keep big group runs out\n\nBingo bongo.\n\nI bet they had a lot of un-permitted events and decided enough was enough. Bummer, though. Trails looks lovely.\n\nBingpot\n\nI’ll always remember the time… I was on the trail alone, fall colors throughout, a light morning fog through the woods, suddenly I noticed a deer silently grazing… I took a breath to savor the moment…And before I could exhale … I heard a voice yell “CROSS TRAFFIC!” to a herd of 8–10 trail runners, directing them to switch to single file formation as they blurred by me. \nThe deer retreated and I sensed the runners had no appreciation of the moment they just crashed thru.\n\nSeen also at Radnor Lake State Park near Nashville, TN, i.e. see old post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/trailrunning/comments/1e4tzmt/first\\_time\\_seeing\\_no\\_joggingrunning\\_on\\_trails/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trailrunning/comments/1e4tzmt/first_time_seeing_no_joggingrunning_on_trails/) \n\nIt's to minimize disturbances to wildlife, from my understanding.\n\nIn Australia I’ve nearly tread on a snake a few times running in nature areas. Doesn’t seem to happen when I’m just walking, the snakes probably have time to hide. In the US I imagine you could startle bears, cougars, moose which could be incompatible with life.\n\nFirst time I’ve seen an Australian concerned about the dangerous wildlife in the US :)\n\nYep, same as with most replies- nature preserve.\n\nRadnor Lake is such a gem.\n\nNo (hobby) jogging, running must be okay then…\n\nTracksmith half tights only.\n\nI believe it jogging, or yogging, might be a soft J\n\nJogging is just what it was called before we started calling it Zone 2, luckily for this sign I'm always in Zone 4!!!\n\nJogging is Zone 1. I know this because I frequently run in Zone 2 and I wouldn't be caught dead jogging.\n\nYup. Just break into a sprint when you hear someone coming.\n\nYep, these are often wildlife sanctuary type places…  the speed apparently startles wildlife.\n\nThe wildlife being hikers with headphones in who don't hear the first 10 \"hey can I get by you here?\"\n\n👆 Yeah you nailed it.\n\nPeople hike with headphones on?? I get it when running, of course, but even then, it annoys me that music helps me run better (cadence, distance, etc), because I'd much rather hear all the sounds of the forest. But just hiking? Hell nah, both for enjoyment but also situational awareness.\n\nUnfortunately, where I am people almost exclusively hike with headphones…or do almost anything outdoors. On multiple occasions I have been stuck yelling behind someone to try to alert them that I was trying to pass only to eventually just have to hop a turn and scare the daylights out of them. \n\nDoes it though….?\n\nIt does. Particularly birds.  Imagine being a little sparrow scratching through the dirt for seeds when a big mammal comes barreling down the path. \n\nWith a hiker birds usually have plenty of time to hide in the underbrush, but joggers can startle them and cause unnecessary stress.\n\nI can understand that. Faster speeds would give animals less reaction time. But I hike at about 2.5-3 mph and run at 4-5 mph. Is 2 mph going to make a big enough difference that there needs to be a ban on my activity? I guess I’m probably slower than most runners, but still.\n\nYeah, that may not matter as much, but you can’t really make a rule “slow runners only”\n\nI live right near hear - it does look great for running, but it’s primarily a nature preserve, so ya, running up on an animal vs walking is more disturbing to the lil critters and birds.\n\nJust run in Mac, always better and all that vert is good for you!\n\nThe trail may be a sensitive nature preserve, or may be specifically designed for walkers and seniors. You ever go running a blind corner and frighten a grandma out for their morning walk? This could prevent that. \n\nI’m fine with it, let the walkers have some tight trail networks too\n\nYou can't run around Walden Pond; apparently Thoreau wouldn't approve.  My understanding is that they really want the trail to be a place for meditative reflections, not filled with runners going for Strava segment crowns.  And I get it - I can certainly get reflective while running but I don't need to do it THERE.\n\n  \nThere's another small nature sanctuary closer by where you aren't supposed to run, but no one pays any attention there.  Hell, I have a friend who did a fifty miler on those \"No Running!\" trails.\n\nSome folks are so entitled. There are so many other places to run! It's why I love running in Wilderness Areas so much. No folks on MTBs barrelling down the trail.\n\nYou cannot swim there, either. They seem to be against triathletes.  \n\n[deleted]\n\nNot at all. They had a big push to get rid of the swimmers.  It's entirely an issue regarding cliches. \n\nWhich nature sanctuary?\n\nTorres del Paine National Park has a no running rule. Which was disappointing to learn because I had been hoping to take advantage of the Refugios and fastpack the route. I was unclear on whether they were worried about wildlife disturbance or just felt that it was unsafe in the backcountry, but someone with better Spanish might be able to figure it out. \n\nIn my area, I would suspect the local predators of putting up those signs after finding a The Far Side comic laying in the woods.\n\nWow I used to read that in the paper like 20 years ago. Haven't thought of it in about as long.  \nMan comics in the middle of the paper were great \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TheFarSide/s/Y0Bba98bsV\n\nTbf I have only done the main hike to the towers but this and the hike to fitzroy in El chalten were the most eroded hiking trails I've ever seen. Like crazy\n\nDo they have horses and pack animals on the trails? It seemed pretty clear the damage they do to trails when I was visiting Bryce Canyon and the Grand Canyon last month.\n\nNot sure. I doubt it. Honestly when you're in a line of hundreds of people ascending it on a Tuesday in the off season it doesn't take much math to realize tens of thousands of people are on these trails a year from all over the world many different cultures. Many of them have 0 understanding of leave no trace or trail etiquette\n\nAlso the grand canyon and Bryce are basically paved compared to this\n\nJeff Pelletier on YouTube has a [video](https://youtu.be/Fmjdmu5J2q8) fastpacking the O circuit.\n\nI ran the O route 2 years back, 10/10 would recommend, running wasn't a problem.\n\nthey do? is it new? I've had friends recently fastpack it (2023) and they didn't mention this. maybe they didn't run much?\n\nI have no idea when they instituted the rule but it existed when I was there in 2023. It’s not advertised well though, so I wouldn’t be surprised if most people are either unaware of it or just pretend it doesn’t exist. For example it’s listed on this trail map that the park provides you, but under the “behaviour on trails” section, not “restricted activities” section - https://torresdelpaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/ing-Folleto-trekking-PNTP-2022-43-x-33.pdf\n\nThis is the first time I hear about this and I was also thinking of going back one day and fastpacking it. I looked up the regulations in Spanish and they don’t really forbid running. All I’ve seen is a tourist information PDF with a recommendation against it. Some activities are clearly marked as forbidden, like mountain biking the O/W and the direction of travel for the O, but nothing about running beyond organized runs like trail races. I think if you plan it on your own you’d quickly find out when you try to make the reservations and they realize how many nights you plain on staying. Jeff Pelletier ran it and uploaded it to Youtube. Who knows if legally or illegally though.\n\nEDIT: I ran a small section and I swear it was in view of a ranger. So yeah don’t give up on your dream and try to plan it anyway. My experience hiking it was that fastpacking it would’ve been a lot more enjoyable. I like to backpack with a tent when it’s deep in the wilderness. TdP feels too developed for that. In that case I’d rather move faster and sleep in a bed.\n\nIt explicitly says no running (and they put it in bold) on the map provided by the park: https://torresdelpaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/ing-Folleto-trekking-PNTP-2022-43-x-33.pdf\n\nThat was enough discouragement for me. Like many things I’m sure you could get away with it, so I won’t tell anyone off for doing it. But as a visitor to both their park and country I didn’t want to do anything disrespectful. \n\nContext: I'm from South America living in the US. To be honest there's a bit of s difference in culture between the US and South America when it comes to regulations. The US tends to have more avenues for people to advocate and that leads to less strict regulations on recreation. In SA most regulations are passed by local legislatures or beaurocrats with not many opportunities for protest. Organizations like climbing or cycling coalitions are very very rare.\n\nSo what tends to happen is that regulators don't see certain activities as common and overreact when something bad happens. But then when it comes to actual Rangers that might be the same as the US. Most will be chill and you could run into the one super strict one.\n\nSo I'd still say just go for it. Just be courteous and be ready to slow down at any moment. Be respectful to the other trail users and you'll be fine. I can't believe noise is a concern when there's 60mph gusts every day. I'd maybe be careful on the first day when you're in the plains. That 100% looked like puma hunting ground.\n\nJeff here. We’d heard from a guide that running was technically not allowed, but couldn’t find anywhere where this was officially stated. The guide implied it was discouraged simply because of how busy the trails were so it may be dangerous for other hikers.\n\nWith that in mind, we were just careful and extra respectful when passing others, as we always try to be whenever we’re on a busy trail.\n\nWe also didn’t make a big show of running while around rangers, but I doubt they really care anyway, especially on the O Circuit which is so much less busy.\n\nThanks for the clarification!\n\nGlad I backpacked around Los Torres del Paine in the 1970s when Pinochet was in power.  No tourists, no silly rules.   Hardly any people at all!   Ran into 3 young Israeli soldiers on vacation and that was it.\n\nWhat does a dictator responsible for the torture of more than 30000 people has to do with your backpacking trip?\n\nThere's another wildlife refuge further north in Oregon that says no running and has funny signs that make jokes re-enforcing the message. Its the same reason they dont allow dogs. They dont want you to spook the wildlife.\n\nIs it a bird sanctuary or a wildlife refuge. There is a bird sanctuary in Sherwood Oregon and they don’t allow jogging or running so as not to disturb mating birds.\n\nI’ve seen similar signs before, and I guess it usually has to do with minimizing the impact on the environment. Jogging could disturb wildlife more than hiking due to the faster, more rhythmic movement. In some cases, trails might be designed for a slower pace to reduce erosion or prevent accidents with other users. It’s probably about preserving the area while keeping it peaceful for wildlife and hikers.\n\nYeah, running is destroying our national parks...\n\nIt could just be guidance designed to reduce trail use overall... but I agree, there are far more damaging forms of recreation on public lands. Have you ever seen a horse trail at the end of a busy summer, or an ATV trail in the middle of mud season? They get absolutely demolished.\n\nAre horses allowed? There's several trails near me that prohibit running, jogging, hanging up hammocks, among other things as to not scare the horses\n\nGood thing I'm running, officer, not jogging\n\n\"No officer I was sprinting.\"\n\nYou can run. You just can’t jog.\n\nYou sound like my soccer coach\n\nI sprint trails so that sign is no problem for me\n\nOne of the trails I visited was a bird sanctuary, it also required “no jogging/running”, so my guess it that jogging/running (or fast movement) disturbed birds?!\n\nJust keep yourself faster than 6mins/km\n\n[https://www.asics.com/gb/en-gb/running-advice/running-vs-jogging-differences/](https://www.asics.com/gb/en-gb/running-advice/running-vs-jogging-differences/)\n\nThe sign says No Jogging (allowed). If it was disallowed, the sign would have the line through it like the other ones that are disallowed.\n\nYou can see this is true because of the sign that reads Hiking (allowed).\n\nSo you are allowed to not jog, and also are allowed to jog.\n\n/s for the smoothbrains like me.\n\nJogging can distribute gravel was what I was told. Hiking is slower and you follow the path. \nIf everyone jogged the path would be very uneven and not as regulated. \nBlazing a path vs following an established one. And jogging can scare the animals.\n\nThere are 'No Running' signs around Walden Pond in Concord, MA, but that's because they get literally half a million visitors a year and it's a tight path. Also it's just that one path. It is enforced.\n\nJust run, don't jog\n\nWhere I live,  trails are designated hiking-only by making them rocky deathtraps with a 7% grade.  Signs seem like a kinder,  gentler approach.\n\nLuckily my trail running can hardly be called running or even jogging\n\nNo running around predators like cougars and bears and Canadian geese, they may decide to chase you\n\nPark is sponsored by Ozempic.\n\nIt's not dissimilar to mountain bikers.\n1. A few knuckleheads think they own the trail.\n2. There's reports of confrontations with snooty tourist\n3. It's shutdown for everyone \n\nIt's really not hard to share. If you are on a bike or run, be mindful of your speed and spacing. If you are on a hike, give way to the faster individual. I've been saying it for years, but park rangers need more judiciary enforcement power. Cause a problem?? Here's a ticket!! But don't let one trail bum you out, there's plenty of trails for everyone to enjoy, and trail running is a fantastic way to spend a day!!\n\nThe rangers put the signs up for a reason, I just follow the sign. Lots other trails you can run in\n\ni believe it's pronounced *yogging*\n\nCYA for when a cyclist and a jogger fail to see each other and somebody gets hurt.\n\nEdit: so yea I’d ignore that sign until somebody tries enforcing on me.\n\nNo doggos and no running? Pffft,  not interested!\n\nJogging? Never heard of it. Must be a naughty young people thing.\n\nI’ve seen that in Tokyo in few parks.\n\nWhere is this to be more precis around Corvallis?\n\nWilliam Finley wildlife refuge\n\nDoes this trail go along the perimeter of a swimming pool? We all know there is no running at the pool.\n\nI just run at the pool anyways\n\nThere’s no reason not to run at the pool\n\nYes, I have seen this at only one other place. Radnor Lake state park in Nashville TN.\n\nNo hashing?… SMH.\n\nI have seen this on trails primarily utilized by horseback riders.\n\nMy coach said I am a runner, not a jogger. Should be ok.\n\nBears GRrr\n\nIs running ok?\n\nSeen it in Nashville too\n\nSeen it in Nashville too\n\nI know there must be a reason, but I have never seen such a sign here in Massachusetts, and I run regularly in wildlife preserves as well as many forests where hunting is allowed. The only thing they ask is that we wear bright orange. However, I think you’re probably right about it being a nature reserve by the fact that they don’t allow pets, which is common in wildlife preserves.\n\nIf there were equestrian trails in this nature preserve, OP, I would wonder if the no jogging is because some horses can spook at the relatively fast approach of a runner around a turn. Doesn't look like there are horses on this trail, but one time trail running on an all-purpose trail outside Nashville (in the woods, perhaps obviously), I approached two riders on horses around a turn. I'm a pretty fast [runner.One](http://runner.One) of the horses got a little spooked and the riders got nonplused with me. I live in horse country but know almost zero about horses, but this is a zero cents worth theory \\*\\*IF horses would ever be on any of these Corvallis trails. But doesn't look like it.\n\nIs that jogging with a soft j?  Yogging?\n\nIt's not well kept and/or very narrow.\n\nI have seen these signs on a few trails. I still jog_run anyway. Unless there is a clearly stated reason not to.\n\nI identify as a runner…sooooo…\n\nRocky Mountain Arsenal just outside of Denver has signs like this. You’re also not allowed to ride a bike on the roads, however, motorcycles are okay? It doesn’t make any damn sense. Some boomer get-off-my-lawn bullshit.\n\nHere you go  https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/travel/outdoors/2014/04/13/jogging-forbidden-at-area-refuges-since-speed-can-distress-animals/7685447/ This is in Oregon and the article explains the reason at this particular refuge for no running or jogging allowed. \n\n\nAlso note the two other prohibit signs are n your photo should be a clear give away as part the of explanation in the article.\n\nI've heard of things like this in Argentina. It can upset animals, which in turn is dangerous to humans.\n\nSteep trails, jogging = falling? I dunno.\n\nTypically it’s a conservation area, but I ran in one of those too. Send it\n\nYes. In wildlife refuges. They don’t want people disturbing migratory birds.\n\nRunning is just fast hiking. So, it’s still ok.\n\nHave you ever tried riding a bike on the highway?\n\nIt's to keep TikTok influencer jogging challenge away\n\nIs that down in William Finley Wildlife Refuge? I remember running there a few times. Some of the trails have that sign because of wooden bridges on the trails and running over them is quite loud. Others are near nesting spots so they don't want people running through that either.\n\nLocal walking community has gotten irritated with runners \"sneaking\" up on them when they are just trying to have a peaceful stroll while listening to their podcasts and got a persuasive ear on city council is typically what the situation is. .\n\nquickest nail gold physical tap entertain afterthought unite fragile merciful\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nRunning makes the birds self conscious\n\nArrest me\n\nMountain lions will chase you? (Just shooting from the hip here.) what about speed walking?\n\nYeah I'm running\n\nWhy are no pets allowed? That’s the question\n\nTripping hazards.\n\nI’ve seen these signs in nature centers.\n\nWildlife? Horse trail?\n\nI’ve seen it on a couple of trails in Alaska due to bears. A person running triggers a bears prey drive. I’ve never seen no pets unless it’s a National Park trail.\n\nProbably a bunch of Karen’s.\n\nThey're probably worried about runners not being courteous and bowling over hikers.\n\nScares birds which messes up their ability to use the area as habitat.\n\nHelon Mead put that sign up.\n\nYes. In bird sanctuaries.  It is super annoying because right after getting yelled at I see two maintenance trucks drive by... My running disturbs the birds, but not the maintenance trucks?  I don't think a solo runner is more apt to scare birds than a pair of hikers chatting.\n\nWhat’s the problem, running is allowed? 😜\n\nFor every sign, there was a reason...\nI dunno what it is, but it was probably needed.\n\nFor every sign, there was a reason...\nI dunno what it is, but it was probably needed.\n\nNo jogging and no biking is great!!!\n\nI’d just go jogging and tell whoever complains “I’m dyslexic”\n\nYet no mention of that trail classic, the FV4034 Challenger 2 main battle tank.\n\nHow about sprinting or speed walking.\n\nJust run, don’t jog.\n\nI was told by a conservationist that it has to do with the  impact on the trails and surrounding areas - running has a more damaging compaction and can lead to the destruction of vegetation. So, some places like a nature reservation don't allow it.\n\nWhen I read your post title I immediately thought of Finley and sure enough. Like others said it’s to minimize disruption to wildlife. \n\nJust try walking twice at the same time. Hope this helps.\n\nBecause yuppies ruin everything\n\nI had a woman yell at me the other day when I was running the hiking trails in my neighborhood. She yelled, \"These are hiking trails, not running trails!\"  I stopped and ask her where this was posted, she said it isnt, it's just known. smh.\n\nLucky for me I run, I don’t jog.\n\nSo you don’t trample hikers\n\nRunners have a bad habit of thinking walkers need to move out of their way. It's especially bad on winding trails with lots of blind spots due to dense vegetation. That would be my guess based on my experience.\n\nYes you can going hiking BUT IT BETTER BE MODERATELY PACED.\n\nHorse trails or dirt bike trails are usually the only times I see signs like this. \n\nMainly because: \n\n1: you never know how someone else's horse is going to react to a random person\n\n2: if it's a mountain bike or dirt bike trail they often anticipate people going fairly fast for some jumps, so a person walking might be in danger on blind corners or tight switchbacks\n\n3: in parks with multiple trails you want to keep people on the trail they're supposed to be on. Often times there'll be emergency access or park service roads, so signs like this let's people who got off the trail stay safe by not going on incorrect trails. Often times emergency access or maintenance trails are so infrequently used that other trails will cross them often, so again you want to keep people on the right trail.\n\nI did the mammoth march one year on a very narrow trail packed with other hikers. Despite the rules saying no running there was a couple bumping into everyone as they went until running into brick wall of a dude who knocked him into the lake. It was very satisfying.\n\n¹q\nT\n\nFind another trail if you want to jog/run. They excluded bikes and pets also. There're thousands of trails out there.\n\nI will never understand a runner or a cyclist desire to seek out and knowingly use a trail heavily populated with walkers/ ordinary hikers.  No thanks not where I want to be.\n\nDon't jog, just walk like super fast.\n\nToday, I am “Hiking”\n\nHiking quickly. Maybe some jumping and skipping peppered in.\n\nI showed up to a private trail network and was trying to pay to get in and the ranger saw my gear and frankly said there was no running allowed because it 'disturbs the wildlife'\n\nPresumably you can still sprint\n\nI'm such a slow trail runner they won't know the difference 😉\n\nBecause some people hate life and they want everyone to hate it\n\nPcch, it wouldn't stop me from my trail run 🙄\n\nYup fr\n\nBalls out sprint or GTFO\n\nIt’s not enforceable either way.\n\nSome, if not most, laws should be broken."

Maybe one day I will attempt something so epic.\n\nThat was it for me as well. Saw the helmet guys running, and then watching the PTL closing ceremony with the finishers ringing their bells, and I vowed to absolutely be back for that. Got to ring my bell in 2022.\n\nThat’s fantastic!! I was there that same year running OCC — following a friend’s race today, watching the finish line live stream, can’t wait to go back.\n\nOh amazing! OCC looks like a very deceptive race!

I heard even better things about the MT2/3 trainers for durability too.\n\nOh wow. Need to check them out. I’m a big NNormal fan, not just for the durability but also the technical grip/control. If it’s similar well worth checking out, thanks! \n\nFor the PTL, I ran with La Sportiva Helios 3s. Haven’t done 100 mile+ with the NNormals and my feet are quite wide so stuck with technical shoes I’ve done long runs with :)\n\nI check the lasportiva website quite often, and the Helios 3 would not come first to my mind for a 300km course 😅. Did they hold up well?\n\nHey, great job still, OP!\n\nNgl, that ridge really is terrifying it looks like an abyss underwater.\n\nYou guys are hardcore 💀 tf\n\nWow. Hell yea\n\nFantastic photos and an amazing effort!\n\nAmazing work, was there any one particular moment that you thought, “this why I choose this race?” \n\nI find that there’s always moments that keep me wanting races like this. I’ve only done a few shorter mountain based races and would love to one day tackle something like this.  Inspiring!\n\nI love the really technical, semi-mountaineering, self-supported type events. So a very good reference point would actually be that first photo. It's the middle of the night, you are on some godforsaken ridge somewhere at 3,000m, with big drops on both sides. And at that moment it's like YES, this is why I'm here! This is such a different experience that what you would get on a normal race.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThanks so much!   \n  \nAs a side note, the PTL acronym stands for 'Petite Trotte à Léon' - the little trot of Leon. A baker from the Champex Lac region who often disappeared for a few days to go pick some blueberries :) So the name was jokingly named after him. The legendary Leon is still at the finish of the event to welcome back runners.\n\nI thought I was on r/scuba for a sec - looks amazing and terrifying! Good job OP!\n\nDamn, you won just by running it\n\nAmazing. Would also make a pretty intense hike. Beautiful."

Maybe Georgia/NC, but once you’re out of there aren’t you smooth sailing?\n\nShe ran southbound, right? Finished through North Carolina and Georgia? \n\nI thought I read that 30 percent of the trail was inaccessible. Even if the trail can be used, I’m not sure how her crew could have navigated the roads and access points.\n\nAH fuck I had no idea!!\n\nImpressive.\n\nThe Appalachian Trail Conservancy has never recognized speed records. Until the rise of social media and fastestknowntime.com and similar, speed records were largely shared on discussion boards and word of mouth. Now we see new records and record attempts regularly. It raises awareness of the trail, which has both positive (funding and conservation awareness) and negative (crowding) effects\n\nSpeed records on the AT have no effect on crowding on the trail. The AT is crowded because it is close to towns and millions of people. There are typically less than 5 speed attempts per year.\n\nthis reads like bad AI\n\nLooks like she just finished a 5k. What an absolute beast of a runner.\n\n Does anyone know which altras she’s wearing?\n\nExperience Wild\n\nGreat shoes, super comfortable. Just worried about durability. I mean she wore them for the AT but i dont know if Altras just sends her a new pair every few days or whatnot\n\nSponsored as she is, I'm betting she got plenty of fresh shoes.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI don't see it like that. No-one expects a running shoe to remain fresh on the trails for 2000 miles. And the feat is by the runner, I wouldn't want it tainted because of failing gear.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMy other comment was not belittling the accomplishment by any means, as you seem to be implying. Runners on 100 millers swap shoes, why wouldn't a runner on 2000 miles? By the way, Altra themselves confirmed that she used several Altra models during the FKT, so take it as you will.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DARHXcLP4Ik/?igsh=dDU0bWVmaTN4MW04\n\nI thought so. I’ve been wearing the mens version for about 2 months and love them so far.\n\nI was able to get out and pace her for a day that included Mont Blancs, both lace and BOA (not captured here, but can speak to their use).\n\nWhat an awesome opportunity! Thanks for sharing that!\n\nAn extraordinary athlete and even better person! I was humbled.\n\nNice! Did you catch if the laced ones were the newer ones (carbon) or the first ones but without BOA?\nThanks\n\nGiven the Altra box stash I would venture a guess that they were new. All I can say for sure was that at aid points there were swaps between lace and BOA Blancs.\n\nThanks for asking! I didn’t recognize them. Looked like Hoka colours (Speedgoat 6) but not the shoe lol.\n\nI can’t imagine the emotions you feel at that moment.\n\nFor the record, I think she walked a lot more than she ran and she made it look really easy. \n\nShe was on the trail everyday by 3:30 am and often didn’t finish until after 9pm. \n\nJust amazing, such an achievement! Women strong!\n\nIncredible. Does anyone know if they are making a documentary or anything on this? Would be excited to watch the full story played out! What an incredible accomplishment.\n\nYou can find some short content of the last 12 minutes on the Singletrack podcast on YT. He also does an interview with her about it.\n\nCamille Herron and her husband are at their PC right now anxiously waiting for this to hit wikipedia.... may not be a world record for long."

Give us all the details! \n\n[Btw: That’s a big old swanky finish line / arch! The events I do normally have a couple of self standing flags either side of the electronic timing mat! 😂 I also do a run near / round / to Stonehenge every year and there’s two traffic cones as the start/finish line! 😂 ]\n\nYeah, it’s normally a guy with a clipboard and a stopwatch next to someone ready with your medal 😁\n\nAt the Stonehenge thing you don’t even get a medal - you get a sew-on patch. Which you only get if you collect an ink stamp on your piece of card at the checkpoints…which have tea and biscuits! It’s quaint AF and I love it!\n\nIt’s basically a walking / rambling event taken over by annoying fucking running wankers. Like me. \n\nEntry price: £7.50.\n\nWe have a local 50k race where the RD gives out painted rocks lol. Like a shark or an alien or whatever. They have a special “DFL” ladybug rock for last place. It’s pretty small, I think usually 20-25 people in the 50k, but really good community vibes. Usually someone smoking some meat for the finishers, too🥩\n\nI *love* this!\n\nI would have a ladybug rock collection by now.\n\nSounds pretty neat. I’d prefer something like that to a medal! At least they’re moving to wood ones now rather than some of the clunky metal ones which are dangerous when my two year old gets a hold of them. \n\nWell, it’s a UTMB org race. And this same weekend included a suite of races at many distance, I think some of routes  had a shared finish line\n\nThat’s pretty cool (depending on one’s opinion of UTMB, of course).\n\nYes, they had 6 different races, from 120 km, 80 km, 50k, 25k and 15k and then 10 which I ran. It was really nice, good atmosphere and people said it was well organised.\n\nI really like it when shorter race distances are offered alongside ultras. It builds community and welcomes less experienced athletes into the sport — or athletes who prefer a shorter distance for whatever reason.\n\nIt was great ❤️ There were about 220 of us running this distance, mostly inexperienced runners like myself. The real pros did the distance in less than an hour and we slower folks needed about an hour and a half to two hours. We all got shiny medals and saw some beautiful scenery and pretty cows 😂😂😂. I set my PR in 10k and discovered I love  love love running downhill. Also, being a fairly experienced hiker really helps when the trail gets a little technical. And that is all I can think of.\n\nCongratulations and great work!\n\nHow did it compare to a road 10k?\n\nI actually never ran a road race but in terms of time, it was much slower than when I run on the road. However it was so much more fun 🥰\n\nCongratulations!! Wow, amazing looking course 💚\n\nAwesome .. great job\n\nThat’s awesome! Well done! I did the 25km last year and it was beautiful but brutal. The final climb is straight up a ski slope…\n\nI was thinking about appplying for 25k... But that ski slope 😭😭😭\n\nBeautiful views! Congratulations!\n\nCongratulations!\n\n🙌🏾🙌🏾 where's that paradise?\n\nSlovenia, Kranjska Gora"

All these whacky fun and cold loving folks set up hydration stations with maple syrup shots, fireball, cookies and pancakes...

I wanna do a roadside oyster next year! and the baked goods on the top of the last hill before town- I was drooling down my balaclava\n\nI’m thinking of doing that race next year! Just out of curiosity, what shoes did you wear? Are trail runners necessary?\n\nI wore just nike trail runners, nothing too special, and was glad i'd run on snow and ice a few times this year to be ready. I saw a lot of nanospikes and crampons, but I didn't think the terrain itself was hard enough to need it- not really any steep, sketchy downhills to speak of, and it was lightly sanded and wide enough I could pick my path. And once you get off the Golden Road after 6 miles, it was pavement, so I don't recommend spikes unless you're willing to stop and take them off\n\nRan the half as well, what an amazing race! Fireball being handed out at every mile, the locals were awesome!\n\nReminder the RD is a creep with multiple restraining orders and was arrested a week before the mdi marathon a few years ago for violating an active one.\n\n207 represent"

    "all_comment_text": "“The Global Organization of Multi-day Marathoners (GOMU) president Trishul Cherns said he was appalled by the situation. ‘In my forty-six years of ultrarunning, I’ve never seen anyone as talented as Camille, who is so dedicated to creating division and animosity within the ultrarunning community. Unfortunately, the Wikipedia story is part of a pattern of interference. This couple has a history of trying to disrupt athletes, their reputations, races, and performances by citing World Athletics rules that do not apply to ultrarunning and multi-day running. I was appalled by Camille’s criticism directed at athletes challenging “her” records and her efforts to discredit them. This unsportsmanlike behaviour is bullying and mean-spirited and has no place in the larger ultrarunning community.’ ”\n\n\nYiiiikes. Not sure I ever realized this about her.\n\nTrishul is one of the most prominent figures in multi-day ultras and ultra running in general. For him to say this is a big deal.\n\nIt’s refreshing to see someone of his stature to call a spade a spade in a situation like this.\n\nShe’s also been known to engage in bullying other runners in her efforts to discredit their accomplishments.\n\nIt’s wild, looking now you can see just how carefully crafted her social media is to present a certain persona.\n\nI both wear Goodr sunglasses and use Squirrels Nut Butter because I like their products, but I’d like them just a tiny bit more if they dropped her as sponsors as a response. \n\nI would love that journey for her.\n\nSame and same. I wonder if Lululemon will drop her — I don't care for them as a brand and they have historically been problematic, but they have such a prominent voice I would love to see them drop her for that reason alone...\n\nTheir running gear for men just isn’t that great at the price point compared to Patagonia and other nice brands\n\nThat brand’s history of bullying…\nShe’s the perfect athlete for them\n\nVery true. I would just love to see her dropped for the publicity of it all. But yeah they both suck.\n\nThat didn’t take long haha\n\nHell yeah. They did something right.\n\nThey just did\n\nWhen in reality she’s a ruthless bitch.\n\nthis was an absolute scathing quote, there has been some interactions there for sure.\n\nWasn’t she the one that helped stoke the fires against Ashley Paulson?\n\nYes. And she did it while Paulson was still running Badwater, calling race officials and pinging Derek Murphy. Camille is a real piece of work.\n\nI had no idea! I was supportive of Ashley since the beginning and that debacle was just awful.\n\n&gt;”In my forty-six years of ultrarunning…” \n\nThat’s an absurdly long race!!\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt’s a quote from the posted article.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo worries!\n\nme either, TIL. Lost any and all respect for her.\n\nThis is petulant for a high schooler, much less someone as accomplished as her.\n\nAlso, particularly disturbing given how openly supportive ultra running is. It’s got to be one of the best communities in sports.\n\nIve though this about a myriad of niche sports - climbing, diving, alpinism -, but then was proven wrong by a small élite but very competitive group. It's generally not the rule, but there are assholes in every sport I am afraid.\n\nIt doesn't matters, as long as you enjoy it yourself and let others enjoy it. Just dont give it any energy.\n\nFortunately in Ultra running our two most elite representatives, Killian and Courtney seems to be top knotch people, and thankfully not reflective of people who behave like this.  Someone knocks down one of their records, and they both are the 1st to offer congratulations.  That's how it should be.  \n\nAll records will eventually fall, except for Wayne Gretzky's, people just need to accept it and cheer on greatness.\n\nI couldn’t agree more. The elitism of not only ultra running, but trail running in general is some of the worst I’ve seen in any niche sport. The most mediocre of runners somehow feel like elite specimens because they walked a 50k. Trail running is fantastic, but the amount of people in the “community” who simply cannot get enough of the smell of their own farts is just nauseating.\n\nUnfortunately it's there in a lot niche sports, it just requires more attention to spot sometimes. \n\nMy first thought when this story broke was how Courtney was out cheering for Katie as she broke her UTMB record.  That's how supportive this sport  is supposed to be\n\nYeah, and part of what makes ultra running great is that there's so many different events and distances that lots of people can be great at different things without having to be the \"greatest ever\".  Even if Camille didn't diminish other people, she would still be seen as great because of her performances, especially over the 6 day distance.\n\nI personally know Camille and Conor. Sad to say that this is not surprising based on the interactions I’ve had with them over the years. The kind of people that just talk at you rather than have an actual conversation.\n\nAnd to do this to Courtney Duwalter is mean girl petty. Grow up.\n\nRight?! Courtney is a class act.\n\nCourtney: “What she say fuck me for?”\n\nI'm sure she and everyone else went \"what happened? Oh ok... ...odd\" and then shrugged and went on with their day\n\nIt's not necessarily hurtful because it's so bizarre. At most I'd worry for their mental health (Camille and husband)\n\nFor sure. This just solidifies how unwell Camille, her coach, and husband have been for years now.\n\nEpic handle btw!\n\nLol thanks mate\n\nI would think it is deeply unsettling to be the target of two obviously unwell people like this. While not hurtfull I think it is far from something you just shrug off.\n\nI hope this ongoing controversy is added to her Wikipedia page.\n\nAnd it should continue to be re-added once she or her husband remove it\n\n“This article is a stub, you can help by expanding upon it” \n\nNo, not like that Camille\n\nIn addition to being pathetic, this is truly bizarre behaviour. It's strange to me that someone so successful would find it worthwhile to be so incredibly petty. \n\nI find it especially strange that she is targeting men, who you wouldn't as obviously consider direct rivals.\n\nHer website says \"the world's best ultra runner\". Between that, her actively trying to have records thrown out(even Canadian records that she can't compete in), and her removing Wikipedia entries for others it really seems like she's trying to make it so when you think ultra, you think Camille. She's trying to become \"the world's best ultra runner\" by removing any competition.\n\nBut part of the thrill of ultras is that nobody is \"the best\", because there are so many different events and distances, so lots of people can be great at different things. I don't think people would debate Camille's greatness even if she didn't diminish others, so it's disappointing that she does.\n\nBut she does consider them to be her rivals. She feels all ultra distances can eventually have a woman in the top spot.\n\nA lot of high performers are narcissists. Ultrarunning and trail running in general always seemed to be better on average about this, many of the best seem to be low ego. There's exceptions of course and Camille Herron is clearly one of the worst.\n\n\nI move to bestow upon her the title of WOAT, worst of all time.\n\nPlease don't call her a narcissist. Pop-psychology is getting way out of hand on the internet.\n\n\nEdit to add: i agree with the rest.\n\nAgree with this, it’s not narcissistic to be an insecure individual, that is also childish and of low moral character.\n\nI'm not sure why you're down voted. You are correct.\n\nBecause people are dumb, quite frankly.\n\nThis is absolutely true\n\nMortifying behavior by an adult. And to go after Courtney Dauwalter of all people, who is nothing but humble, inviting and an incredible athlete? I have secondhand embarrassment for Camille and her husband. This represents everything the ultra world DOES NOT.\n\nCourtney's humble and kind nature coupled with her incredible happiness and grit likely irked CH so much that she became obsessed.  Dangerous and sad.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHer legacy is well and truly set in place now. Most people will remember this for much longer than any specific ultra record she has.\n\nSadly agree. This is not even a little bit surprising.\n\nBack when I still was on Twitter I remember her giving Olympic trials winners shit over draping the flag on the shoulders. She was going on about how that wasn’t proper flag etiquette. So god damn petty. Glad she’s getting her comeuppance. Fuck her, fuck the roches, fuck sage, fuck Billy Yang.\n\nWhat did Billy Yang do?\n\nYang, the Roches, and Cannaday all swim in the same self righteous waters that Herron is currently drowning in.\n\nMaybe so, but what did Sage and Billy do? I mean yea they seem pretty self centered but they seem ti be nice folks as well. You don’t ever hear anything bad about people’s interactions with Sage when he’s walking around Chamonix, or wherever. Sure, I too get tired of the constant pulmonary embolism talk, but that’s different.\n\nto be fair, the constant worry that everything at the center of your life is affected by some unknown health condition that lurks like a boogieman must be pretty taxing. My wife has had pulmonary embolisms and runs ultras and it's constantly in mind when pouring through the data. Must be hard when you're that far up the sport to know you'll probably never be the same again.\n\nThe Roches can be a little much, but I do think they are genuinely kind people. Granted I’ve never met them and only know them from occasionally tuning into their podcast and having a couple friends who are coached by them, but I’ve only ever heard that they’re supportive of other athletes in the sport (David did not enter any big races for a long time because he didn’t want to take away from any of his athlete’s accomplishments). I also think they had a pretty measured reaction to the spring energy controversy — once the facts became clear they expressed frustration and dropped their support. I’m struggling to see the comparison here. You don’t have to love the Roches but Camille was actively trying to minimize/detract from other runner’s accomplishments.\n\nSage is a pretty nice guy in person, and he really doesn't take himself too seriously on his Youtube channel. Where are you getting this from?\n\nWhen the Spring Energy scandal first broke Sage was pretty rude and dismissive to anyone questioning Spring Energy’s nutritional information, including spouting some science-sounding jargon filled nonsense in snarky comments and a now deleted video.\n\nThanks for the reply - I hadn't followed any of the Spring Energy stuff. Definitely disappointing that he'd be rude to anyone for questioning a product. The science will out, there's no need to get attached to a brand... ...but I am guessing the defensiveness comes from his livelihood being so dependent on all these niche products. A bummer.\n\nBilly Yang? Come on now.\n\nI find him a bit to kitschy for my liking...but we have a mutual friend and he says he's an excellent person.\n\nYea fuck Billy he can’t even finish an ultra. Jk I like his videos\n\nMe too. I just tell myself when one of these better know ulta-people or content maker puts something out, I need to be careful not to step in the bullshit.\n\nMay I also ask what the Roches did? I don’t necessarily like them, but don’t know if I should dislike them 😂\n\nOnly thing I heard about is they supporting Spring Energy and then shifting into denial mode after their lies came out.\n\nThis is oddly psychotic behavior. Camille is a legit legend in her own right, there is absolutely no reason for her or her team to need to shade anyone else out for her to get the credit she deserves. \n\nAnd being autistic doesn’t excuse this. It’s just silly and petty and dumb. And good lord who the fuck thinks they can edit out Killian’s or Courtney’s accomplishments and not expect pitchforks - that’s just laughable.\n\nYep, this is so lame and embarrassing.\n\nOne very good reason for her and her husband's behavior:  financial interests.  Pumped-up wikipedia pages for her and downgraded ones for others can be used as marketing material to obtain sponsors, book speaking engagements, and attract new coaching clients.  Potential sponsors not very familiar with the ultrarunning scene may actually buy into her self-proclaimed \"The World's Best Ultrarunner\" title and get scammed by following up on the wikipedia pages.\n\nWell now she won’t have to worry about obtaining sponsors over Courtney or anybody else bc no one will want to work with her\n\nFingers crossed!\n\nat 42 yrs old, thats likely the last of her running career.\n\nCamille Herron is a talented runner but unfortunately specializes in a niche area of ultrarunning that doesn't attract as much attention as she think it deserves. You can hear her frustration in past podcasts and social media comments.  I would think as a scientist that she would understand the Wikipedia auditing system and safeguards.  Instead, she has been caught red-handed and and it's a terrible look.  I believe she was still in the hunt for a new shoe sponsor but her marketability will decline rapidly with these stunts on record.  A full apology would be the first step for a get-well plan but I doubt we'll see one.\n\nReally amazing watching someone with a special talent just completely sinking their own ship.\n\nPrecisely. I mean, at least use a VPN. That’s just pirate 101 protocol.\n\nWhat’s funny is that she herself has been arguing that her part of ultrarunning shouldn’t be discussed alongside people like Courtney because they’re mountain/trail runners. She can’t appreciate that everything being called “ultra running” does more for her personal profile than her being able to exclude Courtney and be called “the worlds greatest Ultrarunner”. \n\nThen she dropped out of western states because her \"special gait doesn't work on snow\". Even though two women broke the previous record. It was so clear that Camille was getting smoked by a lot of runners and just couldn't admit that that's not the type of race for her.\n\nI also find it funny her insta bio claims a 12:42.xx trail 100 mile when the race is held on a very flat crushed gravel path 😅 hardly a trail ultra. She’s good at pumping her own tires up tho\n\n[deleted]\n\nA lot of scientists don’t have phd’s. That can be for several reasons, such as their job not requiring a phd. This is particularly true in the private sector or phd candidates working through their phd program. \n\nShe does have published research, however. \n\nhttps://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/xs55mf995?locale=en\n\nHa, I saw this and thought the same. Apparently she is on some papers as a research assistant. I mean, fine, consider yourself a scientist if you want but don't have it as your headline like fucking Albert Einstein.\n\nYou dont need to be a PhD'er to be invested in the scientific method. Dont be elitist like that.\n\nI’m glad she got caught b/c this incident will allow hoarded of people to come out and have their voices heard when maybe they didn’t feel comfortable speaking on public platforms before.  Camille and Conor have a very long history of atrocious behavior.\n\nWhat an entitled asshole.\n\nBig big yikes. But not a surprise really. I remember way back she was a big poster on Let’s Run and her posts were …. Interesting.\n\nWhat an absolute PoS.\n\n💀🤣\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/s/ChXLEJ5R48\n\nbwuahahhhahahaaa\n\nJust goes to show that being a great athlete doesn't mean you are a great person. The contrast really flatters real champions like Courtney D and Katie S.\n\nCamille seems to have deleted or suspended her own social media. She was caught. What a sad little life she must live.\n\nI noticed that her ultrasignup record of all of her races are gone, too.\n\nThose have ALWAYS been gone - she was able to get those results suppressed years ago. Guess she didn't want to have her stats posted..???\n\n[removed]\n\nThat makes so much sense (in Camille’s world, anyway) I’ve always wondered what her full record looks like. And I’d imagine it’s less painful to her ego than seeing folks ranked higher at 100% who managed to run a few virtual races during early COVID days. US has always been a bit hanky but that’s also part of its charm.\n\nAaaand looks like her IG account has been deactivated.\n\nAnd the Twitter account too\n\nAnd her Facebook account, she deactivated everything\n\nInteresting to revisit the post linked below from u/neptun123 about athletes having problems ratifying their efforts that have broken Camille's records.  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/1f9h8ce/records\\_ratification\\_and\\_camille\\_herron\\_vs\\_people/?sort=new\n\nEspecially when compared to people like Courtney and Kilian who are incredible role models. Courtney was just out cheering on Katie Schide and seemed legitimately stoked that she beat her record at UTMB. \n\nHer behavior is antithetical to the spirit that makes the ultra/trail community great. So many notable examples of FKT holders being gracious and even sharing beta with the people trying to break their records. She's showing her insecurities in a very ugly way and her reputation will (justifiably) suffer because of it.\n\nEven Sorkin who could have the same gripes as her was helping put on an event where others came together to try and beat some\nOf his records\n\nHow can someone be so toxic to the sport?!\n\nVery sad but not surprising. I have met her a few times and she is beyond self centered.   I think someone should look into her claims that she was 1)Valedictorian of her HS 2) Has accolades and advanced degrees from OSU.  Can someone check if those degrees are real?   Also, who gave her the diagnoses she now says she received last year?  She seems like a very skilled liar and manipulator.   What a waste of talent.\n\nJust why?!\n\nSome people don’t think well and can’t help it.\n\nBoooo! That’s super shitty.\n\nWow, I'm surprised to hear this what with the ultrarunning community being so supportive of everyone, regardless of their experience level. Casts her and her husband/coach in a much different light.\n\nVery embarrassing and cringe behaviour.\n\nHer wiki page is conveniently locked for comments.\n\nThe comments are open here are at @yaboyscottjurek on insta.\n\nOh I’m well aware of that account. It broke the story for me.\n\nIt’s gotta be the best meme account out there, for any sport\n\nPlease tell me this story is going to be referenced under a “controversy” section on her Wikipedia page\n\nShe deleted her socials pretty sure\n\nIndeed her Insta account is gone\n\nThere are multiple other athletes speaking up about being harassed and bullied by her. Howie Stern is PISSED.\n\nOh, what has Howie been saying? My Google-foo is failing me\n\nShe’s just salty cuz Courtney destroyed @ States last year while she DNF’d with her goofy ass gait\n\n[deleted]\n\nUnfortunately\n\n[deleted]\n\nMy thoughts exactly.\n\nWhat a loser.\n\nI felt bad when my Coros Camille record watch was recalled, not nearly as much now.\n\nJust goes to show that you can win all the greatest, be the greatest, performed among the greatest, and still be a fucking sorry loser.\n\nI don’t want to see her on any start lines anytime soon. Bad sportsmanship on and off the trails should be grounds enough for a ban.\n\nWhat an absolute PoS.\n\nThis is just sad..\n\nWho is going add the Controversy section to her Wiki\n\nShe committed sudoku on all of her socials 🫠\n\nhttps://runningmagazine.ca/the-scene/lululemon-ends-partnership-with-ultrarunner-camille-herron/\n\nYesssssssss\n\nAs a former hockey player… I endorse fighting for this reason. Sometimes, the rules just don’t get enforced and players regulate the game. Trade some blows, get that rowdy player to think about what they did while icing down their lumps in the sin bin for 5 minutes. \n\nSadly… this isn’t on the ice…\n\nI was following her. Glad she deactivated her accounts. We need good ambassadors for trail running, like Courtney. I'm sure she will blame this on her recent autism diagnosis.\n\nSociopathic…\n \nI just scrolled through her IG and wow. I hope she gets canceled.\n\nGood old fashioned narcissistic personality disorder\n\nWas she getting a lot of feedback on Instagram after this came out? I just went to unfollow her and couldn't find her. When I googled it, I got an error page. Did she end up temporarily deleting her account??\n\nShe deleted ALL of her social media.\n\nWho?\n\nWhat a boomer\n\nAll of this is super sad. Camille and Conor are both legendary runners here in Oklahoma. Camille's been nothing but super nice whenever I talked to her (maybe it was him lol) on social media. It was my understanding that Conor manage's her social media and a lot of their business interests. They've been trying hard to lock up sponsors and keep her running going as a full time gig. They also just recently moved and bought a house out-of-state. Maybe the money and sponsorship pressures caused one of them to be stupid and petty on Wikipedia. Her taco shoe posts evidenced their abnormal method on trying to pressure sponsors. The autism and menstrual cycle campaign she's been on recently seemed contrived too to gather marketing attention. When you're one of the best in the world at something, I think it's easy to assume that you deserve money, attention, and sponsorship, but ultra doesn't make their athletes rich lol. It's not my business, but I would assume they're barely scraping by financially without one of them working full-time. I hope she personally didn't edit the Wikipedia posts. With no evidence, it just seemed to me to be more of a greedy husband move than something she would do on her own.\n\nAs a woman of a similar age to Camille I actually appreciate her posts about perimenopause. It's not something often discussed, especially within athletes. \n\nIt also seems as though they were likely both involved in the Wikipedia tampering. I've also seen some testimonies from other female runners over the last 48 hours how Camille would follow women when they started to show promise and then block them when they \"got too good\" and would also start a campaign of trying to downplay, block and report any of their big successes. Like submit complaints to governing bodies trying to get records overturned, etc.\n\nI'm not downplaying the importance of raising awareness for perimenopause or being on the spectrum. I just think the way she and her team (aka Conor) were pushing it came off as a marketing ploy to try to say hey I deserve sponsorship over others because I'm championing these causes.\n\nAnd ya she had to have least been involved to some extent. But I think it matters more how she acted towards other athletes in person because like I said, I don't know much he was actively managing (controlling) her social media and publicity.\n\nIve had talks with Camille via twitter/X over the years and have always found her to be pleasant and nice , very genuine.   She was always answered my questions and made a point to always be positive with and towards me.  This as I will be running my 17th NYC marathon this Sunday.    Redemption is for everyone and I hope this doesn’t tarnish her amazing accomplishments.\n\nThis news is so disheartening. I had been chatting with Camille thru IG messenger after she was diagnosed Autistic around the same time I was. I had responded to a story she posted and we just started talking about how much we like rocks. I didn’t know about her history of accusing others for cheating, but we had some pleasant exchanges via DM. This really breaks my heart because it shows that she is greatly suffering from mental illness which means that she likely isn’t loving herself and her insecurities are out of control. I hope that she resets, owns up to her mistakes, and gets the help she needs.\n\nCould just be the husband being a Jackass. I think we’re too quick to call her a “narcissistic” and low moral character when we don’t even really know it was her.  I have access to my wife’s email address because it automatically signs in when I log into the tablet.  I could see the husband being a d-bag and think what he’s doing is sneaky and clever… people are dicks\n\nYou probably need to scroll through some of the comments on all of the social media platforms to get a much better understanding of these two.  This Wiki thing is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWow this is amazing!\n\nFuck this bitch. Gross looking af.\n\nI have no problem with this thread sharing the og link. However, I do feel that calling her mentally ill is fair to her.\n\n\nIn my race in-person interactions with Camille, she does not seem to have a psychiatric pathology. She leans more towards a personality disorder, which all competitive runners need to be a tad bit narcissistic. \n\n\nHonestly. I think she is just playing her cards. At her age and lack of raw leg speed, she doesn't have many cards to play. Her sponsor, Lululemon, is mainly hiring heavy set big boned minority women to market their apparel. \n\n\nCamille is allowed to rant about whatever floats her boat. Not everyone has a desire to hear her mentruation lectures. I think her husband who is of irish decent, still holds the course record for the okc marathon. I could be wrong. \n\n\nGive them a break. They are an old, childless, progressive lefty couple living in a motor home. If they are getting some endorphins out of that life then so be it. \n\n\nIt takes a very special person to stand in the rain and cheer on woman for 48 hours running 10-12 minute miles. They obviously love each other, and their love us obviously not based on lust, but on authentic care for each other and common interest. \n\nShe and her husband are twats. Plain and simple.\n\nthis made me laugh\n\nSorry but why are you defending this behaviour? Why should we give them a break?\nIt is shitty behaviour. Doesn’t matter what their politics or living situation is, no idea why you brought that up. Being in love also doesn’t seem relevant?\nAlso your reference to lululemon and “hiring heavy set big boned minority women” is highly problematic.\n\nNo, you’re not allowed to be a shitty person and say “whatever floats your boat” and think there are no consequences. Camille is a 42 year old woman who consistently shits on other peoples’ accomplishments. Her time is up.\n\nWas she the ultrarunner who pooped all over the Paris ultrarunning course, right? Merde, merde, merde!\n\nExcept they still own a home in Oklahoma and are building a custom home in Tucson.\n\nThey definitely are privileged. Same with the Roches!\n\nWhat the actual fuck is this comment?\n\nShe was forced by authorities to leave the course and clean up because she kept running after filling her shorts.\n\nSomeone trace this IP\n\nConor is that you?\n\nThey're actually very hardcore Trumpers.\n\ntheir love is not based on lust LOL this comment is full of weird and funny lines\n\nYou can still be all those things and be a complete narcissist without going into Wikipedia to edit competitors bios.\n\nJD Vance is that you? It’s ok for a woman to not have children. It does not excuse this kind of behavior jfc "

    "all_comment_text": "Oof, that’s a heck of a route! Gorgeous, though. Congrats on completing your run!\n\n17.8 miles, 4485ft of elevation gain, 240ft of elevation loss. Every mile was up. Total time was 4:32. I did not run back down, my wife picked me up at the top. Mt Mitchell is the highest peak in the eastern US.\n\nEdit: 26.6km, 1367m of elevation gain, 73m of elevation loss\n\nI live in Asheville and have been training on the shut in for the table rock 50k.  From the French broad up to the top of mt pisgah is pretty similar. Probably more uphill and a lot more downhill though. I’ve been eyeing that for after a 50k coming up. That Mt Mitchel run looks great, gonna add it to the list. Thanks for posting!\n\nNice! I'm also training for the TR 50k. Tapering starts today, and I'm looking forward to it because my legs are cooked after the past few weeks.\n\nMy last long run was last weekend. Did a 22m loop up the shut in to beaverdam and back down into bent creek. It was supposed to be more elevation but I ran out of water and had to drop down off the ridge to filter more. I’m feeling a bit under trained for it but the cut off time is huge so I know I can finish. Good luck out there!\n\nI’ll be there too! Good luck, OP!\n\nI've done this climb a  few times, once as part of quest for the crest 50k. It truly does suck, despite the beauty of the mountains. Just brutal\n\nFuck yes man!!! This is awesome\n\nSuch a beautiful area. I've run a bit of the Mountain to Sea, I need to come do this.\n\nMore or less the first half of the “challenge” course from the Black Mountain Marathon held every February! The marathon turns around where the Parkway intersects the Old Mitchell Toll Road and the 40M “challenge” goes to the summit and back to town. Fantastic event.\n\nEdit: Though it looks like you may have gone up and over Graybeard?\n\nYep I went up Graybeard. I did the Black Mountain Marathon this year and I'm already signed up for next year. Not sure if I'll do the Challenge or not, it depends on how I feel when I get to the turnaround!\n\nWoof.  Hiked that from Montreat once and that's a hell of a climb.  Nice work on running it\n\nAye I thought this Reddit was mostly euro stuff! I’m in Knoxville, Tn and split time between the Smoky’s and Frozen Head. Nice to see some posts about familiar areas!\n\nKnoxville as well and I've been wanting to head over to Black Mountain/Pisgah area for some trail running and MTB.  like a 2 hour drive really not bad.\n\nMissing that area lately.\n\nDamn you are in shape\n\nAwesome!!! Do you have the GPX and care to share?\n\nAlmost looks like a game, crazy\n\nIs there now a maintained trail that connects the Seven Sisters area up past the parkway to the Crest?\n\nNah, I ran along the parkway and up the road to the state park before getting on the MST / Buncombe Horse Trail. It's maybe half a mile of road. There is a trail you can take, the Bald Ridge Knob Trail, but it goes down before going back up and I wanted to do all-up on this run.\n\nSo beautiful!\n\nNice splits.  Ive hiked briefly on sections of this trail.  PAIN\n\nBeautiful\n\nDamn - hell of a run. Nice work\n\nI’ve done this once. Great run/hike\n\nWhat does your water and fueling look like on runs like this? Do you carb load the night before?\n\nNo carb loading. I bring 2x 600ml soft flasks in my vest for water and a water filter (Katadyn BeFree). I stopped to filter water twice on this run. I put Tailwind (3 scoops) in one flask, plain water in the other. My fueling was Clif bars and fruit snacks, probably right on 300 calories per hour total.\n\nYou're a hero - that terrain is no joke! Inspiring!\n\n18 miles of WONDER\n\nGreat job! I did the Pitchell over Labor Day weekend and the terrain on that side is no f’n joke.\n\nCongrats on the Pitchell! I hope to do that soon. But yeah, the terrain is harder than the elevation for me. You just can't look away from the trail unless you stop. The concentration takes a ton of mental energy!\n\nJust ran this Saturday the Mountain to Sea trail from Brevard to Asheville! Beautiful area. Might do this trail this coming weekend."

I´ve been thinking about running with sheep spray. Has anyone else done this, and does it work?\n\nYou just run with some large shears.  Sure you might stab yourself but it's that or the fluffy sheep might get you.\n\nI've had something similar happen before. I had these three random dogs follow my brother and I on a mountain run once. They just ran up to us and put in 10 miles with us. I still wonder whatever happened to them. We named them Larry, Curly, and Moe. \n\n[Picture 1](https://i.imgur.com/3fs55dn.jpeg)\n\n[Picture 2](https://i.imgur.com/0ELdHoV.jpeg)\n\n[Picture 3](https://i.imgur.com/sRIL4k1.jpeg)\n\nI've had it happen twice for a dog to randomly join me in the forest and run along with me. One of them kept me company for 10 km, we came down from an altitude of 2300m to 1400m, I have no idea what he was doing so high up.\n\nIt makes for great memories for sure.\n\nHad this with a deer the followed me for a while.\n\nLife goals\n\nOne time on one of my long runs this was me with a random stray dog. I'm sure that dog ran with me for at least a few miles, to me I wasn't sure if the dog was dangerous so I would try to get him to go away but he was pretty resilient.\n\nThis running story keeps coming back to me.\n\n[Amy Marxkors](https://www.fleetfeet.com/s/stlouis/news/it-matters)\n\nThat would go down as my best run ever. Hands down.\n\nHoka SpeedSheep 100\n\nA think a couple Murakami books got combined here for this one.\n\nOn the bright side, the bells on the sheep make you feel like you're at the finish line of UTMB\n\nSo, this happened to me once with one dog, and I was trying to run around a lake, every time I stopped the dog stopped, and people were glaring at me, I had to keep saying \"it's not my dog, it's just following me!\"\n\nI had a stray following me like that this morning.\n\nI love this everytime i see it.\n\nI did something similar once, though the farmer (who has a bit of a reputation locally) had just herded them out of the field I was running towards.\n\nHe threatened to shoot me (this is the UK so not entirely common) and really didn't cheer up when I told him to sack the collie and hire me instead...\n\nThis happens to me with cows when I run on BLM land out west sometimes. I really try to avoid it but some cows just won't stop. 😂\n\nSomething similar but opposite happened to me once. Came across a group of 4-6 cows and a similar number of calves and they kept running away from me. Took about 0.5 mi before they found a spot to get off the trail (steep embankment on the side)\n\nA sheep rustler! LOL the face of the farmer when he gets up in the morning and see his entire flock gone overnight!\n\nMay be she is Jesus.\n\nAs someone who owns a flock of sheep, all it takes is one of them deciding that person is the shepherd for something like this to happen\n\nAmazing.\n\nAh, I see we finally found Commander Shepard.\n\nLol that would freak me out\n\nIt’s perfect.\n\nMaybe, she smells like weed ?\n\nMan somebody needs to replace her with an enormous trump figure and re-air this video"

The ziploc is in case the wipes get used…\n\nDegradable. I'm not sure you want to digest it anywhere.\n\nif it's warm maybe some water\n\nWater,phone and keys with an apple tag (wife likes to stalk me )\n\nIf you have an iPhone, the FindMy app means no AirTag needed. Although I’d imagine you still want keys etc… 🤷‍♀️\n\nWe are an iPhone and android couple...I know I know 😂😂\n\nThis, or bear spray if it’s not winter. \n\nUsually that’s the only thing in my pack. I don’t like wearing belts.\n\nThis\n\ncaption says OP is carrying a 1L water bladder\n\nyes, well done, you are correct!\n\nah I misread OP's post title, thought they were asking what ELSE people carry aside from what was listed\n\nAnything from nothing, to all the gear, clothes, food, first aid and locator beacons. The location decides, not the distance.\n\nThis. Yesterday i went out for 21km along the ocean bluffs - cool weather, familiar terrain, i knew it would be fairly busy, and there was potential for water and outhouse if needed. I carried my phone and a lara bar. \n\nToday, 15k up and down the ridge a few loops with less (zero) people, warmer, spotty cell service, and likely the same 2.5 hours or so duration. I will wear my vest with 500ml water, full set of snacks, small first aid, emergency blanket, phone, and a container in case the blackberries are ripe.\n\nLarabars are my go-to, too!\n\n500ml for 2.5 hours!?\n\n Very much location, weather, route dependent. \n\nMy baseline is on shaded northern california coast ridge trails closer to 2hrs. I ran yesterday with zero water because we had fog and i knew there was access to some if i needed. \n\nToday i needed all of what i carried (1 flask with tailwind) and then drank a bunch once i was done. \n\nIf i head over to lake sonoma, hotter and more sun exposure, i’ll go thru one flask (or more) every 30 minutes and likely run in cooler part of the day. \n\nIf i’m on a loop that ends home, i will risk being empty. For other trails, i may carry a water filter or extra litter.  For a race, i tend to carry two flasks (one leaded and one water) — and plan to not go dry between aid stations.\n\nI take water on long runs, and I being calories if I plan on running for more than 1.5 hours. Usually cookies or gummy bears.\n\ncrocs and a headless naked Barbie doll.  Just like everyone else\n\nNothing\n\nRaw dog gang\n\nYeah for a 13 miles run I will just bring my garmin and a house key. Nothing else needed.\n\nSame as me but car key rather than house. Keep it simple\n\nThis is the way.\n\nthats the goal of trail running, simplicity, its cool to be able to do things like that with just a pair of shoes. On the other hand, if you want to get the best from yourself, you should be keeping an eye on nutrition, and that is taking 200ml every 1.5h and some amounts of carbs aswell.\n\nIndependence vs performance.\n\nWater in my bladder and 500ml of isotonic drink. A gel for emergency. \n\nFurthermore: phone, cap, sunglasses, keys (in a leather pouch to make sure they don’t make a sound) leather pouch also contains a 50€ emergency fund for when cash is needed to get a cab or whatever.\n\nHaha this sounds much more like the amount the stuff I take. I don't find it too annoying and there's no way I can run for 2-3hrs without a decent drink and some sugar.\n\nNo one should be exercising 2-3 hours without taking in calories. You can do it, but you’re inhibiting your body from being able to recover well, and you’re actively preventing your body from effectively improving your performance. Fuel your body! :)\n\nFor a trail I will take this. For a 15k training run on roads I take only my flip belt with phone and keys :)\n\nI learned a tip about carrying keys about 10 years ago on this sub, I tie the keys with my shoelaces and place it flat against the shoe tongue under the laces.\n\nIt sounds strange at first, but it's actually really practical. They don't rattle, and they don't interfere with running whatsoever. One less pocket required. I've ran thousands of km this way and never had any issues.\n\nThat’s  a great hack. Read about it, never tried. Maybe I will.\n\nBodies are so different, some need more water or more calories, some need less or nothing at all. Take what works for you!\n\nIt depends. Anything under 2 hours probably no vest at all, maybe a softflask that I can tuck into my running belt or shorts.\n\nOver two hours I probably load up my vest with softflasks with water. It becomes a training tool at that point (train as you race). I only start bringing food if I expect to be out for three to four hours or more.\n\nI don't look at distance too much, I prefer to focus on time on my feet.\n\nSafety: phone, let somebody know when I expect to be back and first aid kit if I think it's wise\n\nGood point about time vs distance. I would take less time for a road half, and wouldn't be taking all this luggage.\n\n500ml bottle if it's hot and maybe a couple of jelly babies or something. I mean the answer can drastically change depending on the terrain (huge elevation Vs \"regular trails\")\n\nAside from water and some snacks, I always carry an emergency blanket because you never know. 😅 In England as well so I have a packable jacket. Also, I have a shopping bag in case I remember I need to buy something from a shop along the way home.\n\nShopping bag! How wonderful. I'm considering adding secateurs to my kit list, the brambles are like Triffids at the moment.\n\nTIL: secateurs, Triffids\n\nI’m glad to hear I’m not the only one carrying an emergency blanket 😂 it’s so light and can be used for so many things if needed\n\nMan it’s crazy to see how wildly different the answers are here. I’d bring my vest with 1.5 liter bladder, a few small snacks, phone/wallet/keys and a small wad of TP just in case. But 13 miles is a long run for me. People saying they’d bring nothing are kinda blowing my mind lol but it’s all relative I guess.\n\nMore food than a toddler eats in a day. Talking pancakes, apple sauce and biscuits.\n\nIt's basically a picnic but on the move\n\nCommunication if the route takes me somewhere remote, water if it's hot, and a very limited little first aid bundle.  Oh, also ID.\n\nIn the summer it’s hot and humid here, so usually 2 500ml soft flasks, one with skratch high sodium or tailwind. I might bring a gel or 2 if practicing nutrition. In the winter or fall, probably nothing or maybe a handheld with tailwind.\n\ndepends on the weather, the elevation, and the remoteness of the route. 13 trail miles could honestly take 2-5 hours depending on the difficulty.\n\n2 500ml water bottles and an emergency snack and a first aid kit\n\nAdd bug spray. Waterproof matches and an emergency blanket to your kit.\n\nDistance is not the relevant factor. 21 km close to civilisation down in the valley? Phone, small first aid set, Water depending on temperature, gels. Or 21km without cellphone reception on high alpine trails with a looot of vert, scrambling and maybe cold temperatures? Add a long shirt, rain jacket, beanie, gloves, space blanket, inreach, more to eat, sun screen. In the winter even more to wear plus spikes\n\nSnacks, poles, extra layer(s) depending on season, water filtration, 2x500ml flasks, inreach, cell, map, compass, headlamp, bivvy, first aid, multi tool, lighter, whistle, tp/poop shovel, battery pack, cannabis (some form).\n\nSounds excessive but I'm usually out in the white mountains, and I don't mess around out there.\n\nFor my 24k yesterday I had 2x water 500ml and 2x 500ml Electrolyte, Carb and Salt mix. 2 Gels and 2 Bars. Almost had a problem with hydration because it was 98% humidity where I ran.\n\nWater, salt tablets, one gel, toilet paper, phone, ID, keys and a longsleeved jacket if weather is like that(in a running backpack)\n\nWater for sure, my plb, a small first aid kit, my phone, keys, and sunglasses if I'm not already wearing them.\n\nEdit: hat and buff for bad bug situations.\n\nDepending on the heat - either one or two bottles of water, a gel or two and maybe a snack. Plus phone, wallet and keys.  I likely won't use a vest.\n\n2 500ml bottles, 3-4 kendal mint bars, suncream, waterproof, hat, this noise canister to keep any angry dogs away and my phone. Also poles if I'm doing ultra training\n\nNice photos. Whereabouts are you? \nFor a half marathon I’d have a litre of water/squash, some snacks, and loo paper in case of emergencies!\n\nDevon! I love exploring the footpaths here.\n\nI thought it looked like the south! I’ve lived in Dorset, Hampshire and Wiltshire so it kind of felt local!\n\nIt's that lovely flint that gives it away!\n\nI love the path in your last pic, I really want to run down there!\n\nUsually I bring my osprey enduro belt which has 2 x 500ml water bottle slots with 2 x side small pockets for gels snack etc and a mid large one for phone, and few other essentials or additional snacks. Usually on a 14 mile run I bring 1 x 500ml bottle with electrolytes, 1 x gel and a chai seed flapjack. \n\nI only tend to bring my vest when I’m doing something above 20miles with additional clothing, battery bank or if I’m planning to be out for longer than 4 hours.\n\nIf its above 80 degrees water with a nuun tablet\n\nDepends if it’s just extending your mileage or prepping for a full or half marathon\n\nThe former I’m carrying what I think I need, which is a litre or so and a gel for every 30 minutes, plus warm downs etc. (jelly bean reward whatever) \n\nthe latter I’m carrying what I need for the full after the first one to get back used to carrying that weight and extras plus any mandatory kit \n\n+phone, first aid kit, chamois cream.\n\n2L of water (mainly because I don’t drink enough water most days and feel like this is a good opportunity to drink more), a few gels, phone, some edibles or weed to smoke, and keys to my car.\n\nWater, 3 gels, one band aid, and my phone\n\n1 water 1 electrolyte and a few gels. That’s it. Have fun!\n\nSoft flask, TP, car keys, headphones, maybe dried mango / almonds / etc if it’s longer, maybe KT tape as well (10+mi)\n\n[removed]\n\nSounds much more simples!\n\nLooks like a nice trail to run! Where is this at?\n\nDevon, England. Very hilly but beautiful and never too far from the sea.\n\n500 ml with filter, 2 gels, phone.   Depends on how much elevation.  Time, location and elevation more  important.\n\nUsually nothing, I'll just down a litre of chocolate soya milk before.\n\nMy balls, LSD, and duct tape\n\nNo vest for me.  I use the 3L CamelBak Mule NV.  Standard load out is water, lip balm, knife, phone, wallet, small medkit, snack.  Usually 1.5L of water.  All training runs, regardless of distance.  Only in the last two years have I been using it for races.  For poor visibility and night excursions, I wear two headlamps, one mounted on the CamelBak's sternum strap and the other on my head, providing two independent light sources. Depending on season, I carry an extra layer.\n\nA fractured ankle in the woods in the middle of January has made me more cautious and now tend to over-prepare, regardless of event (which isn't necessarily a bad thing).\n\nI've considered going the vest route, but drinking from a tube is damn convenient.\n\nWhenever i go alone i take my vest, regardless of distance\n\nI do it regardless of distance to stay trained for having to use it on longer runs\n\nPeach rings. Honey packets. Water + electrolytes. Layer if going high and exposed.\n\nAll these people not bringing peach rings can I ask why?\n\nMy dog\n\nAw, I wanna take your dog on a run too!\n\nFeel free to roast him! He can’t do more than 50k so don’t get any crazy ideas\n\nHe deffo looks emotionally manipulative. He has the looks and the style and knows how to use them!\n\nHa! The complete opposite, he’s the definition of separation anxiety\n\nI see he has sucked you in.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/roastmypet/s/jMTPSOouQj\n\nElectrolytes if it’s really hot. Got that distance a handheld is enough unless it’s the middle of summer or there’s a lot of climbing. For that distance a I prefer one gel at the one hour mark\n\nWater because the vest makes me sweat so much and phone in case of emergency\n\nFor under 2 hours, no vest just a phone in shorts backpocket for pictures etc. If it's really hot or i'm far away from home/water tap then vest with one or two soft flasks in addition\n\nMaybe just a hand-held water bottle and a single gel.\n\nAlways in my vest: cell phone, mace, and dog treats. Gatorade if it’s humid.\n\n🌟💫\n\nMostly nothing, unless it's a hot day. I actually only take water or gels with me when I go beyond 20k\n\nChoice of water or food(gels) is more based on time than distance for me. \n\nUnder 90 minutes I don’t worry too much about anything, if it is warm maybe some water or electrolyte drink. \n\n90 - 120 minutes, maybe a gel or two and some water. \n\nOver 120 minutes, breakfast, gel or banana right before starting, gels every 45 minutes, water or electrolyte drink (I normally don’t eat breakfast before morning runs) \n\nYes,all that, &amp; someone said ID which is wise + I also keep a chapstick/lip balm  w/SPF\n\nFor 21k, I dont bring a vest. Not really worth it unless super warm. Maybe I bring a belt with a few gels and a 250/500ml soft bottle if its warm (25+ celsius)\n\n  \nWhen I bring a vest, I usually semi fill my two 500ml bottles, some gels, a credit card, and a small pack of tissues (for you know what), and maybe a rain jacket\n\nAt that distance, I'd carry nothing at all. If it were warm, I'd plan a route with a drinking fountain in the middle.\n\nNothing to carry on that distance.\n\nI wear a mtn bike backpack. I don't like vests. Almond butter and jelly sandwich and 2 bananas. $40 and some coins. Toilet wet wipes, 4 mini bladders (one liter total) with electrolytes. Mobile phone.\n\nbeautiful trails!!\n\nFor that course I’m packing some meat pies, ale in my flasks, and maybe some anti-Nazgûl spray with extra time for second Breakfast.\n\n\nIn seriousness that looks like a glorious place to run. For 13 miles I bring 2 water flasks and a small bag of almonds and sour patch kids\n\nWhat’s the elevation? Most likely wouldn’t take a vest. Just a single key in the pocket and the Garmin on my arm.\n\n 1l of water, food (candy), keys, phone, headphones, sunglasses, extra top layer \\[ideally waterproof\\] (got caught in the mountains one too many times not to)\n\nNothing, just my shorts, shoes, and a watch.\n\nNo socks?\n\nSocks are for the weak!\n\na pistol\n\n[removed]\n\nI prefer a machete, looks fierce and can also create new trails as I go.\n\nI carry some nuts in a small baggie, one energy gel, 2x500ml soft bottles filled with water, phone, debit card/transit card, one big bandaid and one small bandaid, 1 alcohol wipe\n\n250ml water in my small soft flask in my hand, no vest\n\nI don’t bring anything on runs of this length, unless particularly hot out, then .5L of water. It’s been my experience The more stuff you bring the slower you go. Start out by being fueled and hydrated and that should get you 2.5 hours of playtime.\n\nNo vest needed for that kind of distance\n\nA bottle of water\n\nUsually when don’t take anything, not even a vest. But if it’s really hot then I might bring some water\n\n2 small (225ml) soft flasks of isotonic sport dink, if it's hot an extra soft flask with water in my vest, and an isotonic gel for emergencies.\n\nUsually just some water. If it’s not really hot I just go shirtless with nothing\n\nI'll drink water before and I take some toilet paper with me. That's it.\n\nWater bladder, TP, wet TP, Keys, phone, ID, sugary snack, salty snack, head lamp, rain layer/warm layer, \nconsidering bear spray because i have no Idea how i would handle a wolf\n\nFor this distance, I generally take 2 hand held bottles - no vest or pack, unless it's scorching hot. It's right at the distance where it would be a toss up for me to take a pack with more water and a  bar. The determination would be if it was my first time on that trial, or a trail I knew well. If I didn't know the trail or didn't know the weather, I'd take a bit extra water, a bar, and maybe a dry long sleeve base layer for the downhill.\n\nRehydration tablets, 5 ltrs of water. Chocolate bars.\n\nFor half marathons I bring nothing. This would change if I went above 8k elevation or so.\n\nSome water and my phone. I don’t like carrying too much.\n\n2 flasks (1 water 1 electrolytes and carbs) Pepper spray, snacks (not gels if trail), mini first aid kit, mini bathroom kit (dude wipe, dog poop bag, ziplock bag, hand wipe), phone\n\nThat’s a 3 liter day\n\nall kinds of good shit\n\nWhere is this u/badgerhoneyy?\n\nIt looks…South of England-y. \n\nI bet I’m wrong.\n\nWhat vest. Water bottle summer, nothing fall, winter,spring.\n\nI usually bring water and, if it's cold, the light jacket I started my run wearing.\n\nshorts, socks and shoes (optional)\n\nThis distance? I wouldn't wear a vest unless it's going to be hot hot and unsupported. But I'd carry A Nathan hand water bottle with phone.\n\nPretty much always being my Katadyn\n\nWater, phone, and a gel or 2 incase I need any. Always have my orange space blanket in my vest. If it’s a lot of vert then my poles.  Anytime there is possibility of dark then my light. \n\nI’ll have to remember the dude wipe in a bag though. Had some close calls before.\n\nProbably a handheld and a gu.   If it's super hot and there's no water sources, a second handheld.\n\nWater and 2 gels\n\nWater and 2 or 3 energy gels\n\nA knife and a sweat towel!\n\nTail wind, water, and some trail mix.\n\nI always have a couple Joy Ranchers as a back up bonk cure too.\n\nLooks like a fun run.\n\nIf i do 13 in the mountains, i bring 2L of water and 2-300g of carbs and eat 100g on the ride there.  13 with 4-6k of vert at elevation can take 3+ hours for most.  Trust me i learned the hard way on that.  I need much more fuel above treeline.\n\nWater w/ nutrition, emergency gels, car key, phone, head torch, mini first aid kit, and biodegradable wet wipes.\n\nI haven't got myself up to 21km yet but I'd be taking at least 1.5L of water, probably 1 with Tailwind, some gummies/snacks, and my emergency kit (super small in a 1L freezer bag with a blanket, headlamp, tiny FAK, emergency Gu, TP, couple salt pills).\n\nAnd bear spray, I've had enough encounters already this year.\n\nWater, a bar, salt tablets\n\nI do a bottle of Tailwinds a half hour. so 13 miles is probably 4 - 5 bottles. (2.5 hours?.. terrain dependant) If i know where water fountains are... i time accordingly and use [effectively] pill bottles to hold a scoop and a half of Tailwind to mix.. then I only carry two chest bottles.\n\nsweat rag, 2 sets of 3 sheets of TP (might have two poos), bear spray (depending on location), Phone (which is a wallet so 2 credit cards)...\n\nwater, phone, tissues, headlamp if likely to go past sunset, light jacket if likely to get cold - that's it\n\nWater phone keys sig365 wallet\n\nI did 16M in 2:56:51 with 1,678’ of elevation today. I had two liters of water, two 500ml flasks of Gatorade, a PB&amp;J, three gels, a Clif bar, and a roll of TP. Keys, knife, wallet, chapstick, and sanitizer as well.\n\nTP in a baggie to carry out if you poop\nA bite of real food if the gel isn't sitting right\nMini packet of antichafe and sun screen\nWhistle on vest\nMaybe a baby power charger if you're keeping your phone on\n\nIf that run includes significant climbs, i sometimes add a snack more substantial that gels. \n\nIf no steep vert, i leave poles at home. \n\nIf the weather risks changing or if there’s a lot of sun, I carry a light long sleeve. \n\nAlso, always a little tube of sunscreen if it’s sunny. I burn easily. For races I sometimes squeeze a bit of 70+ spf into an empty lip balm tube.\n\nI pack a PB&amp;J. At the halfway point I pause my watch, eat it, enjoy nature. Then I finish the run.\n\nWater, phone, and some basic first aid that's always in my pack in case I take a tumble. I learned back in the day to have some Hydrogen peroxide to clean the rash, and some basic ointment and bandaids. That's about it, though.\n\nnothing. No vest, keys in wheel well. Phone in pocket.\n\nAll of the above + my 40 caliber and TP\n\nWater and candy corn\n\nVest is for losers\n\nIf its really hot, a soft flask with 500ml water. That's it.\n\nSame as I would for the race I’m training for\n\nIn any case....beautiful scenario for a running. May I ask where this place is? I would say Europe 😄\n\nLooks beautiful, enjoy!\n\nNo vest for this distance.  Carry maybe ½ L of water and some Jelly babies and some sort of choccy bar in a pocket.\n\n13 miles? That's basically the top end of my carry nothing but my phone distance and maybe some water depending on temp and location. Usually 15+ is when I start carrying extra stuff.\n\nsalt pills, Motrin, a packet or two of mustard for cramps, Pepper spray, and a taser\n\nYou’re overpacking. Way too much water\n\nUsually just water for that distance. I don’t find it necessary to eat unless it’s farther than 13 miles. Eat afterwards, pack a sandwich or whatever you refuel with.\n\nDepends, but from the looks of your photos I wouldn't wear a vest. Two handhelds (one water, one electrolytes), a bar or two (Lara), car key, maybe phone. If super hot and/or exposed, might ditch the handhelds and throw on the vest (w/added sunblock) just to carry more water. And I like to throw a small Buff around my wrist to wipe sweat.\n\nmaybe only a bottle of water\n\nFor 13 miles, nothing really. I would wear a small waist belt if I was going to bring water and maybe a gel or two. If it's flat, you would get through it without much support.\n\nI just take half liter of water and phone. Where I run I have a few fresh water sources along the way and some wild fruits for energy if I feel I need it.\n\nJust enough water to get around in the summer, no gels needed for a short run.\n\nOne bottle of water. That’s it.\n\n500ml water if hot outside. Otherwise nothing is needed for a half marathon.\n\n13m training run? I don’t wear a vest. It’s less than 120 min. You need nothing"

Didn’t know there was a Green Mountain out there. “Green Mountain run” to me means the Green Mountains in VT. I was like…that sure doesn’t look like VT\n\nI was squinting at the photos in disbelief that this was Vermont lol\n\nI'm glad somebody said it\n\nI think there’s a green mountain in every state that has hills\n\nThere’s mountains called Green Mountain everywhere. There’s at least 2 in the CO Front Range, within a 30 minute drive of one another\n\nThat may be true, but the green mountains are in Vermont\n\nThere are three.\n\nWhere is the third? I know of Lakewood and Boulder\n\nIt's much more rural, near Bailey. You can find it at 39.3068414, -105.3065349 in Google Maps. There is a Green Mountain Ranch, Green Mountain Creek, and Green Mountain Campground there.\n\nYou could probably climb all three Green Mountains in a day if you started early!\n\nI live near the Lakewood one.\n\nI can see my house from there.\n\nI’ll run over for dinner next time\n\nHowdy, neighbors!\n\nGreen Mountain rocks. Box O’ Rocks is my favorite segment. I’ll tie it into Summit Loop. Solid.\n\nthanks for sharing, stunning scenery\n\nFelt real happy to live here running last night\n\nI was the local legend on the fire road for a bit last year leading up to Leadville. Weekly 3-4 1-mile climbs with \\~700' of gain each time up.\n\nSuch a great park to run at. Watch out for snakes!\n\nWhen do the snakes brumate and gtfo? Just moved to the area and this would be a super convenient place to run in the mornings.\n\nThis is my neighborhood trail and I run it all the time! Nice representing, OP!\n\nUsed to live in Denver and this gave me very much nostalgia!\n\nLook at that sky...\n\nI love it. I'm stuck in the Midwest, with tiny little hills, so I live vicariously through posts like this.\n\nNot our best trailing in the area but I do love workouts on that fire road!\n\nI like this\n\nIt's beautiful\n\nVisiting Boulder next week.. what trail is this ? Trailhead? Planning 3 days of hiking and trail runs\n\nIt’s in Golden, Green Mountain summit trail. You’ve got plenty to run around boulder tho\n\nIt's in Lakewood.  Lakewood Parks allows you to run after dark so it's a good spot for winter post-work miles.  Jeffco trails in Golden does not allow night runs.\n\nThis is gorgeous. You are lucky!\n\nVery\n\nThanks for the stats, bro.\n\nWelcome, bro."

The variety allows me to open up my stride on the downhill while really getting my dancing shoes going on the steep tech.

    "all_comment_text": "My favourites are single tracks that go steadily uphill forever and ridge lines, nothing beats those two for me!\n\nLove a ridgeline with views!\n\nIf you're ever in the Bay Area, drive 15 min north of San Francisco and you'll be in Marin Headlands. Miles and Miles and Miles of technical, fire road, Sequoia trees, ocean views galore. Infrequent if ever horses and bikers. No cars. You will love it!!\n\nLove the Marin Headlands. Absolutely stunning area.\n\nI live in the San Juan islands and have never found a place more beautiful until I went to Marin.\n\nAny trail reccos? I'll be in the area! the further out from the city the better, imo, but I'm open!\n\n#1. Steep Ravine Trail\nStart: Stinson Beach\nDistance: 4 mi out and back\nDifficulty: Medium to hard\nNotes: Fun trail and you can have lunch at where you park.\n\nhttps://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/steep-ravine-trail--2\n\n\n#2.  Tennessee Valley Golden Gate Loop Trail\nStart: Tennesse Valley parking area (lots of parking and bathroom)\nDistance: 5.7 mi loop\nDifficulty: Moderate\nNotes:  Beautiful ocean views along the loop\n\nhttps://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/tennessee-valley-golden-gate-loop-trail\n\n\n#3. Muir Beach trails\n\nThere's so many to list here.  You may want to go to alltrails.com and search for \"Muir Beach\" and see what works for you.\n\nFrom Muir Beach, you can go north towards Mt. Tam for a good hike/run/workout, or go South towards Tennessee Valley for Ocean views.\n\n\n\n#4. Mt. Tam\n\nAgain, lots of trails to pick from.  Go to Alltrails.com and search for \"Mt. Tam\" and see what works for you.\n\nMt. Tam offers cooler running, runs through the wood, rocks and roots to avoid, places to refill water at the top and awesome views and more tranquil running.  You'll run into fellow hikers/runners occasionally, so you won't feel all alone.\n\nIf there were folks from out of town visiting, I would definitely take them to #1 and #2.\n\nLet me know if you're looking to hike or run and the distance, and what you're looking to discover and I can give feedback.\n\nAlso, I would recommend you download the \"Alltrails\" app, and download the map.  Just in case you get poor cellular coverage out in the wilderness.\n\nYou're awesome, thank you! I see a potentially fun day of running steep ravine or tennessee valley and then heading to Tomales bay to grab some oysters and sit on the beach :)\n\nSaved because steepish trail running and oysters describes my best day ever (see also: oyster dome -&gt; Taylor Shellfish in Bellingham)\n\nHell yeah. Any other seafood spots near Seattle (south of Seattle or near rainier / Olympic) you would reccomend?\n\nSeattle: Taylor Shellfish (they have 2 bars in the city), Walrus and the Carpenter, many others \n\nOlympia: Chelsea Farms \n\nHard to beat the total experience of going to the main Taylor Shellfish location outside Bellingham and eating Olympias, Shigokus, and Totten Virginicas right next to an oyster reef. And the proximity to a nice verty 6-miler is a major bonus.\n\nAnd if you're looking for a place to have a good breakfast/lunch, I would recommend \"MH Bread and Butter\".  It's in San Anselmo, off of Highway 101.  I know the baker/owner and they're ultra-distance runners and have a background in French baking.  The food is really good.  There are lots of tables outside for bikers/runners that come after their excursions.  The price is between $10-$20, but it's delicious and different from Starbucks or local breakfast places.  The hours are 8am-3pm.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/zjyRZwXpSdBfxKrh7\n\nFavorite trails to run: Yes.\n\nMy answer! A combination of all these *chefs kiss*\n\nAs long as it's not shared with horses or cars I'm pretty happy. \n\nor dirt bikes, or down hill bikes, or people with selfie sticks\n\nOr baby strollers for triplets. I’ve been on a trail near my house numerous times with a dumb lady that had her 3 seat baby stroller with kids in tow and struggling to get it down a single track. I personally seen her 3 times.\n\nOH THE STROLLER KARENS!!!!!!! not the pleasant ones either, like to no kidding full on BITCH LEVEL move I'm pushing a stroller....the trail is for everyone...but not for E V E R Y O N E\n\nAnything with lots of forest, mist or drizzle and cool air, preferably with some elevation changes up and down but nothing crazy and with some kind of water nearby. \n\nI like old fire road type trails too, again if in forest the better. \n\nReally it depends on my mood though. Open fields and flowers or flat stretches can be just what I want sometimes, it just depends. Yesterday I felt horrible for forgetting my camera, there were beautiful fields of wildflowers that I would have liked to share with someone.\n\nYou're basically describing the Marin headlands 15 minutes north of San Francisco. There are miles of fire trails and technical trails. Cool weather and ocean views. All levels of difficulty\n\nSecond forest, mist, drizzle, cool air.  I hate being too hot on a run.\n\nSounds a lot like the Superior Hiking Trail in northern MN\n\nA fellow Seattle trail runner! Nice! \n\nPratt Lake is one of my favorites to run. Anything with a lake that I can jump into *adds to favorite on all trails*\n\nHow we doing, Seattlites!\n\nI've never actually gone all the way to Pratt Lake. Typically head up Granite or make a loop out to Mason Lake and down Mason Creek. Definitely need to get out there soon. As someone who hates cold water, jumping in the lakes is tough for me. haha\n\nA great route near there is to start at the granite mountain trailhead, go to Pratt lake, then continue on to malakwa and down to the Denny creek trailhead.   Then it’s a 3 mile jog on a fs road to get back to the granite lake trailhead.  Roughly 16 miles total.\n\nThat’s a classic. This is the route if anyone’s interested: \n\nPratt Lake, Melakwa Lake, and Denny Creek Trail Loop on AllTrails\nhttps://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/pratt-lake-trail-to-melakwa-lake-trail-to-loop?sh=md9qb5\n\nLove it! I'm taking some scouts to Melakwa next weekend. May take a quick run in the morning before they get up.\n\nIf you ever need a longer route that’s got a steady grade, I suggest Mount Defiance trail looped with starvation ridge! Views are insane and minor scrambling. Your legs shall burn. You can bomb the entire thing downhill!\n\nAdding to vacation next year, thank you for sharing.\n\nIt’s worth the trek! Happy to share. If you can do it before it’s too hot, it’ll feel good to swim. When I went, there was a nice inversion and the peaks were popping out of the clouds. So beautiful!\n\nI then camped in hood river, it’s just west of there.\n\nI usually head up Putrid Pete then take the ridge east to Defiance and down to the Mason Creek trail to Ira Spring and down to Exit 42. One of my favorite loops. The run from Defiance down to Mason Lake is a blast.\n\nDon't know Starvation Ridge. Will need to look it up.\n\nI love those trails especially on the downhill.\n\nIt’s down further south in Oregon! I was thinking of a different Mount Defiance 🙃 oops \n\nI’ll check out your loop! Sounds fun.\n\nI have a single track trail 2 minutes from my house that gets pretty rooted and rocky and wouldn’t be a great trail for most people. But since it’s my every day go to and I used to hike it for years before that, it’s a complete flow trail for me. Im pretty sure my feet land in the same place on 90% of the trail\n\nI like the variety honestly, sometimes its nice to quick step through rock fields, takes me back to high school football ladder and footwork drills. Of course its great to fly on a downhill with a clear trail in front along a ridge with a view haha.\n\nPhoto 4 is amazing, love how the trail seems to disappear in the sunny tree\n\nThat's what it is, thanks! Had a hard time understanding what I'm seeing\n\ni thought i was looking into the gates of hell or something. a tree makes way more sense! either way, gorgeous picture.\n\nThe type that I can run. Therefore of your photos 1&amp;4.\n\n+1\n\nThe trails 0.5 miles from my front door. Can put together a quick 3.5 750 foot loop or a much longer 10 mile 2k out and back. But I will take a soul crushing Mt. Tam hill climb any day of the week :)\n\nAn entirely uphill trail with a ravine of sandstone and overgrown manzanita. I cannot run it but it is a struggle bus. Then a nice redwood lined singletrack descent.\n\nTough to beat proximity. I have some reasonably close, but much flatter than I enjoy. I typically have to drive 15-30 minutes to get the my favorite trails. Still not too bad.\n\nSpider webs so I know I’m on a virgin run!\n\nThe I90 corridor really is unparalleled!\n\nHonestly it is tough to beat. So many great options. I'm usually out early to miss the crowds that come later in the day.\n\nIf you get there early enough you get to find all the spider webs.\n\nHaha. I got them on the way up today. Even got some more on the way down. Those spiders work fast!\n\nSaw the photo without reading the post and could've sworn it was Tiger mt. Looks like I wasn't too far off! Going to have to get around to doing Si soon\n\nDo it! It's a great trail. New trail is more \"run\" friendly, but way more crowded.\n\n4 is every trail run in Wisconsin. Rolling woods and hills with rocks that pop into existence from another dimension right where your foot is mid kick. Over and over and over.\n\nEmpty ones.\n\nThank you for saying it\n\nI recognized this immediately. Great trail.\n\nGod that reminds me of the Mazama trail out in Oregon.\n\nMan I miss hiking the shit out of the Cascades\n\nSide hill.\n\nHell yes, steep drop off to one side.\n\nI'm a really big fan of open trails above the treeline, but those are pretty few and far between near Seattle and snowed under for the vast majority of the year. That runnable single track in photos 1 and 4 is nice too, especially if it leads somewhere with a view. \n\nMy embarrassing opinion is that I'm just kind of over the really wet forest stuff. I have a spot I go to every year that starts with 6 miles of flattish trail through some of the only untouched old-growth I've ever come across. It just drives me insane and I can't wait until I climb out from it and get to the views.\n\nYou’re not alone. My favorites are ridge lines and wide open meadows. Give me sunshine, give me roots, give me rocks that have a grudge against runners. \n\nAny favorites?\n\nI’m partial to hurricane ridge, sourdough ridge, Lillian ridge, grand park… and always looking for more.\n\nFor close ridge lines, the web-&gt;defiance ridgeline is really beautiful and close to Seattle.  Web can be accessed via a brief bushwhack then boulderfield climb from the Dirty Harry trail.   I’ve also done a loop from mailbox traversing the mailbox -&gt; dirty Harry’s -&gt; web -&gt; defiance -&gt; Thomson lake -&gt; mailbox.  That route has a lot of ridges, but the first part from mailbox to dirty Harry’s is a bit adventurous.  \n\nFor alpine meadows, I’ve always thought the pct past Kendall Katwalk is close to Seattle and incredibly beautiful.\n\nAh I miss those. I’m on the Olympics side now, but when I lived closer Kendall was one of my favorites. Kautz creek to mirror lakes is another good one, great views, well so long as you run faster than the cloud of hungry mosquitos.\n\nThat looks nice. I’ll have to check that out next time I get out to Mount rainier\n\nOregon trails.\n\nRidgelines with great view, downhill, climbs too steep to run, technical trails, overgrown trails with branches hitting my face, long flat easy trail in open areas, wet and muddy forest trails.. What's not to love? 😄\nLoooong steep and technically challenging downhills kill my feet and bring some hate sometimes since I'm in the mountains way too seldom, otherwise it's mostly pure joy no matter what 🙂\n\nwas gold creek/eagle mountain in Bremerton-----\n\n  \nNow Hakone near MT Fuji---really anything where I can claw at dirt, no cars, and running with my dog!\n\nMountain trails! Mt. Baldy…Wilson…San Jacinto near LA and stuff\n\nOr a national park trail on vacation for some fun\n\nOh heck yes, San Jac via Marion Mountain\n\nYeah san Jac is numero uno for sure - prettiest view ever. I've done deer springs once 🥵\n\nThat mountain truly has it all:\n\n1. Easy fun: tram\n2. Steep and gorgeous: Marion Mountain\n3. Mileage: Deer Springs, Fuller Ridge\n4. Sufferfest: Cactus to Clouds\n5. Mega-sufferfest: Leatherneck Ridge\n6. YER GUNNA DIE: Snow Creek\n\n(Have done #2 and 4, want to collect them all—well maybe not snow creek…)\n\nOoooh I attempted cactus to clouds once and had to turn back - that’s truly an amazing hike. Sooooo cool. The way you just get to look up at all the ridges you’re ascending is so amazing\n\nBut yeah, it’s truly an amazing mountain. Muir said it’s the best view in SoCal. I think on clear days you can see the base of the sierras? I can at least see some from Gorgonio so I assume Jacinta would be similar\n\nThe overnight campgrounds there are something I really want to try sometime\n\nSeeing a desert sunrise from rescue box #2 was pretty amazing. The views from that ridge are incredible. The campgrounds look great but I’ve heard reservations can be tough. It would be really cool to stay in Little Round Valley.\n\nAnother route I’ve had my eye on is the San Jacinto traverse—starting in Palm Springs and ending in Idyllwild. \n\nThose trails look great. I don't crave a ton of climbing, but I'm not opposed to some for a good view.\n\nCan you share this route?? It looks amazing, and I’m not too far from Mt Si. I have been looking for some great, new trails to run for a while now.\n\nHere you go. Way less crowded than the standard Mt. Si route.\n\nhttps://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-si-old-trail\n\nThank you!!!!\n\nWestern Washington, Kendall Katwalk, Sahale Arm, Lake Ingalls, Bandera/Mason lake, Ptarmigan ridge, Burroughs, all amazing runs. And Middle Fork for the gloomy or no vert days\n\nYeah, all those are classics. I try to do each at least once a year.\n\nMy bed\n\nSingletrack of any kind within the trees. A short exposed ridge line is fine but I prefer trees.\n\nSingle track, a mix of smooth sections where it feel like you're floating and rocky sections where if you eat it you better contort your body in a way that you only slam on the gaps between the rocks. The elevation sections are somewhere around 500ft gain per mile, but there's a nice amount of flats to stretch things out. The end is a tough climb up to a ridge line where you follow that to the peak. I spend more time than most runners at the peak, putting everything else in my life aside to simply enjoy this rare view over a vast mountain range.\n\n1st and 4th. Never ran a No 3.\n\nShaded\n\nYes\n\nPhoto 3 is a trail?!?!\n\nNo, it's the view from the top. All the pics are from the same trail this morning.\n\nI like dirt, or gravel, don't mind vert but not a fan of technical.  \n\nI ran on one today that had so many rocks and roots on the edge of a cliff I was basically hiking most of it.  I am too old to have multiple falls on jagged rocks.\n\nThey all look like #2 around here so it doesn't really matter what I prefer.\n\nThis kind. Those photos. That is heaven.\n\nWhat’s going on with the 4th, the end of the trail has 2 perfect vertical edges running parallel to each other, almost looks photoshopped\n\nI think it’s actually a tree trunk illuminated in the sun, agree it appears odd.\n\nOh yeah on a second glance I see what you mean 😂…. Silly me\n\nAnd mine are actually coastal paths.\n\nYes\n\nAll of them.\n\nI love them all. Uphill, downhill, straight and flat, ridgeline views. The Forrest trail runs are the best in my opinion though\n\nLiving around the St. Louis area. We don’t have much choice.. most to all of it is rocky, rooty, hilly goodness. Some, very little is smooth buffed out trail(flowy goodness). I’m only slightly jealous\n\nMy brother trained for western states while stationed in St. Louis!\n\nNice wide fire roads are my speed. But I’ll take anything made of dirt.\n\nI like desert single track. That dusty sand and rocks mix with desert environment around dawn is so satisfying to run and moving in that environment just seems the most pleasurable. Cool and dry and beautiful\n\nAnything I can get to quickly from my house here in western PA. Lots of single track, hills, trees for  shade and streams. But really literally any trail is fine.\n\nAll of these! Even better if they are free from mountain bikes trying to take me out lol\n\nI am probably in the minority, i like a nice ski area access road, basically wide and up\n\nRidge lines babyyyy\n\nI prefer to be tucked into the trees. Exposure is a nasty mistress and she’ll get you in trouble quick!\n\nThe answer is yes, all the above 🫡\n\nThat one.\n\nAll of the above\n\nLast picture had me looking at a portal into another world\n\nColorado here.Loved runing around garden of the gods trails.Whatever seemed fit.\n\nTechnical and rooty\n\nFound the Beast Coaster \n\nThe who??\n\nEmpty and clean with a view.\n\nPictures #1 &amp; #4\n\nThose beautiful trails where you don’t see another soul out there and you can’t help but feel the calmness of the solitude you’ve found mixed with the natural beauty of the terrain.\n\nSoft mud. Not a fan of going through boulders and small rocks \n\nSteep steep trails with a wide path"

May be fun if you sit down for the first hour and let the crowd clear?\n\nSeriously… or book it straight out the gate\n\nYes - that's a good plan.\n\nI particularly like the jagged rocks hidden in tall grass.\n\nClouds or crowds?\n\nOP stopping on a narrow track to take photos surely cant help matters\n\nHa!\n\nEverest vibes\n\nOn yer left!\n\nWas this super early in the race?\n\nThat's what I'm hoping lol\n\nHad this at the beginning of a 33 km race. They had the terrible idea to include a track with stairs going up idk, 400 - 600 m, right at the beginning (I'm talking first 2 km). Once that was cleared though the crowd thinned out and it was a super fun race!\n\nYes, it’s a very technical race. At the start, there’s an ascent of +700 meters in the first 6.5 km. Add to that the adverse conditions of fog, wind, and cold at the mountain ridge (around this time of year, it’s approximately 35°C), which made things a bit tricky. But honestly, with that incline, nobody can run, so the single file is almost a relief.\n\nI’ve seen many ill-intentioned comments, likely from people watching Netflix while others run (not your case). But honestly, it’s a very technical and beautiful race. I finished with a pace of 10:35, so it was definitely runnable.\n\n&gt;I’ve seen many ill-intentioned comments, likely from people watching Netflix while others run \n\nlol what kind of comment is this?? Nobody likes a face to butt conga line\n\nYep tons of ill-intentioned couch potatoes in the trail running specific sub. Are you still at altitude?\n\nUmmm 35 Celsius is like  really warm.\n\nEven 35 Fahrenheit is a good temp to run a race in.\n\nTy for reaffirming my thoughts towards races. Always too crowded for me!\n\nOnly reason for me to ever join a race is to be able to cover longer distances, say 50km+, without having to carry all my supplies over the entire distance. Especially water…\n\nI just have 2 small flasks and manage my water or take a filter if I’m going remote. Each to their own\n\nI run usually in the Swiss Jura mountains. Due to the limestone, there is hardly any water there. Everything just disappears. We have no lakes in the mountains, no real streams. We have to kind of dip down deep into the valleys to filter our water. Sometimes I wanna just stay up high on the ridge for many many kilometres and then I have to bring the water with me…\n\nDamn that sounds like a dream but also sounds hard to manage water! So fair on your justification 👌\n\n99% of races are nothing like this.\n\n30 steps?\n\nRunning or walking slowly?\n\nHey… This is for trail running. Go find the trail conga line sub.\n\nCongratulations for your 30K!\n\n  \nBut that's not organized by UTMB. The only race in Argentina that is part of UTMB World is Valholl, which happened in May at Villa General Belgrano, Cordoba.\n\nThat picture is from a race called \"Xtreme Race\" (https://xtremerace.com.ar/). It seems like a really good races, and gives a valid UTMB Index.\n\nThanks my friend!!. I really don't know how utmb works (I'm not too interested honestly) it was just a color information from the post\n\nUTMB? No seas fantasma 👻\n\nUhmm, I believe the UTMB behemoth bought many races across the planet…\n\nYeah, but that one isn’t one of them\n\nAh sorry! Good for them!\n\nGood on you!  Remember with trails, it's not only the distance - but the vertical.  It's looks like an excellent time to embrace the moment.  Wish I could have joined in the fun!!\n\nVery cool pic with the clouds descending and the line of participants.  I hope you crushed it.\n\nAre they all walking to the starting line for the race?\n\nThat line is a lot longer than 30. Whose 30 were the next people, and what did you do with them?\n\nI love the terrain! Looks great. I do, however, prefer races that start with at least a few kilometres of wide trail to allow for the crowd to spread out before running the narrow sections.\n\nHimalayas style"

I shall get this for my next audio book.\n\nI’d recommend finding a sample first, I really enjoyed the book but absolutely could not stand the audio narration, I found it super distracting.\n\nAgreed! I’ve read it back in 2019, and when I tried to listen to it a couple of years later, I just couldn’t do it, and I’m really into audiobooks!\n\nMay I ask why you fely that way? Was it just a poor narrator?\n\nI wouldn’t say objectively bad, just not to my taste. I found myself listening more to her voice than the text, if that makes sense. \n\nI’ve read some reviews that the narration was really divisive, so maybe it’s like cilantro, you love it or hate it.\n\nI loved this book.  A total random pickup on audible and made me feel things haha.\n\nFelt so many things. I have yet to cry to another book but damn did I cry every chapter of the over story from either tragic loss or exuberant joy\n\nIt's tough to see a clearcut forest. I was raised on 40 acres of mostly forest. My mom inherited it and it was connected to another 120 acres of forest. I used to run around in that forest all the time and the trees just made this nice shade to hang out, build forts or whatever we wanted to do as kids. After my family moved off the land my uncle sold his piece and I came back a few years later. The guy who bought it clear cut the side next to my mom's and all of the big beautiful trees along the main path were gone. It was like a friend had died. I cried but most people don't quite understand why. It was just this whole setting and ecosystem just gone. Worse than seeing your childhood home torn down because it was more as if the land itself was just ripped up and mutilated so much you couldn't recognize what it once was or the life that was there in the canopy of the trees, ferns and other plants. I don't think environmentalism or preserving the ecosystem meant that much to me until I saw that. I understand the cutting of trees needs to be done occasionally to prevent fire but this was just utter devastation. They didn't leave a single tree and the ground was just dirt with tracks up and down.\n\nI know that feeling. I also grew up in the forest, on a small piece of land backed up to thousands of acres of public Forest Service land. We grew up doing whatever we wanted in those woods and I have so many good memories. A few years ago a major wildfire destroyed most of it. When I went back and saw it for the first time after the fire I completely broke down. Like you said it’s like losing an old friend. It still hurts\n\nMan, this hit me in my childhood soul. I have an eerily similar upbringing and I did a little inside every time I see forests, woods, and farmland torn up for roads, houses, and Lord knows what else.\n\n&gt;I understand the cutting of trees needs to be done occasionally to prevent fire but this was just utter devastation.\n\nFIY, many times clear cutting is done for the benefit of native species. \n\n[Clearcutting is used as a method of regenerating or rejuvenating certain kinds of trees that cannot tolerate shade.  It is also used when a forest type conversion is planned, often from low quality hardwoods to pine, on sites best for pines.](https://mff.forest.mtu.edu/Curriculum/SupportDocs/Clearcutting.htm)\n\nThis was old growth forest. There were western hemlock trees. It was for money and selfishness from the guy who bought the land not forest regeneration. It was also not one of the few species appropriate situations mentioned in your link where you clear out pioneer species to help some of the others grow.\n\nWhere did you get your Forestry Degree? \n\nAlso, is there was a stand of western Hemlock near a rail track it is not old growth, possibly 2nd growth, but likely 3rd or 4th already.... SMH\n\nNear a rail track? Are you replying to someone else? Who said anything about a rail track. Western Hemlock can live up to five hundred years old and these were very large old trees. Go bully someone else about a lost forest for kicks with non applicable situations. Yours really don't apply.\n\nThey definitely were. It was some other poster in this thread he was trolling.\n\n\\*IF\\* people lived near that tract of land there is a near zero chance that it was old growth, to you, sure, it was older than you. In the US, only 7% of Old Growth Forest Remains, that includes Alaska, so basically every scrap of land in the lower 48 has been logged at least once, so while possible, I dont buy it...\n\nBased on how far out it was in the west, how long it had been owned by either my great grandfather or my uncle, the topography, and the location you absolutely cannot be sure. Even if it was only 100 years old or 150 it wasn't cut to \"maintain the forest health\" or just to reduce fire danger. Why push that narrative when the entire ecosystem was destroyed as I said? It didn't need to be done and stating that every account of deforestation is one of the rare harmless forms of clearcutting isn't helpful.\n\n&gt; the entire ecosystem was destroyed as I said? It\n\nYeah, na. The entire ecosystem was ***NOT*** destroyed, that was your interpretation, and yes, I can be sure, because all of 7% of the forest in the US has been logged at least once... SMH\n\nWhere did you get your forestry degree?\n\nIm not making any assertations that would require a degree. Specifically I am not calling a forest old growth, when, by some studies 98% of virgin forests destroyed by 1990 in lower 48(estimated from map in Findley 1990 and commonly estimated by other authors, e.g., Postel and Ryan 1991). 99% loss of primary (virgin) eastern deciduous forest (Allen and Jackson 1992).\n\nsooooo\n\nThe forest you were running through was probably planted by the same company doing that logging. The devastating loss of old growth forest happened decades to centuries ago.\n\nWhere I live in British Columbia, logging of 1000+ year old trees and clearcutting of old growth forests continues today.\n\nThis is horrible\n\nIt’s so wonderful to hear that the money is still more important than what we collectively own.\n\nI was thinking of my problem, the face plant.\n\nWet rocks and roots don’t help!\n\nNo worries, it will come back.  Mixed age classes are good for diversity.  But, I get it, a bit of an eye sore for a few years... unless its a housing development.  Then its an eye forever.\n\nOld growth forests take centuries to develop. The shitty monoculture forests that foresting companies hire tree planters to plant is in no way an actual substitute.\n\nOP is jogging through a \"forest\" of 30-50 year old trees.  No where in that video is any \"old growth\" present.  You can see the decaying stumps from the previous management activity along the trail.\n\nYes that's the point. The old growth is gone, clear cut and replaced with shitty monoculture trees.\n\n&gt;The old growth is gone,\n\n50-80 years ago now, because of human intervention the land needs to be managed, that might at times mean Clearcutting. Clearcutting is used as a method of regenerating or rejuvenating certain kinds of trees that cannot tolerate shade.  It is also used when a forest type conversion is planned, often from low quality hardwoods to pine, on sites best for pines.\n\nThis is also the reason we need hunters, Wild populations can not self manage at this time in North America, so because of our actions in the past we still need to be involved in population control.\n\nWe need hunters because we killed the predators. If we bring the predators back, we don't need hunters\n\n&gt; If we bring the predators back, we don't need hunters\n\nNot enough contiguous tracts of wild land to support the proper balance of predator/prey that will naturally reach homeostasis.\n\nSO unless you are ok with not growing enough food to support the current population, AND are ok with packing everyone into cities, then your suggestion is impossible today.\n\nBoth Plant AND Animal populations must be managed in North America.\n\n40% of agricultural land is used for growing food to feed livestock, and 50% is for that livestock itself. That's a ridiculous amount of land we could save for wild animals if we switched to plant based agriculture. We're wasting far too much space\n\n&gt;40% of agricultural land is used for growing food to feed livestock, and 50% is for that livestock itself. \n\n100% agree, but that would mean not only taking the livelihood from a large number of people, it would mean forcing people to eat a diet that you believe is ethically/morally proper. Are you really suggesting that we should pass laws based on a small group's ethical/moral considerations?\n\nThat sounds an awful lot like the objections to the right to marry or the right to choose, a small group trying to legislate their own moral/ethical code. \n\n&gt;  \nWe're wasting far too much space\n\nYou say that like you are an expert or are repeating an accepted fact, rather this is your opinion, one that only a minority of Americans, and not all experts agree with.\n\nI'd say animals as a whole are not a small group.\n\nI ran through some wooded area outside of Brussels, and they have a system to the woods where they trim a little on this section, replant and leave alone. Rinse and repeat. It seems like the need for lumber would be met while also maintaining the business of the woods. \n\nAm I wrong for thinking a balance is necessary for these environments that are near civilization anyway? Preserved yet utilized\n\nThey are not preserved. That's the point. There is a significant difference between old growth forests and single monoculture trees. The first is a vastly bigger carbon capture, actually sustains a substantive ecosystem and actually is healthy and can resist natural disasters. These replanted monoculture forests become ghost forests where their only purpose is to be cut down again In a few years.\n\nDam beavers\n\nProblems of running in the forest.  Entitled dog owners.\n\n“Don’t worry! He’s friendly!”\n\nThat's word for word what a woman who had her dog off the leash told me. The dog proceeded to bite me.\n\nYou’d think dog owners would understand that even the friendliest of dogs can become threatened by a stranger running toward/past them in an unfamiliar place. Maybe they do and they just don’t care.\n\nIt’s also dangerous for the dog that’s off-leash. You have no idea what your dog will encounter around the next bend. Off-leash dogs are a danger to themselves and everyone else. If you care about your dog, they’ll be on a leash.\n\nThis should be the persuasive argument to dog owners for why to keep them on-leash- protecting their dog. My main park is the Wissahickon in Philadelphia, so it can get very crowded. Mountain bikers and equestrians are my biggest concern for dog encounters- the former move too fast and the latter easily spooked. (And I say this as a dog owner).\n\n“Don’t worry he’s friendly…he just doesn’t like men” as it runs straight towards me(m)at full speed..\n\nCan’t even trust dogs on leashes.  On a run there was a big poodle that ran off the sidewalk on to the road and jumped on my back. Left a deep scratch. It was leashed on one of those retractable leashes and it just pulled out all the cable and still got me. Couldn’t believe it. F-ing dogs.\n\n“I’m not!”\n\nThis is the part people don’t understand.  My dog isn’t friendly but still deserves to go outside to a secluded area, please keep you dog leased so my dog doesn’t get freak out.\n\nHas no one on this thread heard of off leash dog trails?\n\nI’ve heard of them, but they are generally privately owned, not state or federally owned at least where I am.  This means they are generally smaller places you wouldn’t really be able to put some miles into and are generally more in line with dog parks rather than trails because if the state is putting money into something the public is using they generally don’t want children or other vulnerable people being bitten by lazy people with “friendly” dogs.\n\nThere are tons of city parks and national forest lands on the West Coast that are leash optional. State parks naturally require leashes most of the time (as they should, since they see much higher traffic).\n\nWe don’t have any near where I am.\n\n&gt;My dog isn’t friendly but still deserves to go outside to a secluded area, please keep you dog leased so my dog doesn’t get freak out.\n\nYour lack of ability to train your own dog, and your dogs resulting behavior issues are in no way my responsibility, no matter if I am a dog owner or not. If you cant control your own dog, he does not \"deserve\" to be on publicly accessible trails.\n\nIt’ll be your problem if you are missing a few fingers lol.  I personally don’t give a shit about people who don’t take my advice.  If I am going to a leash only trail, am going off trail if I hear anyone at all until they pass, an telling anyone who approaches that my dog isn’t friendly, and they ignore me or have a dog off leash…..100% not my problem.\n\nI’ve done everything I can at that point….they call them darwin awards for a reason.\n\n\\*IF\\* your dog attacks me there is no question that you are liable, if I lose fingers because you have the inability to control your dog, get ready to be paying me the majority of your income for the rest of your life. \n\nYou have to control your own dog.\n\nHence the leash, and warning you not to approach, and moving away from you while you are on the path to avoid any confusion, and reiterating that you shouldn’t approach my dog several times as I continue to back away with my leashes dog.  I go pro all my runs, good luck explaining why you chose to ignore all of those explicit warnings on the recording when you are seeking payout.\n\nAt that point I would argue that my dog was protecting me, no sane person would continue to approach in that situation.\n\n&gt;Hence the leash, and warning you not to approach, and moving away from you while you are on the path to avoid any confusion, and reiterating that you shouldn’t approach my dog several times as I continue to back away with my leashes dog.\n\nNO ONE EVER SAID, I NEVER SAID, that I, or my dog, leashed, or unleashed, would approach you, or your dog. You didnt specify either, you said your dog goes nuts when he/she SEES another dog off leash... that is on you. STOP trying to twist this into something that you can win... SMH\n\nNow it is apparent that you had a traumatic experience, but not being able to control your dog is a you thing. If we are both ON the trail, and your dog can not handle being passed by another person or dog, then you need to get off the trail. You do not have the right to hog the trail because you can not control your dog.\n\nLegally in public, you have to maintain control on your dog, that means , if the path is 8ft wide,  and my dog and I are running in the opposite direction, and we are each on opposite sides of the trail taking up 24\" then you should have control of your dog if I am only 4' away. If it is single track, get your ass off the trail if you cant control your dog ... it wont be I, or my dog, initiating contact, especially if you show that you have little to no control of your dog.\n\n  \nNOTE:[ Michigan is a strict liability state in regards to dog bites,](https://www.whitelawpllc.com/blog/how-is-a-dog-bite-case-litigated-in-michigan/) that means no matter what happened leading up to the dog bite you are liable for the damages your dog caused.\n\nUnless the victim provoked the dog or was trespassing and if the person injured was comparatively negligent then any amount they could potentially recover is reduced by that percentage.  It would be pretty hard in the scenario I mentioned not to see the approaching person was mostly at fault especially since Michigan has pretty strict leash laws.  \n\nBottom line, leash your dogs.  It’s an animal even in the best of circumstances.  There is no amount of training that will make your dog not a dog.  If you do not leash your dog you are not in control of your dog, I don’t care how well trained you think it is.  It speaks to a crazy sense of entitlement on your part that you are willing to put other peoples animals or children at risk because you are so anti leash.\n\nI’ve outlined how I am always in control of my dog along with the steps I take to give it the best life I can while taking steps to prevent injury to others and injury has never been an issue. There is no twisting here, I’m letting you know you are actively putting you dog at risk by not leashing them.  If you choose to ignore that warning and existing leash laws that’s on you….not somebody else.\n\nu/Magic-Vagina gets it.\n\nI see plenty of runners with dogs off leash in the forest.  I haven’t had a problem yet.  Is it really that taboo?\n\nPlenty of runners with dogs off leash is the problem right there. No matter how well controlled your dog is, some else will have a dog who wants to fight.\n\nIt’s also rude to other runners to let your dog run up to them.\n\nYes. It's bad for wild animals and dangerous or at least frightening to other humans.\n\n&gt;or at least frightening to other humans.\n\nHow is that anyone elses issue? \n\nWhat about the middle aged white women who are frightened by large black men, should large black men not be allowed on the trails because it might be dangerous or frightening to middle aged white Karen's? \n\nWe dont stop people from being in public because you are worried there \\*might\\* be a problem, your feelings are your own issue, control them, or stay in your home.\n\nBecause there's a difference between being frightened of black people because you're racist and being frightened of loose dogs because they're animals that might be untrained and aggressive. \n\nIf you simply don't care about other peoples legitimate feelings and safety, you do you, but also: go fuck yourself.\n\nIt’s similar to driving without a seatbelt. The vast majority of times you do it nothing bad will happen. However, the potential downside of one bad incident is quite high.\n\nIt didn’t both me any until I had a dog jump on me and growl last month. Owner refused to leash her and said she was friendly. I turned my back and tried to hunch a bit and this aggravated the dog more. She finally got the dog away. The trails I visit are for on leash dogs 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\nLosing the forest for you is less bad than getting angry that OP does not follow Reddit leash rules? Really?\n\nAgree 100%!\n\nThe Forestry Commission did a lot of felling around our favourite bit of forest last year. It looked terrible for ages and left some of our favourite paths impassable until we and I suspect a lot of other bikers, dog walkers and runners made the effort to clear them a bit at a time as we picked our way through. It’s mostly recovered now though. To be fair, they don’t generally clear fell like this in this country these days, IME.\n\nYour dog should be on a leash.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo they are not, sorry. It is a safety issue I don't care how well people think their dog is trained. It seems like you have never read about this or investigated this at all.\n\nI’ll remember that for next time\n\nThe dog doesn’t need to be on a leash. Let the animal run and be happy. Don’t crush its soul with a leash.\n\nIt's not the unleashed dog that's the problem, it's the irresponsible owner who can't control their dog. \n\nPeople need to understand that there's a time for on-leash running and a time for off-leash running. And that nothing is a substitute for good training, not even a leash. Running down a steep rocky mountain with a dog that weighs 1/3 of your body weight leashed to you poses a greater hazard than a properly trained unleashed dog. People don't want to hear that though.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong with running with your dog off leash in an area in which it is legal to do so. Provided you are a responsible dog owner, which means: your dog has great recall and is under your control. \n\nI use an e-collar and a skijoring harness with a leash loop every time I run with my dog off leash (in the areas in which it is perfectly legal to so). When I see others (which is rarely), I call her, she heels, I hold her lead, and she is on a leash when we pass other dogs because *they* might be unfriendly. If she doesn't come (also rarely) the e-collar gets used, which allows me to control her with a button the same way leash does. She doesn't approach people because she doesn't care about them, she just wants to sniff other dogs.\n\nEveryone gets all up in arms \"but what if something happens *that one time*?!\" But that \"one time\" can also happen while your dog is on a leash. A leash can be pulled from your hand, for instance. Large dogs can still snap and lunge while on a leash. Waist leashes and retractable leashes are longer than the width of most trails, so untrained dogs can still be a problem, even on a leash. People seem to think \"leash\" is the only answer, but a leashed dog can still attach someone with a negligent owner. *A leash is not a substitute for good training.* \n\nAggressive dogs need a muzzle and an e-collar, in addition to a leash. If your dog is \"reactive\" you are responsible for its behavior. If you just got your dog, you don't know the dog and its temperament, so it shouldn't be off leash. If your dog has ever been reactive, it needs to be on a leash *always.* And probably muzzled as well.\n\nMy dog has been attacked so many times while she is on a leash, which she is in areas in which it is required. A neighborhood dog has run out of their property, into the street, and attached my dog, twice now. I have also seen very good dogs sitting on their porches, unleashed and unsupervised while we run past. \n\nA lack of leashes is not the problem with dogs. The problem is the lack of training and responsibility in the dog *owner.* If you don't have the time and money to properly train a dog, you should not have the privilege of dog-ownership.\n\nSorry buddy, but if your dog comes bounding up to my very old, very traumatised dog - that I try my best to keep as far away from other dogs as possible - then what happens next is your fault, not mine.\n\nNope sorry you are wrong. Dogs are on a leash 100% of the time unless in a fenced in area. Training isnt the answer. Leash your dogs.\n\nAbsolutely not\n\nDang, that’s sobering. I feel the same way about coming upon cleared forest. Unfortunately for me, it’s mostly because of wild fires so you’d be in lush greenery and then boom - burnt trees, downed logs, shrubby undergrowth coming back up.\n\nWhat you were running in is more analogous to a corn field than a forest ecologically.  But, can still be enjoyed for it’s visual appeal! I definitely tend to prefer douglas fir field running to corn field running haha (apologies  to my midwestern friends!:)\n\nThat’s all planted timber. We can complain all we want but don’t we want to use less plastics? The materials have to come from somewhere and timber is a renewable resource.\n\nI was not complaining.\n\nYou’re totally fine. I don’t know why people who love nature can’t seem to understand why you’d find this jarring. \n\nI used to live on the island and I remember driving up the Malahat and seeing entire sides of old growth just gone. Big, black holes.  It was very sad to witness. \n\nFarmed trees are one thing, which it looks like these may have been, but it’s still sad. It’s still a living forest that’s been there for sometime.\n\nI mean I think it’s a complex issue ultimately. Between old growth or 2nd+ growth, wildlife, invasive species, diseases, land ownership, development, etc there’s plenty of concerns at play. And I don’t think it’s always navigated in the best way. \n\nBut anyone pretending “just stop logging” is lost\n\nPersonally I worry about many many other issues before I lose sleep over logging concerns. But that’s me\n\n\nThe worst part about going running is seeing an unleashed dog. I ~~hate~~ *strongly dislike* those owners. \n\nI'm a dog person, volunteer at an animal shelter, and have owned many dogs. I know what can go wrong from an owners perspective and from a runner's perspective. Even if you have the best trained dog in the world, other runners don't know that, and other dogs and animals don't know that. It's just not worth it. Also, it's usually required to leash your dog, and even in places it isn't required, it's just common courtesy to.\n\nYou don’t have to like me 👍🏻\n\n[deleted]\n\nI already commented elsewhere here that I wasn’t complaining. I live in a freaking logging town. \n\nI hope you stand at the corner of an intersection in your neighborhood stopping everyone who goes above the speed limit. Downright dangerous AND illegal!\n\nGood. I don't. And I hope to never come across you and your dog on the trail.\n\nSo runners need to worry about the feelings of other trail users???\n\nSO large Black Men shouldn't be on trails alone just incase they come across a White Middle aged Karen???\n\nYou cant hold someone else responsible for your feelings. Your feelings are your own issue, not mine, or anyone else.\n\nFound the racist. You just equated a dog to a black man. Wow\n\nYOu really missed the point.... I compared your feelings being frightened by dogs, to a karen who is friengened by black men... you really missed the point. \n\n Racism is irrational, Being frightened by a unleashed dog is also irrational, Im not equating the two, Racism is bad, Irrational fears are bad.\n\nAlso I wasn’t trying to make any specific statement with this video. As others pointed out, this isn’t an old growth forest - the type we SHOULD arguably undeniably protect. \n\nThe fact logging exists where I live can be an eyesore for sure, but the forestry roads they create also allow me to recreate in places that would have otherwise been way too inaccessible\n\nAnd yeah, wood is in everything. From your toilet paper to your house.\n\nHello fellow Oregonian.  Nothing new here, although it still sucks\n\nI’m Canadian, eh?\n\nYour dog might over heat running with a coat on.\n\nIt was cold and raining\n\nThe dog doesn’t need it. Judging by the video, it’s not cold.  The dog could overheat and die.\n\nThank you for your concern.\n\nA wizard should have known better!\n\nThis is messed up.\n\nIts cute when beavers do it, we're just efficient /j\n\nWhat you were running in is more analogous to a corn field than a forest ecologically.  But, can still be enjoyed for it’s visual appeal! I definitely tend to prefer douglas fir field running to corn field running haha (apologies  to my midwestern friends!:)\n\nMan Boobs?\n\nYeah. I don’t normally run up it but felt very confused it felt like quite a bit of it got rerouted but maybe not 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nWhere?\n\nPrivate land or public land?\n\nClean up looks good, almost too good.\n\n  \nP.S.  That is a small clear cut compared to what happened half a century ago and earlier.\n\nI don't see how you can blame trail running for shooting vertically?\n\nBoooooooo\n\n[deleted]\n\nI wasn’t complaining or saying logging shouldn’t happen or other political statement\n\nJust zero doubt it’s jarring when you’re running and “suddenly” come across such a fresh and drastic change. Could have also been turning a corner and suddenly seeing a huge snow-capped mountain :)\n\nMakes me physically sick.\n\nThey cleared a small woods to build homes along some old train tracks I used to run. I can’t run there anymore.  We need housing, but it just hurts my heart\n\nSo the owner of private property, that you didnt own but were trespassing on, chose to use their property as they saw fit???? the nerve of someone wanting to do something with private property!!!\n\nHuh? It’s a provincial trail along some defunct train tracks. And it was acres of land that was sold for development. \n\nAnd I already mentioned i understand we need housing, but it doesn’t make it any less jarring coming up on woods you’ve loved for years - gone. Bulldozed.\n\nI’m allowed to be upset by that.\n\n&gt;I’m allowed to be upset by that.\n\nDo you vote? If you are of age, and participate in your government by voting in elections, you have, weather you voted for the elected officials or not, given legitimacy to their decisions. \n\nSo if the decisions were legitimate by the government to sell the property for development, you dont have a \"right\" to be upset. \n\nSo again, the owner of private property decided to do something with their private property...\n\nDO I have a right to be upset with you for how you use your own private property?\n\nYou do realize being upset at the loss of a wooded area, and being upset at an owner for selling property are two different things, right?\n\nI’m not quite sure you’re ever going to be empathetic to me on this, but I’m pretty sure you won’t be.\n\nIt doesn’t matter who owns what, when you see something that upsets you, you have emotions.  Did I run to the bulldozers and yell at the drivers? No. Did I protest in any other way other than just not going there anymore? No.  So really Augie. You can fuck right off and leave me alone.\n\nWhat really kicked me in the pants was a birds nest in one of my the fallen trees and the mama bird flying around it, shrieking.  I actually started crying. What can I say - I’m a sensitive creature\n\n&gt;I actually started crying. What can I say - I’m a sensitive creature\n\n[How do you make it through the day? Nature is vicious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GibiNy4d4gc), regardless what type of bird was it? It could have been an invasive species, and killing it was reasonable for the local environment.\n\nYou’ve got to be trolling.\n\nSeriously. Get bent.\n\nNormal sight where I live. Can't avoid them.\n\nOnce I was in as on a run, beautiful topography with streams and rolling hills in the forest. When I reached the edge of the protected land it was completely clear, leveled and being sterilized for some gross chicken nugget urban “community”. I get that people need places to live but you could just as easily plan houses around the trees and make a place worth living in.\n\nI’m probably in the minority but I actually don’t really know why this bothers people other than it’s a bit of an eyesore. That forest was cut down before and in a while will be cut down again. The real tragedy is the loss of old growth forest that has occurred and every effort should be made to preserve the small amount that is left. As trail runners most of us all use the forest service roads to get to the wilderness. Those wouldn’t exist without logging practices and lumber is much needed in the world we live in.\n\nAgreed. As I had already commented elsewhere\n\nThere is an unchained beast in your film!!!\n\nyeah I live in a climate where the forest can literally be regrown in a decade or so so it's not the end of the world but I will say this clear cutting still looks like hot garbage.\n\nDang the heckin government for selling all this pretty land to the greedy.\n\nWhat's your house made from?\n\nTimber is the most renewable resource on earth, and it's also a natural carbon store - the carbon captured in that wood will  be stored probably for a hundred years. Meanwhile, the forestry company will replant this coup and over the next 30 years this patch will grow back in and capture a few million more tonnes of carbon all over again.\n\nOld growth forests take centuries to develop. The shitty monoculture forests that foresting companies hire tree planters to plant is in no way an actual substitute. These forests are negligible sources of carbon capture compared to old growth forests.\n\nThe forest in the video is clearly not an old growth forest. It's obviously a plantation, and it's probably been logged 5 times already in the last 150 years\n\nWood (dry weight) is roughly 50% carbon by weight. The atomic mass of a carbon atom is 12 amu. The molecular weight of CO2 is 44 amu. Per tonne of wood grown, a tree therefore extracts over 1.83 tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\nPine generally has a yeild/growth rate of 5 tonnes per year per acre, so nearly 9.2 tonnes of CO2 sequestered per year per acre, and then when it's harvested that carbon is permanently stored in whatever structure or building or furniture is made from it, whilst the coup is replanted and continues sucking up more carbon. \n\nOver the 20-ish that most plantations grow prior to harvesting, that's nearly 200 tonnes of CO2 removed per acre. The area in this video could easily be 50 acres, so that's be 10,000 tonnes of CO2 sequestered \n\nKeep lying to yourself by pretending that's negligible.\n\n30 years? Lol you silly\n\nOof, those clearcut landscapes. Looks like the western part of North America?\n\nBc, Canada\n\nSeeing the clear cut is always a bit jarring, but among other things the logging industry helps provide access to recreate in more remote areas (even though this specific spot isn’t remote)\n\nYeah, I just can't help but wonder if clearcutting and then planting a monoculture to replace it is really the best idea. I remember spending a bit of time up around PG and the clearcuts behind the 'curtain' of trees by the highways and such was pretty stark. Even in some of the regrown areas it was still pretty sterile relatively speaking, especially in the undergrowth.\n\nOh for sure I am positive those more educated than me could point to the countless issues with monoculture. But I also don’t know the effects “in the short term” when they’re effectively just replanting to be logged at maturity. I personally love to see the diversity because… of exactly that - the diversity. It makes the forest more magical. And cedar smells amazing 😊\n\nOld growth - and the idea of old growth - is all but gone basically\n\nCream show! Money to be made"

Have eyed it for a while, never been.\n3-4 days with 20-35km each day or so?\n\nAviemore is a great base. It’s on the Speyside Way so you can run north on the trail towards Grantown (~25km) or south towards Newtonmore (~30km).\n\nThe trails around Loch an Eilein and Loch Morlich are the best though. About 5km from Aviemore and endless trails with epic scenery. Cairngorms have something like 5 mountains in the top 10 (highest in the UK) so plenty of options near Aviemore if you want climbs too 👍\n\nIf you want to mix it up at Loch an Eilein - there's a castle on an island that is a short swim away for a confident swimmer!\n\nPack well and go through the Lairig Ghru one day. You could do Aviemore - Braemar, overnight there and then return a different way either over the hills or via Lairig an Laoigh. \n\nI think Aviemore-Braemar is 30-40km total, so that'd be your big day and then you could wind back via a bothy or something for two shorter days to follow.\n\nShould add I've never done this but been on my bucket list for years. You need decent weather really, Cairngorms are as hairy as it gets in poor conditions as far as the UK is concerned I'd say.\n\nI highly recommend the chalamain gap circuit if you're up for a climb!\n\nAwesome thanks for the tips!\n\nIs there an ideal time of year? I don't mind uncertain conditions (can adjust). how is May/early June or Oct/Nov?\n\nMay is a great month. Probably early enough to avoid the worst of the midges (and school holidays/price hikes) whilst also having a decent shot at good weather.\n\nI had the pleasure of spending a week in Carrbridge and ran around Loch Eilein and in the forest near where we were staying. Loved it. \n\nFantastic temps as well! It was ~3 degrees Celsius\n\nCongratulations. Increíble pace: 4.45\nBravo.\n\nBeautiful!\n\nHow does it compare to the Alps?\n\nLess chance of being chased by a grumpy wild haggis in the Alps....\n\nLess cable cars, less tourists.

Since I had to look that up. 🤣 wow one of the wilder trail running stories I’ve heard\n\nYou should try this :D\n\nhttps://www.cockbainevents.com/the-tunnel\n\nWhere’s that\n\nSnoqualmie Pass\n\nDoes the UltraFest 100 miler go through that thing? I’m running it for my first 100 next month!\n\nDid it improve your run time?  Higher heart rate?\n\nI felt like I pushing the pace for sure due to the environment but routing wasn’t working since we were under a mountain. I timed it at about 9:45 min/mile on my stopwatch which is NOT pushing the pace lol but there were also lots of potholes and puddles to watch out for and not being able to see much. So I definitely wanted to go fast but also didn’t want to get hurt.\n\nDid you run through this tonnel without a light? \n\nI've run through this tonnel during a race but a light was required.\n\nRan with a headlamp but had to pay close attention to the ground, I did turn an ankle once but it was mild. On the way back, my breath was obstructing my light a little and made visibility a little tougher.\n\nDid you meet any CHUD?\n\nI love biking this tunnel, but I can't run it though cause I get a little panicky and can't spend too much time in it. I run from the upper lot east.\n\nLove stopping at Dry Bru for a hot dog and a beer for post run refueling!\n\nI was super nervous but actually enjoyed it more than I was expecting!! I don’t drink anymore but I loved Dru Bru before I quit! They had tasty beers. We went to Twede’s since we are on an another Twin Peaks kick, we def love going there for the fun of it as opposed to the food lol. And for damn fine cup of coffee as well.\n\nGréât training for [the tunnel](https://www.cockbainevents.com/the-tunnel)\n\nCame here for this!\nHere's a great [article](https://www.bbc.com/sport/64139029) about this monstrosity.\n\n£260 to find out you're scared of the dark\n\nThere's a half marathon in Pennsylvania that is an out and back that goes through two tunnels on a no longer used section of the Pa Turnpike. It's fun but a little weird, especially because tunnels freak me out\n\nCheck [this](https://www.bbc.com/sport/64139029) monster out if you're freaked out about tunnels!\n\nI remember reading about that one and thinking how awful it would be\n\nIf you haven't done one of the tunnel marathons (or halfs) yet, you should!  They're great races and it's all downhill, so super fast.  You can wear normal road racing shoes for them.  The tunnel is by far the sketchiest part of the trail.  The views get even more beautiful.\n\nWhile you can run in regular road shoes, I certainly wish I had a light/fast trail runner for this (something like endorphin edge). We had a bit of a wet one and certainly felt lost traction on the course. And missed breaking 3hr mark by only 62sec… \n\nShow choice, tying method changes, getting caught zigzagging the half marathoners at the end. Zigzagging puddles. Who knows. Still elusive at this point. 😅\n\nAh, when I ran it was dry except for the puddles in the tunnel.  I wore Adidas Pro 3s and they were great.  I did a 15 mile test run on the trail a month before with the Terrex Agravic Speed Ultras, but am happy I went with the AP3s as they felt more efficient.  I also tested the Prime X 2 Strung, but those felt like a mismatch even though my stats were a bit better with them.\n\nThe zigzagging was tough.  I lost a few min in the tunnel and had to avoid slower groups of runners and people not in the race who were using the trail.  The one kind of annoying thing was someone's husband decided to ride a bike in support and was constantly passing and stopping and I lost some time avoiding him.  But it's all good, it was a great race.\n\nNice!! Will have to check those out! Love a bet downhill too lol\n\nIt looks like the last one this year (Sept) is all sold out now.  The next one is in June (which is the one I did this year and it was great) and they do 3 a year. (Here's the [website](https://www.tunnelmarathon.com/)).\n\nThere is also the Jack and Jill Marathon, which is the same course and in late July.\n\nWhen I ran the tunnel marathon, I did it without a headlamp.  There were so many other headlamps, my light wouldn't have added.  And I didn't want to carry it for 26.2 miles.  I was going for a BQ.  But you definitely need one if you're alone or with a small group.\n\nAh, wild, I feel like it'd be so tough without a light that you control in the tunnel even with all the others.  I was constantly scanning the ground for potholes and puddles while trying to avoid getting tangled with any nearby runners.  I wore a hydration pack (oversized too, the Salomon ADV 12), so I just threw mine in the backpack after the tunnel.  It's a [pretty light headlamp](https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Headlamps/IKO-CORE) so I didn't notice it.  There was also the headlamp drop off after the tunnel, but I didn't use it.\n\nVery cool! Beautiful views!\n\nNGL. this is terrifying. At the same time i love runs where i am scared, it makes me run faster.\n\nI would love to do this one. I’ve done forests after dark, but never directly into the darkness of a tunnel.\n\nI’m interested to see the type of time you would get running this tunnel for time. The obstacles make it interesting. Maybe you’ll try one day in the future?\n\nBy my stopwatch, I got 9:45 min/mile so 44:52. But not an accurate reading for the first 2.3 miles. I’m also not very fast, can run an 8:40min/mile flat 5K but cautious in this tunnel for sure due to visibility and potholes and wet surfaces.\n\nWell, if you ever decide to try it, I and maybe some other people would love a video of it. That type of thing is underdone and really cool.\n\nThat’s so cool! But also terrifying! Running in the dark even with a headlamp scares the crap out of me.\n\nI was not alone at least! Would not have done it alone! It was definitely intimidating but I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.\n\nThis is really cool! It also gives me anxiety to think about being under a mountain in a dark tunnel. Lol\n\nWe ran from rattle snake to the Columbia river over a week, awesome route, love in the tunnel you have your own cloud\n\nRan through that bad boy 3x on my way to a DNF at Cascade crest. Went through first to the turnaround, came back a second time… then needed to drop and the easiest place was back through that tunnel. All in the dead of night. I’d be content to never set foot in it again.\n\nOkay at night would be absolutely terrifying\n\noh gosh did you have to do the descent from the pct down to the tunnel x2 too?\n\nSuper cool!! Would love to try that one day.\n\nYou're braver than I am! Glad you stayed safe and had fun!\n\nYou should have kept running, the views get even better. There are several old metal trus bridges you get to cross.\n\n\nThis is where all the tunnel marathons are run, where people score individual PRs and qualify for boston, thanks to the -1% grade.\n\nWe definitely will keep going next time! It was spontaneous and we were a little crunched for time but I can’t wait to go back and go further.\n\nThis is a good spot to access the Ironhorse Trail.\n\n[https://maps.app.goo.gl/pgjEYQtEvy4SSBBQA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pgjEYQtEvy4SSBBQA)\n\nHike up to the trail and head east. You will reach a bridge in just a few minutes.\n\n[https://maps.app.goo.gl/rX9x5f4Wd88USyXh8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rX9x5f4Wd88USyXh8)\n\nWas this worth doing? Been meaning to go run it but haven’t yet.\n\nI thought so!! Def want to extend it into a longer run next time.\n\nI ran through that tunnel during the Cascade Crest 100 a long time ago, it was really freaking cool! \n\nWhere was this?\n\nI did not love running through that tunnel during a marathon. Great in theory, but a lot of pot holes and in a race you just had to hold your pace the entire time because it was too cramped to pass or be passed safely.\n\nBig Mines of Moria energy. Any balrogs down there?\n\nI know that tunnel well. Ran it as the opening miles of the jack n jill marathon. Such a beautiful spot. And glad I had a jacket and headlamp cruising through there haha\n\nThis is the ultimate tunnel run.\nhttps://www.cockbainevents.com/the-tunnel\n\nI walked through that tunnel. There is a very popular geocache nearby, so there is always a lot of people passing by.\n\nThe Jack and Jill marathon ran through this tunnel a few weeks ago. Was awesome\n\nThe year I ran Cascade Crest 100 they sat a skeleton against the wall in the middle of that tunnel wearing a “Pacer” bib, was hilarious\n\npretty sure this just reminded me of a recurring nightmare i’ve been having for years 😂\n\nthe last time I ran a marathon through that tunnel a gas powered SAR atv passed me in it and drove just ahead of me for most of it. Had a bad headache that afternoon which is unusual for me and wondered if it was carbon monoxide poisoning. loved the tunnel up until that point"

Lots and lots of smiles yesterday 😃\n\nCongrats, looks like a really nice adventure!\n\nThe nausea also happens to me around these km. My guess it is because I try to eat too much before that.\n\nTimewise it is fine I would expect you to end just behind 50/60% in a trail match\n\nSo interesting about the nausea! I always like a solid breakfast (couple of eggs and yogurt with oats) and even then I was starving by the time I started running. Hope i can work out a solution 😂\n\nThat's awesome!! What event was this? I'm also based in southern Germany, and am always looking for fun trail events :)\n\nP.S Good to know there's still some snow up there. I have a race in two weeks, and was (too) optimistic that it'll be gone by then...\n\nProbably Zugspitz Ultra Trail: https://www.zugspitz-ultratrail.com/die-rennen/mittenwald-trail/\n\nHey hey! Also based in Southern Germany (GAP). It was ZUT- such an amazing event, can’t recommend it enough. My husband has done it the past three years and they’re fantastic. Snow conditions are good overall- the last of it is melting fast\n\nThanks! This is one that I’ll have to add to the (long) list for next year 😅!\n\nAwesome!!! What a beautiful place to run. Congrats to you!\n\nThank you!!!\n\nCongratulations! Scenery looks beautiful and your smile is evidence that you crushed it!!\n\nThank you!! It’s a gorgeous route!\n\nEpic views!

THANK YOU!\n\nWhat a gorgeous course! Congrats, and thank you for sharing your photos!!!\n\nAhhh thanks so much! It was truly wonderful!\n\nI would love to try something like this someday\n\nGO FOR IT! Two years ago I was saying I’d never be able to get back into running (health issues) but here we are! You’ve got this!\n\nNoice! Congratulations!\n\nIs this the ZUT or by happenstance you where there!? I was supposed to do it this weekend but work had different plans with me on another continent.\n\nThis is ZUT! It’s our home trails 😍 bummer this year didn’t work out for you! 100% recommend trying again for next year- they do a phenomenal job and the energy is incredible!\n\nAwesome! I'm sure it was great -- me and a buddy were there a few weeks ago checking out the trails, loved them. Next year!\n\nNice! Which direciton did you go? Might save the route for a weekend sometime\n\nThe route starts in Mittenwald! It’s a nice one 🙌 also can really recommend doing the route from Eschenlohe up over the Estergebirge (Hohe Kiste, Krottenkopf, Bischof, Fricken, Wank) down into Garmisch if you’re looking for a long day ☺️\n\nAwesome, thanks for the recommendation! :)\n\nI hope one day I can be like you. And I'm a guy. Actually enjoying a distance like this with that elevation is crazy!\n\nHahaha thank you!!! I’m glad i come from a strong hiking background (regularly do 2.000meters a week or more) so the elevation gain wasn’t a scary factor. That helped a lot 😅\n\nPractice downhill running.  Gary Cantrell (aka Lazarus Lake) will tell you that it is a must      The right shoes and semi sense of invulnerability will carry you through    To this day the weirdest thing that ever happened to me during an ultra was me bombing down a hill and I had tons of people yell \"slow down!\"  Could not for the life of me figure out why. Was my first ever sub seven hour 50k!\n\nI would LOVE to get to the point people told me to slow down haha! I am always the slowest descending 😂 good on you! Anything that really helped you get confident on the downs?\n\nMinimalist shoes that let let you feel the trail was the biggest part.  Mass cushion was such a numbing factor where I never felt confident on what I was stepping on.  Altra Superiors and a rock plate and I was ready to slap on the invisible helmet and go crazy High knees and loose hips.  You can stagger stumble down some shocking terrain\n\nThanks for the rec!! I’ve been using Lone Peaks the past four years for pretty much everything, but haven’t ventured into their other models!\n\nThat’s a lot of elevation gain for a marathon too! You crushed it! Way to go\n\nThanks so so much! It was a great time!"

I’ll need to come back with my “proper camera” and capture this. \n\nOriginally, I had planned a longer route to check out another creek valley, but since I was moving rather slow through that muddy and occasionally technical terrain, I “only” (compared to some of you guys) managed to get to a half-marathon’s distance (550m/1800ft of total elevation) before I was running out of light.  \nIn the end, after wading through countless puddles and sinking into mud, I felt quite miserable and cold but I’m still kinda proud to have beaten my inner demons and made it outside.

And some of my favorite moments in life I’ve had filthy feet. Thank you for sharing it was just what I needed tonight.\n\nNice cake!\n\nI totally thought this was somewhere in UK\n\nDefinitely on my running bucket list, thanks!\n\nAh wow!

All these fresh shades of green in May, when fauna has fully come back to life, never disappoint. I’ll need to turn this run into a photo hike and capture this properly. In the present moment, you often don’t cherish it as much but dearly regret not having captured it once nature has changed again in summer\n\nYeah, my local trail is full of creek that sometimes flood and change over the seasons. Really makes you feel part of this world.\n\nWool socks FTW!!\n\nAny recommendations? I use wool socks for hiking (and cycling in winter) but my pairs are not that optimal for running, so I’ve been thinking of buying some. Wool is the hidden sportswear champion\n\nThat looks hard as hell\n\nSometimes I’ll just take the dunking rather than risk slipping on the mossy rocks here in the PNW!\n\nGorgeous pics!\n\nYep this looks like heaven. \n\n(I love running through streams and rivers, the cold water really sorts out my Achilles tendinitis…. )\n\nThose are the days I wish I brought my poles...\n\nI’ll have to look into finally getting a pair. My orthopaedic recommended the same should my occasional knee pain not go away\n\nThis looks amazing.  Try using “never wet” fabric spray on your shoes for a more…dry experience next time\n\nThat’s a good tip I follow on my hiking boots. I did spray the running shoes with a repellent spray before but it’s not as effective on this highly porous upper. On the flip side, any water did not stay as long in there and could evaporate quickly. Originally, I planned on getting a pair with goretex but was put off by many comments saying that goretex isn’t invincible and takes forever to dry once you’re sitting in a puddle of water - which I know too well from my hiking boots\n\nYou can also use it on your gear like backpack shoes, and Tent\n\nMy equipment rotation is Luna Sandals, Vapor Gloves and unshod. Let me tell ya: when it's wet and muddy nothing beats unshod. It's so much damn fun.\n\nI was adamant this was Wales somewhere until seeing your comment! Nice photos despite the drab weather.\n\nThe grosser I am at the end of my trail run the more memorable it is. Swamp creature is the goal.\n\nWhat a beautiful forest, how long did you hike for?\n\nHiked longer than I’d want to admit. I was out for close to 3h this time. Usually such a distance with equal elevation would take me 2:15-2:30h at a relaxed pace but wading through mud slowed me down significantly - and I didn’t feel all too well, physically and emotionally, to begin with so the goal was to get out and explore new possible trail combinations. \n\nThe very steep, technical section (the warning signs call for experience navigating through “alpine” trails) in the first 9 pictures only stretched for 1k, which took me 15min as it was more climbing than running, haha. Later on, I’ve also checked out another very steep trail (20-25% gradient) that I had planned on eventually riding my bike on but decided that, when running is already hard enough there, I don’t think that I’ll try biking here soon.  \nThe rest consisted of narrow single trails and these muddy forest roads. I’ll soon revisit this route and tweak it a bit\n\nNice!!\n\nGorgeous.\n\n🤩🤩🤩🤩\n\nOnly if you smell them when you get home\n\nI am trying out a new pair of waterproof altras…admittedly I get a little bummed when even the slightest amount of dew seem to soak up my toes with water.  I prefer dry feet…but when it’s really wet out , sure enough, you eventually have to embrace the elements and learn to enjoy all of it.\n\nEither that, or you’ve got to embrace Gore-Tex."

    "all_comment_text": "You running in heaven?\n\nIt only feels like that after the run when im looking back at the pictures, but on the run itself it usually feels more like the opposite… 😈\n\nAh beautiful Slovenia, how I miss you.\n\nNot too far from Kranska Gora, part of the area of Slovenia that I know best.\n\nGetting increasingly tempted to book a trip to Slovenia every time I see a post in this sub\n\nDo it! It's my fave place, even with that North York Moors &amp; Cleveland Way on my doorstep! (UK)\n\nAny suggestions on where I should scope out a place? I work remotely so could feasibly have a scan for next summer :)\n\nKranska Gora is a busy little town, plenty of lifts up the mountains and lots of places to stay. When I say busy, the town can be busy but the mountains aren't! Decent public transport links to Ljubljana (the capital) &amp; a short walk or run to the Austrian and Italian borders. Loads of nice hotels and restaurants. \n\nBohinj is smaller and quieter, a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. Public transport is still doable too, it's further from the borders, closer to Lake Bled (must visit the castle there).\n\nBoth of these places are in the Julian Alps which are amazing. \n\nBohinj is 2 hours from the airport on the bus.\n\nKranska Gora is 1 hour 15\n\nThere is the whole of the rest of Slovenia to explore as well but I have tended to end up in that north western area as I have friends in Ljubljana.\n\nI'm sure others will have plenty of suggestions as well 😊\n\nAmazing, thanks &amp; sorry for being lazy by asking on this thread. That’s a great starting point!\n\nNo problem. I intend to explore the rest of the country eventually but can't really justify going and not visiting my friends in the North West, they would not be impressed if I didn't visit them whilst I was there!\n\nNo problem.
