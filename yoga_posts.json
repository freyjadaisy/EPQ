    "all_comment_text": "Shavasana is like my favourite part and I can’t imagine just loudly leaving?!\n\nI always have a blanket, and the studio gives out heated lavender-scented eye beanbags. It’s the most relaxing thing ever.\n\nI used to take a class with a teacher who would say \"we're about to do shavasana. anyone who needs to leave early please do so now before we start\" and then she'd wait a few minutes. I always appreciated her saying that so those of us staying didn't have to hear people gathering their stuff or the door opening and closing.\n\nThis is great! As someone who had to leave every class since dealing with some very intense personal trauma and cannot complete this portion of class for about a year now, I always leave quietly - but would love a heads up to get out before! Even just seeing everyone else begin this part of class is triggering to me still to be honest.\n\nI totally understand that and nobody should have to have a reason or excuse to stop their practice whenever they need to.\n\nYou should leave before savasanah. It is pretty easy to tell when class is winding down.\n\nThis is what I do too, announce savasana a few minutes prior and invite anyone who knows they must eave to do so before the practice begins. Usually no one leaves, but I think it's important to offer that option. You never know what rrauma people are going through or, fo that matter, who really urgently needs a restroom. :-D\n\nI knew a girl with a \"I'm just here for shavasana\" shirt and I think about it often\n\nI need one haha\n\nWho knows, maybe the guy was having an emotional release and just needed to take off... But yea, I would be extra careful to leave quietly if it happened to me\n\nMy ex used to laugh because if I’d been working long shifts I’d literally start the class in shavasana and just sleep through the whole ordeal. Which is odd, because I’m generally a very poor sleeper.\n\nsometimes I really really want to do that...maybe next time I should try it\n\nSome people can’t stand being still and sitting with themselves\n\nI'm not good with the still so I silently and slowly cycle my legs if I'm particularly twitchy. No excuse for just walking out and disrupting everyone else\n\nThat was me, I just recently started meditating and I’m excited to do a class again to see if I can sit through it\n\nI always have to fidget for far too long, but I can't imagine *leaving*\n\nSome ppl have other things to do\n\nIf you find you want to leave or cut your practice short during shavasana, consider that maybe this is the most difficult pose for you. And maybe you need to practice  it *more*, to get better at it. \n\n-my instructor\n\nDon't go to a yoga class if you're too busy to stay for the whole yoga class\n\nMy friend does this for any group class 🙄 wow so efficient, save time and mad rush to put things away.\n\nWhere could one get some of these eye beanbags?? Asking for a friend.\n\nSorry, no idea!! They have them in a warmer all class and pass them out during shavasana if you have your palm up. \n\nThey kinda remind me of just a microwave beanbag. Maybe they’re just that and spritzed with an essential oil?\n\nI have something like [this](https://a.co/d/6g7D19B) but from a nearby wellness type store, maybe you could check there!\n\nI was gifted something called a \"nodpod\" which is a peanut shaped eye beanbag and it's heavenly. I've seen them cheap at TJ Maxx or Marshalls, otherwise you can shell out $35 and get it on Amazon.\n\nMaybe their stomach dropped.\n\nOof too real. I honestly thought I was gonna pee my pants once in shavasana and I used it to practice sitting in my discomfort BUT if it was my bowels I probably would have been running lol\n\nHow potent is the lavender?  I can’t share space with it at all.  I think it’s a genetic thing, like some people taste soap when they eat cilantro.  I smell baby piss when there’s even a pinch of dried lavender in the room, it burns my airways, and in a few minutes’ time it makes me light-headed.  I would have to switch yoga studios.\n\nIt’s not super strong imo. I can’t smell it during class, only when the instructor passes them out. From your description though, I think it would bother you a lot.\n\nI will leave during Savasana very rarely, but it's only because it's a hot studio and the timer on my asthma has completely run out - if I don't leave the room, my breathing is gonna get hella disruptive. \n\nEven then, I'll leave as quietly as I can, even if that means leaving my mat/towel/block and coming back later when my lungs are being useful again.\n\nthanks for pointing this out. I get that he didn’t need to be loud, but if someone leaves during savasana there’s a reason. whether it’s b/c of asthma or a severe anxiety disorder or just because. \n\nif you’re judging people for not participating in savasana during your savasana, you’re kind of missing the point…\n\nI have an ostomy bag, and once every few months it will start to leak at the edges and I'll have to leave. Trust me when I say, I am definitely more annoyed than everyone else 😂 \n(For context, it isn't noticeable to anyone else but me.  Most people never know I have one)\n\nI feel you!! I’m so nervous to go back to hot yoga with it! (It’s in my head-just need to get my butt back in that room!)\n\nand there we go lol. this is exactly why we don’t need to judge! I usually feel bad if someone has to leave b/c it’s the best part of class🥲\n\n100%!! Yes it's true that some people are rude and entitled, but others have genuine problems and reasons for leaving. But we don't know who's who, so we should keep an open mind. I LOVE savasana.\n\nBonus point for using the correct spelling of savasana 👏\n\nEither spelling is correct. Given that it is not originally an English word spelled with the Latin alphabet there is no point in deciding your way is correct.\n\nI've typed and deleted this comment so many times.  But I just can't resist any longer.  There are many systems of transliteration, and \"savasana\" is wrong in all of them.\n\nHunterian transliteration is used to Romanize numerous Indian languages, including Sanskrit.  It's the default system used for placenames by the Indian government.  It renders both श् and ष् as sh, as in \"Uttar Pradesh.\"  In that system, the orthography is \"shavasana.\"\n\nIAST is favored by academics and preserves the phonetic precision of written devanagari.  In that system s is only used to represent स् and the orthography would be \"śavāsana.\"\n\nHarvard-Kyoto Protocol was more widely used when computers were less advanced and people wanted to precisely encode devanagari in the basic Latin character set.  That system rather unfortunately uses z for श् making the orthography \"zavAsana.\"\n\nThere are many more systems, and maybe one of them uses s for श् and something else for स्, I don't know. I think about all this every time I see \"savasana\" when someone obviously means शवासन and I think about colonialism and cultural appropriation even more when I hear it pronounced \"savasana\" out loud.  I get it.  Diacritics are hard, and not everyone wants to learn Sanskrit or even just devanagari.  But I would never correct someone's pronunciation, or their spelling, unless they were one of my students, or they asked for my feedback.  So if people want to spell it \"savasana,\" or even to insist that's the *only* correct spelling, sure, have at it.  I'll just be over here, thinking about Sanskrit orthography in an increasingly globalized society.\n\n[removed]\n\nI would have expected that a colonizer attitude would demand that there's only one way to spell a thing...\n\n&gt; The fact that it is frequently misspelled doesn't mean both spellings are acceptable. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription#Criticisms\n\nI’d feel the same way, but the frustration you’re feeling is part of the pose!\n\nLove that reframe!\n\nHe , who needs it most …\n\nIt is wrong to leave during shavasana especially if you can’t do it ninja quiet. If you kno your leaving you need to be halfway to the door before the teacher finishes saying shavasana at a minimum. \n\nAgreed! My instructor says, \"find your shape\" to cue if anyone needs to quickly and quietly leave before we are are settled\n\nWhat does that phrase mean?\n\nShe means find your most comfortable shape/pose on your mat while we go into Shavasana even is it means not the actual Shavasana pose itself\n\nGet into the position and space that you feel most comfortable in for savasana (including leaving the studio).\n\nI think it’s a cue to get into whatever position you want to take Shavasana in\n\ncrow pose here I come (...not really)\n\nThe chaos! If I saw someone do that, it would stick in my brain forever\n\nCounterpoint: I think you’re ruining your OWN practice by leaving during shavasana, but it’s not some huge wrong committed against your fellow yogis. \n\nUnless you’re practicing yoga alone in a bunker, you need to expect to hear evidence of the existence of other people. If the shuffling of someone leaving the studio somehow ruins your corpse pose, consider it an opportunity to practice your mindfulness and focus.\n\nI’m fine. Thx though. I could stay still thru a nuclear blast during shavasana. If your leaving leave before shavasana has settled in. End of story. Emergencies are emergencies sure. But otherwise. Plan ahead the 5 mins needed to leave before shavasana is fully ingrained. I do agree it’s best to stay for it. But life waits for no man or woman and things happen.\n\nWell, those are your preferences, but the point is that other people and the world in general doesn't follow your preferences.\n\nWhat you control is how you react.\n\nEh nah. I’ve done savasana with mosquitos buzzing and biting me, it doesn’t matter. Nothing is owed to us even in the peaceful bliss of corpse pose 🙏 if the teacher is walking around to do oils or massages then u will hear feet creak, chances are there will be breaths, noises from outside, etc.\n\nthis is an oddly entitled way of thinking , it is their own practice just like it is ur own. Unless they are physically touching anyone else or yelling at people then it is what it is !\n\nOh goodness. I think mosquitoes are THE thing that would keep me out of savasana... I've never had that experience and I don't think I ever could.\n\nCompletely agree. \n\nIt’s the same culprits too which blows me away because they know the routine enough to leave before hand. \n\nI once had someone (current studio) spraying their mat next to me in shavasana. I was getting droplets of spray on me.\n\nTell them not to spray you\n\nTo Leave quietly without any gatekeeping on anyone else’s end is best\n\nMy studio puts everyone in shavasana and then the teacher leaves everyone to come out on their own. So often I’ll want to be in shavasana for 7-10 minutes and the first 3-5 are me listening to people shuffling and packing up their stuff to leave. \n\nI’ve learned to tune it out but at first it was really challenging. This was so different for me coming from another studio that would take people out of shavasana at the same time and close the practice together. \n\nI don’t love it, but it’s all I have for now. I always wondered if this method of queuing shavasana and not closing practice together is rooted in some teaching or a school of practice that I’m just not familiar with. \n\nIt’s a big treat when we do get the odd substitute teacher who closes practice together.\n\nThat's pretty lame. Basically the least patient person in the room decides when shavasana ends.\n\nExactly! It’s wild how many people don’t actually include shavasana in their practice at all. I’ve always been taught it’s almost more important than the actual asanas that come before\n\nSame! My studio always calls it the most important pose of all haha\n\nI took a class like that once and fell asleep, lol. The instructor had to come back and wake me up. Oops!\n\nHaha.\n\nthe whole time i’m usually thinking like “let it go inhale exhale, let it go, clear your mind” \n\nbut really im like\n🤬😤🔥💥😱🙄\n\nDisrupting Shavasana would definitely go on my list of things that annoy me in the studio- right under extremely performative Ujjayi Breathing.\n\nI only remember someone leaving during Shavasana one time and that was because the class had run on 15 minutes late already. They tried to do it quietly but it was quite disruptive. I blame the teacher for that one. I’m fortunate that I can take 15 minutes or however much longer is needed from work but many people cannot.\n\nI’ve had that happen a few times(class run late) but the instructor always owns it, announcing the end time when we are about to settle into shavasana and asking anyone to leave if they need to and to stay if they can. This has happened a few times so they’re not the most punctual or efficient with timing their class, but at least they take accountability for it\n\nI’ve done it to get to work and doctors appointments. Do enough yoga long enough, and you’ll be opting to skoot out just before the bodies hit the mat, if the difference is getting to practice vs. not.\n\nBut I’m not a sadist. I don’t leave DURING the final resting pose.\n\nI always leave my watch and phone in the car so I have no idea what time it is during yoga. That’s how I prefer it. If it runs over and causes problems then I’ll deal with it once it is over. Nothing takes away from my yoga time.\n\nI've done it one or two times, and some people do it at the timeslot I go. If the class runs for too long because the teacher some just have to go.\n\nMy ujjai gets very loud when I'm exerting myself in Ashtanga. I'm a bit self conscious about it if I go to class (I mostly practice at home). But, like, if it helps me too be able to keep up with the pace without breakibg the correct breathing, I'd say it's fine right?\n\nI do remember once after class the woman next to me said that I had a nice breath to follow, so idk,guess not disturbing then? (Top unusual compliment I've received, \"you breathe nice\")\n\nI'm not who you replied to but one of my favorite things about public classes is listening to the whole room's ujjayi breathing. That's when it actually starts to sound like \"ocean breath\" to me and I really love the vibe. All that to say I think your breathing is totally fine and you shouldn't be self conscious about it\n\nand moaning 😂\n\nPerformative ujjai 😆\n\nSome people connect deeply to their breath, and that’s kind of the point. The poses exist to help us get into the breath work. If the energy of the room (Prana) bothers you, maybe you would be more comfortable practicing at home by yourself. \n\nBut disruptive exit during savasana? Agreed: straight to jail.\n\nOmg the performative breathing 😭 my biggest pet peeve, especially if they do it WHILE in shavasana\n\nPerformative ujjayi? I think some people just breathe deeper and louder. I don’t think anyone is purposefully thinking, “I’m about to be the loudest breather in this class!” Most people are more concerned that people will notice them breathing hard and think less of them.\n\nYeah, the comment you replied to made me raise my eyebrows. How do we know someone else’s breathing is performative? This sub can be very judge mental for like no reason lol\n\nAfter hanging out in this sub for a while, I really don’t think I could even handle a public class. All those little things would also annoy me plus I know I’m going to annoy other people because I can’t get through an hour practice without peeing 75% of the time.\n\nWhen  I was the most into yoga (public classes 3-4x per week, many different teachers all over the world), I really got to appreciate imperfection. My teachers were really good with pointing it out too! Like construction workers starting up their drill during deep meditation, and the teacher laughing and saying \"this is fine, this is life, accept the challenge with a smile, the drill is now your focus point - can you feel the spaces in the vibrations?\"\n\nI was doing meditations in trains, yoga on platforms, beaches, plains, streets. I was just in this great flow while travelling, and found teachers in many countries encouraging the exploration.\n\nI've since lost touch with this deep drive, become lost in the working life, and can only reconnect during vacations, but man, that time was some of the most healing and giving in my life!\n\nThis made me chuckle bc it feels like such a niche pet peeve, but I am right there with you on the over-ujayyi 😂\n\nWent to my first bikram class recently (previously, I was exclusively a home practitioner of various forms of yoga) and lol I was not ready for the breathing.  It was so loud that it sounded like the lofi music had a track going for cueing your breath during that posture.  It was tremendously distracting (altho I guess that is part of the challenge), bordering on annoying.\n\nDon't blame him. Sometimes you have to Take a dump.\n\nafter a twist heavy practice, definitely.\n\nThis whole thread makes me laugh. Who knows what his story is or what was going on for him. \nAnd why not use it as an opportunity to deepen your own practice?\nWhy you all so caught up in policing other people’s practice? \n\nSure it’s annoying the door slammed. It’s a lot to assume that he did that deliberately\n\nThe yoga sub threads can be very…. Precious sometimes lol\nAgree, we don’t know anything about the practitioner, there are a hundred good reasons he could’ve walked out.\n\nOccasionally. Yes.\n\nI never understood how frustrating this could be until I experienced it myself. About a month ago, a new person joined the studio and started doing this. At first, it didn’t bother me much, and I tried to ignore it. However, now I’ve noticed that others who have been at the studio for a while are doing it too, and it’s really distracting because they aren’t quiet or considerate when they let the door close. I haven’t brought it up to the studio yet, but I plan to soon.\n\nThat’s why ppl need to do them but do it quietly\n\nI’m ok with this when the class has gone over the end time.\n\nI was about to say this. I’ve never left, but that’s because I don’t really ever have anywhere I need to be on time. But, when class runs over time, I don’t blame people at all. Sometimes even an extra 3-5 minutes could make someone late for something. One of the studios I go to is bad about running a full 7-10 minutes over. I’m a naturally punctual person and it annoys me and distracts from my practice because I get antsy about the time. You should be able to rely on your instructor to close the class on time.\n\nI have one teacher that always goes over like 20min of practice, I bear with it because she is really good (Dharma practice, iirc she's a student of his), but sometimes I've been tempted to go before shavasana\n\nI left early the other day for the first time ever. I typically do not go on Monday nights but there happened to be a class that started right after I had to drop my son off for practice and would end 15 min before he needed to be picked back up.  But class was running long, and the instructor knew I needed to leave on time, so she helped me quietly pack up and said she’d take care of the studio equipment. I left as quietly as I could, but it’s impossible to be totally silent. \n\nSometimes you just can’t stay, especially if class is running late. \n\nSERIOUSLY\n\nI go to one studio where the teachers always go 5+ minutes over. I'm trying to squeeze a 90 minute class into a busy day. That's hard enough without making it a 110 minute class.\n\nThey not like us\n\nWhy are you watching what others are doing? Focus your eyes and ears on your own mat.\n\nWe have no basis for making a judgment on the needs of others. The goal is to practice so that we can find that space and make that peace accessible when we need it. Consider it a lesson on bearing interrupted and settling into stillness again. Celebrate it as a gift for strengthening patience and understanding.\n\nI teach a 7am class in a gym.  I know I have people who are either going to come late or need to leave early.  I talk to them about it, and I mention in  \\*in class\\*.  \"Every teacher's policy is different, so this may not apply to someone else's class, but for my class, I trust that you will be quiet and respectful of other people's practice.  So if you need to arrive late, I trust you'll gather your props quietly and set up quietly.  If you need to leave early, I suggest packing up your stuff before we transition to savasana and I trust you'll exit quietly as well.  If you need to leave particularly early, let me know and I'll try to remind you.\"\n\nIt helps I've got a small-ish set of regulars who are there 70% of the time, and make up 90% or so of class, so they're just as likely to smile and be happy the person who walked in late was able to make it at all.\n\nAddressing this upfront, and talking to any student who isn't able to be quiet (I think I've done this something like three times in &gt;16yrs of teaching), has been effective for me and my students.\n\nI should note that this is somewhat particular to the type of class - I'm not teaching meditation.  I hold a different space for a restorative class (I'll tell them to leave their props if they have to leave early so I can take care of them).  And I let people know the \"vibe\" of the class freely, so they can choose if it fits their needs or not.\n\nWhen I was teaching I always let the students know a few minutes before shavasana was happening and if they needed to leave that this was their window.\n\nLove me shavasana. I pull down my bandana over my eyes and become one with the planet. Like liquid. Once I was so in touch I could almost feel the curve of the earth. Who would want to miss that?\n\nMaybe take some time to work on yourself. Ask why you are triggered and judging people for leaving during savasana.\n\nOr try not judging? You have no idea why someone needs to leave. Sure, it might be for a dumb reason, but it also might not. You have no clue.\n\nRight. What if they had to urgently use the bathroom? \n\nIs it more 'respectful to the shala' if I stay and sh\\*t myself?\n\nEasy guys.  Some people have shit to do…has exactly Zero to do with you and your practice.\n\nBiggest pet peeve\n\nI personally hate it. It's dumb and useless to me. I'll do nidra at home to find actual relaxation. I'm getting nothing from 2-5 mins of laying there after a power class. I don't leave as I don't want to disturb others but I totally get wanting to leave.\n\nI give in a lot of the time and get on with it, but I don't enjoy savasana at all 😆 I usually sit up and relax and connect with my body in that way, after an hour of moving my body it is hard to just lay there 'relaxing'.\n\nSame! I think a very gentle class I might enjoy it but after something like power I can't just go from 100 -&gt; 0 that quickly.\n\nYou guys are such snobs sometimes ppl have more to doing their day than lay on the ground\n\nEvery time I’ve left yoga early was because of…. uh… cantankerous digestion.\n\nSometimes I have to if class runs long and I have another time commitment shortly after. \n\nIt is what it is. Sometimes I don’t have to run out but others do, and I feel compassionate about their situation that day, because I’ve lived it.\n\nDrake is a pedophile. No reason to use his image.\n\n☝️\n\nThat’s hilarious!\n\nI honestly don’t mind challenging myself to tune out what’s going on around me while maintaining my peace and grounding. I’ve intentionally signed up for a group class and can’t control what others do so I take it as a challenge to maintain my meditation despite it all.\n\nLife long studio ban is the least\n\nHa! I had to do this once! Needed to catch a train. The studio told me it was rude and I shouldn't do it again, I get where they're coming from, but I really had to catch that train.\n\nIf someone leaves during Savasana, take it as a challenge to be not so reactive to the outside world.\n\nEdit: I wanna send this to my yoga teacher buddies but I'm afraid they'll see Drake and it will disturb them lol\n\nAll that stretchin, twistin, and bending packed in just 45 mins makes one wanna use the loo, pronto! Better than holdin it in and lying shavasana pose\n\nYou had to use a pic of a disgusting creepy groomer for this?\n\nI‘ve always hated shavasana. Loathe it. Skip it when I’m practicing at home. Be the first to pop up when the teacher announced that we could stay as long as we’d like, but class is now concluded.\n\nHaving said all that, I’d never leave in the middle of it in a class setting. Barring outside obligations and class running over, that’s rude.\n\nTo all the downvoters: Lying flat on my back is deeply painful, and I've never had a teacher outside of a yin class indicate that you can adjust your position. In most classes I've been in, even the most \"here are the variations of every pose\" teacher will insist on savasana being a quite particular way.  \n  \nI also find that nothing like rest, relaxation, or digestion happens for me in savasana. Rather, every single thought I'd not had during the rest of practice felt like it had to make its presence known. Usually all at the same time. Five minutes of non-stop obtrusive and banal thoughts? No, thank you.\n\nSome can’t say depending on what is going on.  Chill. Focus on you\n\nA person should try to melt into - or out of - a class as stealthily as possible as to not disturb others.\n\nAs an instructor, the only people that bother me are the people that do it every single class- and I know it’s not bc they have to hurry out. It’s bc they just don’t like it\n\nI once left during shavasana because the instructor had chose the worst possible song for it. But otherwise, why not stay?\n\nMaybe they had an appointment\n\nI've had teachers ask people who don't want to wait the 3 minutes for savasana (no H, BTW) to pack up and leave during the closing asanas prior to savasana. So by the time savasana starts, those people have already left.\n\nCorpse-pose\n\nI’ve never left but it is honestly the hardest part of the practice for me. I can never quiet my mind.\n\nShavasana means get the hell going in Hindi\n\nPeople at my studio do this. The studio makes a lot of money on the hot Pilates crowd so their culture developed to be a little more active and chatty than other studios I’ve gone to. I’ve learned to tune it out, as it’s not too frequent…but what really gets me, every time, is that because they applaud each other at the end of a hyped up Pilates class, they’ve developed a weird habit of applauding at the end of savasana, after the “namaste”… \n\nIm often still on my back soaking it up and I find it so jarring. Why applaud when you can just say a quiet “thank you” to preserve the peace? I breathe through it, snap my fingers in solidarity, and hold my tongue about it, but I often wish I didn’t have to. I got nothing against applause at the end of an adrenaline-pumped Pilates class, but savasana is *sacred*.\n\nYes to get a beard trim\n\nI only do it if I’m late for work\n\nguilty, sometimes. :(\n\nI never have the patience 😭😭\n\nA lot of haters on this sub. Ironic really.\n\nThis has happened in a class I was in. I had one lady have her phone on sound and then TOOK A CALL. During class.\n\nDrizzy jump scare\n\nI've had to dip out at shavasana a couple of times due to appointments. I've let the instructor know ahead of time, set myself up near the door, and left quietly.\n\nShavasana has been one of the most transformational poses for me. I often meditate on the literal nature of the corpse pose. As in, the life we live each day is challenging and rewarding and has its ups and downs and cycles and patterns and sometimes you feel elation and sometimes frustration and at the end, the ideal outcome or  death is a peaceful letting go of the struggle and a truly well earned rest.\n\nI basically go to classes specifically for shavasana 😭\n\nIt’s an important part of setting sacred space around your practice. Ppl that don’t make time for the entire practice are really doing themselves a disservice.\n\nHonestly I take a 6am class and there are a decent amount of us who pack up right when savasana starts due to having to be at work for 8am, with class ending at 7 that extra 5-10 mins really makes a difference! The teacher is very understanding g as is everyone in the class.\n\nWhy are we still using this pedo for memes?\n\nThat's the best part!\n\nLeaving early is like the opposite of practicing mindfulness, but then so is criticizing someone for leaving early.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nI have to leave early because my gym's child care ends five minutes before yoga ends! I tiptoe out of the open door, do a silent Namaste to the instructor, and always feel so bad.\n\nMe to myself when I skip shavasana every single time (I only practice at home, and solo after the gym, the only person I'm disturbing is myself)\n\nI read the op several different times with imaginary punctuation placed in several places and still need a translation.\n\nThe people who leave during Shavasnana are the ones who need it the most.\n\nDoor slam or not, it's incredibly rude to leave during when you KNOW it's the time everyone is trying to zone out quietly. It doesnt even last that long so if you 'feedstock leave that little bit early then you didnt have time for the class anyway\n\nIf this person had left quietly would it be such a big deal?\n\nShavasana is the best part ❤️\n\nWho does that 😂😅\n\nShavasana is not always necessary for all people.\n\nI don't have anything to add that hasn't been said, so I'll just say I would love more yoga memes. Namaste.\n\nSome jerk in my studio had his Apple Watch announce his exercise stats during Shavasana a couple times before somebody finally talked to him 😤\n\nI hate when people do this in general. \n\nI did have an early morning class where it was expected behavior because a lot of people left early to get to work. Trains and meetings don’t care what time yoga class ends.\n\nExactly so it shouldn’t bother you\n\nAnd miss the chance that you’ll get a Savasana assist??  (I got one today…..they are so lovely)\n\nMaybe he was not familiar with the door? Maybe he has something traumatic going on in his life?\n\nWhy is it always the people who need meditation the most are never going to do meditation? Cruel fate.\n\nI have had this happen probably over 6/7x in the studio I go to. There’s one guy specifically always leaves when shavasana starts…\n\nAnd? He likely has things to do\n\nFirst of all, you’re rude with that attitude. Secondly, he leaves every single time. He’s done this in every class I’ve been to where he’s there, he just packs up as soon as someone says shavasana. You’re telling me he has something to do at different times of the day and they all align with shavasana? Wow. Thanks for the insight!\n\nAt the beginning of my classes I always say \"if you have a phone or smartwatch please place it on silent. If you need to leave before or during savasana please place your mat closer to the door. \nOne time had a lady leave and she was kind loud. She didn't want to miss another class and messed up the time. Apparently while she was waiting outside for another class another gym membership came up to her and ripped into her for leaving during savasana and disturbing her. The lady came in to tell me because she was all flustered and felt so bad. I appreciated her coming in and explained the reasoning. But I think the lady that laid into her did it super loud and was really pissed.\n\none time I came into a yoga studio and I asked another student in the lobby what she thought of the class and in a very upper crust British accent she replied, \"It's ok, but of course I don't stay for the 'sleepy-time'\" - I guess reflecting on her practice wasn't a thing?\n\nRight? It's not like most classes cue a significant savasana - if you have an hour to give to class, then you have 3 min to chill at the end of class. Fr, I get tight schedules, but if you really are *that* tight fit time, wouldn't you be better served by saving the time driving to the studio, changing into yoga clothes, then driving home? The lack of self awareness for how very rude it is. You and your schedule are not *that* important that 3 minutes is going to break your life🙄\n\nThis entire thread has me feeling like I'm on crazy pills. The top comments are all saying the same thing and mine are being downvoted because I'm late to the party? It's incredibly rude to leave during class and if you can't carve out literally 3 more minutes to avoid being rude then that makes you selfish with bad time management and I stand by that. You can downvote all you want because you want to retain your lack of self awareness. Part of yoga is practicing your ahimsa and deliberately disrupting everyone else's practice is not that.\n\nAfter a hot yoga class some people would hustle out during savasana because so many people wanted to shower and you’d end up waiting in line for the showers.\n\nYes my doc appt is that important. Esp when I can’t get a better class time, traffic is tight, and I need to get my yoga fix, and wont be able to return later. Most teachers aren’t that uptight…focus on you.\n\nThen get your yoga fix at home? It's not appropriate to ruin someone else's day when you know you don't have 3 minutes to stay in savasana.\n\nFor the record, a singular doctor's appointment is fine if you're leaving once, but there are people that literally do this every single class they take. It's sending an incredibly disrespectful message to everyone when they choose that every class. Savasana is part of the class for a reason and the option is to accept it or not. It would be rude to leave partway through any other class - so why is it magically fine for yoga?\n\nWhile I understand your point of view- Try to have compassion for other’s situation. Other people leaving early is an opportunity for inner reflection and to practice patience.\n\nI find it strange that instructors leave then. I get it, that they should be at the desk for anyone leaving, and I think if they stay it keeps people in the room and in the pose\n\nI used to teach and that shit drove me crazy, not cool to disturb the vibe just keep it in your pants for freaking five minutes 🤷\n\nGlad you’re not teaching anymore\n\n[removed]\n\nThose who have had things come up or stuff that needs to be done.  Those who can’t get to another class or change something else in their schedule. The better question is-who does not live in the real world to understand not everyone has the same schedule as them?\n\nHi. Just as padmasana is a good start , so too is savasana a classic Closure. A time to  calmly reflect on the practice the exploration the challenge the outcomes and the questions. Without reflection, the practice is an empty shell the impact lost. \n\nYoga is not something you go to to sweat and then leave behind. It is a way of life  that becomes your guiding star. It joins the separate parts to a cohesive balance complete whole. Embrace it and release your restraints. Open your senses to every possibility. Recognise your full potential.  Happy journey. Only the practitioner can determine their path because  we are all unique with unique need. Enjoy, for you are already on your path. It has many places for you to explore, and they are all within.\n\nNamaste\n\nI’ve done this for no reason before and I feel like the instructor gives me looks"

So I was recommended this YouTube channel which I’m sure all of you know already. \n\nI bought an Amazon basic mat and have already done 2 sessions and feel better already.  \n\nThe mental and physical connection of yoga is something I am really enjoying. The mindfulness of this is unreal. \n\nI feel like I’ve been living inside my own head so long. \n\nAnyways, just wanted to share my new found appreciation for yoga with people who will get it. \n\nMaybe after a few more weeks of YouTube videos I’ll get the confidence to go to a studio.

    "all_comment_text": "she was my intro to yoga as well and i still return to her regularly, love her:)\n\nShe's fantastic for beginners. I started with her channel. and never needed anything else\n\nShe was my into in lockdown. I still go back to her when I've had a break. Thanks adrienne!\n\nSame! I now do her 30 day program every January!\n\noh thanks for reminding me, i definitely need to do this years!\n\nThe Queen of Covid\n\nThat’s wonderful to hear! She helped change my life. I began with her on January 1, 2023 with her 30-day yoga challenge. Just last week I applied and got accepted for yoga teacher training. After decades of struggling with mental health issues such as depression, trauma, anxiety, Yoga has helped alleviate it all, has brought me peace and back into my body. And I am healthier and stronger than ever before. Truly transformative.\n\nI love this.\n\nThis comment alone is inspiring! I must look up this YouTuber! I have a YT workout girl I follow, but not for yoga (although I've been interested)\n\nmy experience is very similar, 10/10 recommend!\n\nI love hearing this. I’m so happy for you!\n\nShe does a lovely 30 day challenge every January. It’s a great place to start\n\nI’m so happy that my comment is inspiring to you. Adriene is very generous with her content and I highly recommend doing the 30-day challenge that she begins every January 1. It really helps create that habit which allows yoga to become a sustainable and beneficial practice in our lives.\n\nI’m genuinely so happy for you and this journey you’ve been on. Wow!\n\nThank you! Me too. I look back at my life and how it was over two years ago and that hopelessness that I felt. That hopelessness that I had felt for decades that I did not think could possibly ever shift. And yoga helped it shift. And helped it lift. I am very grateful.\n\nI started with YWA about 3 years ago and I still practice with her at least 5 days a week.  She’s the best!  I appreciate her positivity and care but mostly her general goofiness\n\n[deleted]\n\nBenji forever!\n\nShe’s got this gentle charisma that makes learning easy. And I love Benji!\n\nI’m a therapist and yoga teacher and recommend her to clients often! I’m happy you are benefiting from your practice ☺️\n\nSame!!!! Especially to trauma clients.\n\nI always feel like I’ve had a therapy session after one of her videos!\n\nMe too! I work in an IOP with high acuity teens and adults, and she’s always who I recommend when folx ask for recommendations to keep practicing once they discharge!\n\nI feel like I’ve been living inside my own head for so long. \n\nIsn’t it *such* a relief to get outta your head and into your body? This is the very best part of yoga, for me. Such a boon for anyone carrying trauma. Welcome and namaste!\n\nCheck out Kassandra and James, Tim and Charlie Follows as well, all on YouTube. Kassandra will always be my favorite💜\n\nYes!! Adriene is fine but Kassandra is sooo good\n\nKassandra is the best and most gentle!\n\nI also started my yoga journey with Adriene because I was curious but too shy to go to a studio! It’s been six years and I’m in training to become a teacher now. You’re starting a wonderful journey back to yourself, welcome to yoga :) \n\nI’ve been attending a gentle/beginner yoga class locally. Almost the entire class is older men (I am a middle age woman). You would be surprised how many people are like you: just happy they made it to the mat, no judgment. One fella is inspirational to me because he is really quite poorly with lots of pain and restrictions (he shares it before class) and yup, there he is! \n\nGo when/if you are ready. I also loved Adrienne during Covid.\n\nNo she really is just the best. I started with her in 2020 during lockdown and she helped me SO MUCH and I still regularly do her sessions!! She is just the absolute BEST.\n\nSo are you!\n\nI've been using her channel (and a couple others) for years; she was a great intro to yoga after years away from the practice. I'll offer this up, too, OP. I do yoga almost daily and have zero interest in a class. If you're wanting to go to a studio because that feels good to you, by all means. But attending a class doesn't have to be a main goal, and if you decide never to do that, and have a home practice, you're still doing yoga and that's still awesome. Enjoy the journey!\n\nYes, I came here to say the same. Yoga definitely does not have to be a group activity. I love practicing alone and I have zero interest in going back to a studio.\n\nShe saved my sanity when I discovered her and made me love yoga. She’s wonderful. I love her calm, sweet energy.\n\nI've been doing yoga for almost 40 years and I will say that Adriane's yoga channel is one of the once I turn to quite often if I want to guided practice.\n\nyoga with Adriene was where it all began for me so many years ago. anytime I have sciatic pain, I return to her. I always recommend her for beginners. amazing you are finding what feels good on the mat, welcome yourself to the practice again and again\n\nThank you 😊\n\nI still find the most joy out of my at home practice. widespread panic playing, pre-yoga dabs, and whatever class I want at the time of day that works for me. pause it and feel the music and repeat the flow as many times as you want... there is no \"right way\" and going into a studio can feel a little intimidating, but you'll find what works best for you\n\nLove your attitude!\n\nYoga is great for us older guys. You should try a yoga class in a studio.\n\nWorking my way up to it. I’m concerned with just YouTube that I’m doing a form wrong or something but also trying to not overthink it either and just go with it.\n\nlearning correct form makes the whole thing better.   but doing ANY yoga is the most important bit.\n\nI'm a 500hr teacher, and that's a great attitude. Think about the poses more as tools to help you feel sensations and to stretch, strengthen or relax - depending on the focus. If you have a blanket, books or blocks and a strap, props are wonderful for helping us access the tools. The most important thing is breath work, or pranayama. Once you settle into the pose, focus on those deep, long inhales and exhales - that's the magic that relaxed the body and settles our nervous system. If the pose feels good in your body, and you can breathe yoga breaths, you are doing it well. If not, skip it, pull back or modify your position. This part is very important - we learn to trust our limits. If you can keep your mind on your movements, it also keeps you present. :) I teach adults with all sorts of disabilities and we can find a pose for everyone.\n\nI totally get wanting to have your form locked in before doing yoga publicly, but getting in front of a teacher is the best way to get form corrected. Try to get there early so you can get a spot in the back if you’re shy, and go intro yourself to the teacher. Let them know where you’re at in your yoga journey, and that you are interested in getting form corrections. You can go at your own pace, take breaks when you need, and the teacher will gently help you make form adjustments and modifications so you can improve your practice. There’s also something uniquely powerful and energizing about practicing with others.\n\nThat’s exactly what I did. Did it at home for over a year before branching out into the studio. However you do it, however it works for you, works.\n\nSuggest Cherryblossom Yoga with Robin Dinerman on YouTube. Safety first. Gentle yoga good for beginners and seniors.\n\nI have been doing her videos every day for five months now and will start at a studio in January. She gave me the confidence to rock up and join in.\n\nI love Adrienne and Benji! Such sweet, calming, peaceful energy.\n\nShe's the gateway drug for YouTube yoga \n\nYay so happy for you, stick at it. Keep the ego out of it and just practice for your piece of mind\n\nAdriene changed my life!! Had done yoga for years before discovering YWA. I have been doing her videos 5x/week for almost five years now. I get emotional thinking what YWA has done for me. It’s a constant I always come back to. So happy for you and the start of your journey!!\n\nI love this for you.\n\nSame! I started at the beginning of the pandemic, around April of 2020. I've kept it up, 5x a week. I have other favorite YT yoga instructors now as well but I always end up coming back to YWA. She's done a lot to help me sleep and calm anxiety.\n\nThat’s great that you noticed that you’ve been living inside your head. Now get to know your body.\n\nI love YWA. I started doing more Peloton yoga classes because I have a Peloton membership, but revisited YWA recently and I was like wait…. why did I neglect my girl for so long? The new restorative practice she uploaded this week was so perfect. She is so peaceful and calming. \n\nShe is great! DoYogaWithMe.com is also another great platform for online classes. Cheers on cultivating your home practice!\n\nI like her, too! She's a little chatty, so I need to take a break every once in a while, but I love her monthly schedules and her flows/lesson plans are spectacular. I feel taller and more loose after every single one\n\nSame!  I really like yoga with Kassandra as an alternative.\n\nThat’s a great introduction to yoga.  As an older guy who found yoga later in life I cannot recommend finding a studio more.  There is nothing to be embarrassed about.   Yoga is one of the most accepting communities of everyone in their various states of fitness.  A teacher can help you with poses and accommodations/adjustments to help you get the most out of your practice.  Plus the community and connection from in person classes are just an aspect of yoga that online classes can’t replicate.\n\nWhy pay for something you can get for free on YouTube. Check out your local recreation centers, too!!\n\nI like how she uses humor. Always cracking up\n\n6 years strong with ywa 🥰 i never watch anybody else for my home practice\n\nHer breathing techniques are awesome too!! As a total novice I get so much out of her videos\n\nThe hardest part of going in studio is getting to class-just keep that in mind. Once class is over, you’ll be so glad you showed up for yourself!\n\nI do love Adrienne but there’s nothing like yoga in a real yoga studio! A lot of them offer virtual classes as well that might be a good next step for you!\n\nIf you’re in the US and there’s a YMCA near you they offer yoga classes free with membership but day passes are pretty cheap too. Very beginner friendly and the classes are mixed with beginners and more advanced students of all ages and sizes.\n\nshe is my favorite and I always recommend her page to everyone that asks me how to get into yoga!!!\n\nI've been doing yoga for a few years now and I still pop her videos on now and then for something light and fun. Her gimmicks always make me laugh.\n\nShe's the best. I just switched to DownDog but Adrienne and Benji are great :)\n\nI started yoga before yoga with adriene was a thing but I remember starting and the only thing that got me to the studio was having a friend who was also a newbie who went with me. I'm glad you found a safe way to enter the world of yoga- Welcome! 🙏🏽🕊️\n\nShe’s what got me started doing yoga 2 years ago on her YouTube channel. I now subscribe to her app &amp; I do a 30 day every morning then the calendar yoga at night.  Definitely changed my life (and body &amp; mind)  for the better.\n\nI’m so happy for you!!! Keep going!!!🤗\n\nThank you! What a lovely community I stumbled into.\n\nI’m glad you’ve gotten so much out of starting a yoga practice! Adriene’s classes are really nice and she’s got specific classes for whatever ails you! \n\nMy personal favorite is Two Birds Yoga. Also on YouTube. Fiona, the teacher, is amazing. She’s got such a kind and generous nature to her. I do one of her classes nearly every morning. Best way to start my day! I’ve been on a Fiona kick for a couple of years now. Before her I was super into Yoga with Tim. Occasionally I’ll go back and do some of his classes. He gives really good form cues and was integral in helping me in my early days of yoga. \n\nAnyways, keep on practicing and have fun!\n\nShe is amazing! I love how relatable she is.\n\nI'm about to start doing her 30 day. Are you doing this in the morning, before bed, or somewhere in between?\n\nI’m doing it in the morning so far.\n\nBohobeautiful is awesome too\n\nI love herrr 🥹🥹🥹 her energy is so sweet and quirky she doesn't take herself too seriously and it's really refreshing. I think she's a gemini so it makes sense lol\n\nHer attitude is everything\n\nShe's my favorite too! Awesome person who uplifts and helps keep me on track. And I can't get enough of Benji!\n\nI know!\n\nShe really is the best. I love her videos.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou’re so sweet. I’m looking forward to gaining your confidence.\n\nLove her so much! Her bedtime yoga is on repeat in my house (should probably have it memorized by now, but don't). Her vocal cues and ability to teach is amazing.\n\nI have practiced for years and trained as a teacher (even taught for a while) and I still do her videos. Love her simple approach and humor\n\nF46. I’m basically ripped. That’s yoga. I try to tell people but people hate to hear me blabber about it, I love this community. Yoga is special. I can’t preach enough.\n\nShe is wonderful. The Fred Rogers of yoga\n\nI still practice some of her older videos. I’ve missed the last couple years of her 30-day new years programs, but she keeps them up. Can’t wait to try\n\n$12 Amazon mat and Yoga with Adrienne is exactly how I got my start!\n\nhave to credit yoga with Adrienne for leading me to COACH Sean Vigue (YouTube algorithm).\n\nif you're a dude who just wants a good stretch with some dad jokes sprinkled in (heresy, I know!) give Sean a sub, he's my favorite yoga dad.\n\nI've gotten back into yoga thru Adriene on YT. My anxiety has been thru the roof and she is a great teacher. I am back at beginner stage ( Never really left it tbh) and it helps so much. Yay for Adriene!\n\nI love her so much,she’s helped me tremendously.\n\nBefore Covid I worked at an orthopedic clinic and the doctors would regularly recommend her videos specifically for people with shoulder and hip issues. Finally I gave in and used Adriene videos for a full year of practice before switching to the Down Dog app for more randomized sequences. But there’s something so calming about her presence. And she has so many videos for different intentions/focuses. Awesome stuff.\n\nI love Yoga with Adriene too and I hope she knows how much we all love and appreciate her \n\nI hope so too!\n\nI’m so happy for you that you found a way to yoga, you’re doing it, and that you’re experiencing benefits🌞\n\n😊 thank you. What an amazing community this is.\n\nYWA is the best. I subscribe to her FWFG app because I’ve been doing her videos for so many years! There’s also a great subreddit just for YWA: r/yogawithadriene\n\nI love Adriene! She has a yoga session for every situation. Yoga for neck pain, yoga for overthinking, yoga for gardeners - you name it, she has a practice for it. I always return to her videos, and her FWFG app is awesome.\n\nFantastic to hear! She absolutely helped me through the first year of Covid and my divorce- so glad you’re having a good experience!\n\nThis is how I started consistently practicing yoga 8 or 9 years ago. Truly had an effect on my life and well being. Grateful for that.\n\nYoga with Bird is also another great channel especially for those just starting, or with disabilities/limitations.\n\nOkay, time to go back to yoga again. Happy for you man!\n\nYoga with Adrienne has been my go to for the past week 😌\n\nI just did my third day in a row 😊😊\n\nYes! I love her. I was also too scared to go to class and started with her lessons.  Eventually I became brave enough for private lessons but I still practice with her daily.\n\nWhen I'm struggling with everything, I do the same video day after day until I feel confident to move to another one. So, a 30-day yoga challenge will last a couple of months, but as Adriene says, I showed up to the mat.\n\nI love this attitude 😊\n\nHi, OP! I’m the largest woman at my studio (both locations of it in fact), so I understand. But I can honestly tell you that not once has anyone made me *feel* that way. At a gym I always felt so glaringly out of place. In the studio everyone has been so wonderful. It may help that in my area we have a lot of older people, so the instructors are accustomed to helping with a lot of modifications.\n\nAnyway, I’m happy you found yoga, and I hope you can feel comfortable giving a studio a try. It is one of the best things I’ve ever done. 💗\n\nI always watch her videos when I’m doing yoga. I love her content and she’s such a pleasure!\n\nGreat minds think alike. :)\n\nI believe she's the best for starting out! She's funny and I like that she doesn't say anything too woo woo like some other yoga youtubers who make me roll my eyes😁\n\nDon't worry about going to the studio. There will be people of all shapes and fitness levels. You won't be judged and you will love it.\n\nShe's fantastic! Happy you are already feeling into it. It is a great ongoing practice and even when I repeat one of her same videos, I may get something different out of it every time. Enjoy your yoga journey 🙏\n\nThank you!\n\nI love her! I started doing her yoga videos 2 years ago because i was in a deep depression and had so much anxiety and have been doing her videos daily ever since. I'm so happy for you and your yoga journey :)\n\nThank you. I’m happy for you too!\n\nLate to the party but this is exactly how I started yoga six years ago. Too much anxiety to go to a studio. so I started with Adrienne at home and then two months later I went to my gym and did classes there. \n\nIt was so cathartic, so helpful to me in every way and it got me through an incredibly painful divorce. The breathing and the flows kept me sane.\n\nI was a gym rat and had practiced yoga but not consistently. During lockdown I needed to find something, I started one of her 30 day journeys in July 2020 and I’ve been practicing EVERY day since. I also attended the 200 hr YTT at her studio in Austin TX (shout out to Rey!). And I’ll be graduating with my 500 hr certification this spring at Kripalu. Yoga 1000% changed my life.\n\nShe’s the best for introduction for sure\n\nI started with Adrienne, and then moved onto the DownDogYoga app which I've been doing for years. I've never been to a yoga studio - can't afford it, nor do I have the courage.\n\nI love Yoga with Adriene. I'm 20 days into her 30 day Move sessions. I try to do a video every day &amp; have felt amazing successes!!\n\n&gt; I’m a mostly out of shape man who is too shy to go into a studio so far\n\n\nYoga isn't for just thin, fit people. Half of most of my classes are overweight and unfit people. \n\nI love YWA! I started with Yoga with Kassandra, but I love Adriene. Shes my go to for yoga videos (:\n\nI’ve been using her videos the past year and have gone through ~4 30 days series. She puts out an easy to follow beginner format that is very easy to keep up with. I don’t plan to stop.\n\nI love YWA, but I now spend most of my time in a very remote area with no internet. Is there a yoga dvd series anyone can recommend that is sitting Yoga with Adrienne?\n\nHer weekly emails are a nice way to start off the week as well!\n\nI love her because she’s constantly affirming that all we need to do is show up. Many days it’s all I can do and it feels great to know that’s okay :)\n\nI love doing yoga with Adrienne. Makes you in such a good headspace before lifting. I also love yoga in general\n\nAnd Benji! Love them so much, always get me back on the mat in January for the 30 day.\n\nJust be that dude and take yourself lightly.\n\nFabulous Adrienne....\n\nLove Adriene!  She has helped me get through the last five years.\n\nWhy are you complexed to go to a studio? What I hear is: \"When I get good, I won't be ashamed of showing my skill level in public.\" \n\nSkill is whatever you repeat. Everybody with skill accepts people who just started because we were all new at some point. People aren't judging and if they are who cares? Most are too busy worrying what others will think of them anyway. I know I do!\n\nI love everything about her! \nHer yoga for sciatica saved me many times and her runners cool down is my go to maintenance ❤️ \nI know it’s sounds ridiculous but I miss her like a friend when I neglect to do yoga\n\nI love it too! I started yoga IRL but nowadays I travel too much to have a consistent studio practice. Adriene is with me even in random hotel rooms. I love her videos both from a workout perspective and for the mindset bits she shares. And any video with a dog is a winner for me!\n\nFor those looking forward to 30 Days of Yoga in 2025, be aware that early in 2024, Adrienne said that would be her last 30 day yoga journey for a while. Of course there are several of those 30 days playlists on YouTube to go back to from previous years, as well as other YouTube teachers to try.\n\nI saw someone say that she is the US’s universal healthcare 😂\n\nLove and peace brother ❤️\n\nShe rocks!\n\nI pretend I have a dog too! I always stretch for the Glory of God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Angels, Source, Spirit\nThen utilize the breath as the light of awareness, breathing into the muscles getting stretched. Breathing out tension. The trauma, stress, and addictive nature get stretched out of my muscles. \n\nRemember yoga is the science of God realization, and unification with God. Its more than just asanas! \n\nLook up Paramahansa Yogananda. \nAnd Eckhart Tolle The Power of Now. This book will help you to be your true self which is truth, love, bliss, peace, harmony. \nWhat is not yourself is the voice of the mind!\n\nsomething that i appreciate is her always offering modifications and gentle, kind reminders to not push your limits. i have hypermobility issues and can easily injure myself trying to meet/overexert a lot of positions if im not careful, but shes always very mindful about reminding the viewer not to do that and its so helpful. ive fallen out of my practicing for the last while, im gonna take this as my sign to let her guide my mind and body back to a more optimal place. 🥂\n\nI’ve been a daily YWA follower since the pandemic. She is truly amazing! ❤️\n\nShe gets everyone started and she does it really well.\n\nShe is AMAZING!!  My (previously very bad back) has never felt better. I AM STRONG!  Love Yoga with Adriene!\n\nI love her videos! She’s so down to earth and funny, and I always get relief from aches and pains after doing one of the routines\n\nI started with YWA 9 years ago and still practice yoga daily to this day!  I call her my first yoga teacher and return to her practices when I need them.  She came to LA several years ago and I got to take a live class from her.  She has transformed my life!\n\nCan anyone recommend a good sequence of her videos for beginners? I do like her and her practices, but sometimes I find certain videos are too slow and certain videos are too much. She has so much content now I don’t know where to start.\n\nI personally liked starting with her most recent 30 day sequence “Flow.” I also like any of the “morning” videos because they are generally pretty mellow and were a great start to the day. If you want something a little longer or more intense/targeted on certain days, “Rose Yoga” is a good one or any of the ab-related ones (ex: Center - Fan or Yoga Camp - I am Supported). \n\nI haven’t watched them yet, but she always calls out her “Foundations of Yoga” videos for beginners. \n\nYou can basically just search for something based on your mood or state of mind, even anxiety, illness and hangovers, haha.\n\nI completely credit her with saving my mind during covid and bringing me back to yoga after stopping it for over 10 years when I had my son. I loved her soooo much and she reminded me how much I had loved my yoga practice. As soon as I could once we werent locked down I took it up again and now practice regularly in a studio.\n\nIncredible!\n\nI love her videos! I've been following her 30 day challenges for years!\n\nShe is the Bob Ross of our generation 💚\n\nShe changed my life about and when I finally got my partner to tune in and she changed his too! Love her and Benji\n\ni do yoga with adriene every day! :)\n\nDo you have a local government owned recreation center? The city near me has several (gyms). They offer yoga for $4 and because of the time (8:30 am) most of the participants are older people. I love it because I’m 40 and out of shape so I don’t feel so self conscious. "

    "all_comment_text": "I'd like to see more yoga space on here actually. They're inspiring.\n\nTrue\n\nThis is so lovely\n\nGreat space! If you don't have pets, I would suggest some Himalayan salt lamps for ambiance.\n\nYeah I already thought about that, won’t have the space forever anyways, as soon as my soon need his own room this space is gone but till then I enjoy it.\n\nIt’s really beautiful! Do you listen to music or sounds when you practice/meditate? Or in silence? I think of ambient music when I look at it.\n\nI listen to music at the end when I’m in shavasana :)\n\nAwesome!! 🙌so do I … I have a LONG list of tunes\n\nPlease share your list!\n\nI DJ and collect music. I create different playlists for different classes. I try and create a journey the same way I would for a set. From setting an intention… steadily building BPM to peak pose, then back down to savasana. You can get quite creative with it and match sequences and flows to the BPM; and go as micro as you like. They are personal for me … and what I think would work for a particular group. Everyone’s would be different though so I’ve never shared any of them.\n \nFor Yin classes I use mainly music from my ambient collection. \n\nI’ve found it’s better to design it specifically for a class, with a little bit of my own taste in it. Just like a DJ set. \n\nThe most important thing for me is that it compliments the class rather than being a distraction.\n\nSorry, why can’t they have the lamps if they have pets?\n\nThey are toxic for cats if they lick them\n\nThey'll lick them and become sick\n\nI am so envious I can’t even look at this. \n\nSuper happy for you! It looks perfect! \n\nJust also wildly envious.\n\nAs someone living in a tiny apartment, same. \n\nHoping one day I can have a space like OPs\n\nI wish I could have this but my guest bedroom is where my cat eats and poops\n\nHaha Cat yoga is a thing isn’t it?\n\nIt is! She visits me on my mat in the living room :3\n\nThat’s worth the poop ;)\n\nHahaha same!!\n\nMy guest bedroom is where my cat poops and I do yoga, so my mat is always covered in litter 😁\n\nCozy!\n\nCan I join your yoga space? Lol\n\nAs this is an English speaking sub I guess it’s way tooo far away.\n\nAh, you are a fellow German :)) \nUnd ich dachte beim ersten Hinsehen noch \"ist das das Poster von Mady?\" .. Wie schön!\n\nYour room is really lovely!\n\nDanke\n\nWow I have just floor next to my bed... :( Wow thats amazing! Embrace it and be thankful!\n\nThankful for our house every day\n\nGood for you! I'm very happy for you!! :)\n\nI love the chair. So much space to relax. Super meditative.\n\nso envious, I can only imagine how relaxing this is\n\nOh I love this! How I wish for hardwood floors. This is a lovely space.\n\nThere the original ones, about 100 years old\n\nThe tears in my eyes. That just made this post 100x better for me.\n\nLove the couch. Does it fold outwards to lay down?\n\nNo unfortunately not\n\nThis is beautiful! I'd never want to leave!\n\nI love everything about it.\n\nWow gorgeous\n\nPerfect room for yoga and meditation.\n\nThis looks so relaxing!\n\nThis is gorgeous! So earthy and cozy looking. I also LOVE the sun and moon salutation art! \n\nQuestion- do you practice the moon salutation? \nIn all my years of yoga I have not but it’s been calling to me lately.\n\nDone it a few times but to me it doesn’t feel as flowing as the sun so not my favourite\n\nThe earthy Color is because the walls are clay, which is also super healthy\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xzx0m6y6b01e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad31f723f2a121343ffd66c867503be395f1d5f8\n\nThis is my student's practice space♡\n\nLovely\n\nThank you. Your space looks so serene.\n\nI love this spot!\n\nI love rang chair. Seems so comfy for book reading as well.\n\nLovely 🤍\n\nDas ist aber unsere lehmbude von r/wohnkultur! Looks beautiful!\n\nJa ist sie xD danke\n\nLooks so peaceful! I love your couch where is it from\n\nThat's really beautiful.  I don't have a yoga space though I have the room.  Maybe I'll play around with the idea.\n\nVery cool space, relaxing vibe. \n\nIt reminds me of those memes though, where it’s like “[any gender] don’t understand that THIS is all [diff gender] need to be happy.”\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous\n\nI love you space, I’m obsessed with the vibes\n\nI need this!\n\nThat looks super zen, nice setup!\n\nLove it!\n\nI’m jealous! That looks like the perfect yoga space!\n\nThis is so beautiful and calming. Saving for aspiration and inspiration!\n\nyour yoga space is well-designed for a good session! like, i can feel all these calm vibes from the image alone\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/616ihag2c01e1.jpeg?width=3213&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b79dd690573c39e20a200d30b3504998b06dd86a\n\nLove your space so much ✨ Not as cozy as yours but this is my practice space when not doing headstand :)\n\nI love that you can look outside and there even is nature 💚my windows are towards the street, it’s second floor but still street.\n\n🔥🔥🔥\n\nThis is so great to see &amp; inspiring. I also wanna have this as my yoga space one day.\n\nAmazing\n\nStunning!\n\nLove it!! 😍the lights, illumination, perfect!\n\nI love it! It's lovely\n\nThat is nice looking. \n\nI like nature and when I go to class I like to open the blinds cuz there is water, trees, and grass out there.\n\nIf there only was nature behind this blinds :O\n\nI figured as much. 😂. All good. One of our class members actually wore sunglasses once. I am talking barely open blinds. Oh well, maybe she just had her eyes dilated…..\n\nI love this !!\n\nI love this and didn’t know I wanted this until now.\n\nExquisite\n\nI feel calmer already\n\nIt's lovely ✨\n\nThat looks like a great place for practicing! I practice in my basement with tile floors and low ceiling, it’s cold and when stretching while standing my fingers touch the ceiling!  🙄\n\nGorgeous space 😯!!\n\nOh my god, what a dream 😭😭😭 so happy for you 💗✨\n\nR/cozyplaces\n\nWhere do I get a mat pillow combo like that?\n\nBeautiful!\n\nThis is a beautiful space - thank you for sharing &amp; I wish you many days of joyful practice ✨\n\nOmg this is absolutely beautiful. I felt at peace the second that this beautiful image landed on my feed 💛\n\nAmazing!\n\nThought I was on malesurvivingspace for a minute\n\nI love it!\n\nI really wish I could have a space like this to practice yoga and meditate. Maybe one day! :)\n\nPerfection! I love it!\n\nSo peaceful, thank you for sharing. u/ms_doctor_strange, would you mind telling me what kind of lights those are? I love the softness they achieve.\n\nI don’t remember unfortunately but as I’m from Germany I guess you wouldn’t be able to purchase them anyways?!?\n\nWhat would you call the mat under your yoga mat? I'd love to find one like it that I could put under mine for when I'm in child's pose or other wide-knee poses!\n\nI got it from decathlon it’s a motion mat for a indoor cycle my husband used to have. And as I have troubled knees I love to have under my mat for extra support otherwise I just use double mat.\n\nAhh, thank you! You gave me the idea to search more generically for non-yoga mats, and I've found several candidates that look like your mat's dimensions. My knees will be thankful as well 🙏\n\nI love the wall sconces! Can you please tell me where you got them?\n\nAlready replied to someone else asking, I forgot where I got them from or what they where called but I’m from Germany anyways.\n\nWow bless\n\nwholesome , its truly appealing for a session"

There's nothing to win because you already had it.\n\nMf just transcended matter\n\nAre you sure you’re doing yoga or are you competing with yourself doing physical exercises that challenge flexibility, strength and balance?\n\nThe craziest classes are when you end up in all three phases at different points in the class in no particular order.\n\nYeah these are not linear phases lol\n\nYes! Definitely been there before\n\nTomorrow, we can try winning at brushing our teeth.\n\nBrushing your teeth is the only time we get to wash our skeletons. \nSomeone said that to me the other day so now you get to hear it too.\n\nThat's an interesting take, never thought of it that way... thank you for sharing\n\nExcept teeth are not bones.\n\nenamel, dentin, cementum &amp; pulp...But it was a funny thought nonetheless\n\nWhatever baby steps it takes to get there\n\nNo brother, *today* we can win at brushing our teeth.\n\nHaha that's the perfect analogy. Doing it at all is a win.\n\nLove this\n\nMy mantra is \"savasana is a yoga pose.\" If I get on the mat and just lay there, it's still yoga. Just put down the mat and try.\n\nIt's the only position I'm able to meditate. Love it. Even though I morbidly call it corpse pose.\n\nIt's my preference for meditation also\n\nIt is corpse pose. And it is the most important part of class. Dying is the one thing we are all going to do. We might as well train so that we can die well.\n\nThis.\n\nSavasana is the most important of all poses. 🙂‍↕️\n\nI agree\n\nI finally cycle between 2 &amp; 3 and I love it there.\n\njust had a phase three summer\n\nJust had a phase three fall. Now, after all that rest, I find I can go deeper than before!\n\nFrog pose... \n\n\nResponsible for like 80% of my back health 🥰\n\nIt's Pigeon pose for me\n\nHi. Yay. We all need this lessons so we begin our journeys in the right place.  Thank you\n\nNamaste\n\nI love this &lt;3\n\nMaybe an unpopular opinion, but I don't like when people lay or are in child's pose the whole class. It's distracting\n\nIt's probably not an unpopular opinion as I'm sure there's plenty of people that feel that way but a big part of yoga to me has been learning that you just have to let people be where they are &amp; personally I'd rather see someone come to class just for child's pose than for them to sit at home alone withering away from depression"

Something I did not know that clever girl could do. She takes a calming deep belly breath and then breaths it out buddy. What the actual fuck right? I have obviously had a child. Did having a child also grant my vagina the power to breath? Someone help me. It's the loud breathing out part I just can't do. She's too loud. She needs to calm down with the breath work.

    "all_comment_text": "I am blessed to have eyes and the ability to read this poetic art form today. What a visual.  \n\nI think you are just extra good at breath work now, look at you multitasking!\n\nOmg multitasking yes exactly\n\nThe magnificent multitasking vag breathes and births. It's called [queefing](https://www.health.com/condition/sexual-health/what-is-a-queef) (aka vaginal farts). Pelvic floor strengtheners ([kegels](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/kegel-exercises/art-20045283)) can help! But it is a natural thing.\n\nAnd to quote a famous Sex and the City episode:\n\n* Charlotte: \"OMG, vagina weights!!!\"\n* Samantha: \"Sweetheart, my vagina waits for no one.\"\n\nLmaoooo 🤣\n\nThis is so funny 😭\n\nPelvic floor!!! Since you’ve had a babe you may need to see a pelvic floor physical therapist to reengage those muscles and build strength up in a meaningful and intentional way. There’s nothing wrong or abnormal about you and your clever lady!\n\nI’m calling my vagina ‘my clever lady’ from this day until I die\n\nOmg. Me too.  LOL.\n\nNow I’m comparing it to the velociraptor “blue” from Jurassic park. Iykyk\n\n“Your clever lady:” 💜\n\nAll of this, and then more!\nYou have a clever lady who is trying to warn you she is starting to migrate or considering morphing in some creative way.  This need'nt be scary or problematic.  She and her adventersome friends do this from time to time. Ask her about what her friend, your Cervix is up to?  Is she considering prolapsing? Has your Uterus invited Fibroids to move in?  Sounds like you need a routine visit to the gyno  and maybe an ultrasound to check up on these girlie's. Fear not. They do these things.  But you should get peace of mind.\n\nI died at “is she considering prolapsing”\n\nThat silly goose\n\nShe’s toying with the idea lol\n\nI second this\n\nThis!!!!!! I came here with the same response!!\n\nThe way you worded this tho 💀 bless sis\n\nBreathing from 2 places must just mean you're really good at yoga\n\nI don’t have any advice, but I just wanted to let you know you’re the wordsmith of the century. R/yoga laureate.\n\nPoems in Iambic vaginameter.\n\nThis genuinely almost made me do a spit take\n\nVa-JAM-eter!\n\nOh wish I'd thought of that one, LOL!\n\nI realized this only happens (aka always happens) if I’m intimate with my partner the evening before class. She likes to brag I guess 🤷‍♀️\n\ntooting her own horn lol\n\nSame here!! It cracks me up lol\n\nWhen I'm going to do these poses, I pretend there's a zipper from my belly button to my tailbone and zip it up (thanks pelvic floor pt for that trick!)\n\nOkay this is an awesome suggestion and I'm going to try to use it! Quick question- do I start the \"zip\" from the belly or from the bottom? Does it matter which direction I zip in? I'm realizing its hard to do it from starting with your middle, the more I'm trying 😅 Please help!\n\nStart with your tailbone and then unzip from your bellybutton  :)\n\nThank you!\n\nLmao. I haven’t had a child and she still has the occasional eldritch sigh during hip openers\n\nNooo this thread is killing me 🤣\n\nEldritch sigh 💀\n\nEngage you mula bandha\n\nThis is the correct yogi answer but yes to all the pelvic floor suggestions and congratulations on being a hilarious writer\n\nThank you! As a yogi I’ll say it in layman’s terms for you or anyone else. While entering the pose do a kegel (i.e. tighten your vagina). As you get stronger start engaging your lower core too. There are so many poses that people think they are doing right because they are loosey goosey and flexible..but it is as much about tightening the right muscles and less about how deep you go into a pose. Strengthen the muscles, THEN true flexibility will come. Ask a teacher you trust in private for tips on how to engage properly. Then keep practicing! And if all else fails wear a tampon. Because while it’s normal i would freakin die if I queefed in class and I guarantee your classmates would rather not hear it as well.\n\nI wouldnt care at all. We have bodies and they do weird stuff.\n\nI heard a nice yoga music piece that has fake farts built in.\n\nLmao I love that\n\nUjjayi vag\n\nBreath of fire. Lol\n\n😂😂😂\n\nPujjayi?\n\nPunaniyama?\n\nCoochayi?\n\nPranayoni\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is common and you really shouldnt worry about it! Dont feel weird. Anyone that takes notice is the one who is weird.  \n\nIf you need help in this area however, look into pelvic floor pilates. Its all about strengthening the lower pelvic floor muscles, to tighten everything up down there, and should help a lot with this. Theyre especially made to help you recover your strength down there after a baby. Having a baby usually destroys the pelvic floor muscles, and these are the muscles you need to be able to contract to help with the \"exhaling\" haha.\n\nThis is so true. Before I figured out my pelvic floor situation, I used to queef every single time I would get into shoulder stand. Kind of ruins the vibe when I start laughing hysterically at myself in the middle of practice.\n\nRight?! I cannot calm my mind when I'm panicking and waiting to exhale\n\nomg waiting to exhale 💀\n\nOh come on now, you might notice it but you're weird if you visibly or audibly react. You can't tell me you don't notice it occasionally if someone exhales posteriorly\n\nYes, in my comment \"take notice\" means to react. If someone does or says something about it, they are weird.\n\nHappens to me all the time and I haven’t even given birth. It’s just air singing it’s terrible song through our groin n loins\n\nin Canada its called a Quef aye ? 🇨🇦\n\nIn Australia it's a fanny fart\n\nhmmm … I was think’n you guys would call it ‘ the thunda from down unda ‘\n\nI thought that was the clap. 👏🏻\n\nhave not heard that for ages 😂. Im an Australian\n\nOr is it queevefe?\n\nPussy (and I cannot stress this enough) power\n\nWhat a pleasure to read. And here I was thinking having balls makes doing yoga difficult. Sorry I don’t have anything useful to contribute but I hope you figure it out!\n\nwhere can I get a reddit post framed?\n\nI love the way you wrote this. Also have recommendation for pelvic floor PT. It's something that everybody can benefit from - pelvic PT can help with sexual function, holding urine, and having better bowel movements.\n\nThis is the best post I’ve ever read on this sub\n\nI’ve only have it happen to me when I do three legged dog with my right leg in the air.  Doesn’t happen when lifting my left leg.  I have had 3 children so guess my pelvic floor is fxcked.  Will try the tip in the replies re engaging my pelvic floor muscles and see how that goes!!\n\nHave you considered that your vagina is just right handed?\n\nI haven’t had a child, but I used to have this problem when I first started too. It made me afraid to practice inversions. Then I started practicing Ashtanga and learned about the bandhas. \n\nSo basically all that happened is, I tried to remember to keep my pelvic floor slightly lifted/flexed as I practiced, and over time it helped a lot. And of course whenever I go into an inversion now, I’m aware of keeping my pelvic floor lifted as I do.\n\nWhat do you mean by lifted?\n\nLifting is the action I think of when I tighten my pelvic floor. You’re essentially very lightly flexing the muscle there.\n\nLifted, like you’re trying to stop a pee flow\n\nMy instructor has a very thick Bostonian accent and she loudly instructs us to “pull up on ya anus and ya rectum!”\n\nAND? There’s two?\n\nShe’s fine! 😇truly, vaginal farts are perfectly natural.   It means you’re relaxed. Let em rip, tater chip. \n\n\"Let em rip, tater chip\" can I get this embroidered on a hat?\n\nPlease do! It would absolutely delight my Southern soul to pieces. \n\nLove, clever girl\n\nThis is a phenomenon I’m familiar with in my life outside the studio as well. Never had kids, but definitely related to my pelvic floor muscles, which are also, shall we say, idiosyncratic. Like many other exciting challenges of female anatomy, awareness of pelvic floor idiosyncrasies has increased dramatically over the last decade or so, and it’s easier to find help with the more problematic aspects. Still not truly _easy_, but the fact that pelvic floor physical therapy is a service businesses actively advertise (not to mention practices engaging the bandha) demonstrates how far we’ve come in the parts of the world dominated by allopathic medicine.\n\nThat’s some serious pranayama\n\nHas it developed teeth too? Is it breathing or is the wind whistling through it?\n\nlean into it, Sometimes i break wind in plow pose. I like to yell YES everytime\n\nQueef\n\nlol with your description\n\nThis is DEFINITELY the wrong answer, but inserting a tampon ahead of time will likely solve your problem.\n\nTry to engage your core more? Breathe out and then clench, girlie will shut up!\n\nWe’re so quick to shush women who have something important to say😩 let a bitch speak!! (Joking)\n\nI know, but girlie should know her place! \n\n/jk\n\nThis exactly. Breathing in deeply naturally relaxes and lowers the pelvic floor and contracts with exhalation; one can utilize this natural process to assist their pelvic floor flexing and lifting.\n\nP*ssy Pranayama 🙏🏻\n\n“Shes like the wind…..”\n\nOh Swayze - my first \"man\" crush - \n\nHaha me tooooo! 🥰🥰\n\nI don’t have any suggestions or help. I’m just in awe of you doing handstands!!\n\nI've never had kids but my vajayjay started doing this after my hysterectomy. I'm very active and have a strong pelvic floor. But the surgery did something to the alignment of things and, yeah, I also have that breathy, clever lady issue too. It's a weird sensation! All I can say is that it probably seems way more obvious and loud to me than it does other people. I hope. 🤷‍♀️\n\nThat’s what the music is for.  Teachers need to keep the volume up during those kindsa sequences\n\nTake a deep EXHALE when you are moving into positions that cause this. Should fix the issue!\n\nHaha I feel you. I went to a yoga class at 3m postpartum and it was only me and one other person in the room. Luckily my queef was so dramatic it sounded like a fart but I don't really know if that's any better....  Luckily for me the teacher was a true pro and just powered through.\n\nI have not had a child, yet I too experience this vaginal sigh\n\nWhen I hear a fellow yogi share some air, I just feel solidarity\n\nA lady in my TT told me she always had to wear a tampon in class for this reason lol\n\nI’ve heard queefing during headstand entry is fairly common.\n\nI’m sorry I am in TEARS of laughter reading this. My vagina acts the exact same way it’s soooo loud I can’t practice in public anymore. \nOk now I’ve dried my tears I will read on for suggestion.\n\nWould wearing a tampon work? Oh, and I laughed at your wording :)\n\nOk I definitely tried to plug her up with a tampons and it did work but I feel like if I need a tampon for yoga I'm in trouble\n\nGood point :) You could plug 'er up just until you train those pelvic floor muscles like it's your job.\n\nGirl, you ain’t ever queefed before?\n\nI do this and I haven't had a baby. \nUnfortunately early my freshman year of college, we were all trying to do a handstand against the wall. That's when I learned about the vagina sigh. Thunderingly loud. Mortifying.\n\nYou have super powers\n\nWhen I first heard my yoga teacher talking about Ujjayi breath, I heard \"vagina breath\".  Perhaps it was vagina breath all along!\n\nKegels.\n\nI had this problem right after I gave birth - it was embarrassing but I think it was a sign of re-engagement, which strengthened the muscle to do what it needed to do to prevent that from happening.\n\nLike vagina farts?\n\nLmfao you’re a dope human being\n\nThis was the perfectly-written prose I needed today. I 100% agree with some pelvic floor work and a check in with the gyno. But it’s also normal. Cheers to all of our clever lady friends!\n\nI quit doing yoga for several years after my first because of this- then someone suggested wearing a tampon during yoga and it works perfectly! I don’t even wear tampons for my period but I keep them around for yoga. I’ll never forget my first yoga class after giving birth and the long, loud queef after the first leg lift. I wanted to die. \n\nWear a tampon!\n\nMine does too. Part of the reason why I practice alone. But I have done some work on my pelvic floor especially after my second baby. Its a lot better than it was, and when engage my pelvic floor properly I can avoid the deep breath she takes. But not always, it take a lot of mental concentration as well as pelvic floor engagement.  \n\nIt is frustrating and I'm working on it but I also just grew to live it with as well.\n\nI’ve felt this before in child’s pose, opening the vagine chakra\n\nJust wanted to let you know mine does this too and I’ve never had a kid!\n\nThis was genuinely so well written that it got a belly laugh from me lol well done OP. \n\n  \nI haven't had kids and this has happened to me before, it just happens sometimes!! \n\n  \nJust like the guy in class who sometimes farts loudly as we do happy baby, bodies are funny noisy things and yoga studios are where we get to humble ourselves while our bodies try to shame us with creaks, cracks, and escaping gases :P\n\n I don’t have kids and sometimes i get the same problem, especially in poses where you relax you pelvic or stretch your behind very far away and/or apart\n\nPersonally, for me wearing tight fitting underwear and pants usually works. But not always, sadly \n\nAlso, the noise is one thing, but i HATE the feeling of that even more!!\n\nmy pelvic floor muscles are super strong and it still happens to me every time I'm in shoulder stand-- it's just anatomy, unfortunately.\n\nWay better than asking why are you queefing. That’s what we used to call it. \nA deep breath. Nice.\n\nPelvic Floor Kegel exercises required.  \nIs it the same during being intimate ? You may need to see a OBGYN\n\nBesides the recomendation of engaging your core and pelvic floor, plus excersising the pelvic floor regularly, it might be worth talking w your doctor. This can be also related to an imbalance in your vaginal bacteria.\n\nYes to the pelvic floor suggestions, the way I think of it is tightening your lower abs and pushing down (not too hard… don’t cause other problems) and keeping those muscles engaged throughout your practice. This should prevent the orchestra and lead to a nice flat toned tummy with time. Double benefit.\n\nOh yeah, 2 kids later I definitely dread this too every time I get into down dog. I've just learned to embrace it and tell myself it's just like at the pool - sooner or later what goes in must come out. And maybe I get an extra cleansing.\n\nLeslie Howard is a yoga teacher who specializes in pelvic floor. She does workshops all over the country and has online options as well. She even does a teacher training that counts toward continuing education.  She has written a book called Pelvic Floor Liberation and has videos on YouTube. Lots to check out. \nAlso yes to mula bandha and pelvic floor physical therapy.\n\nPilates is a great compliment to yoga for strengthening those pelvic floor muscles. \nAlso, getting your twists &amp; wind-releasing pose in first should help move extra air/gas out of the body.\n\nTry to push out when you're currently sucking in\n\nSo ive always done kegels and had strong muscles down there, but for some reason whenever i flip my lower body upward it always makes me queef. When you tilt your vagina that way it sucks air in and out of it so it’s fairly common. Glad people had advice for this!\n\nPop a tampon up there and she’ll stop breathing real quick. You’re welcome.\n\nThese comments are giving me life. I had a really bad fall today, I'm injured and feeling sorry for myself. These comments have me laughing out loud so hard. Thank you to everyone in the comments.\n\nJade egg and red light therapy wand.\n\nThis is why I practice at home now.\n\nI am a teacher who had a baby 7 months ago, and had a student who had a baby around the same time. She confided in me after class one day and we both were laughing and talking about our experiences with queefing in inverted poses like downward dog. This is totally normal after having a baby, and even for some women who haven’t! I second what some other commenters have said about seeing a pelvic floor specialist, or doing your own research on how to strengthen your pelvic floor. I haven’t seen any professionals on the matter but have noticed this hasn’t happened to me much in the past month or two anymore. \nFor a while it was such a normal part of my at-home practice. Id feel embarrassed when my partner was nearby to hear it, but he was like “this is a pro-queer household!” Bless him lol.\n\nshe’s just doing ujjayi hahahaha\n\nIt's possible it's pelvic floor muscles, but queefing also requires some good muscle control. I know it doesn't always mean a dysfunctional hip floor.\nHow do I know? I could do this in my virgin teen years, I wasn't a couch potato either. Literally, I \"trained\" these muscles to do that on purpose.\n\nI can do this standing up from a chair. Consider yourself an expert at breathwork...Seriously, there are pelvic floor specialists who can help you with this. It's as natural as a burp, though, and as we all know, \"when you do yoga, your body will make sounds; this is natural.\" \n\nThank you for making a dark morning a little brighter, and go find yourself a pelvic floor yoga therapist. Keep us posted on your clever girl!\n\nBefore going up you squeeze that baby like she drinking a thick smoothie through a straw. \nAnd squeeze throughout.\n\nJust remember that there is but a single letter of difference between ‘queef’ and ‘queen.’\n\nRage on, monarch!\n\nI called myself “Queen LaQueefa” for the first painful year of yoga! lol\nAnd I personally think that it changes as you tighten all of your core AND OTHER muscles. It has changed for me . So hang TIGHT, Sister!\n\nThis is honestly EPIC. 🙏🏼 YOU WIN THE INTERNET FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR!\n\nthis thread is incredible\n\nPunaniyama the 4.5th limb of yoga\n\nConsider taking up the trumpet\n\nThis used to happen to me when I was a beginner yogi and I have never had children. It ended up stopping after regular practice which I assume made my core and pelvic floor stronger to stop the queef. But until then, a tampon or menstrual cup in for the lesson should help. The queef in the silent yoga studio is not it!!\n\nI love your language! ❤️ So I’ve learned to FEEL that deep vag breath happen, and let it out more slowly with the next pose. Yeah, sometimes audibly, but you know, just give it a calm ‘excuse me’ and keep going. Farts happen in yoga class too 😉\n\nDefinitely pull in and up as you enter the pose and yes definitely pelvic floor work.\n\nI have had this problem!  I looked it up and found that near our cycle (or ovulation, I can’t remember) the cervix thins and this is common.  It will be dramatic for me for a couple days then ease up.  I find a tampon helps stifle the queef.\n\nThis used to happen to me every time I did yoga, and I finally figured out the issue. The bondhas. When you are supposed to go belly button to spine (tighten your core muscles), I was “pulling in” air. One ways is like sucking in your stomach, and it feels different than tightening your intercostal muscles, which to me feels more like I’m pushing rather than pulling. After scouring the internet about it years ago, that was the answer for me.\n\nI know this post is a few days old but I have to add that I had this problem BEFORE I had kids but having 2 children solved it temporarily, after a few years of pelvic floor exercises it is back again especially when I do plow, it is very audible \\*sigh\\*\n\nSomethings wrong Dr Dre, my coochie’s doing a beatbox\n\nMy first thought was to maybe use a tampon if you’re worried? Plug her up! But definitely also take the much more qualified advice in the chat. 🪷\n\nWhat is going on here lmao\n\nLiterally didnt understand anything\n\nTo much info"

    "body": "So I live in NYC and wanted to try nude yoga. I mainly did because yoga without my clothes on felt more freeing which it was, but also the craziness of being naked with all strangers felt so different I wanted to try. When I entered the class I found about 30 people there and all but two students plus the teacher were men. The teacher explained that nude yoga mainly appealed to cisgender men, because they are less likely to have their bodies objectified. This makes sense and isn’t horribly surprising, but I didn’t think the ratio would be as extreme as it was. Curious if other people who did nude yoga  saw a similar gender ratio.",

    "all_comment_text": "That's a gay men's yoga class that's open to all. They just don't label it.\n\nAnd those two women know it's all gay men\n\nThey know they aren't going to get hit on.\n\nOr ogled at.\n\nAnd the one straight guy (OP) who shows up hoping to see lots of titties lol\n\nLmao OP thought he was slick\n\nWas just going to mention that. In the cities I've lived in most nude yoga classes offered were in the LGBT parts of town catered towards gay men.\n\n\nOnly other one I've seen was a \"retreat\" in the desert that emphasized dropping acid/shrooms.\n\nI mean it is NYC. A mega gay city.\n\nWhy did I just picture a giant gay robot attacking the city\n\nMega Gay would never do that!\n\nI voted for Mega Gay for city council, I thought they ran a great campaign. Very civic and community minded.\n\nCommon misconception; Mecha Gay and Gayzilla are super good friends. I’ve even heard they are roommates.\n\nYoure thinking mecha gay\n\n...I'd like to know more. For research\n\nLiterally😭I was thinking who’s gonna tell her..\n\nIts a Him\n\nThat's even better!\n\n[deleted]\n\nHonestly the most rational explanation.\n\nThe only person I know who does nude yoga is a 40 something, white, gay man in great shape.  I suspect that's the usual demographic.\n\nI went once, and there's a lot of guys in great shape, but in San Francisco at least, the ages ranged quite a lot from 20s to 60s.\n\nWell now I want to go\n\nSame!\n\nPerhaps they do not label it as gay yoga because such a label might exclude folks they want to include. Perhaps they want to create a welcoming and inclusive setting.  Perhaps the people who  attend celebrate and welcome a diversity of gender expressions and sexual orientations coming to their nude yoga practise.\n\nAs a straight guy who was worried about yoga because it seemed like a women's safe space kinda deal, and then realized I was overthinking everything, this!\n\nThis kind of reminds me when I joined the Gay Men Choir, literally not knowing it was gay. Honestly was a great decision.\n\nI’m pretty sure I know what class OP is referring to, and it really isn’t a gay yoga class, labeled or unlabeled.\n\nI tried nude yoga at home and my dong kept catching on the crook where my legs meet my torso, and then I ended up crunching my balls in cow face pose. Never again!\n\nI don't know how you all do yoga in public.  I feel like I constantly have to adjust things.\n\nI have to in public as well but I’m discreet and wear compression leggings so tight they’re definitely nuking my sperm count\n\nI find compression clothes make it all worse. The boys get stuck in a position and have no escape when the twisted up poses come along. I find with looser under gear or going commando the boys at least have a chance to make a sliding escape from the thigh vice.\n\nAlso whats with folks being afraid to subtly adjust? Bits that hang off folks in various locations are a fact of life for a lot of people, its only weird if you make it weird by being weird when you adjust. A quick nudge or subtle cup and shift in extreme circumstances is all that’s needed usually.\n\nLol I love this description, very enlightening. I can relate but with boobs\n\nI originally was gonna go with hanging genetalia as a fact of life for lots of folks. But then while typing it I went “no, women must have to adjust their boobs for some poses too sometimes.” So pose complicating hanging bits for all!\n\nMy inner child is cackling at the phrase “hanging genitalia”\n\nI don’t know how you guys walk around with those things…\n\nBriefs are some of the greatest Invention of mankind\n\nSame! I love to follow YouTube classes at home. And if I fall or can’t keep up, only my cats judge me.\n\nEagle=crush your testicles pose\n\nIt is actually a lot easier to manage not to crush your testicles in eagle without a manual adjustment if they are free than it is with underwear on.\n\nJust sitting on your eggs😏\n\nHave you tried dangling them in rice?\n\nA trick for cow face pose is to sit on the edge of a block and let your goods dangle.\n\nI’d need to scrub the hell out of that block after it was nestled in my taint but thanks for the tip!\n\nOmg.  Thanks for the laugh\n\nThat’s very considerate of you\n\nYeah, I'd much rather have everything tucked up close like a Sumo wrestler.\n\nThe fact that you used the word dong made this 100x funnier.\n\nOh my this sounds horrendous. Happy baby pose nude in a room with 30 strangers?! There's just no way.\n\nYeah, but are they letting their anuses bloom?\n\nWhat a terrible day to know how to read.\n\nhahahahaha... the comedy on reddit surpasses anything else\n\nGood thing I lack cerebral visual input.\n\nIt's basically just  * * * * * * * *\n\n💀💀💀💀\n\n🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣\n\n🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣\n\nAhahahaha I remember this comment from another thread, brilliant!\n\n * *every* thread\n\nLmaoooo \"blossom your lotus flower\"\n\nEveryone should sun their anus daily\n\nNo, because it only blooms when the sunlight hits it!☀️🍑\n\nHappy baby is a best case since your eyes are facing the ceiling\n\nYeah it’s the cat/cow that’s gonna get you 🤣🤣\n\nEdit: now I’ve given myself the giggles trying to think of the most awkward poses in a basic yoga class\n\nMy class occasionally does puppy pose which has gotta be the worst 🤣\n\nHonestly. This is the last thing I ever want in my life.\n\nits gotta get smelly in there\n\nWhy would it be more smelly than a typical class?\n\n30 exposed anuses in a small room\n\n29 eyes just staring back at me.\n\nI always feel like\n\nSomebody’s watching me\n\nThe hidden Fourth Eye of Yoga.\n\nGreat album name\n\nOpening track of next Tool album\n\nI think you’re probably overestimating the smell containing powers of yoga apparel. \n\nClothing can mask poor hygiene and natural body odors. If i can smell when someone doesn’t wear deodorant in a normal class I’m sure it’ll smell even stronger when they’re fully naked.\n\nBecause It’s mostly men!\n\n(And I say this as a man!)\n\nNothing stopping them farts\n\nno spandex blend filtering out the larger particle sizes.\n\nJust don’t do anything you’re not comfortable with - including staying for a class that doesn’t feel right\n\nI suppose if everyone is focused on their own pose, they won’t be side eyeing anyone else. Still, happy baby would def be one you’d prefer facing the wall.\n\nThere’s a seasonal nude class I do. If you’re there to practice and not to oggle, you don’t really notice the orifices. If you do accidentally so what 🤷 it’s not like anyone is unique for having an anus, most people do.\n\nAnuses are like opinions\n\nThat given the correct context it is perfectly okay to show them, and gauche to to consider them shameful in that context?\n\nNobody’s gawking. If they are, they’re getting kicked out and not allowed back.\n\nGawking would be the least of my concerns and the openness of certain orifices and the smells it could produce would be the first\n\n😂😂\n\nI would be terrified to look anywhere except directly at the floor.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf they are return customers I’d assume they are there for each other, not women, if they are gawking.\n\nThat tracks with my city which has naked bike rides, clubs and beaches.  98% queer men.\n\nI've got to admit, naked bike riding doesn't sound comfortable for either gender 😬\n\nI would just be looking out of curiosity. Like “what is that?”\n\n🤣🤣🤣\n\nLMAO\n\nI find it's not possible to both gawk and do a pose correctly. If someone gawked it would be extremely obvious and embarrassing for the gawker. Also most yoga classes in the west are a female dominated matriarchy so perving just isn't a good life choice in that hierarchy.\n\nAs a cys male I’d actually be more comfortable in an all male group. I have zero problem with practicing naked and I don’t care if people watch me. I’d hope that there would be no gawking in a mixed class but I think that the novelty of it might cause it to happen. That’s not such a bad thing if it doesn’t bother anyone but it would be distracting for me if did. I don’t think that any of the girls I practice with would want to practice next to naked me…..I think that we would crack up laughing at each other….it would be funny,interesting and distracting…but not why I practice yoga.\n\nAgreed, same sex classes seems the way to go with this sort of thing. \n\nSynchronized Lower Lion's Breath\n\nThe only nude yoga I have done was a class specifically aimed at gay men.\n\nI'm a lady and the only nude yoga fans I know are gay men.\n\nAnd not just any gay men, specifically, the kind of gay men who like going to events with a lot of naked gay men at them. Retreats, parties, yoga classes, etc. \n\nThey post fucking hilarious photos on Instagram when they get back.\n\nyour post tracks with the gays i know that like nude yoga. not for me, but more power to them.\n\nHell yeah it is.  You dorks have strip clubs, we have nude yoga\n\nName checks out\n\nMy balls hang low, no way I could manage this.\n\n“Do your balls hang low?\nDo they wobble to and fro?\nCan you tie ‘em in a knot?\nCan you tie ‘em in a bow?”\n\nCan you thrown them over your shoulder like a continental soldier?\n\nDo your balllllllllsssss hang low?\n\nCan you throw them over your shoulder like a military soldier…\n\nIt's 'regimental soldier' where I'm from\n\nFascinating, I grew up with a continental soldier.\n\nit’s def continental soldier lol\n\nWhatever it is, the question remains:\n\n\nDo your balls. hang. Low?\n\nCha-cha-cha!\n\nI've also heard \"continental\"\n\nIts me. It was continental for me.\n\nWhat yoga position is that?\n\nBallasana\n\ni was gna say sack-vasana lol\n\nDiane Spencer has a great joke about “Nuts-must-stay”\n\nDownward balls\n\nlol my immediate thought 😂\n\nHuh, feels like more of an at home kind of practice\n\nI did nude yoga once, and right before the girlfriend came home, was thinking the sammme thing!! \"Welll shes seen me alll kinds of naked.... but mannnn.... who wants to see their boyfriend all doubled over with their asshole in the air!! Let the games begin i guess\" hahaha\n\nI gotta know how she reacted\n\nI personally would be okay with this.\n\nPretty common in naturist gatherings &amp; retreats. Be cool if there were more (obviously behind doors) naturist stuff so people would just get over it but even in naturist circles people have to be vetted to weed out pervs\n\nI used to attend nude yoga classes in the Phoenix area and while the instructor was female the class was almost exclusively male. We’d occasionally have 1-2 female students but they rarely attended more than one class.\n\nDue to the pandemic, these classes are no longer offered because the studio that hosted them went out of business.\n\nI think I know the studio you're referring to!\n\nThere is a class I saw pop up in Gilbert but that’s far from me (Biltmore area). Where was the class you went to?\n\nIt was in Tempe near Mill and Baseline.\n\nThere was an all-male class in Phoenix but that studio also went out of business.\n\nNo shade whatsoever to any yogi anywhere—you wonderful people all do you—but I (a cisgendered woman) am pretty much horrified by the very idea of nude yoga, *especially* a mixed-sex class. I’d be super self-conscious if there were any men present, particularly  if I were one of only a few female students, and frankly I’d feel pretty ungainly even if it were only women. Having my hooha out there facing the world as I did, say, a bunch of standing splits would not be conducive to peace and tranquility for me. (I promise I’m not uptight! Just a bit modest maybe)\n\nI don’t even consider myself modest &amp; I’m right there with you. This is about the most horrific scenario I could imagine 🤣 I’m a yoga teacher &amp; I’m truly baffled that something like this exists outside of a swinger resort or something along those lines.\n\nYeah I’d do it in just a pair of undies no problem. But full nude? Eek\n\nWhat are your thoughts about naked mixed gendered saunas?\n\n\nHere and large swathes of Europe, saunas and spas are all mixed gendered, all age, and completely naked.   It's considered unsanitary to not be naked in the sauna.   Young old men and women all relaxing and sweating it out, coming and going.  \n\nNo problem with those at all. I have experienced those types of places  to some degree. I’ve been to lagoons in Iceland and in which you have to bathe naked in same-sex locker rooms before entering the (mixed) pool/saunas in a bathing suit, for example. I’ve also been to hot spring baths (onsen) in Japan when I was fully naked for the entire time, although to be fair those were sex-segregated. \n\n   \nI think I could comfortably do a mixed onsen. I think the difference with yoga is that many of the postures expose the genitals (and really the whole body) to an extreme degree that doesn’t happen at a bath or sauna. Maybe I could do nude yoga if the room was very dimly lit. I would just feel too exposed otherwise.\n\nI mean if you're there for the nude yoga, why would it matter if they're mixed?  \nIt's like complaining about a nudist beach being mixed. \n\nI'd understand if it was a women's only nude yoga and a man rocked up, but if it's mixed like who is it bothering?\n\n[deleted]\n\nNudism is more of a \"free-ing the mind\" thing. Honestly the older I get, the more I understand it. Clothing, outside the context of staying warm and managing your bits, is starting to feel like a prison. \n\n\nHide your flaws, show your social status, don't \"tempt\" the other sex, etc etc. It's wrapped up in so much bs that I sincerely wish we could get away from all that\n\n\n. Signed, a ciswoman who has gone to mixed-gendered spas and onsens.\n\nEven Indian yogis don't know what you Americans are doing on the name of yoga💀\n\nyou can say that again.\n\nI mean, I can understand the freeing aspect, but personally I’d want to keep loose, floppy parts bound against my body.\n\nthis is way out of my comfort zone\n\nWe're geographically close, but this is the first time I heard of 'nude yoga'\n\nThis really piqued my curiosity. What was your experience like? \n\nDo you have to take off your clothes-- like how we remove our shoes-- before going into the room?\n\nDid it feel freeing, exposed, comfortable/uncomfortable? Would you do it again?\n\nYeah it was like taking off your shoes. Not sure it was my cup of tea now that I’ve tried it. I felt a bit uncomfortable at first but it definitely wasn’t a sexual experience at all. Any flirting was completely prohibited.\n\nWhere I live nude yoga classes are predominantly attended by gay men, and are male only. I’ve never attended but I have friends that have. \n\nIt’s rarer to see women’s only women’s classes and even rarer to see a mixed class. \n\nIm not sure if it’s something I’d do. I have zero problem being naked, but I want to be comfortable and focused during a class. I hardly wear anything in class anyway. I’m not sure how taking off my tights is going to help my practice. \n\nIf you enjoy it..go for it. It’s just not for me\n\nI attend a monthly women’s nude yoga workshop and it’s a wonderful practice. Candles provide low light, the mats are further apart, and all nudity is optional; some women keep underthings on. Being in community with other women naked is the best possible medicine against body shame that I’ve ever found.\n\nAs someone who wouldn’t have seen myself doing naked yoga ever, that experience sounds very healing actually\n\ni used to spend a lot of time night swimming at our local nude beach, and gradually more and more of my friends would start to join me. Mostly cis women and trans folks. It was healing for very similar reasons- splashing, playing and having fun without gendered expectations for our bodies and presentations. plus we could float on our backs and watch the stars!\n\nDownward facing schlong\n\nDownward facing dong was right there\n\nYoga teacher here…. The amount of men I have to kick out in clothed classes is unreal. I would hate every part of this.\n\ntell us more\n\nWhat warrants being kicked out? Want to make sure I’m being considerate\n\nI’ve been to tons of yoga classes and never seen a man kicked out. What are the reasons they’re being kicked out?\nI only do yoga at home and stopped going to classes years ago because I started hearing from women that it makes them uncomfortable when men attend.\n\nCis female Yoga practitioner of 10+ years here, I have never felt uncomfortable with men being in class. I think you should go.\n\nAt one of my old studios one of the local college football teams lost a bet and they all had to come to a class, it was hilarious. I was next to a massive guy, must have been a linebacker, and his sweat literally dripped on me - kinda gross but it’s a great story to look back and laugh about!!\n\nThat sounds like a great memory.\n\nAnd I think they learned a lesson. Those guys really struggled with mobility. They needed it. This was an ivy school, too.\n\nOh wow. It makes me sad to hear this. I am a yoga teacher and love having men in my classes. I have never had to kick anyone out (male or female) and have also never heard a woman say they’re uncomfortable with a man practicing alongside them. 💜\n\nI have no issue with men being in the class, but common social decency is required. I have had men touching themselves while in my class, trying to hit on other students while class is happening, purposely exposing themselves and claiming it as an accident… the list goes on. If a woman acted like that I’d kick her out too.\n\nHoly shit dude! Wtf! I am so sorry. Where do you teach at? Statistically that is insane. I’ve been teaching for 5 years and have only had about 2-3 odd encounters with men but it was no where near the stuff you described. \n\nDo you teach at a gym? Studio?\n\nTaught all over Vancouver and neighbouring cities for 15 years. Gyms, studios, private sessions, by-donation classes at community centres…\n\nJust to add to that list… my mom taught yoga for a bit around the time smartphones cameras started getting really good. More than a few times, she had to kick a man out whom she caught trying to sneak a picture of another student’s backside during class. He’d sit in the back behind a female student and wait until we were all doing puppy pose or tabletop and then sneak a photo of her presenting her bottom to him. I’ve sat in front of one of those guys a few times before he was caught so it’s likely he got some photos of my ass\n\nHoly shit. \n\nMy experiences with yoga have been either being the only man in the room or at a class aimed at gay men and I have not seen this issue. \n\nThat’s disgusting!\n\nPlease keep attending in person practices if you enjoy them. I've been to dozens of yoga studios and always appreciate and respect the male yogis, as students and instructors.\n\nwtf that’s weird. I love that men have found hot yoga. My classes are like 1/2 men and it’s cool to have them see how fucking hard it is. Women definitely rock at it but some of the men are pretty amazing. \n\nAnd my classes are all types. I mean definitely a lot of fit people (sort of a product of my area) but tons of body types and even some pregnant women\n\nWhy are you kicking men out of classes?\n\nI think the real question is what are the men doing to get themselves kicked out of class. I can venture several guesses.\n\nI've done it only once but it was a women's only class. I won't do it around men because my own brother said he'd totally do a nude yoga class just to ogle the women and I've seen so many disrespectful comments from men in the female-only event pages that I just won't risk it.\n\nNude yoga in the West has historically been popular with queer men. That part has nothing to do with objectification, it’s just a piece of (mostly) gay culture that is gaining popularity in other demographics. It’s just the way things are, but, tbh, a lot of even cishet men are more comfortable being nude in mixed sex spaces than cis and/or het women partly because they are less likely to have been made to feel unsafe about their bodies and nudity.\n\nAnyway, I love nude yoga! It’s not for everyone, but if you’re comfortable with social nudity, it can be fun. To me it’s like wearing skintight leotards in ballet. It’s easier for instructors fo make corrections because your entire form is visible, and it’s just kind of freeing to stretch and make shapes in your birthday suit. Or at least it is for me.\n\nI used to go to a small nude yoga class (usually 5-10 people) and I was often 1 of 2 women, and sometimes the only one. That said I went for years regularly and never had an uncomfortable experience. There would be classes where there were more women but often they would come with a male partner and I got the vibe that couples who came as couples were often hoping for something other than the not sexual vibe it actually was, and didn't stick around as regulars when it was just yoga but without pants. Gay men definitely made up the majority of the regulars, though the fact the instructor was a very, very attractive man may have been a factor there lol. The regulars were actually a really great little group, I miss that class, it was my favorite. It was just a really laid back, comfortable vibe, and like most nude beaches the nudity seemed to make people less, rather than more, self conscious about how they looked.\n\nI love nudes yoga classes. \n\nI have been to several gay ones and they have to always start with some sort of respect. It is never sexual, no one really tries to be sexual, it is always just a freeing experience.\n\nThat said, it takes a lot of work to cultivate that experience. Including a lot of consent and zero tolerance. I’ve only been to queer classes, id love to lead nude yoga, but I’d be cautious about multi-gendered classes especially if it is open to the public. Maybe that’s me being too cautious, but the tone setting is one of the most important pieces of cultivating a respectful yoga class. \n\nPersonally, I think the mid body connection is just so valuable when you can feel the body move without the hindrance of clothing. For men adjust parts of the body are also valuable lessons that you just don’t see in clothed classes. I imagine the same is true for women.\n\nPeople are just people. Most people are decent. It's not like gay men have some kind of monopoly on decency.\n\nNo, but women are a lot more comfortable in a yoga room with 30 gay men than with 30 straight men.\n\nOh the reason I said that is because I, as a gay man, believe that gay men have a monopoly on indecency… not that we are somehow more respectful, in faith the opposite\n\nWhere did you go? I go to a nude yoga in Brooklyn that's almost all women\n\nTIL that nude yoga in public is a thing.\n\nAll of the nude yoga I've heard about has been aimed at gay men, never really heard of any straight men or women of any orientation participating. I've always thought of it as a class specifically for gay men.\n\nI think women would be a lot less comfortable being around men during nude yoga. \n\nA women's-only nude yoga would probably be more comfortable. Possibly a suggestion to offer to the teacher.\n\nI agree. I’m not opposed to nude Yoga, but would be MUCH more comfortable in a women’s only class. \n\nI don’t particularly care about it in a sexuality way, as in it wouldn’t bother me if other women were into women, but something about a 95:5 men to women ratio would make me quite uncomfortable.\n\nAre we surprised?\n\nI did nude yoga a few times. My class was a pretty even gender split. The lighting was low and we didn’t do any extremely uncomfortable poses like happy baby. I felt very comfortable and safe there.\n\nYeah. I’m a nudist yoga practitioner and teacher. But really just plain ol’ naturist. \n\nI’ll be the first to admit that the naturist communities that I’ve encountered in Florida have been full of primarily cisgendered males.\n\nI’ve taught a few naked yoga classes and it has been mostly male participants. I wonder if it’s widespread in naturist communities in general.\n\nMy theory is that it can be challenging to be a woman naturist. Being naked as woman poses a different type of vulnerability and boundary setting that most men don’t typically have to deal with. \n\nI also think about some of the specific yoga asanas and the type of exposure that genitals get. I’m not the type that really cares but I know a lot of women that do. Especially when it comes to poses like happy baby or wide legged forward fold. As you can imagine, not everyone is a fan of wide vulvas peeking through to horny eyes and some women may be turned off by that idea alone.\n\nBut I have hope that as time progresses, there are more women that will start to participate.\n\nI have a question about nude yoga.  Is it set up in such a way that people are not exposing their most intimate of areas to others either through placement of the mats or planning of what poses work best when nude?  Or is it just the same class you might do at the Y or your locale studio with people in front and in back of you?\n\nSome classes are set up as normal but other are set up so that everyone is facing into a circle. This way, nobody is behind you.\n\nI mean, 90% of women would rather attend an all female nude class?\n\nHi, i've been to one in a Columbus and it was more 60/40 men/women but that class was maybe 15 total. \nIt was in a darker room and more for the idea of being vulnerable, open, and shedding anything we use to hide ourselves. So in my experience, it was about a personal experience versus a group hang or community building. \nI found it to be a very safe environment and practice but maybe that's case by case.\n\nI’ve gone to a women only one in Austin but it didn’t last long, I thought it was beautiful but apparently some people still had issues\n\nNude yoga near me is exclusively a gay men's class.\n\nDude if you wanted to do nude yoga to see some naked women you should just say that. If you're really interested in doing yoga nude it wouldn't matter how many women or men attended\n\nPeople love any excuse to be nude in public\n\nI have the utmost respect for yoga, and certainly commend you for your willingness. Don’t know how I could possibly not see the sexuality inherent in the situation. \n\nTough on the Brahmacharya!\n\nEdit: wish it were more acceptable to practice shirtless as a dude. Maybe it is. I don’t like tight clothing and I’m tired of eating my shirt all the time!\n\nmost guys are shirtless in the studio I go to, I don't think it's a biggie but maybe it depends on where you are\n\nThat’s interesting, I go to hot yoga and the gentlemen are typically in just small, like bike shorts. Some wear basketball type shorts and a teeshirt, but rarely.\n\nI’ve never heard of nude yoga in my life 😭 I’m a bit lost for words\n\nOf course, they were all there for the \"flow\". \n\nSorry, but I can't get on this nude yoga train without thinking it's a major gimmick.\n\n🤔 my brain hurts\n\ni didn’t know this was a thing! personally i hate the feeling of being naked and doing yoga; the feeling of bare coochie rubbing on a yoga mat is disturbing to say the least lol. did you go through with it, and how was it for you?\n\nI don’t know, something about the image of thirty naked people in downward dog makes me think yoga in the buff wouldn’t be for me.\n\nI like doing nude yoga at home alone because 1) I find it freeing and a nice way to get used to being in my own skin and 2) there's no clothes to catch on anything 3) I can sweat all I need to and not have to do a pile of laundry but I have no desire to do nude yoga in public. When I was younger and good looking I would have felt afraid of being objectified and now that I look monstrous I wouldn't want anyone to be frightened, I've had a lumpectomy and I gained weight and look generally difficult to look at\n\nI need to know more about this. Was there extra room between mats? Did the poses seem chosen in consideration of people’s liberated appendages and orifices? (Like, not so much stuff that would required the spreading of cheeks, say…) Are people giggly or is the crowd so self-selecting that no one’s really nervous about it? These are insecure questions because I think I would like to go, lol."

It’s like a weird version of the powerpuff girls\n\n😎 ❤️\n\nI would like to apply for Powerpuff girl role pls\n\nA grey haired chunky one\n\nThe only reason I'm determined to do most things is out of spite.\n\nMy people! 💕\n\nSpite is one of my main motivators\n\nThank you 💕 I needed an intention for tonight’s class\n\nFelt this ☝🏾\n\nyass 🔥🔥🔥 whatever gets you going. I started because I needed a break from my kids. 🤣🤣\n\nHa. Sounds like a sitcom pilot. Good for you. I fell in love instantly too.\n\nI would watch that sitcom!! Lol. Why isn't there a yoga sitcom?\n\nDharma and Greg? It's the closest I can think of. And it was funny!\n\nThis is it.  The Accidental Yogi. A young woman lies to her ex about doing yoga. Falls in love with yoga. Becomes an online yoga superstar. But she has to constantly lie about why she got into yoga.\n\nI had 1371 classes and ain’t lost shit…might be the diet.\n\nLol. I think for me it's that I mostly go to restorative. I guess I gotta restore myself from my diet lmfao 🤣\n\nMy mom had to pay me 100$ to go to my first class. I spent it at the bar that night. Had her buy me a 20 class pass. It’s been 20 years. It’s def life changing. \n\nI went to my first yoga class because of my mom too. I was at college and she was visiting me and I could bring a guest to the student gym fitness classes. She wanted to try yoga and I'm like whyyyyy mommmm?!? Well I went anyway with her and loved it. I was sore from head to toe, couldn't believe it. Hooked ever since and it's been like 30 years.\n\nIt was a lie only on the surface. Underneath was a wish and a calling,\n\nLove this\n\nThat gave me goosebumps\n\nThis is hilarious! Go you! I started yoga to survive a horrific breakup that coincided with perimenopause kicking my ass. \n\nHonestly yoga is one of the best things to have happened to me. I love it so. Not only did it help me get over that trifling fool, it annihilated lots of my peri symptoms. I’ve been doing it regularly for 3 years, love my studio, and feel like it was meant to be! 🙌🏻\n\nNow you need to go and lie about practicing yoga at home everyday! ;)\n\nHome practice is underrated...(not that I ever could do it every single day, lengthy practices about 4x a week on my own, at home–so:  home plus studio?)...maybe between the two?  If such frequency is important enough...\n\nStart with 5 minutes each and every day.  It could be sitting on the floor quietly for 5 minutes.  Or 5 minutes of sun Salutations.  Pick one.\n\nWait, yoga is just a physical practice based on the amount of time you spend per session in a specific location?? I've been doing it all wrong.\n\nNo I meant Asana and pranayama\n\nLove this, you do you! Yoga is self ❤️\n\nI started because an Ex. “Fuck her I’m gonna go do my own shit and try new things like yoga, oh shit I actually love this”\n\nYou were going to meet girls, admit it... lol\n\nThat was almost a year ago and I am finally just starting to feel like I am getting over my ex - I was in therapy and had zero intention of dating anyone for a while. I just needed to be around people instead of sitting at home alone and it seemed approachable enough of a thing.\n\nThat’s kind of why I made the comment - I didn’t expect to love it as much as I do. \n\nI was super concerned of coming off that way - like lots of men - so I really tried hard to not come off that way. There’s definitely some women I’ve met from class and hung out with outside of yoga, that I would *consider* dating if there was ever a spark, but that is after I’ve been friends with them outside of yoga and that just happens sometimes. None of them I ever met with the idea that they’re pretty so maybe I can become friends and then date them - it was strictly platonic.\n\nThis is more so as I consider looking into doing teacher training as that is both problematic and unprofessional.\n\nI will say, I didn’t necessarily have this problem before, but there’s a lot of men that suck at just being friends with women and now that I have a ton of female friends  I’m even further removed from that camp.\n\nWhatever gets you to the studio 😂!\n\n“Energy flows where attention goes.”\n\nNamaste.\n\nSo my yoga studio's owner told a story about \"taking her dad to yoga\"\n\nSo she's back home visiting her family and her olderish and out of shape dad was there so she convinces him to go do some hot yoga at the local studio.  He begrudingly agrees and says OK let's do the 4PM class at So and So studio on Thursday.\n\nSo Thursday rolls around and she straight up stands her dad up, he goes alone and falls in love with it... on his own!\n\nLOL! Amazing, good for you. Exactly something I would have done.\n\nLove it! Namaste :)\n\nNah, I'ma go...\n\nthis is so funny. omg. so funny &amp; so real.\n\nDidn’t know yoga causes weight loss\n\nI love janky stuff like this, when we dork ourselves into doing something good for ourselves.\n\nYou were just having a prophetic moment. You were speaking into your own life. Luv this for you!\n\nHahah yay!! Everyone comes into your life for a reason! Good job girl proud of you !!!\n\nThat's awesome! It's like spiteful accountability, I LOVE it! :)\n\nI love this post so much\n\nFake it till you make it, boo!\n\nThis is amazing!!\n\nYass yayyy\n\nHappy for you!!!\n\nAm I unaware that yoga is supposedly high class so that women would lie about doing it to make themselves seems better?\nI get that people lie about their job, income and popularity but does yoga belong to that category now 😂\n\nNo I talked about going for a long time just couldn't find the time when I ran into him, he  asked if I finally started so a little white lie.\n\nOh okay now I get it. Good for you.\n\nIt had never really left that category...just boutique fitness classes rejoined in the high class category, too ...yoga no longer in its trendy era\n\nTo the OP:  Yeah, those who can lose unneeded weight or get physically stronger than they already are from yoga alone, are a breed apart...\n\nGood job gilding what was already a lilly...\n\nThat he had been your ex, also, proved that you did not have to do all that much; he had been with you in the first place 😏\n\nI like this 🧘 🧘‍♀️ 🧘‍♂️\n\nAnger is useful. :)\n\nYou are a rock star ⭐️ Seize the day!!!\n\nNice!!! :)\n\nThank you for sharing this 🥺\n\nLove this!!!\n\nI need to start lying about things I need to change anyway :)\n\nYes! Good for you!\n\nWhat limbs of yoga are you practicing?\n\nThat’s great but who cares if you fulfill your lie 🤷🏻‍♀️"

Love the strength, focus, energy!\n\ntrying not to faceplant energy\n\nThat right leg like “wait for me!!”\n\nLol my face feels that \n\nThe way I was CHEERING for you! Great work!\n\nYou've hit a glorious level of beast mode!\n\nthere's always a harder pose\n\nHow long have you been practicing?\n\ndaily for five years\n\nWhat is the difference between you at 3 years to five years?\n\nAt three years I could hold a ten second handstand. At five years I could hold a two minute handstand.\n\nHow long did it take for you to move from a headstand to handstand?\n\nA year and a half from solid headstand to solid handstand\n\nGood to know. Your vid's an inspiration, man. Congrats on the strides!\n\nMay I ask what your daily exercises/poses are\n\nOne hour cardio morning, one hour yoga evening (lots of variety), then roughly an hour of handstand drills.\n\nDamn!! Congrats, looks awesome! I'm sure it's taken a lot of practice and I just know that moment when you finally get it!!\n\nthis one is more of a relief than anything. my ashtanga teacher has been cueing me to press up from there forever, and it was starting to feel like it would never happen. don't give up.\n\nThanks! Truly inspiring\n\nOh my gosh this is so good. Is this easier for guys to do?\n\ndefinitely easier for men strength-wise, whereas there's lots of mobility stuff that's a lot harder for men.\n\n💯% can see this. I’ve been practicing yoga since 2014 and I have a solid pincha scorpion but have been very inconsistent with handstand practice so I can’t hold one fully. Your persistence is inspiring.\n\ncongrats on the pincha (a huge goal for many).\n\nmy experience:\n\npincha looks really hard, but is actually much easier than it looks\n\nhandstand doesn't look that hard, but is WAY harder than it looks\n\nYMMV\n\nSomething I’m working on!!! Awesome\n\nu got this. work on negatives and increasing HSPU range.\n\nHello can you expand on which negatives are you specifically recommending and also what is HSPU range? \nThank you ☺️\n\nhandstand negative to one leg crow, and deeper handstand push up range by getting comfortable with elbows bent close to 90 degrees.\n\nThank you!\n\nDayuum\n\nExcellent! Congrats!\n\nWhat part/s of the pose took the longest to work on?\n\none leg crow is a hard enough pose to begin with, and the initial part of the press is brutal because it's a no leg crow with your body out behind you and your arms bent a lot. you need a lot of bent arm/hspu strength, which was a gap i've been filling since March.\n\nYessss!!!\n\nYesssssirrrrr!!!!!!\n\nHell yeah! Nice job! And you held the handstand forever\n\nSo good!\n\nYour strength and control is amazing. Do you do much other physical activity like weight lifting? Or mainly yoga? \n\nJust yoga, cardio, and handstand drills\n\nAmazing!\n\nOh Canada! Wow!\n\nHoly shit this is awesome!!!! The amount of strength this must take is insane\n\nGotta breathe ◡̈\n\nHell yeah!! Good stuff\n\nAmazing! 👏🏽\n\nMADMAN\n\nnailed it\n\nThis is awesome! Id love to get to this point in my practice. At 200lbs it feels impossible.\n\nif you look for reasons why you can't, you'll likely find them.\n\nif you look for reasons why you can, you'll likely find them.\n\ni believe in you! little by little. again and again.\n\nWow thanks friend 🙏\n\nWhoooo!\n\nWell done!!\n\nWowza! Well done!!\n\nAt first glance my brain thought this was Twister\n\nBeautiful! So much control, but I can you're also not rigid and letting your body adjust and balance. So steady. Great job!\n\nTrying real hard just to be impressed and not jealous.\n\nWow! You are so strong and in control - great body awareness 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼\n\nHow did you start? How did you reach this level of strength?\n\ni started by deciding \"i'm going to do handstands,\" then i started holding myself up against a wall until my shoulders were cooked every day, then added the balance component, etc. etc.\n\nbasically i started where i was at. it was the decision to do it that was the main driver.\n\nAwesome. Consistency and will power goes a long way, I'll try to give my best too.

    "body": "Hi! Long time lurker. I was signed up for a 10 am vinyasa class this morning that I was struggling getting the motivation to go to today. I have been mentally in not the best place and wanted to just sleep in until noon and order Chinese food. \n\nI remember reading the quote above in this sub “I don’t want to go to yoga, I want to have gone to yoga” and it kept ringing in my head as I got my butt out of bed and begrudgingly switched out my sweatpants for yoga leggings.\n\nMy class was awesome. It was the first time I was able to catch my back leg with my hand in lizard pose. It was the first time I seamlessly went from wild thing to three legged dog no shakes or dropped legs. I left with a huge smile on my face and a resolve to get my depression den apartment cleaned up! \n\nAnyway, a moment of gratitude for this community and yoga. I hope you all are having the best Saturday ❤️",

    "all_comment_text": "And now you’ve paid it forward by inspiring someone whose house full of guests just left that she will be happier for completing yoga today and will enjoy the silent house on a deeper level. Thank you. \n\nA year ago today I got back to the mat. Nice to think of that too.\n\nSo proud of both of you !!! :-)\n\nI love this! I always tell myself “I’ve never regretted going to yoga” when I’m on the fence or depression/stagnation sets in. It’s such a bonus when you go and then you feel energized to make other improvements in your day too like you did! Yay.\n\nI use that too! I also often tell myself that since yoga will make my day smoother and better, going to yoga is actually the lazy approach because it comes out as less work overall\n\nI've had a downward spiral and depressive episodes for the past six months, so I haven't been to any classes for a while. \n\nRecently I started going again, at least once a week, every Saturday. At my studio, we could cancel our booked class down to 12 hours before the class. Every Friday evening, I would hum and haw on whether I should cancel it and I always had to talk myself into not doing so. \n\nBut come Saturday morning and I made my way to the studio, attempts every single asanas as possible and like you said, I just feel more energized for the rest of the day! \n\n&gt; “I’ve never regretted going to yoga”\n\nThank you for sharing this thought! I will remind me of this every time i feel like cancelling my classes haha!\n\nSame. I never regret going but I always regret skipping.\n\nNo better feeling than pushing past the unwanting of doing something beneficial for yourself and coming out the other side successful. Be proud!!\n\nGood for you OP! \nI went to early yoga flow last Saturday. My teacher was like \"what a surprise\" hahaha. I don't do early and I don't do vinyasa. I made 3 more classes last week tho. Showing up really is the hardest part.\n\nBig props for going\n\n  \nI can’t tell you how many times I just got myself there and on my mat…and everything that day was overall better. Even if you get your food after class, pig out, and take a nap. That’s a big win.  There is nothing better IMO\n\n  \nYoga class is possibly the only thing on my life that I have never, ever regretted doing. Even on my worst days….once on the mat, within 10 minutes, I remember why I use have to get to class.\n\nAmazing job! You pushed yourself out of your comfort zone and reaped ample rewards. Don't forget this feeling as it will motivate you in the future. It's such an indescribable feeling when you feel an overwhelming sense of positive growth In real time!!\n\nThanks for the motivation. I’ve been procrastinating and now I’m going to do it.\n\nThink I needed to read this today. Thanks friend\n\nNewcomer here, I had the same situation as OP but i stayed in bed too long and missed it. After working out for so long i am struggling to make the switch to yoga purely because of ego. I think yoga is healthier and better for me though. Anyway, this post is inspiring to me.\n\nLove this! Always hard finding the motivation to work out, but once you're there you never regret it! This is what I always tell myself when my motivation to go is very low. I went to an 8:30am class this morning, and felt so at peace after the flow.\n\nAs my teacher says, getting to your mat is a victory!\n\nI feel that way about SO many things: mowing and edging the lawn, getting my steps in, even changing the bed linens and brushing my teeth. I try to pay attention to the little endorphin rush after doing the thing, so as to be mindful of how my body thanks me for doing the thing.\n\nBack when I teaching a lot, before COVID, I told my wife (a fellow yoga teacher), I really don't want to go teach. She said, \"You get to, you get to teach\". \n\nThat was all I really needed to remind myself of the gratitude practice.  I still didn't WANT to, but that comment shifted my energy and I remembered it being one of my better classes. \n\nSo whenever things get tough, I recommend you remember that \"you get to.\"\n\nYoga\n\nTaking a walk \n\n=\n\nthings I never regret doing\n\nWhen it's \"too cold\", \"too dark\", or I'm \"too tired\" to go to yoga, I just say \"that's nice\" and keep getting my stuff together and put on my shoes and get out the door all the while having those thoughts. And I never regret going!\n\nThank you for this quote. I have been struggling with motivation lately, and this is a perfect quote. Just got back on the mat couple of days ago, and I feel so much better\n\nI’m really struggling with the motivation to make it to 5 pm class today, thank you for this!\n\nI always say I am going for how I’ll feel afterwards. It’s been a game changer. It’s not nearly so hard to drag myself to class anymore!\n\nSo happy for you that you pushed through and it was so rewarding! Hugs!\n\nI always have to tell myself “you don’t want to do it, but you won’t regret doing it”. Glad you were able to overcome that mental block!\n\nLove this!! \n\nI always find that the days that I am struggling to get to my yoga class are the days when I seem to surprise myself too!! \n\nProbably something about the fact that the hard days are the days when you need it most.\n\nCongrats on keeping to your practice! Celebrate your growth! Keep being kind to yourself and turning up for yourself 😊\n\nAnd thank you for sharing and paying it forward in this community!\n\nI’m going through the same thing right now and have to change out of my sweats and leave in 15 Min if I want to go to class so thank you\n\nThat’s awesome that you were ultimately able to enjoy the benefits of the class. Also a friendly reminder that something as simple as daily Surya Namaskar at home is extremely effective in the long run\n\nThe hardest part of any yoga class is getting there\n\nI love this  so much! And yes! I never regret going. Find your zen! 🧘🏼‍♀️\n\nlove this for you. i'm very similar and I always tell myself, you'll never regret going to yoga once we're there.\n\nGood work! It's indeed how it works, just got just do it, you never will regret it (exept when you got hurt). This does count for all sports imo.\n\nThe hardest part is getting in the car and going to yoga. Get past that\n\nSooooo relatable! ❤️\n\nThis brought me to tears. Yoga has saved my life numerous times now and it’s because of this feeling. Thanks for the reminder to roll out my mat today ❤️\n\nTurn up and you're halfway there.\n\nWell in the early stages of a solid exercise program you dread getting started.... And you get you don't want to but you have to stay with it and then implement some good dieting to go with the exercise dieting and exercise will help you to lose weight and over a period of time your legs and your body are going to feel better\n\nI felt like that until I found Jivamukti Yoga and now I look forward to class!\n\nWell done, would have been easy to stay in bed and you’d feel worse about yourself, hard sometimes when we don’t feel like doing what will make us feel a bit better\n\nYay. I love this for you🩵yoga really does give you superpowers!\n\nThank you so much for sharing!\n\nAll battles are won or lost first in the mind. Envision the way you imagine you will feel after an awesome class and allow that vision to carry you through. The hard part is not allowing the monkey chatter of the mind to hijack the process that you know you want to happen. Discipline is quite difficult at first, gets easier with time.\n\nThat's awesome!! Just saw a video from a doctor explaining how we used to try to treat hopelessness to get motivated, but it turns out you start taking action and the hopelessness goes away! \n\nW on you taking action. 💙💪🏽\n\nThis was exactly what I needed to read thank you!"

I’ll work on this pose tomorrow 💃💪\n\n Nice!\n\nlovely! any tips?\n\nI couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t working for me for way too long and the two things that brought it together finally were: \n\n1) having my hands mat-width apart. I was keeping them too close together and it wasn’t allowing me to properly engage. \n2) lifting right up onto my toes in forward fold to get my knees into position. Somehow this magically puts things in the right place for me. \n\nBeyond that I’ve basically just been doing them every couple of days and can hold them longer/get into it easier with each practice. \n\nDon’t be scared to play around with positioning and methods to lift off. If running short on time, do a few sun sals every day or two, end in a forward fold, and attempt to transition into crow. If it’s not working, adjust your hands and knee placement until it feels right. \n\nIt’s really one of those poses that make you think “I could never” when you first attempt.\n\nCheck out Yogi Flight School. They had a free workshop and it totally unlocked this pose for me. I’ve tried everything and was not able to do crow, but now I can! They do free workshops every now and then. I love her cues and how she teaches.\n\nAmazing! I'm just starting to try this pose, how long did it take to be able to hold it? I can only do it for 1s right now, but I read your tips and will try again tomorrow.\n\nI still honestly can’t hold it longer than 5-10 seconds usually, I could never figure out how to get into position properly but once I made that connection it’s taken only a few weeks of practice to hold it longer ☺️ my next step is a graceful transition to plank to exit\n\nThe float to chaturanga is one of the most fun and satisfying movements!\n\ncongratulations!  \n\nfor some reason what unlocked this for me was focusing on my finger strength\n\n💪🐦‍⬛🖤\n\nCongrats! Also, I love your mat! Where is it from?\n\nThank you 🩷 Yogi Peace Club, they’re a local surf coast brand in Australia, amazing quality mats\n\nWoo hoooooo!! 🎉 💜\n\nBravo!! Well done 👏\n\nThis is great thanks for your tips!\n\nThat’s rad! Congrats\n\nReally nice surfboards!!!!!! Love those stylrs\n\nNice! Nearly there myself. It feels so close. Congrats to you.\n\nCool! How long did it take you to achieve this\n\nYour form looks amazing!\n\nStunning!\n\nYay!! Congrats 🙌 looking awesome!!\n\nCongrats! I might use this as inspiration and set a 2025 goal to master the pose\n\nWell done! Congrats.\n\nWonderful! Now work on internal rotation of hops to bring knees more closely nestled into your arm pits ."

There are plenty of poses that I can hardly do, like barely bending forward in upavistha konasana, but I find the benefits of the practice are found in making an effort to try the pose - not necessarily in finding a deep or full-expression of the pose.\n\nPoint is: don’t be afraid to try and don’t compare yourself to others. If you are making an effort you will benefit from the practice!\n\nRight on.  It's about your own individual practice, not some objective goal to attain.  Enjoy using your body!!!\n\nRight there with you dude! I've been doing it for years now though and I'm happy to say that I am no longer just a big guy. I'm a really flexible big guy 😎\n\nI honestly think yoga is in some sense even better to get into the bigger you start, because since it's so body weight-based you end up building strength a lot easier than someone who starts skinny would.\n\nPre-pandemic I used to do weights or cardio 5 days a week and yoga just once per week, then covid closed my gym and I stopped exercising entirely and started drinking a lot and gained probably 60-70 pounds. I tried getting back into weights/cardio but just could not enjoy it at all, my joints were getting fucked up, I was short of breath all of the time, my whole body was a mess.\n\nBut when I started baby-stepping my way back into yoga around this time last year my body responded really positively, and by springtime I had worked up to my present 3-4 days a week yoga routine. It's still more challenging than it was back when I was thinner--I am having to re-learn a whole new center of gravity, my stamina isn't what it was for holding certain poses (chair fucking murders my thighs now), and it is such a pain in the ass dealing with stuff like my gut getting in the way while I'm trying to do twists--but I'm already so much healthier than I was.\n\nNo more joint pain, no more shortness of breath, I can move comfortably in all kinds of ways I couldn't before. The best part of it is feeling stronger and healthier and fitter without worrying so much about some goal of getting thin and jacked; like, sure, I'm losing a bit of weight, but that's kind of become beside the point to me. Now I find myself focusing much more on the progress I can feel in my body than on any image of what I should or shouldn't look like.\n\nPlus--and this is very contrary to the spirit of yoga and all that, but still--there's a certain smug satisfaction I get to feel as a bigger guy whenever I can pull off a pose I know is challenging even for my thinner, conventionally fitter-looking peers. There's nothing like getting all of your large-ass self up into a crow pose...\n\nRight on, I cannot agree more.  On all counts.\n\n\nI've felt amazing functional strength gains quickly.  Which is nuts, I'm a big manly man.  But the fluidity I can stand off the ground now is amazing.  \n\n\nFor my part, I'm pleased at finally being able to stand without needing to use my hands.  It feels pretty fantastic to pop my 41 BMI body off the ground and see people be amazed.  \n\nright on my man, yoga is for all\n\nYes, yoga is cool for us big guys too. I would add I have something called bi-lateral vestibulopathy with occilopsia. Basically my inner ears have signed off. They give very little to no info to my brain to help with balance. I still manage to join in with my wife on basic yoga. The less balance intense positions are better, but I just modify the difficult balance poses into ones that work with my issues. Go for it!\n\nAs a fellow big guy yogi, and teacher, you are awesome.   Keep on breathing.   Yoga can serve anybody.\n\nLove this post! 👏👏👏\n\nHell yea\n\n👏👏\n\nGreat tree pose my friend. May your yoga journey be life changing! ✨\n\nExcellent post! Thank you so much.  Old dude here (71m) who came back to yoga as conditioning for archery, Shepherd’s slings, and knife throwing.  No matter your body type , age, or condition, yoga can be adapted to suit you.\n\nI see that you are using blocks for props.  I am lost w/out my strap and my yoga stick.  Just don’t tell me to do chair yoga 😊\n\nReally liking your “phone-asana” variation!\n\nkeep rocking it, bro!\n\nWay to go OP . Yoga is for everyone .\n\nI love this! I am starting my yoga journey and you give me a lot of motivation\n\nHell yeah. I'm making a bunch of health changes, and just started my own yoga journey. See ya out there!\n\nlook at that balance! way to go! I just started  too and I'm quite wobbly, but when the class is over i feel soo soo good!\n\nNice! Can’t tell if you’re doing it but just in case - never put pressure on your knee. That’s what I was taught\n\nBest of luck and yay yoga-squad! 😁\n\nChecking in just to check in. Big guy here. Started at 320 now down to 260. \n\nYoga was the linchpin to getting everything going for me. It’s become a defining practice in my life. It’s philosophies have carried over to my career as well. \n\nYoga is what I came to after I started walking and it led me down a fitness rabbit hole. Currently running 10Ks, kickboxing, weightlifting, etc. and planning on bigger better things. Yoga is still my go to and has kept me moving even when I wanted to give up. It’s a remarkable practice.\n\nA little lower with the foot on calf. You can either be completely above the knee or below it. Don’t be on it. It will change your life for the better if you keep going. \n\nyess yoga is for every body!!\n\na little tip for tree pose... you want to place your foot below or above the knee, but never on the knee! 🫶\n\nNice tree 🌴\n\nAwesome!!!\n\nLove it! Keep showing up and the results will come. 🙌🏻\n\nThe challenge is how long you can stay there\n\nInitially thought you were Andre the Giant sized, then I realized it's a phone and not a block above your head. Great work mate!\n\nProud of you!! 👏🏽\n\nAwesome!\n\nYour balance is excellent\n\nSo proud of you!\n\nBest practice! Great stuff, brother.\n\nI worry about my shirt creeping up to my neck and all the people seeing my belly. Tucking doesn’t help for the most part\n\nTucking makes me feel like I can do something about it.  But yeah, my belly definitely hangs out.  \n\nYou're awesome!\n\nLove it! Way to go nailing tree!\n\nLove it! You are doing yoga truly and correctly, which is much more about how it feels to you rather than how it looks to others.\n\nway to go sir!!\n\nAs a big guy I started my own studio to help folks feel better.

    "title": "Why being the worst one in a yoga class is the best",
    "body": "If yoga was a competition, I would lose. (Thank goodness it’s not.) I am often the slowest in class, I use blocks and straps often, and I take a lot of water breaks.\n\nBut, I’ve noticed that my presence in class has allowed other people to give themselves permission to also go slower, use blocks, take more breaks. My yoga teachers often encourage us to do this stuff, but when I first joined the studio I noticed that a lot of people didn’t take any of those suggestions and went hard the entire time. Not only can I physically not do that, but I don’t want to. Going 110% in a hot yoga room does not make me feel good. \n\nI am proud to say that since I’ve joined and have been going to classes consistently, more people have joined me with the extra water breaks, or going into child’s pose instead of downward dog, or using a block in pigeon. It’s like sometimes people need a person to “break the ice” to give themselves permission to also do things a little differently.\n\nSo, if you’re like me, and feel awkward being the slowest one or the one who needs extra breaks or whatever, don’t give in to negativity. Your presence is a wonderful reminder that whole point of yoga is to listen to your body. And the way you practice is more helpful than you know. :)\n\nEdit:\nI really want to clarify that the point of this post isn’t to compare myself to others. If you go hard during yoga and that feels good to you that’s 100% ok. It doesn’t for me. And that’s also ok. I just made the title what it is because I thought it sounded good and could help other self conscious people like me feel ok expressing themselves during class. That’s all. Please don’t say that I am better or worse than anyone else because in the end we are all just people doing our own practice. Thanks.",

    "all_comment_text": "Blocks and straps do not = “bad” at yoga 🗣️ they are merely tools to access a different experience.\n\nStraps just make my arms longer and the blocks just make the floor closer. All good.\n\nThat’s one way to use em. There’s infinite ways. They can also actually make certain postures and movements more challenging. We’re all just trying to overcome the stigma in the yoga community that they’re for “novices” only\n\nIyengar approves this message.\n\nIsn’t it amazing that you inspired a class full of people to do the very thing yoga philosophy urges  us to do? which is slow down and really listen and feel our bodies and minds. \n\n It sounds like you were actually Lightyears ahead of everyone else, &amp; not trusting that you were further along in your self awareness &amp; humility than others. \n\nWhy is OP light years ahead of anyone because they do or do not take breaks? This line of speech in the yoga community is harmful because everyone is on their own journey, and we shouldn’t be appealing to egos like that\n\nAlso, I will always encourage people to slow down and take breaks if they really need it. But I also learned over time that I simply babied myself, my mind is too weak and I was not embracing how strong I was. I do give my asanas 100% barring any pain, and I don’t drink water during an hour class, because I know I can and I don’t like to distract myself from the asanas. \n\nI’m not saying the way I do things is right, but it works for my practice. Just like slowing down might be right for others. People shouldn’t be compared regardless, and I think a lot of people are capable of way more than they realize\n\n“One Truth, many paths to get there.” \n\n Your path might be fast or just different from the above yogis , but it’s not any better. Lol and I will always argue that no one is remotely close to attaining Enlightenment,  unless they are able to slow down the mind. \n\nYeah like, I commend the sentiment here and respect OPs experience and all, but it’s missing the mark. Everyone is at different physical ability levels, has different goals, and are seeking different experiences in the moment, so, taking frequent breaks doesn’t necessarily and objectively = practicing yoga asana “well”. \n\nTo be clear I’m a big advocate for breaks and the like, and creating an experience that feels right for each, AND to not strain just to keep up if it’s well above your ability to breathe well. But to say it’s objectively right for every person to necessarily take them is flawed.\n\nMight I ask what the goal of your yoga practice is?\n\nPersonally: It's my daily exercise, so I strive for consistent improvement in strength, endurance, flexibility. But also: it's my daily mindfulness reset, so I also strive for consistent breathing and a meditative state as I'm practicing.\n\nI will second the parent commenter. I find that I'm much more satisfied with my practice if I feel that I did the best I could. That means pushing myself when I'm tired and not slowing down in the face of difficulty. But it's also important to listen to your body and know when you truly need a break. Delicate balance.\n\nSometimes doing your best means, fighting the urge to push through and simply admitting that you are tired and in need of rest. The body can always be pushed to extreme, that’s arguably very easy to do, especially overtime. I think that most people agree it’s much harder to use restraint, and sit in stillness or quiet.\n\nAre you able to practice yoga off the mat and in real life? Like in the office?\n\n for example: are you able to be mindful, have consistent breathing and enter a meditative state there? What about a playground or chaotic crime scene?\n\nSure, I often remember my breathing and body relaxing when life gets stressful. I'm not perfect, but I'm getting better.\n\nThat’s amazing! Progress, not perfection. 🥰\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt’s a safety cue to avoid injury, but ok. \n\nDo you know what the yogic principle of a Ahimsa is? \n\nIt's worth mentioning that nowhere in any historical yoga philosophy will you see that,  not in Patanjali's Sutras, not in Swatmarama's Hatha Yoga Pradapika, nor in the Gheranda Samhita. That said, it has come into modern postural Yoga and I consider the suggestion to slow down and listen to our bodies while practicing asana valuable modern wisdom.  The understanding of our practice didn't end 600 years ago. I only mention this just for anyone interested in the history and philosophy of the practice, not as a criticism of your statement.\n\nWell, I’m not only using those sources as my understanding of yoga philosophy. I would argue like many scholars and historians do, which is that the Hindu holy books are actually the foundation of yoga philosophy. You know, Bhagavad Gita. &amp; the other 2.\n\nAll of the postures are modeled after the Hindu deities after all. And the three warrior poses are representative of the Hindu Trinity and actions of those gods, as well as life and death and everything in between.   \n\nNonviolence (Ahimsa), a key principle of yoga philosophy, also applies to your body and practicing postures. If you were trying to violently twist yourself and push past specific discomfort points, you will injure yourself, and that is not a sound minded decision, which goes against yogurt philosophy. \n\nThat's a beautiful response. Thank you!\n\nYou’re welcome &amp; thank you for the great diacussion! \n\n“Yogurt philosphy!”😂😅\n\nI kind of had this experience when I went to yoga class while pregnant. It was a gentle hatha class and I was the only lady there under age 50 or so. The others were all regulars.\n\nIt was the first time I'd attended class with this particular teacher and she really individualized the practice for me, recommending adjustments, variations, and props for nearly every pose. Being pregnant made my anterior pelvic tilt really exaggerated, so my low back was completely off the floor in savasana and she even took notice of that and brought me a small bolster to put under my back (and she cued me to come out of savasana early due to pressure on the aorta from the uterus).\n\nAnyway, the other ladies in the class were really paying attention to the adjustments I took, and a few of them ended up matching my pace and variations. One of them remarked that she didn't know gentle yoga could be even gentler on her body. It felt really good that others were paying closer attention to their bodies and needs because of the way the teacher handled my presence.\n\nThat sounds so positive :) I love it when people are open to learning from one another like that.\n\nMe too! Thank you for making this post, hopefully it inspires others to make their practice their own, especially in class where others can see :)\n\nI feel that yoga is one activity where it is ok and acceptable to be bad at it and mess up\n\nYayy! I've noticed this before too. I was in a class, maybe 6 months after I first started, and noticed a new student really struggling with some poses. Sometimes instructors will explain different modifications, but this one wasn't, so I randomly decided to do all of the modifications I've been ignoring for 6 months and it was my best class ever! I noticed the other student using the blocks too and felt so happy lol. After that I stopped being so anxious about matching everyone else and now I get wayyy more out of my practice, even if I dont burn as many calories.\n\nI always see people struggling because they need to use blocks yet their ego gets in the way and they don't.... Yoga is all about listening to your body not trying to impress others. Form is  more important than depth in the pose in my opinion. \n\nYou are not the \"worst\" you just listen to your body and know what's best for you.\n\nThat’s awesome! You’re doing what’s best for you and that’s what we all need to do. \n\nI’m usually one of the strongest or more advanced/longest practicing yogis in the room. I always use blocks in my practice. Almost every posture. It helps me get into the poses with more correct form. It also allows me to stay safe while practicing. I also hope there’s another person in the room who sees me using the blocks and it gives them permission or space to feel free to also use a block or down level a posture. If I can be an inspiration to someone else, and that helps them stay safe, I’ll use my blocks even when I don’t need them.\n\nI’m with you! I used to go b*lls to the wall with my hot yoga classes. It took me a good year of overstretching and wearing myself out to realize that it’s okay to use blocks, modify poses, and take water breaks. I now notice others doing it as well.\n\nThank you. I needed to read this today.\n\nIt took me almost a year to finally stop overexerting myself and just go at my own pace. Even though my instructors have always encouraged and suggested modifications. \n\nNow a days I do whatever feels right in the moment. If that first chaturanga doesn't feel good, you're damn right I'm going into updog from a child's pose for the whole vinyasa. I find that when I back off, I come back stronger the next time! \n\nI hope that I can be that inspiration to someone else. Especially since I'm a bigger girl, and sometimes we feel like we have to prove to everyone that we can do it just as well.\n\nI feel this! I love going to child pose and lot of times I notice people do the same once they see me there 🤣 like a chain reaction\n\nI get OP’s point.\n\nI love you post. I'm a 110% person myself, just how I'm wired, but occasionally I just don't have it and I do listen to my body and take the extra breaks.\n\nI dream of being a 110% person. It’s just gonna take me a while to get there, I started doing yoga with zero foundation. I’m just trying to be patient with myself as I work up. Keep being an inspiration in your classes!\n\nI started just doing the 101 and restore classes and worked up to doing the power classes. The biggest thing I've found that helped was the sculpt classes. At first I was like that's not yoga and I wouldn't take them, than the studio changed one of my regular time slots to a sculpt class and I've found that building strength helps get into asanas easier\n\nam i the only one focused on my own practice to notice if Im the best or the worst ?\n\n*Blessed be the stiff Yogi; he does Yoga, not Bhoga.*\n\nI started accepting my journey so I relate to this!! For some reason, I cannot for the life of me do a yogi squat without block assistance lol. The first time I did it in a particular teachers class she was surprised in a good way! It was really validating.\n\nTja is. Some of your observations are so true, people tend to struggle too hard. I have to remind myself often as well. Good teaching helps with that too but still, in a group people want to keep up.\n\nI love this!\n\nLove this so much and I’m a yoga teacher at four different locations. Love when my students listen to their bodies and others feel more comfortable and at ease to do the same. Thank you yogi friend.\n\nMy favorite students are the ones who haven’t exactly “mastered” each pose if there is such a thing. If every student was a master we wouldn’t feel as helpful to the people in the room. \n\nThank you for continuing to show up!\n\nThe lowest ‘bar’ makes me understand my humility. Thank you for your service in allowing people to be kind to themselves\n\nhey look I lost 25 lb doing yoga in my house right during the pandemic when I couldn't go to the gym .\n\n\nThat was 50 lb overweight too when I done it.... So don't give up just stay at it It doesn't matter how bad you are at it it gets better and it helps\n\nI had a bad yoga class today. Suffered thru most of it. Doing some Pilates moves - toe lock with stretching legs out front ...I just kept rolling back. Trying to get into plow...just wasn't happening. Three legged dog walked back into half moon...yeaaaaah not graceful after this week. Just keep showing up, that's the practice \n\nThanks for the post, it's very encouraging :)\n\nOne time I had a teacher mock me for drinking too much water in a hot yoga class. The class chuckled at me.  It didn't stop me from going, or from drinking water whenever I needed it. I did avoid that teacher's classes \n\nThis is awesome! As a teacher I know exactly what you're saying, people won't take modifications, etc,  unless I do them myself. And I really try to reiterate to listen to your body and take breaks at any time at all.\n\nI feel this way in life, too. I'm inspired when other people are transparent about having a normal human response to stressors, and I aspire to model that for others. This isn't to downplay strengths. I want to celebrate those, too. It's just to say it's really freeing to sort of matter-of-fact name fear, hurt feelings, confusion, etc as they arise, rather than pretend to be super human.\n\n100%. And some day you will be going harder then them for parts of the class and still listening to your body and your needs and just corpsing the fuck out for 30 mins of class. I say this because i had a teacher give me a hard time about taking breaks because  I am doing the harder modifiers and setting certain tone but then I ruin it by taking child’s or corpse. The conversation went a different direction then the teacher thought it was going to. \n\nLove this post. I have multiple sclerosis, so as time goes by I need to allow myself a lot more grace, breaks, and props. I'm just grateful I can still do the classes at all!\n\nI dunno, I don't think anyone is paying that much attention to anyone else.\n\nI’m on the heavy side so I can’t do a lot of things but I’m also strong enough to do a lot of poses! Most of the time I know that I make a difference in the classes I join because newbies would be inspired that if a heavy bodied person can do this specific pose, so can they :) but also when I skip some poses like the vinyasas in my ashtanga class, it’s also a reminder to them that they can take it easy and go at their own pace. :)\n\nMy honest reaction is why are you paying this close of attention to what other people are doing in the class?\n\nIt's a class with other humans of differing skill levels and abilities.  People will notice others incidentally and to learn from their peers.\n\nI’ve been doing yoga for many years and still use blocks for some poses. Like, I cannot get into half-moon without my hand on a block for some lift.\n\nHaha I'm the worst at power class but I still attend every week and give it my best shot while stilling having fun and staying present\n\nYes!!! Listening to your body is the whole point! Which of course will lead to doing different things in class, because everyone’s body has different needs that vary on different days.\n\nKeep on keeping on\n\nI used to learn blocks in yin yoga and it feels amazing to not strain into a pose sometimes\n\nFor experienced yogi’s blocks and straps are a MUST!! I use both all the time. Congrats to you for doing what makes you feel good.\n\nYou’re inspiring. That’s the best kind of yogi to be. Keep going in that direction.\n\nLove this. I’m one of those teachers always reminding you that the tools are available to help you get deeper into your body. No shame, no ego, no judgement of what your body does/does not do in any given practice. Yoga, as in life, sometimes you need different tools for the moment you’re in! 😉\n\nSounds so wrong. I don’t think people are taking breaks or changing just because you are. You need to focus more on yourself rather than thinking you have an impact on everyone and watching what they’re doing \n\nI’ve practiced for over a decade, so been the worst and the best is many classes and don’t tweak my practice just because someone else is doing something else\n\nI absolutely feel empowered to be gentler on myself if I see other people also taking creative variations or following their own pace! People like OP have made me feel comfortable many times and I am grateful for them :)\n\nWell that’s good for you. Sounds like you are not a self conscious person. Other people do not have the same inner experience as you. \n\nThe only reason this thing was brought to my attention was because another girl in class said she was always excited to be behind me because I remind her to keep hydrated. But that felt weird to put in the post.\n\nIronic how judgmental you are and accusatory on self consciousness while having main character syndrome in the class.\n\nReminder to do what each person needs - great. \nThinking you're doing everyone a favor and running the pace of the class - is your ego.\n\nHey man, respectfully my tone in the previous comment was not meant to be one of judgement. I was just stating what I gathered from what you were saying and then tried to explain my point. I apologize. Have a good day.\n\nI agree. Nobody is paying that much attention to anyone else in my opinion. I give myself a break when I need a break, I don't need to feel that I've been \"given permission\" by someone else.\n\nI am a beginner, and  when I see that another person is using a block in this or that way, and I think I would benefit I do that too. I have a very long way to go and much to learn, fellow yogi behaviour is helpful.\n\nAsking the teacher for modifications is best. You don't know who is doing something correctly or not. Also modifications are very personal.\n\nYoure Right, luckily yoga class is not a race. I like the way that you encourage yourself. Which books have you read? I wonder what you think of Asana, the postures, their origin?\n\nI love this! The more experienced I became, the more breaks I would let myself take, the more I would use props and modifications. Beginners in yoga often feel so much pressure to do the pose exactly, even if it hurts. I love hearing that your example is helping people to care for their bodies better.\n\nThis is amazing. I’m like you super inflexible and I kinda do this already but you’ve inspired me to take it up a notch.\n\nBecause the hot yoggi adjusts you.\n\nNah for real, as a long timer you do you. I've been practicing for a while with hiatus inbetween. I take my time, sometimes i move slow, sometimes i go deep sometimes i go mild, use straps and blocks. you be you.\n\nlove this post\n\nEven the thinking the idea that best/worst in the yoga class is sickening.\n\nThe main character energy coming off this post is insane\n\nSame thing happened with me at my studio! I would always, at some point in every class, have to ask the teacher to turn the heater off as it made me dizzy. One class recently I asked the teacher to turn it off and she refused, which honestly kind of fucked with me, so I tried to get through the next few classes tolerating the heat as much as possible. Close to the end of the next class, a couple of other students mentioned how hot it was, and joked asking me why I hadn’t asked to turn the heater off yet, because apparently everybody just waits for me to do it!!\n\nI’m also drinking water, slow, using all the props, etc. Being able to identify and meet your own needs is a massive skill and one I’m proud of!!\n\nYou all are corrupting yoga. Yoga is to be done in silence not with music also with loose clothes\n\nusing tools and going slow aren't bad at all.\n\nI find that the class and the teacher often go out of sync with my breath, and I continue with my own pace.\n\nIt's way more important to do whats right for you than to keep up with the changes."

I agree, I feel like we should share our struggles as much as our wins because it’s all part of the journey 🥰🧘🏻‍♀️🙏🏼\n\nQuad strength: activate!\n\nthe wobble almost got me 😅\n\nHey, at least you're getting back up!  I tried a few times and...I'm just happy I have control(ish) to the bottom.\n\nHow can you do that??? Amazing.\n\nhonestly i don’t know\n\nI love and understand this.\n\nYeah I can’t do it like that. Good on you!\n\nthank you !! the other leg is worse 😅😅\n\nYup I don’t balance as well on my left either\n\ni have strong leg and a flexible leg haha\n\nBe careful, I tore my meniscus doing that. \nManaged to do 4, but the 5th one was :(\n\nOmg really? The tear on the way down or up? my knees feel fairly strong but i do not want that to happen to me! thanks for the warning!\n\nOn the way up :( , ended up tearing the middle part of my meniscus, had surgery, and am still recovering. \nI mean my ortho reprimanded me saying - only professional Athletes \"need\" to do this. I should be happy with yogic postures. \nPlease be careful. Rest just listen to your body (:\n\nDo you usually squat or lift in addition to yoga?\n\nYeah 2/3 days I train with weights. Practice free squats regularly. \nThe doc told me it was a build up over the years and the single 🦵 squat just triggered it.\n\nI can only do this on my right leg, but no where even close on my left. Curious if you have a similar experience? Or can you do both legs? \nAmazing job btw!!\n\nOn my left it’s hit or miss whether i can get up or not. definitely weaker !!\n\nI can’t even get down 🥲 it’s like my knee just stops bending lmao\n\nFor me it’s the other way around, but yeah. Same issue with getting up from Skandasana. But the right hamstrings are more flexible, so each side has their strengths and weaknesses\n\nI’m working on it.  Good grief is it unreal hard.  Seeing others work for it gives me super motivation thank you for posting. Very impressive.\n\nyes keep at it!  it’s way harder then it looks!!\n\nGreat job comin outta that pose… anyone have any other ways to come out of pistol easier? I feel I’ll break my knee if I try to stand back up😂\n\nthis was the way i found on youtube to come out “easier” 😅 but it is a knee cracker for sure lol\n\nYou can sit down and stand up with one leg using a step. The idea is train your knees with small progressives\n\nKilling it 🔥\n\nthank you 🙏🏼 🙏🏼🧘🏻‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️\n\nIf your knees love it, then awesome!  My joints say nay\n\nyeah no knee pain 👏🏻👏🏻\n\nYou actually inspired me to try again. I’d off and on practiced unsuccessfully but I literally just did it too!\n\nYay!!!! I always find that when i give up on something for a while and then trying again later i can get it! It’s THE BEST feeling !!\n\nHow long did it take for you to master this ?\n\nWell i’ve been practicing yoga for years but i just started working on pistol squat in the last few days :)\n\nFew days … wow! \n\nObviously no discrediting your yoga skills. \nI struggle with doing pistols without any support so kudos.\n\nWoah!  I'm impressed.\n\nWell done!!\n\nBravo looks so much easier than it is and I can NOT do it.\n\nThank u !! yes it looks like it’s a super accessible pose but that ankle mobility gets ya\n\nOkay slay on, mama bear.\n\n🫶🫶\n\nholy wow you go girl\n\nthank u ☺️\n\n[deleted]\n\nhahahhaha i use my gargantuan legs as an excuse too 😅😅😅😅 they literally are way longer then my body\n\nBRAVO!\n\n👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\n\nI’m so impressed! I just started practicing 3 days ago.\n\nLove this! But kind of too hard for me LOL\n\nLooking strong!! 🦵🏽Also practice tucking your chin a bit so it’s in line with your entire spine all the way from the tailbone. I know you are probably fixing your gaze so that you can stay balanced, but eventually you’ll develop dristi gaze and be able to lengthen the neck without it interrupting where your gaze is fixed. Keep it up!\n\nthank you! I need all the queues i can get\n\nShoot that duck!\n\n🎯\n\nAmazing 🤩\n\nWell done!!!!\n\nWow. Great work. Goals.\n\nDamn grl\n\nWell done!  Strength, flexibility, and balance!\n\nthank you!!! 🙏🏼\n\nThat is CRAZY!!!!\n\nI'm still working on getting my second leg in my underwear without leaning on the bathroom counter. Brute strength there!\n\n😂 we all start somewhere\n\nThat's awesome! \n\nI want archive that. Now I can do a pistols squat but I can't do it taking my feet. Any ideas how to do it?\n\nAmazing skill 😲\n\nNice balance👏👏👏\n\nThis hurt my knees, just watching it\n\n[removed]\n\nthat’s not nice :)\n\nRemoved, suspended."

    "title": "What’s Your Unpopular Yoga Opinion?",
    "body": "I’ll go first :)\n\nIf you get easily annoyed by others during a yoga class, you should just practice at home or pay for a private class.\n\nIn this sub I’ve seen people complain about everything: people arriving late/leaving early, people breathing too hard, people not doing exactly what the instructor is doing, people drinking from their water bottles, I could go on but you get the point.\n\nI understand if someone is in your space or filming or is purposefully being distracting, like get that out of here that’s annoying. \n\nBut I feel like this weird hostility towards anything not 100% perfect creates an unfriendly environment. The yoga studio I attend has no in and out times, encourages you to switch things up pose wise if you need to, and tells people to take breaks and drink as much water as they need. The studio is expensive, but tons of people go because it’s inclusive. If a single mom only has time to do a half hour of class instead of the full hour then she can do that without worry of being judged. \n\nYour struggle to focus is your own issue, and I say that as an easily distracted ADHD person. I have such a difficult time sometimes, tbh most times, but I feel like that’s the point of yoga? How am I supposed to learn how to focus and block out distractions if there are never any distractions?\n\nJust my thoughts. I’d love to hear your unpopular takes too!\n",

    "all_comment_text": "I don’t know if it’s unpopular, but I absolutely feel that most classes do not spend enough time in forward fold - like let me linger a little bit please 🥹\n\nYes!! I love to hang out in forward fold for a bit\n\nYeah it seems to me like a lot of the time people don’t hold poses long enough in general (I like hatha best). And my yoga breathe is slow so when an instructor starts counting breathes I always feel rushed. :/\n\nOof it’s so frustrating when it feels like you can’t match the breath - sometimes I just gotta go my own way otherwise I can’t get into a flow 😅 you’ve inspired me to seek out more hatha style because I’ve been craving long poses!\n\nUgh yes :( I love hatha and my old studio had a bunch of hatha classes, but I had to move and in my new city I literally can't find even one hatha class - they're all power yoga and vinyasa and other fast paced classes (I can't even find a slow flow!). I like vinyasa sometimes but not every time lol\n\n[deleted]\n\nMine is that most yoga studios suck at helping new yogis. The class descriptions aren't clear enough to help someone that doesn't do yoga understand which class to pick, teachers assume you know a bunch of things already, studio websites rarely have anything ressources to help you, etc. \n\n\nThis is why I'm teaching intro classes, where I teach people the very basics, that way they'll have the knowledge and skills needed to go practice in studios or on their own after.\n\nHonestly I totally agree with on this. One of the classes I take is called “Yoga Fusion” and it took me forever to realize it’s a variance of bikram (I assume they changed it due to the problematic stuff). I didn’t know that when I was new and spent  half the class in child’s pose it was such a struggle.\n\nlol my studio calls their \"bikram\" Hot 26+2\n\nThat sounds great. It's also very hard to find classes suited to beginners. I used to go to a studio that did but it changed owners. I know classes are supposed to be for any level but if you have no idea what you're doing and everyone's flowing through class doing advanced moves it can be so off-putting. And some teachers are better than others at helping you modify and explaining to newcomers.\n\nI feel like there should be more yoga 101 classes that show students who are beginning the basics in clear ways, like how in music lessons you may begin with learning scales and reading music. Someone can always be learning, but having clear direction and correction on the core asanas and principles can help out a great deal.\n\nAbsolutely. And I know it's not popular to say, but without a ton of advanced moves. I'm not a beginner as such but I'm very unfit and took a very long break. Classes where you spend more than half the time doing child pose because it's too hard aren't much fun. \n\nAnd those classes need to be non judge mental. We had a yoga beginners course at mine and it was run by the owner and she would get so frustrated if you didn't have perfect etiquette or couldn't remember a flow or had questions. Very annoying\n\nYeah! Even intro classes will tell you to just “go into downward dog” as if everyone knows what that means.\n\n\"Ok, we're going to start in Sukhasana\"\n\n🤷\n\nEach quarter, we had an instructor at my favorite studio who had created a four-part curriculum on Yoga Basics. If I remember correctly Day 1 alone was literally an hour or so of just working general posture and alignment and learning what that means for the individual. \n\n\nShe went into rigorous detail about just some of the most basic of basic and I feel like, early in my journey, she really helped me establish a strong foundation. \n\nThat sounds amazing. I'm in yoga teacher training this year and I would love to learn to teach this class! And aerial gym in my city does the same thing about their different aerial options and general education about doing aerials in general.\n\nI feel my Iyengar studio offered me really strong and specific beginner instruction when I started. But agree that people should read the class descriptions. Beginners sign up for more advanced classes out of lack of knowledge and there’s no good preventative when people just don’t have the knowledge to begin with.\n\nAgree. I got lucky starting out. It was a new studio so I was often the only one in class. It was one on one training.\n\nI agree. Yoga is sooo confusing when you’re just starting out. And even if you do take a beginners class, they don’t show alllll of the poses. So if you work your way up to a more advanced level and someone all of a sudden throws out dancers pose or wild thing or lizard, you never get the chance to learn how to do it properly unless you go home and google it. \n\nIt took me a LONG time to figure out the difference between cobra and upward dog because teachers weren’t clarifying. \n\nAnd it’s confusing when teachers aren’t held to a standard either. I take a class once a week called flow, yet it’s slower than the regular non flow classes. It’s supposed to be an intermediate class but it isn’t. People are disappointed and it feels awkward to say anything.\n\nI wish more teachers would do hands on assists (obviously with consent). If I’m doing something improperly please help me fix it!\n\nThere's a local studio that has some assists classes, and they are fantastic. They keep little battery-operated candles in front of each mat, and you can turn yours off at any time that you don't want to consent to touch for assists.\n\nWhat a great idea!\n\nIn 10 years, I only had one instructor who was hands on. I LOVED it. I learned so much from her.  I wish more would be\n\nSame!!! I love when teachers do hand on adjustments because it’s one of the big reasons I go to studio to practice - is to gain a deep understanding of how to do each pose and flow. So when the teachers don’t do hands on adjustments, I feel I could gain the same benefit from an online class, unless it’s hot yoga. I understand there are people who have experienced trauma and that teachers want to maintain a safe space, but I Absolutely LOVE hands on adjustments\n\nSeems since Covid, that has stopped. At least where I practice, little to no real teaching anymore. \n\nAdjustments are important\n\nI have been told that if hot yoga makes you feel like crap, it’s because your body is flushing out toxins, which I think is a bunch of bull. \n\nYou know what makes you feel like crap? Heat stroke!\n\nNo, no, heat stroke is just the unenlightened approach to flushing out toxins!\n\nThere are so many medical reasons for someone to be intolerant to hot yoga! Heart issues, histamine problems, low blood volume, eye problems, dehydration, hypermobility, dysautonomia, being unacclimatized, thyroid problems, Cushings disease… \n\nI did years of hot yoga, and loved it, but it’s not for everyone. \n\n“Flushing out toxins” is woo that we need less of in yoga. We have organs that take care of that!\n\nbtw, in all of the old books about yoga is recommended a normal temperature not heat.\n\nMy yoga teacher is from India and runs an ashram there. He says that the whole “hot yoga” thing is misapplied. It’s hot in India, so they do yoga in the heat because it’s their normal temperature. If you come from a cooler climate he says to do yoga at your normal room temperature. \n\nI remember reading (in Pradapika?) that different doshas are recommended to do asana different ambient temperatures. But none of the recommended temperatures were as hot as, say, Bikram. \n\nYup, thank you to my liver primarily and also my kidneys to some extent for doing the detoxification work!\n\nIt is hahaha, but the whole detox thing is believed by a ton of people, not just people in the hot yoga community.\n\nYup, and it's annoying as hell because they are very loud opinions, in my experience. I have MS and being overheated makes me legit start shutting off one body part at a time like a robot losing power. But it's \"toxins\" I guess?\n\nFellow hot yoga hater here 🫡 I already live in a hot and humid climate, I don’t need to exacerbate my misery\n\n[deleted]\n\nUsername tracks...lol\n\n“Pain is just weakness leaving the body.”\n\nOh please, that’s your toxins, right there. I’m nothing more than a beginner, but I can tell some people need to listen to their bodies.\n\nPeople overlook that the body might be flushing out the good stuff too.\n\nSo if yoga feels good is it because I’m absorbing lots of delicious toxins?\n\nMy favorite yoga studio shut down, and I am having SO MUCH trouble finding another one that isn't a hot yoga studio. I hate hot yoga. It's too hot for me to get a proper workout without getting dizzy, and it's so easy to overstretch.\n\nYeah, I don’t buy that either. Hot yoga is intense and can be uncomfortable until you get used to it. I don’t think it has anything to do with “toxins”. We have a liver for that.\n\nI looove hot yoga, but the detox thing is bunk. If you feel like crap it’s because you aren’t replacing your electrolytes enough.\n\nI only HOPE that this is not an unpopular opinion.\n\nI practice at home so I can fart in peace lol\n\nMy yoga instructor: Take a minute to set your intention for class today\n\nMe: Don’t fart 🧘‍♀️\n\nThat way, you know you're doing the supine spinal twist right!\n\nWhen I first started doing yoga it was with an Iyengar teacher and I thought it was hilarious that one of the poses was, in english, referred to as \"wind relieving pose\". So true.\n\nI farted in child pose once. Everyone pretended not to notice\n\nI actually came in to say, farting should be normalized.\n\nI don’t have any unpopular opinions but yours resonates with me. Lately, I’ve become attuned to people blowing their noses in their mat towels. I’m really trying to tune it out but it gets to me\n\nI took a YTT200 in India last summer and in my pranayama class we were instructed to use our yoga towels to clear out our sinuses/energy canals. Blowing your nose on your yoga towel, is yoga 🤭\n\nYoga: the yoking of mind, body, and towel 😂\n\nEven with this explanation I don't think I could handle it if I saw someone doing it lol.\n\nThat’s gross.\n\nThere are a load of yoga people who don't look at it for spirtuality and in so doing have achieved greater spirtuality, possibly even awakening from it.\n\nThis is it for me. Hot yoga is the ONE time/place in my week where I can only think about one thing for 60+ minutes. Yoga. \n\nI love that the flows go from easy to hard on a dime, that I have to concentrate so hard to hold a somewhat annoying or new pose, I have to use every brain cell to balance on one foot, and all the while I’m sweating to death. \n\nI think the concentration *might* contribute to something akin to spirituality. I’m honestly not sure yet. But I really really enjoy it.\n\nI absolutely love your description. It’s like you described my brain. Saving this comment for future reference.\n\nThis is how it was for me. Went in as a completely non-spiritual person and I’m now a Buddhist and have developed so much self-awareness and patience for myself and others through it\n\nI'm an atheist and have become more spiritual. I don't believe in the metaphysical, but I acknowledge spirituality as something physically manifest in the body. It's a state of mind and being.\n\nI used to see it only as a physical practice but I’ve gained a lot of appreciation for the spiritual roots of yoga—especially since I’ve dealt with some health problems that limit my current practice to gentle yin and yoga nidra. It took me a while to realize how valuable it can be in ways that aren’t just about strength and flexibility.\n\nThat would be me. I'm currently questioning my atheism. And this is JUST me: saying I'm an atheist and I'm spiritual seems like a cop out. What do I believe in? Can the divine be something other than the goddess? I've largely gotten by until now by equating the divine to be the negation of the void. And then along came yoga.\n\nIn the YTT I’m doing now, we call it the “divine universal consciousness.” It doesn’t have to be a god/goddess. It can just be a creative force that moves about the universe, like “the Force” from Star Wars.\n\nFor some people, yoga is just exercise and they don't have to participate in the spiritual aspects of it.\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that. ♡\n\nConversely, I see a lot of people on the sub who go to a class for a the first time or have a sub instructor and complain about the spiritual aspects.\n\nThat was the absolute hardest thing for me to understand as a yogi! I've been practicing for years, and recently, my bestie has started taking classes with me. He doesn't have much yoga background but was interested in hot classes.\n\nHe has THE WORST etiquette. He wears socks, he does what I've coined \"bro pushups\" in the middle of each chatarunga, and does the heavy bro breathing after each pushup. He also watches me and tries to copy postures I've worked YEARS to accomplish/perfect without any regard to technique. \n\nWhat started out as me being excited to finally have a friend in yoga turned into a cringe session/me spending too much energy trying not to pay attention to him/worrying about him straight up injuring himself!!\n\nIt changed my perspective once I realized he was just in it for the exercise and calorie burn and not the practice itself. I still give him technical tips if I see him doing something really crazy, but it's much easier for me now lol\n\n&gt; he does what I've coined \"bro pushups\" in the middle of each chatarunga\n\nThere's actually a branch of yoga that does a pushup from chaturanga and then pushes back into puppy pose before sliding forward into updog. It's a variation of the Bihar school vinyasa.\n\nOh yes, I am familar with that! So, he does about 5 pushups in a row, doesn't do updog, and flings himself back to down dog. I'm certain he doesn't know what puppy pose is nor Bihar lol\n\nI was trying to give the guy some credit :-) As long as he's enjoying himself and getting value out of it that's the important thing.\n\nIt's a lot easier for some people to connect to the physical aspect than it is the spiritual one. One you can simply do, the other has to be cultivated. It can take time.\n\nThis is so true!!!\n\nThat's why yoga is offered at gyms - it caters to those people; membership all rolled into one.\n\nI do not like when they play music with lyrics in yoga classes. Sometimes songs bring back memories and I just want to stay present in class. They’re still usually great classes though 🪷\n\nTaking a course and getting a paper that says “X amount of hours” does not actually make you a teacher, actual practice does\n\nThis is true with every certification and degree I think.\nI had a training once with Leslie Kaminoff and the certificate had an asterisk at the bottom that said something like \"I can't guarantee that the above paid attention or was awake during the entire course , or learned anything...\" Or something like that.\nIt was funny, because really, training is like that. Everyone takes something different out of training, depending on what they have already learned and what they put into it, right?\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with at home practice… my self-consciousness keeps me trying harder, at home I can focus better, but I also allow myself to give up a lot more.\n\nEdit: I just realized I replied to the wrong comment. Whoops.\n\nI did my YTT. It's a great way to deepen you practice although you could probably accomplish more for your practice for the same price through dedicated one on one's with a yoga teacher you really connect with. \n\nIf you are planning on trying to really make money teaching yoga, just know that a YTT certificate is the very first step in what will be a long and difficult journey. \n\nIdk if these are unpopular opinions. I'm not really sure what the current mind set is around what it means to have a YTT certificate.\n\nMine is that it's okay to be proud of your yoga body and the work you've put into sculpting that body. Everyone seems to say that's not what yoga is about and while I don't think it's everything, I am very happy with how strong it's made me and how lean and toned I am (I'm 44 and had a child in my late 30s, gained over 100 pounds, was like 230 pounds or something.. I weigh 125 now and look and feel great). I'm also really proud of myself and it kind of bums me out that I feel like it's taboo to say that the process of trying to master asanas/yoga got me looking like a 25 year old.\n\nWell, congratulations! \n\nYoga has a way of forcing you to connect with your body, and losing unnecessary body fat is a part of that. This random stranger is proud of you!\n\nThis really is incredibly awesome. Go you! Did you do anything besides yoga as far as working out? And how often did you do yoga? I’ve practicing for about 2 years (3 to 5 times a week) and I’m definitely a bit more toned and getting stronger but I don’t think it’s doing much for weight loss.\n\nEvery time I find myself peeved with anyone else in yoga class I remind myself that that is quite literally the point of yoga and mindfulness - learning to flow with the distractions instead of getting caught up in them.\n\nThis is one of the greatest lessons of yoga! I used to attend classes at a studio in a very small town where everyone knew each other and THE MOST ANNOYING WOMAN WHO EVER LIVED attended classes occasionally and I was so so grateful every time I saw her there 1. Because she obviously has a shit ton of trauma and needs yoga and 2. Because I got to practice releasing my crappy internal judgements of others (and by extension, of course, myself).\n\nSpeaking as a dude who has never been to a live in-person class (peloton app in the spare bedroom for a few years), the posts on here make me never want to go to an in-person class. Lot of stuff on here about what clothes to wear, how early or late to show up, where to stand, etiquette, phones/no phones, breathe loud/don’t breathe at all, drink water/don’t drink water. Lot of extremes on both sides of normal everyday *stuff*\n\nThat’s part of the reason why I posted this. I think more people should give yoga a try, it’s been *so* good for me, and when people constantly complain about the little things it creates an uninviting atmosphere. \n\nWe can’t complain about too many people being unhealthy and then also gatekeeping so hard. It’s counterproductive.\n\nSome of the stuff I read makes me imagine the giant school cafeteria as a new student. You better have on the right size JNCOs and the right color Fubu jersey or you’re screwed\n\n I lurk here but some of the posts make me nervous to go to an in person class. I’m good with Dennis and Kristen at home! I especially like when Dennis says “I make suggestions, you make decisions”. The only person judging me is my dog. Hah.\n\nFinding a studio/class/instructor you like is a lot like dating. It’s a bit of work and not every one is a winner.\n\nI've been practicing yoga for nine years, taught for one and a half, and I've been to many different studios in my area. None of them have had any of the extreme situations mentioned in these posts. They always have cubbies outside to put your phone in. Wear what you want.\n\nYoga's not supposed to be this uptight, and it's not. Don't let complainers turn you away from an amazing practice.\n\nI agree with you OP. A few years ago students at my home studio complained about one man’s noisy breathing. They thought he was being rude. The manager spoke with him (kindly) and he had a medical condition that caused the noisy breathing. Live and let live.\n\nYoga doesn’t have to be spiritual for everyone, it’s exercise for me and a way to relieve my chronic pain condition.\n\nThank you. I love yoga, I love working on deep breathing and spending time trying to quiet my mind, listen and be present in my body. I am absolutely not there for anything spiritual\n\nSetting your mat right in front of mine in a near empty studio is a personal attack.\n\nMats should be staggered to offer everyone as much mirror access as possible\n\nThis is not an *unpopular* opinion.  Most people feel this way.\n\nI go to a couple studios where the default is orderly vertical rows….so the front person gets a mirror view and everyone else gets a view of yoga butts.\n\nStaggering looks kinda chaotic but is my preferred system\n\nIf that's the system you can't blame the students for lining up the way they do.\n\nBut it reminds me of large parking lots.  Have you noticed how you can park way far away from all the other cars, but when you come back out from whatever you were doing there always seems to be someone who parked *right* beside you, even though there were dozens of other spots they could have chosen?\n\nI call these people \"clumpers\", where the herd instinct is so strong they just feel more comfortable being close to another person.  Whereas others like me, and possibly you, are \"lone wolves\" who prefer the opposite.\n\nOh I *shouldn't* blame the students, but I *do.* I take it personally every time...which is why I figured it would be an unpopular opinion.\n\nYes!  I get to class early and am happy whenever someone is already there in the front row.  I’ll set up offset behind them and be guaranteed an unobstructed view to the mirror.  When no one’s in the front row inevitably they will place their mat directly in front of me; hopefully I can offset my mat, if not it’s an added challenge for me for that  class (let it go).\n\nMirror? Oof, then I guess my unpopular opinion is mirrors have NO place in a yoga studio other than the bathroom.\n\nUnpopular opinion: mirrors do not belong in studios. We are a looks and visually focused society, and being forced to focus on how a posture feels in your body rather than whether it looks like what you expect improves the experience of yoga. \n\nAt my last studio (whixh sadly did not survive the pandemic) we faced a full wall of windows that over looked a river. It was amazing and it changed so much about my practice, and helped me stop judging myself\n\nMy current studio has a huge masala painting on the wall, plus numerous dots on various locations and colors\n\nI feel you OP. Unless other participants are breaking the rules of the studio, then either learn to ignore them or practice elsewhere.\n\nIt's okay if you just focus on the physical benefits of yoga. I feel like I've been judged for having that opinion but I've been practicing for 12 years. Sometimes what I need is to feel better physically before I can feel good mentally. Even after a trauma, I just couldn't focus or do the spiritual side of yoga for many months. What I needed was to feel okay with my body first. I see nothing wrong with that.\n\nTime allotted for savasana is never enough, and could usually double or even triple.\n\nDrinking water is a faux pas? Wtf? I thought hydration was a good thing\n\nI once had a teacher who used to get annoyed for people stopping to drink water in a hot yoga class, told us we were using it as a distraction.\n\nThere was a thread last week where someone encountered a teacher that didn't want them to drink water in class.\n\nWhen it comes to breathing I'd like a beat or counts for breathing. So many times people say \"breath with the movement, I won't coach you through this flow\", then I'm half way done and they're like alright you should be arriving in chattaranga now...like if you want me there now don't let me go with my own breath, give me some cue\n\nI don’t like mirrors in studios. I feel like when there’s a mirror, a couple things happen. One is that you start watching yourself instead of focusing on the pose and alignment and how it really feels to be in that pose. The other is that I live in a college town and the studio I went to for a while that had mirrors also had tons of college girls taking booty pics in the mirror and it killed the vibe. I come to yoga to be less self conscious, not to worry about my sweaty face in someone’s insta story.\n\nMy unpopular opinion is yoga instructors should spend at least equal time on actual science (e.g. anatomy) as they do on: chakras, planetary positions, meridians, crystals, essential oils, etc.\n\nI would say we definitely spent an equal amount of time in my YTT training on anatomy and physiology stuff as we did on the spiritual stuff. Aside from chakras, though, the other things you mention were not even discussed in YTT. It was more about the history of yoga, where the different types and branches of yoga originated from, etc. And then another third of it was more practical stuff like how to sequence a yoga flow, etc. I'd be concerned if a lot of YTTs were spending a ton (if any) time on essential oils and the like...\n\nYES. Having an instructor who knows common physical ailments that affect certain poses and how to give good alternatives to people who have them is so much more important to me than chakras/etc.\n\nMy unpopular yoga opinion is that the differences in poses are not “evolutions” but “variations.” what one may be considering another yogi doing as more “advanced” and then feeling negative about their own practice because of it, is simply targeting something in that yogi’s body/mind that they need/want and has nothing to do with how “advanced” they are. different? yes. better? no.\n\noh, and when you are practicing in the west, you are not immune to the social contracts of a western society. if you can’t come in on time or respect personal space, that’s not my burden to bear and requesting an entire group of fellow paying members of a community to accommodate your oneness is a tall order and if it’s not fulfilled at that studio, find a new one 🫶🏽.\n\nThis! I have POTS and hypermobility and am a teacher and it drives me mad when other teachers use hierarchical language. Don’t tell me “if I can’t do x do x” etc. For myself I actually have to do what they consider “less” so I don’t hurt myself because I’m too flexible. On that note another pet peeve is teachers not learning proper variations, accommodations, and alternatives for disabled and plus sized people. If your default is “go into child’s pose” it’s exclusive and lazy.\n\nYup. I'm practicing using the word \"options\" for poses instead of the hierarchical and competitive language that so many teachers use. (I'm always looking for more inclusive language suggestions, if you have any that you've found helpful). I'm interested in teaching accessible yoga with a lot of accommodation options for folks with all kinds of bodies. Thankfully I'm in teacher training at a studio that has 5 gentle yoga classes a week and a couple of different chair yoga classes as well, so I'm able to learn from folks who are already familiar with providing options.\n\nMy YTT really highlighted invitational language of exploration and sensation! Things like:\n\n-I invite you to explore what this feels like in your body\n-is there a way you can make yourself 10% more comfortable?\n-what does this side feel opposed to that side?\n\nInstead of using levels based language my teachers would often use “if you want the sensation to feel more intense” etc. I was always taught too that the teacher should choose to model more “Modest” variations frequently to show that even yoga teachers choose variations and that it’s about self awareness not competition.\n\nOne of my instructors will say “if (x) pose isn’t in your practice, try (y) pose. Or try (x) pose reclined.” And then notes that the alternate pose works the same muscles or has a different purpose. She also says things like, “you may want to continue to explore this expression of the pose, but if you want to go deeper, try (variant).” I love it. It’s nice to have an invitation to push myself in one of several ways versus an expectation of doing one way.\n\nThis might be “popular” idk but I can’t stand when studios say “all levels” for a flow and then the instructor only calls out pose names. “All levels” should include people who are beginners right?\n\nI believe yoga is less about \"me\" and more about us. Yes, I listen to my body and honor my individual practice, but the connection is the most beautiful part for me. This is why I feel particularly drawn to Bhakti.\n\nI think my unpopular opinion is going to be very unpopular! \n\nWhen I first started yoga, I found it incredibly off putting how many very advanced yogis were in the beginner/introductory class. It’s not just off putting because it means that you feel like an absolute idiot as a beginner, but I also found that teachers spent more time going through variations and how to make poses more advanced than going through the basics.\n\nI understand why people will do beginner classes even when they’re advanced - whether it’s for scheduling reasons, their own training programme or because they want to practice the basics. But it is/was very annoying.\n\nAlso - I wish more yoga teachers actually physically corrected poses (with permission of course!) So many teachers just aren’t good enough at describing what a pose should feel/be like. I understand why corrections aren’t always possible though. \n\nI think it depends on the city/studio. I have lived in San Francisco and now L.A. The “beginner” classes I have taken in these cities are nowhere near beginner level - they’re really more intermediate. So when I try a new studio, I may sign up for a “beginner” class, not knowing how difficult it will actually be.\n\nI just wanted to add that teacher explaining how to make an asana more advanced can be just as well for the beginners. Some people already have body awareness and flexibility in some areas from the start and certain positions will come easy for them from the start while they will struggle with others. Also possibly this way you are being taught of how to think of a particular asana and progress when you are ready.\nThough I understand that that’s not what you want out of class personally and that’s fine of course.\n\nFor me, I'll do the beginners classes if that's the only time I have, or, my body needs to heal from something, and I want to take it easy. \n\nWhenever I'm in a beginner class, I stick to the basics, instead of challenging poses. I don't want to be *that* person.\n\nI do find it pretty eye-roll worthy when someone goes to a beginner class and does extremely advanced poses. Validation is a heck of a drug.\n\nSometimes the beginners/gentle classes are the only ones that advanced yogis with daytimes jobs can attend. Sorry.\n\nBut the teacher should still teach it as a beginner class and not modify to make it harder for you. I wouldn't turn up to an advanced class and expect it to be made easier for me.\n\nBALASANA SUCKS.\n\nIt's not restful.  It's not comforting.  It's a fucking nausea-inducing compression.  I have never, ever, ever heard a teacher give a modification for it.  I've heard modifications for Sukhasana, FFS.\n\nOh, I can return to this pose at any time during class, really?  The pose that makes Pranyama a nightmare?  Like meditating while someone drops a shipping crate on my back?  Can I shove an icepick through my eye instead?\n\nAnd oh how they love it in a Yin class.  Let's stay in Balasana for five minutes?  Really?  Only five?  Why not 50?  How about five hours?  Where'd I put my icepick?\n\nI like instructors who focus on the other seven limbs; I like the ones who cue a class like it's purely exercise.  I like heated and not.  Hands-on is good; so is hands-off.  Ashtanga?  Absolutely.  Iyengar?  With pleasure.  Restorative lying on 20 blankets and bolsters?  Delightful.  Studio or at-home practice?  Yes.\n\nBut fuck that fucking Balasana back to the fucking Stone Age.\n\nChild's Pose.  Child Abuse Pose. Children's Crusade Pose.  Damien the Omen Pose.\n\nAnyhoo.\n\nDo you feel that in wide leg ?\n\nHow do you feel about anahatasana/puppy pose? I usually offer that, or Crocodile, as an alternative to child's pose. But I'm not sure if those poses would present the same issue for you. I have to be honest that I offer the alternatives I do because of the possibility of knee or hip flexor issues and hadn't really thought about compression being an issue, so I appreciate you mentioning this.\n\nI've traditionally been a runner and weight lifter as primary fitness and yoga as secondary. I often sense from comments I get that many in the yoga community feel that yoga is far superior to running/weight lifting. I could be off basis but I've had the feeling numerous times - what I'm reading between the lines is \"one day when you figure it out like I did, you'll give up running and just focus on yoga\".\n\nI'm deep into the spiritual side of yoga as well as asana, but I struggle with the spiritual yoga community. Too much cultiness and holier than thou vibes in my experience.\n\n\nEdit a word\n\nThis is a huge reason why I practice at home. Mostly because I get self conscious, but I have sensory stuff so I can get easily distracted and unable to focus in most classes. So, I practice at home!\n\nSecond self conscience yogi here, no one can hear you fart at home!  I may get a side eye from my dog but otherwise, let it free.\n\nPreach! I love my at-home practice. No sensory issues or anything but I'm very self conscious and get way more into the practice and the poses when I'm alone \n\nUnpopular : I dislike yoga with music. I feel 99% of teachers are terrible djs ( and vice versa, I m sure). Also not a big fan of little stories to reflect on shavasana\n\nIf you call a class a power class it better be more difficult than a non-power class. And making the classroom hotter doesn’t count.\n\nI prefer studios without mirrors. It’s distracting and I don’t want to focus on how I look, I want to focus on how I feel.\n\nI share the same unpopular opinion as OP. Way too many people on this sub complain about every little thing. Makes me grateful to be in such a welcoming studio where I don't have to worry about people judging my every move if it doesn't resonate with them.\n\nKnowing that there’s plenty of people with poor hygiene makes me not want to try hot yoga. I’m already not a fan of heat and baked body odor is horrible.\n\nAnother opinion I think everyone can agree on. \n\nFor the record I've been in more than a few hot yoga studios.  There's generally good ventilation (because of the heaters blasting) so you don't really smell anyone.  The only consistent stench I recall is that my own clothing *reeked* of ammonia after every class.  Not body odor, mind you.  *Exactly* the same smell as from an open bottle of household cleaner.  \n\nAlways was a mystery why.  Apparently, there are several possible reasons, but this seems like the most applicable:\n\n&gt; Protein breaks down into amino acids, which the body will convert into ammonia. The body then releases this excess ammonia through urine and sweat, leading to the ammonia-smelling odor ... During a workout, if someone is producing sweat that smells like ammonia, it's possible that the workout itself is so high in intensity that the body is working in overdrive to break down as many amino acids for energy as possible.\n\nI practice hot yoga regularly. Throwing half a cup of baking soda into the wash works to eliminate the stink for me. \n\nI’ve been to a lot of hot yoga classes, and folks are usually pretty thoughtful about this. I think applying extra deodorant is done by nearly everyone. (Personally, I don’t attend class unless I’ve showered that day, and I put on extra deodorant.) I’ve actually encountered very little B.O. in all my years of hot yoga.\n\nSkip traditional Bikram, the studios are carpeted. I've never had an issue in any other hot or warm class in a normal studio\n\nI like hands-on assistance and that thing where they lift your feet and shake your legs during shavasana. I'm disappointed that far fewer instructors do that now than before Covid.\n\nHaving a teacher tell me I'm doing it wrong while I'm teaching. \n\nPeople who run their studios like a cult.\n\nStudio clicks are the worst.\n\nInstruction is mostly a suggestion, though many instructors don't overtly state that. I actually *wish* more instructors would encourage yogis do what felt right for their bodies. Hang out longer in your forward fold if that feels good! Flip your dog if your back needs a good stretch!\n\nI love studios that are welcoming and accepting of people being human. I already face so many rules every day; I don’t want more when I get to my mat.\nI learned from day one that in yoga, you don’t compete, you listen to your body and adapt to your own abilities and constraints. As long as you make it to the mat and behave respectfully, I don’t care about late, leave early, drink water, modify, sync or don’t sync, or snore in shavassana (that last one always makes me giggle a bit in fact, so I love it!)\nI feel (or hope) that it’s a popular opinion, based on the upvotes.\n\nHard pass on being cool with people coming late. That’s disruptive and disrespectful to everyone\n\nI agree, OP.  My first teacher told me all the distractions / annoyances ARE the yoga.  Can I be serene amidst the chaos?\n\nPartner yoga with classmates is not okay with me.\n\nStop saying Namaste at the end of class! It’s my biggest pet peeve. It’s not traditional, it means hello, among other things. no one in India says Namaste after a yoga session. Also, don’t wear leggings. You’re supposed to wear loose fitting clothes for your body.\n\nWhether you are a spiritual person or not, I think people who practice yoga should at the very least have a healthy respect for the spiritual origins of yoga.\n\nLike if you want to just do asana for physical and mental health benefits that’s fine, but it always feels icky when people who choose that route express open disdain for the spiritual aspect when that is a fundamental part of what yoga is and where it comes from!\n\nHaving a healthy respect is totally fair! I understand and appreciate the origins even if I don’t participate in them. \n\nMy do take issue with people telling me I’m Doing It Wrong if I choose not to include a spiritual aspect in my practice (and to me mindfulness is not spiritual). But I’m never going to belittle someone for including it in their own, or talking about the origins of the practice - and I completely agree that expressing disdain/judgement for people who do include that is pretty gross!\n\nYeah, the comments saying that it's bullshit in this thread kind of make my eye twitch. Sucks to hear.\n\nI don't like people who snore in savasana, who fart, or who are obviously peacocking. Other than that, I'm chill.\n\nYou can get just as much spiritual development out of a power yoga class as you can out of a slower paced class.\n\nI like when flow classes play melodic electronic music at a semi loud volume.\n\nYoga can help with a variety of both mental and physical health problems, obviously not everything, but a lot. Probably not unpopular here but a lot of normies IRL seem to *hate* the suggestion.\n\nYoga should be used to help opiate users wean off drugs snd make withdrawal less horrible. \n\nI know hot yoga is getting a lot of hate in this post, which is very understandable because it’s definitely detrimental to a lot of people.\n\nI was in a very bad accident in 2012. I was prescribed a LOT of hydrocodone and told to take them every 4 to 6 hours. Ans I did religiously for 3 sold mothers \n\nThen the doctor said it was time to stop and he refused to prescribe more, without any warning. I had 5 pills left and I was terrified of what was coming for me. \n\nOut of desperation I went to my old  bikram studio even tho I hadn’t attended class there in over a year. I explained my situation and let them know that I might not be able to participate and would likely be in savasana for most of class. \n\n\n(This was always encouraged for anyone who needed it. I only gave them heads up because I thought it might actually concern the instructor.) \n\nTo this day I don’t know if it was the placebo effect or if it somehow actually helped detox me I spite of what I’ve been told about that being a myth. Either way it helped me wean down with my last 5 pills and the withdrawal period was much much less awful than it would have been. \n\nSo yeah, yoga for people who are coming off opiates. It might not work but I think it’s something that should be encouraged\n\nEdit to add: after that first class I was actually able to join in more and more each day\n\nChanting is usually not what I want in class.  I don’t want to be instructed to say words by someone who can’t say the words they instruct.  \n\nThe vast majority of \"yoga\" in the USA is not yoga. It should be called anything but.  Theres pilates, stretches,  poses, etc..\n\nThis is *definitely* an unpopular opinion, at least for this sub.   \n\nI know because I immediately wanted to downvote, then reconsidered in light of the question, and instead upvoted.  Well done.\n\nI have realized this also, and thanks.\n\nThis is very true. It’s just posture (asana) practice lol\n\nAs someone just starting out in US yoga, would you kindly explain what the difference would be, or where to find more information on what \"real yoga\" is about? I'm very curious.\n\n\"Real yoga\" is a lifestyle.  Theres things one should/shouldent do, belief systems, diet, pranamaya, etc..  all this is in contrast to just a physical practice, which is western \"yoga\".  Some yoga doesnt even involve any physical movement at all out there(yoga nidra), or karma yoga.  All are different paths towards divinity.\n\nTo find more information, I would look up the origins of yoga and \"sage patanjali\".  The \"8 limbs of yoga\" is also a great place to start searching.\n\nMy unpopular opinion is that those new to yoga should not rely solely on online classes. So much can be gained by the in person interactions!\n\nOk, I’m a little nervous to post this one - there seems to be a mad race to the mirrors. Like people will place the top of their mats against the mirrored wall. And then they look at themselves during class. And I get it - I like to see my forms and make corrections as needed, so the mirrors are great tools. \n\nBut sometimes I’m not so sure they’re checking their poses. It almost seems performative bc it’s always the same people, and they are pretty advanced. And it was so intimidating when I first started going to these classes!\n\nThe first time I went to a yoga studio with mirrors, I hated it.  (Around 2010ish).\n\n\nThen I realised how awesome it was to actually be able to make corrections based on how my pose looked, rather than just on how it felt.   It gave me a whole new level of body awareness posture wise, and has been particularly useful pre and post surgeries and with other complex body/postural issues. \n\n\nThe only studios that I've been to with a mirrored wall at the front of the room, have (very flexible) etiquette around who practices in each row.   So more advanced folks do tend to go in the front row, and beginners at the back. \n\n\nThis is so beginners have someone to follow along with visually.    But it's not set in stone.\n\nAgree 100%\n\nIm incredibly grateful to have a studio…as a guy, that is accepting of an old geezer like me. Particularly, considering it’s mostly a women’s space. I’m willing to tolerate almost anything…all while being super careful not to freak out the type of folks you’re referring to in this thread\n\nWe live in an odd time. Sometimes it seems most people are looking to be offended…It’s really sad\n\nLike when people say these modern times are so super bad. I personally think this is the greatest time to be alive on this planet…ever\n\nAnd the fact that me, as a 59 year old male..raised on toxic masculinity…In a horrible environment…can now take this beautiful, introspective journey towards self improvement is something I’m super grateful for\n\nNamaste 🙏🙏\n\nI hate clapping at the end of class\n\nnot only is it unnecessarily self-congratulatory (and a bit masturabatory), but it totally ruins the calmness that is achieved from savasana.\n\nClapping?! I’ve never been to a studio that claps. My god, that’s awful\n\nI once went to a mid-day beginner class and didn’t realize that it was geared towards senior citizens. They all clapped at the end (which I don’t care for), but I clapped with them - it was sweet and they all had fun.\n\nIt frustrates me that instructors think we know what you mean when you say tilt your pelvis or other micro moves. \n\nI don’t have fine motor skills and my math mind does not comprehend what you are saying.  \n\nThere are so many micro movements that mean all the difference between success and struggles on some positions. \n\nI wish there was a micro movement class.  Like\nHasta Bandha.\n\nWhen I started my yoga journey, I did so at my local YMCA. I went in knowing absolutely nothing. The Yoga room was attached to the aquatic center. In fact, we had a blind covering the big window that overlooked the pool. It was very loud and distracting when there was swim practice or a swim meet. I remember getting frustrated and probably pretty angry because I was trying to find my Zen, dammit! Looking back, though, all of the distractions were a blessing in disguise. By having to focus and put all my energy into learning each pose and listening to the instructor, I learned a true skill. I learned to quiet my mind and focus on the lessons at hand. As a result, I learned how to meditate. I’m grateful for that clunky introduction to yoga. Now, I mostly practice at home. That's a result of the pandemic but when my Y and local studio hire more instructors, I will remember how I thrived in that chaos and hopefully not get caught up in the little things that we all might get annoyed by.\n\nI don’t know if this qualifies but I love practicing at studios that don’t have mirrors. I’m relatively new to yoga and have spent 3 months in a studio without mirrors. I feel more connected, more joyous, more focused than I ever have. I called my mum today after a session to happily announce how much joy, centered-ness, and play yoga is bringing to my life. I’m happy to be a yogi :)\n\nMost people’s complaints about group asana practices really boil down to “I can’t force this to basically be a private with a bunch of NPCs doing what I like to do in class.”\n\nAnything having to do with other peoples feet touching mine just grosses me out. Had a class years ago where instructor did this and I just got up and left.\n\nI wish some instructors would stop prattering loudly through the ENTIRE savasana. I don't need to hear your voice for my entire downtime!\n\nIn my Yoga teacher training I was taught to not pull my knees to my chest after bridge/full wheel, because bending a stick in many directions fast will break said stick. \n\nA spine is not a stick, it has joints for a reason and if we move our backs, they adapt to the movement we do. I really wish this sort of fearmongering about the body had no place in yoga, but it does\n\nHeat is just a device to make you feel like you've worked out harder\n\nI dont care for the spiritual side of yoga. It’s great exercise and helps me age more gracefully.\n\nYTT pricing makes it unattainable for a lot of people.\n\nMost of the time, it doesn't bother me if someone wants to change their practice during class or leave earlier. There was one person at a studio I used to go to. She would go right in front of the class, bring her own weights, and do an entire weight workout routine on her mat. This would be in any class, whether a yin or a hot yoga class (no weights involved). Then she’d leave 20 minutes early. I don't know why she even paid for the class. That's the only time someone doing their routine and leaving early bugged me. Not sure why she even came\n\nThat is so odd. I kind of wish I had her ability to not give a fuck.\n\nDownward dog can get absolutely fucked and I'm gonna complain out loud every time it comes up in a yoga video.\n\nHaha, upvote because that does sound unpopular. I love downward dog. It's an acquired taste, though. Keep breathing\n\nVinyasa classes generally don't follow breath and are way too fast.\n\nChaturanga/\"Vinyasa\" (i.e. downdog, chaturanga, updog etc) is taught incredibly poorly - if ever. Most of the time it's solely instructed.\n\nAlginment is generally arbitrary nonsense.\n\nTeachers who don't want to treat their asana class like a workout/physical training, shouldn't be teaching postures/movements that are strenuous. I.e. actually prepare your students.\n\nYou don't have to teach all 8 limbs in every class.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with just teaching a single \"limb\" for a whole class or series of classes.\n\nThere is also nothing wrong with not teaching the Patanjali model.\n\nYou cannot separate the practice from the abuser if you're still singing praises to and using the name of an abuser.\n\nMost folks calling things \"not traditional\" don't know what they're talking about.\n\nIf your teacher talks about \"toxins\" you should run.\n\nPeople who are advanced and basically do their own class rather than following the instructors poses - why are you here. Practice by yourself because you're not getting anything from the class. It's so extra.\n\nAlso I hate happy baby\n\nI wish I could let people come and go from classes. Our studio is unattended and the area just isn't in an area that would be safe to allow that.\n\nI would love to have a class that was so inclusive.\nAlready, I teach classes that can be done by any level, size, shape, ability, gender, (or non) , etc.\nGuess what? It's the lowest attended in my studio.\n\nYeah, I don’t get this either. When I started, I was taught to focus on yourself, your practice, and your mat. Shut out all background noises and distractions. Don’t compare yourself to others because you don’t know their life or struggles or body issue. I’m super into that concept so it’s kind of amusing to see how many people are so distracted by all the various things. Therefore, my unpopular opinion is “Stop worrying about what everyone else in class is doing and stay on your own mat.”\n\nI really hate standing splits. Unfortunately they make an appearance at every class I go to 🥲\n\nI live and practice yoga in India, and my pet peeve is it’s practically impossible to find a class without the religious aspect of praying; would love going to yoga retreats but most of them insist on prayer sessions, that are supposedly mandatory. Ugh! I have been thinking of doing a 200hr teacher training program, just to intensify my practice with no real teaching goals. But can’t find secular yoga schools at home. Someday I hope to save enough money to go to some foreign country and do it instead. I keep dreaming of Barcelona and the Yogabody studio as a potential option.\n\nI actually like chair pose 😂😅\n\nForward fold is an unhelpful term for a movement that should be coined a forward bend or back stretch.\n\nIt can absolutely be about the pose.\n\nYoga can be absolutely nothing to do with the yoga sutras\n\nBackbends are the single best thing one can learn to do properly, especially if you don’t like them\n\nAssists are not there to correct, that would imply you’re doing it wrong, that’s not the case. Assists are there to facilitate balance and align your anatomy and energy.\n\nDoing a 200 hour doesn’t make you a yoga teacher, alternatively you can be a great yoga teacher without it. It just allows you to buy insurance.\n\nTotally only a me problem:\n\n\"Sits bones\" drives me up the wall 😂\n\n*Sitz 🥴😂\n\nI don’t know if this is unpopular or not but whenever teachers voice the sexist and outdated idea that someone on their period (wait I’m sorry “moon cycle”) should modify their inversions I’m just like….how do they think anatomy works in there? Do they think everything is just going to flow in the opposite direction if I go upside down right now??\n\nPet peeve is where the studio jams bodies into the space like a cheap airline."

Ice cream for breakfast. I'm starting tomorrow.\n\nYesss 😂 I do eat ice cream for brekkie pretty much every time I go into town, which is 2-3x week 🙈 There’s a bakery with the most delicious artisanal lúcuma ice cream and I just cannot resist!\n\nbadass\n\n🙏🏽✨\n\nBeautiful! But that hyper-extended knee scaaaares me\n\nThanks! Don’t be scared :)\n\nIf you keep going your leg is gonna pop right off\n\nHopefully not 😅\n\nThe fit w the docs atee\n\n🫶🏽\n\n👏👏👏👏 beautiful dancers pose—nearly competition worthy.\n\nThanks 😊🙏🏽\n\n“The harder you kick you can balance here forever”\n\nWell I wouldn’t say forever 😅\n\ngreat flexibility! what's your routine?\n\nI’ve had different routines over the years but I’d be lying if I said I had one at the moment. This year has been all about moving intuitively for me, practicing about 5x a week and just doing what feels good. Some days it’s more about strength, others more flowy (sometimes all I do is spinal waves), others I feel super focused on general flexibility. \n\nPractice is always changing, just stay open minded and try new things when you feel a little stuck or uninspired and let the sensations guide ✨\n\nI feel for your knees. But we suffer for our art, so I get it.\n\nMy knees are alright 😊 but I don’t claim to know it all and can’t speak for the future so let’s just hope they stay this way 😬🤞🏽\n\nYour knee was the first thing I noticed- please try not to lock your standing knee out you have hyper flexible knees and chronic overextension can lead to injuries, especially when weight bearing. \n\nCame here to say this. Hyperextending combined with locking the knees is a recipe for future injury.\n\nYes girl beautiful dancer pose but your future self will thank you if you start being mindful of the knee hyperextension now\n\nThanks for the concern 🙏🏽 A little bit of hypertension (as I’m doing in this video) can be safe and even natural for certain people, when there’s strength in the surrounding muscles and understanding of alignment, specially with slow controlled movement. I don’t have hyper mobile knees that accidentally hyper extend at random times, I’m moving in a way that feels good and supported. I wouldn’t encourage anyone to do this, everyone is different and everyone should learn to understand and listen to their own body with any movement form ✨\n\n[removed]\n\nThanks :)\n\nNatarajasana!\n\nSuch a lovely asana ✨\n\nPowerful\n\nThanks :)\n\nwow amazing job😍\n\nThanks 🙏🏽✨\n\nomg wow you can do this so effortlessly. goals !!!\n\n🙏🏽😊\n\nGorgeous!\n\nThanks :)\n\nWOWOWOWOWOW\n\n🤗🤗🤗\n\nMy dancer pose looks a little bit more as if “shot in the spirit of the big Lebowski “so great job and looks like a cool place to visit\n\nYou want a toe? I can get you a toe…. Posed well for balance in dancers pose! \nBut in all seriousness - The Big Lebowski is awesome and be kind to yourself, it’s a hard asana and any rendition is awesome.\n\nHi V. Awesome girl. Just goes to prove the ideal studio is nature itself. This looks like an impromptu practice in day wear instead of the studio. A highly controlled demonstration of what I call dancer pose. You make such concentration and mindful coordination with smooth and beautifully graceful transitions look so deceptively simple. \n\nAbsolutely delightful to watch and a reminder to live in yoga 24/7. You are as ever an inspiration. Thank you for sharing.\n\nNamaste\n\nEdit type.\n\nThanks 🙏🏽✨\n\nAwesome! if you don't mind, may I ask your age?\n\nThanks! I’m 34 :)"

    "all_comment_text": "Well I did not know if that was possible. How graceful\n\nThank you! That’s why I like to share :) I feel like backbending specially is quite misunderstood and underrepresented in yoga.\n\nI literally said \"Wow\" out loud over here :-)\n\n\nThat's some really impressive strength you're showing here.\n\nThank you 😊🙏🏽\n\ni wish people would recognize how athletic this is. none of my friends appreciate flexibility but when i am 80 i am going to be a lot happier being able to tough my toes or scratch my back then being able to bench press by weight.\n\nRight! Many people think yoga practice is just a bit of passive stretching that doesn’t really do anything 🤣 It’s okay though cause we know what a difference it makes and that’s all that matters👌🏽\n\nIdeally we'd reach 80 with the flexibility to bend down to our grandkids AND the strength to pick them up. They're not mutually exclusive, and strength training is incredibly beneficial to strengthen joints and bones that inevitably deteriorate. This is especially important for women as the risk for osteoporosis multiplies with menopause \n\nThere's no competition between strength and flexibility when it comes to quality of life! They're both fundamental pillars of a happy and active life.\n\nEvery time I see a video from you you always get to a point where I'm like \"wow that's a really deep bend. What an accomplishment.\" And then you go deeper. \n\nAlways astonished by how deep you go into poses.\n\n😅😊 Thank you!\n\nPs: depth is just a result of practice overtime and not the goal of the pose itself. For example, in my experience a “regular” bow and a full bow to the max expression can provide the same amount of joy and bliss :)\n\nMula bandha legend. Gold medal flexibility. 👐🏽\n\nThank you 😊🙏🏽\n\nSo very beautiful.  No grasping.\n\n😊🙏🏽\n\nThis is so insane you are so flexible wow\n\nThanks!\n\ndude you’re an absolute unit for this, i am WILDLY impressed\n\nThank you 😊🙏🏽\n\nYoga clips on this page really shows the potential of how far this can help your body. Respect.\n\nThank you 🙏🏽\n\nThat is incredibly impressive, OP.\n\nThanks :)\n\n[removed]\n\nThank you :)\n\nI find your videos inspirational. Thank you.\n\nThank you 🙏🏽✨\n\nWow! This is beautiful!!\n\nI have questions. How long have you been practicing?\n\nThank you :) 12 years, the first few were very on and off and now I have a dedicated daily practice ✨\n\ngoals. i bet that feels amazing!\n\nIt does :)\n\nBackbending so good for you! How long have you been practicing? Btw beautiful landscape!\n\nIt’s such a good feeling! At first it’s hard because most of us are more used to hunching for years and years 😅 but once things get a little easier ahhhh feels like bliss! It’s been 12 years since I first got on a yoga mat :)\n\nI've been practicing regularly for 6 months, hope to get where you are in that long! Your grace and control is really impressive 🤍\n\nThank you for sharing! I hope one day my backbending will be as flexible and strong as yours.  ☺️ I’m on my 4th year and began my YTT certification this month. Looking forward to growing in my practice. 🌵🩷🌼\n\nHi V, this is just beautiful. A supreme demonstration of mindful concious control and coordination. You make it look so simple and yet it is so so difficult to control these transitions with such eloquence and coordination with perfect breathing control. \n\nAs ever you inspire with your apparently effortless sequence, it's like you are defying gravity. It is not it is extremely hard physicsl exercise. Thank you so much for sharing \n\nNamaste\n\nThank you for such lovely words and continuous support 🙏🏽 Namaste ✨\n\nAmazing! I can only lift my upper body a few inches from the floor. Are there certain exercises/poses that can be done to improve backbending? Thank you!\n\nThat’s totally fine, we all gotta start somewhere :) \n\nIn order to go a little deeper, sometimes the issue is not engaging the right muscles and relying only on the back (often only the lowerback 🥲) or even the arms to lift, the lowerbody and core play a big role as well as the back muscles in lifting up. I’ve got a [flying cobra tutorial](https://youtu.be/TZrZSkrlxS0?si=R5D6YdWpiXFiRug1) on YT explaining what to engage and different progressions if you’d like to take a look.\n\nOther times if you’ve already got the strength and understand engagement, you might need more flexibility in general. Often upper back, middle back, hip flexors or shoulders (if you want to flip the grip) might need a little bit of attention and love.\n\nIt takes time and lots of practice but wherever you are, it’s totally possible to progress over time. Keep exploring :)\n\nwow 👏\n\n😊🙏🏽\n\nJeepers you are incredibly flexible!  It almost looks like you're bending the other way, I would never be able to come close to a backbend like that, we all have our strengths I suppose!\n\nBeautiful! Motivated me to get on my mat today 🙏🏼 I love your outfit/set, especially the flowy sleeves on the top, where did you get it?\n\nWell done. 👏🏽👏🏽🕉️🧘‍♀️\n\nThank you 🙏🏽✨\n\nWelcome to your future back surgeon.\n\nWhat do you mean 🤔\n\nThat is amazing.  Am I the only one that immediately thought of how fun that could be in the bedroom?"

I’ve been practicing for 10+ years but as far as handstands, only about a year\n\nWhen was your biggest growth curve?\n\nI would say it came after I could hold a solid handstand for 30+ seconds away from the wall. So probably after 1-2 months. In the beginning balance was my only focus, then I started adding more transitions and such after I got that down\n\nLOOK HOW FAR I CAN STRETCH! Blah. \n\nThis is the real deal.\n\nYour walls make you the only person on reddit who I know i’ve seen a post from before.  Always enjoy them.\n\nThank you! They definitely stand out haha\n\nWow. You’re incredibly strong! Great job!\n\nThank you so much!\n\nSo great, good technique!\n\nHow long did it take for you to be able to do it that way?\n\nThank you! About a year :)\n\n😲\n\nWow\n\nHow do you not violently queef doing this? Is there a certain breathing or pressure technique? \n\n(Genuine question from a flexible female wanting to get into recording yoga sessions)\n\nAsking the important questions here 🤣 seriously though, pelvic floor engagement! It’s called mula bandha in yoga but it’s basically just kegels. Doesn’t work every time but it definitely helps\n\nHappy dances are the best 💞 as always you look incredible :)\n\nThanks girlie 🥰\n\n[removed]\n\nThank you 🙏🏻\n\ngoals\n\nThank you!\n\nSo strong! 💪⭐\n\nThank you so much 😊\n\n[removed]\n\nYou’re always so sweet!\n\nAmazing! What does the poster on the wall \"Kitchen Witchery\" say?\n\nThank you! It’s a list of herbs and spices\n\nDamn girl you are killing it!\n\nThank you 🙏🏻\n\nI think if I attempted this, my spine would hop away in protest. \n\nGreat job!\n\nHaha thank you!!\n\nDangg girl 🔥\n\nThanks love 🫶🏻\n\nVery nice and controlled. I hope to be there someday\n\nI’m sure you will! 💪🏻\n\nDude this is seriously impressive! I’m a beginner at yoga so this is definitely some great inspiration :)\n\nThank you so much! Enjoy your yoga journey 💕\n\nBeautiful! If you can't already press up - you will be soon!\n\nThank you! I don’t have my stalder press yet but it’s one of my main goals right now\n\nAny tips on handstand holds? I'm having a hard time staying up for more than 5-10 seconds 😬\n\n\nNice work!\n\nThank you! My top tips are 1) claw the ground with your fingertips instead of keeping your palms flat, 2) tuck your tailbone and pull your front ribs in (kinda like you’re doing an ab crunch), 3) push the ground away like crazy, and 4) gaze between your hands or wrists instead of forward 😊\n\nLol I wasn't expecting that landing and said \"daymn!\" out loud. You are goals!\n\nThank you! I wasn’t expecting it either but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try 😂\n\nWow! This is impressive\n\nThanks!!\n\nHi. Lovely demonstration of handstand dismount. Great control and form throughout. Thank you for sharing\n\nThank you!\n\nSuper smooth. Congrats!!\n\nThank you 🙏🏻\n\nWhat was your progression like from a hand stand to slow lowers?\n\nConnecting that full range of motion is tough. Can you go the reverse direction?\n\nThe first few months I just focused on balance. Then once I could hold a controlled straight line handstand I started working on transitions.\n\nI can’t do a stalder press yet, but I’m working on it! I just got my straddle press and stalder is harder, so hopefully in the next few months\n\nAwesome. Thanks for sharing. \nDo you do anything specific for wrist flexibility? Mine suffer after anything more than 30 mins of hand balancing. \n\nI find myself gravitating to parallel bars for the wrist positioning / weight distribution. Ever try training on them? Increased range of motion is fun!\n\nYou’re welcome! I could talk about handstands all day lol. I always do an extensive wrist/forearm/scapular warm up before my training. That being said, they still get pretty fatigued sometimes, but it takes a lot longer for that to happen than it used to.\n\nI’ve not tried parallel bars, but I want to! I also see people using poles/canes and those look cool too. The extra height could make for some fun transitions\n\nOmg love love LOVE this!\n\nThank you!! 🙏🏻\n\nI was going to ask what did your handstands look like before you started trying to do a slow lower? How did you build the strength! Very impressive. I can hold a handstand but lowering like this is a goal of mine and feels very hard to achieve as I have very tight hips and hammys\n\nMy handstands looked terrible at first lol. It took me months just to get the balance part down before I started working on transitions. Once I could hold a straight line handstand I would stay in it for as long as possible to strengthen my upper body. Hip flexor strength is also super important (and underrated). \n\nAs far as the tight hips and hamstrings, I recommend doing poses like wide legged forward fold, standing/regular splits, and hip openers (pigeon, double pigeon etc) daily. My inversion practice transformed when I started focusing more on flexibility\n\nNice form!  Strong 💪\n\nThank you very much!\n\nGreat work! Stalder press eccentrics are difficult💪\n\nThank you! I’m hoping this will help me get my stalder press soon. It still feels impossible right now 😅\n\nBadass...\n\nThank you 🥰\n\nAmazing\n\nThanks!"

    "body": "I've been practicing since I was 14 and I'm currently doing my YTT just for further enrichment, and honestly I'm getting very cynical at the current landscape.\n\n99% of \"yoga\" is asana now. \"Being good at yoga\" means being able to crank yourself into impressive looking poses. I peak into this sub and I'm genuinely sad to see that it's almost exclusively preoccupations with the physicality of it. Don't get me wrong; I love that aspect and am constantly trying to grow in it. It's separate from my meditative practice for a reason. \n\nBut honestly, why are we continuing to call a practice, devoid of philosophy and the limbs of yoga, yoga? Sure, the mind-body connection is beautiful but you get that from pretty much any other sport... This \"yoga\" is certainly not more efficient than gymnastics or ballet at creating mind-body connection, strength or flexibility. So what's the reasoning?\n\nI can totally see how this may come off as snobbish, but it genuinely saddens me that an ancient practice rooted in transcendence has been adopted by the West as something so superficial, and honestly, dull. Even secularizing it, yoga is meant to be community and service-oriented. It's meant to be holistic. It seems almost disrespectful to the tradition that it's just devolving into \"look at my handstand\" ",

I was wondering maybe there is another subreddit for the more spiritual aspects of yoga. Well there sure are many other subreddits with yoga in the name but they are all NSFW lol. This tells something about reddit as a platform. I guess we just have to bring the spiritual discussions here. Gymnastification is still closer to real yoga than pictures of butts.\n\n&gt;Because how do you simplify the spiritual part of yoga enough to share it with others? \n\nI think probably taking them by the hand down the path. Probably you can teach a bit of the yamas and niyamas during asana. But almost nobody I've learned from taught pranayama at all, or explained the goal of taming the mind through meditation. \n\nThat's plenty of extra guidance without even needing to get spiritual. Myself,  I'm on the spiritual fence. I will experience for myself the results of meditation,  and if it leads me to spirituality,  I will be accepting of that.\n\nI had a teacher like this. She was amazing! And then she left my studio and is teaching at a athletic center that is out of reach for me financially. I miss practicing with her. She changed my life.\n\nSorry to hear she left, I checked your other post. Some studios will exchange free or reduced cost classes for cleaning the studio afterward. Do you have her contact? She may have another idea as well, or can help you find out if that might be an option worth considering.\n\nThis is great. I too, would like to see beyond the asana, but don’t have enough insight to lead the discussions. Happy to be enlightened.\n\nI mean, almost anything. Yoga is pretty much an all-encompassing philosophy. For example, yoga has an element of community and service. It's actually more in tune with the traditional path to post about your volunteering efforts than it is to post your mermaid pose... One could post about having an experience of oneness while walking in a forest, how they are working on different yamas and niyamas in their daily life, their realization of sanskara... \n\nAgain, this doesn't even need to be spiritual in the sense of metaphysical, though it would be totally valid for people to start talking about chakras, karma, gunas or yugas. \n \nYoga is a framework that can pretty much be applied to anything.\n\nI don’t mean to be argumentative, but have you ever posted here to start a discussion about the topics you mention? Are you in turn contributing to the culture you want this community to have?\n\nI actually did and got removed because it was not \"related to yoga\" when the main question was how can I use my existing yoga practice to enhance my spiritual growth....\n\nNo, that's a great question.\n\nI do it in my community. I teach socioemotional learning and that's something i emphasize with my students, because yoga and mindfulness is a part of it. I'm not so active online though; this is a bit of an exception.\n\nWell the good news is you're in YTT. When teaching, cultivate the culture you want to see! \n\n\nIn my YTT, we were taught to integrate yogic philosophy and make it digestible to the general public then your students can take that into their lives and off the mat. (Not leaving parts out, but more along the lines of giving the lessons subtly)\n\n\nI will say also, people doing 200 hr. YTT and then going out there into the world to teach yoga doesn't help. There's only so much people can learn in a 14 day immersion or 10 weekends. There are some things that take continual swadhyaya to get a firm understanding of. Especially if you're transmitting that knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately I am a full-time student and run my own business, so I doubt I'll actually be teaching anytime soon. I'm just doing YTT to deepen my own practice. I do very much appreciate the advice of \"be the change you wish to see\" though.\n\nI do feel concerned that it's disincentivized though. I'm sure there are many teachers that feel they need to stick to the \"workout\" framework because that's what gets the bills paid. I guess the ideal is just to slowly progress until it becomes more appeciated in the mainstream and people start actually seeking it out more. It's a bit of a vicious cycle and it's hard to pinpoint who's able to break it.\n\nI'm doing other physical activity lately (not yoga school) but I'm always at local Kirtan when I can.  \n\nMaybe just pursue your own Asana practice, but instead of going to a \"Yoga Studio\" every tues and thursday, find a Kirtan group, or spend weekends at an Ashram,  or doing XYZ volunteer service.\n\nStop gatekeeping yoga.\n\nThat's a strange reply to a comment where I'm literally saying \"I wish it were accessible for more people to do something.\" Pretty sure that is quite literally the opposite of gatekeeping lol\n\nYou're not.\n\nI empathize with you, and suggest looking into Ashtanga and Iyengar, two branches that tend to attract students with interests beyond asana.\n\nReading through here I'm seeing Ashtanga and Iyengar being kinda billed as \"traditional\" -- but even they are modern/popular, coming from Krishnamacharya and the physical culture boom in the early 20th century.   Didn't he lift the sun salutations from a body builder at the Mysore Palace?  Not saying there's anything wrong with that, but I do struggle with characterizing Iyengar and Ashatanga yoga as \"traditional.\"\n\nTraditionally yoga was oriented towards liberation, samadhi, moksha, whatever -- not what Iyengar and Ashatanga are oriented towards.\n\nEdit:  Alternatively put, if you're studying the teachings of Krishnamacharya, Iyengar, Jois or Desikachar (and their students) you're probably mostly in the modern/popular realm of yoga, whereas with traditional yoga your people (from the last 100 odd years) will be guys like Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Yogananda, Aurobindo, Sivananda and Ramama Maharshi\n\nGotta agree with this as an Iyengar practitioner training to teach: in my 10 years practicing, asana has been a tool to achieve physical health and mindfulness through movement. The wider philosophies and history of yoga have been secondary in my experience.\n\nThanks for the honesty.\n\nMy thoughts exactly\n\nYes, it is well known that Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya designed an Asana system to be athletic and therefore appealing to the military at Mysore palace. \n\n\nIt's also known that he was a Brahmin and a Sanskrit scholar and sponsored his student Pattabhi Jois to attend Sanskrit college. \n\n\nThat same parampara is still past down today, although not in all western circles. That's why with some authorized/certified teachers (although not all) will still teach philosophy, vedic chanting, yoga sutras, etc. \n\nDisagree with this. I’ve found that those two are some of the most physically “make the shape” oriented. They pay some small homage to the roots, but the practice is very physical.  I would recommend OP look into a meditation practice. I think their anger is coming from the change in terminology and what yoga means in common usage. Traditionally, yoga had no movement at all, so if they are looking for something traditional, they should not expect to get that from a YTT that is intended to teach white women how to lead an exercise class. There are a lot of great ways to deepen a meditation practice, from attending temple, to retreats, books, videos, or even a yoga studio with meditation classes, but a normal studio class or western YTT is not intended to do this\n\nI've had a meditative practice since I was 14 as well, in parallel to yoga. It's definitely a great suggestion, but I do think there is a special benefit to movement meditation. Yoga fulfills this perfectly, and it's really its original intention. Just not most modern Western approaches anymore. That's what I find sad.\n\nI was just about to suggest Iyenga - the teacher I found says his body isn’t flexible and accepts and talking more about alignment of the body and opening up the energy channels etc. It feels more of a well rounded approach and is what got me into yoga as I came from a sporty and stiff background so was always intimidated by the asanas and this eased me in. There seems more emphasis on pranayama in this style as well. I can feel irritated by too much emphasis being placed on asanas I guess it’s just about finding your own style and way to incorporate the 8 limbs of yoga ☺️\n\nagree with what others said about ashtanga and iyengar being heavily focused upon asana practice. look into bhakti yoga (yoga of devotion) or jnana yoga (yoga of self study and contemplation).\n\nAshtanga and Iyengar are some of the most asana focused styles and pretty much did the most in creating the current \"modern postural yoga\" landscape by carrying on the work of Krishnamacharya.\n\n  \nCan you give specific examples of their interests beyond Asana and how that is commonly manifested in classes and culture? Beyond doing a little chant at the start/end of a class.\n\nAlternate perspective- Asana is an accessible entry point to everything else for a lot of people and it gives enough benefits that 90% of the people don’t feel the need to go deeper. \n\nBalancing poses, or even challenging poses are great moments to really clear your mind and be fully present (nothing like a healthy fear of falling face first to help) and that, for a lot of adults, is the re-introduction to being 100% present in the moment. Once you find that feeling, you start looking for it and meditating to find that presence without judgement. \n\nThe general feeling of peace also feeds into kindness and care for the world because happy people don’t go around being mean to others\n\nYoga is a broad church\n\nThere are yoga books from the 1940s that say the exact same thing.   It’s not new.\n\nI thought the same thing. Also will add that I think this could be solved by the widespread adoption of the term ‘western yoga’ to describe a practice with a greater, and often sole focus on the physicality. I’m a bit of an outsider myself though honestly so not sure if that’s the best solution.\n\nPretty sure they basically said that about Patanjali and Hatha yoga in general.\n\nThere were a lot of yogis at that time (80 years ago) traveling around India and demonstrating yoga asanas.    It continues today.\n\nMy point is more that it predates even that.\n\nI'm thankful that such gymnastification introduced me to yoga, and simultaneously frustrated with it now that have begun learning more. \n\nI'm doing my YTT soon and if I teach I anticipate it will be community classes to introduce people to pranayana and meditation. Asana and pranayama are just prep. \n\nHopefully there are some who will find that of interest. If not, there's a couple hot yoga studios in town that do the loud music thing. (Sometimes I go there myself, since I can enjoy both.)\n\nI’m thankful too. The rigor of the practice prepares me for meditation. Work hard rest hard (??)\n\nSame here, I started with hot, power flow style yoga and got really frustrated with how disingenuous the environment was. I ended up at a much more spiritually oriented studio with a more diverse community. They also offer Hatha, yin, and restorative classes and do lots of night time nidra with candles and sound bowls. I’m lucky to live in a larger city with lots of options. \n\nEveryone pursues yoga for different reasons and outcomes. They’re all valid! And I’ll seek what I need out and let others do the same.\n\nTotally! Anything that will get people started is a good thing. It's just important to not get stuck in that framework... i think the issue is that becoming more \"advanced\" in yoga is now just synonymous to getting yourself into cooler poses rather than deepening the internal process\n\nYeah it's unfortunate. You really only need be able to sit comfortably to progress. I feel years behind relative to asana in pranayama because it was never properly explained or integrated into my practice. \n\nI think the most unfortunate part is that there is so much to gain that people are likely to believe beyond their access simply because they cannot do a perfect wheel or headstand.\n\nYeah, agreed. Never mind the 4 limbs of meditation - not even any of the many types of pranayama have made it into the average Western Yoga class.\n\nMaybe you need to explore different studios? Different teachers? I find that I can usually find what I'm looking for\n\nSeek and you shall find…on googles.\n\nabsolutely. i love yoga at real studios. one time i went to a “yoga” class at my gym and it was literally dance cardio i was so confused\n\nGym 'yoga' is totally different, isn't it???\n\nCorrect take, but you won't find sympathy here.\n\n\nI've seen comments here such as \"I don't like doing X pose, what should I do?\" \nA:\"just skip it, it's not serving you!\"\n\n\nIt matches with a growing attitude I've noticed trending away from discipline and personal accountability and towards something like unique dispensation. \n\n\nFacing difficult poses is harder than facing difficult truths like the ones you raise, so the culture is a long way off.\nEmbody the correct way in your own practise and influence and it will organically spread to the people around you. Forget about online communites, they aren't a reflection of reality like they may have been in the internet's early days.\n\nThis is so spot on it hurts. So corny but, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. All where you point your perspective and how you approach.\n\nThis is a wildly insightful comment!\n\nJust gotta say I love your user name! I have wonderful childhood memories of that story and it continues to pop in my life periodically. \nThanks for the reminder 💕\n\n&gt; Embody the correct way in your own practise and influence and it will organically spread to the people around you.\n\n\nAs with all things.\n\nThis sounds like the opposite to what OP's saying. But maybe I've misunderstood something.\n\nI’m commenting on this to be able to come back to it. What a thoughtful response. Bravo !\n\nSamesies\n\nAll things are observed by others, adopted with alterations, and morphed over time; that’s part of [Memetic Theory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics) It’s in our languages, fashion, architecture, religions, techniques of every industry, and so on. \n\nI understand your frustration, and I think expressing it out loud is a good thing to do. But I also think it can be taken outside of yoga and understood by all as the relatable concept of “wanting things as we want them” and “not wanting things to change” out of reverence, conditioning, and comfort. This is the way of all things, and it’s not always for the negative in public perception. \n\nWhen the “twerking” term first hit the mainstream scene with the aide of the internet, many didn’t even recognize it as dancing but as closer to pornography, it often didn’t appear on music video TV until the late hours, and kids got suspended from schools for emulating it. Today, it’s all over media that’s far from the source, a part of tons of choreography, and appears on all sorts of programming, and is featured on ad deals and popular late night shows. \n\nSome facts are static, most conditions, perceptions, and science is dynamic, and what people do with all of the above is in constant flux.\n\nI would counter that I practice my mind body connection in other ways, and I do practice yoga to counteract a mostly sedentary lifestyle. I spend a lot of time driving and sitting, I’m a music teacher and I enter “flow states” in my personal life often and intentionally. Doing yoga at home, I like to chill out and connect with my breath, but I go to classes to work out, and that’s not a bad thing. I see what you’re saying but I also don’t think it’s a bad thing that yoga is seen as a great way to get physical and expand your flexibility; it has many benefits that are not just for your mind, and not everyone is very good at practicing mindfulness and they shouldn’t feel shamed for not doing yoga “right”\n\nHonestly, if you find yoga courses dull, that kinda seems like a you thing. When I go to classes I’m not worried about if everyone’s transcending or not.\n\nThis! I am a dancer and I often find myself in a flow state mid song. Dance is meditative for me. I feel connected with my mind, body and spirit when I dance. \n\nI do also enjoy traditional yoga and breath work to ground me into my body. It also helps with chakra blockages and energy healing. I do see OPs point, though.\n\nMy YTT was heavy on the non asana studies as well. I try to bring that dialogue with me here, especially when I see questions from newer folks about feeling inadequate because of pose xyz. That’s all we can do, is be the change, be educators.\n\nI spent last week in NYC (much larger city than where I normally live) and visited a couple different yoga studios there. I was really impressed to discover these were not just sixty minute fitness classes. There was one with lots of Hindi chanting and meditation. One with Tibetan Buddhist elements. One with lots of Chinese medicine etc. Unfortunately if you live in a smaller place it can be a lot more limiting. But many of these studios had online classes so perhaps that’s an avenue to explore if you have very specific interests?\n\nYep. I'm not frustrated by it as you are, but it's clear to me that the vast majority of people who practice yoga in the United States view it as a physical activity, or even a competitive sport. But it's not.\n\nAgreed. It can be really frustrating. \n\nMy own teacher handles this brilliantly. He uncompromisingly teaches the complete Yoga path, but he also defends other teachers' emphasis on the physical parts of yoga, because that can be a gateway into the other aspects of the practice for some people. If we insisted that every teacher taught Yoga in the traditional way, very few people would come. The way it is, perhaps a few more people eventually find the complete instructions. \n\n&gt;yoga is meant to be community and service-oriented.\n\nCould you give a source for this comment? I've never seen anything like it in a Yoga text.\n\nI turned to specific workshops and trainings that favor another branch of yoga. Specially pranayama and meditation. I also regularly come across workshops specific to the philosophy. I think it’s a matter of looking for what you need instead of settling for the same thing over and over.\nBest of luck seeking!\n\nI think even when you’re using yoga as a workout it comes with an extra that puts you in a ¿meditative state? and that doesn’t happen with pilates calisthenics whatever. Asanas are powerful. Even if you wanna ignore the spiritually inherent to them, something comes up; or that’s how I feel. Does anyone feel the same?\n\nPd: I mean, I usually do ashtanga, but if I’m short of time and I want a 10-15 min workout, I tend to replicate the yoga structure, I prefer some sun salutations than jumping jacks for warm up, for example.  Even in that situation (maybe I’m even looking at the clock, not really thinking in my breathing, alternating some glute bridges or lunges with asanas for rest between series) I definitely feel something in downward facing dog, plow or malasana.\n\nI have literally said this while teaching. “If you’re just ‘doing the pose’ to do the pose, it’s just gymnastics.” It usually makes people laugh and come out of that competitive mindset, when it inevitably manifests. Reminding students over and over again that “advanced” yoga looks a lot more like honoring the breath, adjusting for YOUR body moment by moment. And, creating that culture in your classes means students feel safe to explore asana, if they like, but also to dive deeper into philosophy, breath work, and the other limbs of yoga. There’s a place for all of it :)\n\nLook for a new place. It doesn't need to be about circus tricks.\n\n&gt;I can totally see how this may come off as snobbish, but it genuinely saddens me that an ancient practice rooted in transcendence has been adopted by the West as something so superficial, and honestly, dull. Even secularizing it, yoga is meant to be community and service-oriented. It's meant to be holistic. It seems almost disrespectful to the tradition that it's just devolving into \"look at my handstand\"\n\nI think you're going to be very unhappy as an adult if it angers you what people do for their own health / entertainment. I love the gymnastics side of yoga, I started it (as BodyFlow at the YMCA) because I specifically wanted to improve my balance / strength / flexibility and 13 years later I'm of the same mindset. I've practiced in 10+ different countries (in their respective languages) that span the entire spectrum of deep into meditation/spirituality and asanas and you know what happens if a class doesn't meet my needs? I don't give go back to it, it's not actually a big deal.\n\nYoga isn't some living entity that needs you to defend it - just like as someone whose Vietnamese I don't care *at all* how people choose to enjoy their pho. If you wanna start a Change.org petition on changing asana focused classes to another name besides yoga though then by all means - I'll even sign it for you.\n\nAs far as the COMP posts here go, I love them because they're the main way I've learned about new poses to add to my own practice.\n\nthis resonated so hard esp because i’m viet and truly don’t care how much you bastardize your pho. if you’re eating our food and love it, enjoy!\n\nalso i think with how sedentary our world is becoming, it’s great that people are excited about their progress in movement &amp; poses. \n\nto each their own!\n\nThank you for articulating what was happening in my brain. It’s also interesting to me that they think that they know that someone else’s experience doing yoga is superficial or dull.\n\nTrue.  Just call it asana practice.  Not snobbish.  An accurate critique.\n\nIt’s true when someone has mastered a handstand as an adult, it’s “look at my handstand” lol\n\nI haven’t mastered a handstand but I do imagine I’ll be 4 year old excited when I accomplish it\n\nWhich is a totally natural and beautiful reaction!\n\nI don’t feel like this is new at all. I’ve been doing yoga since my teens so a little over 20 years now and even then it was already fully commercialized with high end studios where people cared more about their luxury yoga pants than the actual practice, and offered as a class in some gyms where it was just asana with no other foundation. And I’m sure it had already been that way for quite some time before I landed on the scene.\n\nBut at the same time, some of those gym yoga classes were going really deep into philosophy, and there were still plenty of great resources out there.\n\nAlso, some of the really supposedly authentic and higher vibration studios and gurus turned out to be very fake, scammy and even predatory in some cases. \n\nLike anything in life that becomes popular enough, you are going to get that spectrum.\n\nAlso, there’s a very human tendency to romanticize things from a distance. If your YTT includes a lot of history of the practice you’ll see that feuding philosophies and ego and even sometimes violence has occurred in the yoga community since the beginning, since there’s a huge difference between what humans aspire to be or see themselves as and what they actually practice day to day. Would they even need yoga at all otherwise? I promise you, hundreds of years ago there were “look at my handstand” yogis out there.\n\nSuch is the current landscape, but this kind of vain preoccupation is native to India both contemporary and mytho-historically. I've found it helpful to remember that this is an embodied practice, so there isn't actually a need to pontificate philosophy: the philosophy and ethics are in the *mechanics* itself. Western instructors love to haphazardly dispense Sanskrit to Bon Iver backtracks, but sentimentalism is shallow. You'll influence more students toward the truths yoga makes clear if you refrain from dharma-talking in class and help them continue to refine their attention.\n\nExactly what others say, cultivate what you want to see. Pay no mind to the rest. Be aware. Bring what you want. No point in being ‘bothered’ by the ‘false’ or hip trends. Stay strong!! 🥰\n\nyoga sutras might help [https://yogainternational.com/article/view/yoga-sutra-1-12-translation-and-commentary](https://yogainternational.com/article/view/yoga-sutra-1-12-translation-and-commentary) it seems you are attached to an idea of what yoga is that may not be the same as what others think yoga is. Everyone is on their own journey and that journey is unique. Asana is the traditional practice of uniting the mind-body-universal self, imo there is no other path and there is no destination just the journey. One can step on the path and off the path at any time, and travel along it as long as they like. Maybe become distracted by some crystals or sex or partying in bali, but the path, your path is there right next to you. Let others take their journey as you take yours. Don't be attached to a definition of thing that isn't likely to be real anyway, just enjoy your journey and hold some hands along the way to help others enjoy their journey.\n\nI love to see yoga asana everywhere and my hope is that folks get curious about the other limbs!\n\nYou want to see yoga your way and others enjoy it another way. So you wish for everyone else to see and enjoy yoga the way you see it.\n\nAlso Yoga studios are a business and cater to customers. If you had to pay your bills with the proceeds of your business, you either cater or run into financial difficulties pretty fast.\n\nI started my yoga practice back in 2012. Yogagirl was huge on IG and it felt like even then it was all based on who could do a handstand and get into scorpion. Seems like it still hasn’t changed. I totally get your thoughts. Even speaking to my yoga teacher friend she too agrees that it is very competitive for some reason. Why? Who knows. I’m with you and all your thoughts are valid.\n\n&gt;But honestly, why are we continuing to call a practice, devoid of philosophy and the limbs of yoga, yoga? Sure, the mind-body connection is beautiful but you get that from pretty much any other sport... This \"yoga\" is certainly not more efficient than gymnastics or ballet at creating mind-body connection, strength or flexibility. So what's the reasoning?\n\nI would see it as honoring the roots. Where it comes from. But why should it not be allowed to evolve? Why is it important for you, that it must stick to the tradition or not be called Yoga? Why are you in charge to define what is right and wrong? This in in my opinion some kind of fundamentalism, like one can see in religions. Or it would feel like gatekeeping. You said it yourself: \n\n&gt;   yoga is meant to be community and service-oriented\n\nWhere is the community and service-oriented thought if it can only be traditional as the pure Yoga, and nothing else? \n\nYoga is for a personal thing. It connects me with myself, it helps me with acceptance, and it also spreads acceptance in smaller Yoga classes. And this is so much more important nowadays, where we all get more and more disconnected with ourselves and our environment. \n\nI am not interested in any esoteric stuff, with meridians and Chakra centers and so on, because I see it as an excuse not to have to deal with yourself and your mental problems, but to hand over responsibility to a concept (its the same for me as religion). So this is not for me,  I stay away from too spiritual classes, but it is okay. I call it still Yoga, for the part that fits me, that feels good for me. And I call it Yoga to honor the roots.\n\nWell hopefully one day you'll get to the point where your perceptive faculties become acute enough for you to EXPERIENCE  the subtle reality of the existence and functioning of Chakras, meridians, and the like. Trust me (or not) they're not just concepts - they are subtle, functional energies that many, many individuals have experienced the profound effects thereof.\n\nSo if this is not for you, so be it. But do yourself a favor and don't dismiss these energies as mere concepts simply because you have no interest in them and therefore have not felt their effects.\n\nSorry, but as long as we cannot measure and quantify these energies with scientific means, they stay mere concepts. \n\n\n Look, I know, it is very alluring to believe that such stuff exist. The problem is, that with start believing in them, one disconnects with the reality and fall into a rabbithole. And in this rabbithole, you let lose of your own responsibilty. \"I cannot speak about my Feelings because my Heart Chakra ist Blocked\" is such example. The truth may be, that one is lying to oneself, about some truths that one is Not ready to acknowledge yet. \n\n\nAnd this is the same with human energetics or ancestral karma. People need Help, but they become stuck, because they giving away their Power and responsibilty to external factors and concepts. And the very disgusting part is, that other people selling them \"solutions\". And I know, it is so easy to believe in such stuff, it offers easy explanations and it offers any easy guidance through life. \n\n\n Everybody can believe in his own believes, but If people enrich themselves in the cost of other people, there is the boundary for me. \n\n\n And you know what bullshit is? If at beginning of the pandamic, my kundalini Yoga teacher Back than Said: \"Do this practice to strengthen your Aura. Your Aura ist like a barrier, that blocks all the negative Energies as Well as the Virus\" this is something were the concept is Mixed with a real thing. And this is dangerous.\n\n\nEdit: I think that it is in our Nature to belief in something, that we also need it and it's beneficial to us. But there is a fine Line between believing in something and let it Control our Life. \n\nHmm. I think you might need to learn more about meridians and chakras.\n\nI’m an old fat busted yogi. Who has time to be mad at yoga? Enjoy the athleticism at the fringe or ignore it. Why do you care?\n\nI feel like this was the case ten to fifteen years ago. If anything, the trend I see pushed today is downplaying asana to the point of saying it’s not yoga.\n\nSeriously!!\n\n&gt; ancient practice rooted in transcendence has been adopted by the West as something so superficial, and honestly, dull. \n\nThis is inaccurate.\n\nThere's no evidence of some direct 5000-year-old line from the ancient yoga you speak of and what gets practiced in studios all over North America.  \n\nModern postural yoga, the kind predominantly practiced in North America, is about 100 years old.  It's derived mostly from Swedish gymnastics and British calisthenics.  It was invented in India **by Indians** and specifically marketed **by Indians** to affluent Westerners as a superior form of spiritual and physical exercise.  It's working as intended for its target audience.\n\n[Here's a short article on it](https://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/philosophy/yoga-s-greater-truth/).\n\n[Here's a much longer book](https://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Body-Origins-Posture-Practice/dp/0195395344/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FUY7FL2WZQW6&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zJjHtq_Vb2zFzkqDvrgYkXkWX2JbOBoCHnPXdjVvi1qm7v9lBGybMJQtnW7ry2muOi2FA_8X1Fmzl-cbUdqp8s7NmvyJvqxGjE6nI6vOlDwFKXlyC2MGCo_sjGB2R-qpkLFU3jH33hVpqEWTrMkkAMGwjTyHNEdBRxBNQhyGkb0.lKqqDaQb54UHDf_FWCTO4GXw9MXGmEl6L0-fotLPu6o&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=yoga+body+singleton&amp;qid=1727351439&amp;sprefix=yoga+body+singleton%2Caps%2C109&amp;sr=8-1), fully sourced and vetted by Indian scholars and historians.\n\nEDIT: added emphasis to help others.\n\nI would agree that the sequences may be modern, but I've seen reliefs of human figures in 'yoga' postures carved into ancient - massive temples, all over India. Some of the Tantric depictions are quite erotic akin to things like Urdhrva Dhanurasana with 'helpers'\n\nI hear you and I agree to a degree. \n\nBut let it go. \n\nLive your life. Teach what you believe in. \n\nSending love \nNamasté\n\nHuh? Let it go. Why? It's the truth. You let it go and miss all the subtlety and intention of Yoga. Heavy cost to pay in a casual statement about deep potential of the practice.\n\nI agree. I used to go to a place called The Yoga Garden. They focused on meditation and the whole body and the mind rather than just the poses. It seems like a lot of places are into keeping it as hot as possible or moving fast to burn as much calories as possible. There's way more hot power yoga classes than normal classes. One of the studios here I find unbearably hot and a little lacking of soul. People love it though. I enjoy fitness and hot yoga but I also liked learning, readings, and the full body experience. Or a balance between the two- mindful movement.\n\nI understand where you are coming from. I am curious: do you feel like you are getting this impression more from the online community, the studios you attend, or both?\n\n\nMy studio does a fantastic job if emphasizing the historical, spiritual, and meditative aspects of yoga. It also draws an impressively nuanced balance between using it as a \"tool\" for health, and respecting its traditions. On the other hand, every yoga-related channel or influencer I have every followed has been exactly like you described. So, both exist in our community! There is hope!\n\n\nI recently had an amusing exchange with a friend whom I have tried to get into yoga for quite a while. They didn't want to do it because they didn't like the physical requirements! Well. Imagine their surprise when I introduced them to pure yoga Nidra!\n\n\nAnyway, I completely understand where you are coming from, but I hope that you don't give up hope that there are plenty of people out here who appreciate yoga in all its dimensions! I don't consider myself particularly educated about yoga, but I try to educate myself here and there, and share what it gives me with others. I am sure that I am not the only one!\n\nI can’t help to think of the 8 blind men (or whatever number) and the elephant.  Is that all yoga is?  The 8 limbs?  Are there actually 8 limbs?  Of course that’s true, but why don’t we ask those questions as well?  We can treat as a form of exercise, to help with the mind body connection, a religion, a spiritual practice, or whatever.  It is what it is.  The Tao that can be named is not the Tao.  What I find so ironic about us is that it feels all of us should strive toward the last limb of yoga, like a building.  To be perfectly honest and I’m probably gonna get a lot of hate here, but all I care about are the first 4 limbs of yoga.  The other 4 feel like super powers that while super amazing that really feed into our attachment towards success.  And sure, perhaps that is the way to be?  Who am I to judge?  What limbs are I not finding or sensing?  What I find that kinda makes me sad is how little we talk about the first two, the second being a complete unknown to me in yoga.  Sure we talk about ahimsa and non violence? But how much do we talk about how we treat ourselves and others.  How much do we think and reflect upon “right action”?  I don’t know… I don’t know how much you can get out of books.  Maybe it’s just me, but I learned a great deal about that just by living.  Confucius said, “There are three paths to wisdom: 1) reflection which is the noblest, 2) imitation which is the easiest and 3) experience which is the bitterest.  Life is great, but it is also hard.\n\nAnd I realize if we did, then that would be a bit what Reddit is.  But this is r/yoga.  Sure yoga is all those things, but  all this talk about the asanas originated with yoga… so most of us talk about the asanas because that is how most of us came to yoga.  I’m saying we, because this post is addressed to all of us.  Of course it annoys me that in my western culture, all we talk about is the physicality of yoga.  But if it really bothers you, then as someone else said, make your own posts.  I didn’t read your profile and post history, but I would start there.  As cliche as it sounds, be the change.  It’s why I’m starting to feel good about commenting on this subreddit. It’s where I feel where I can start.  So please do.\n\nWhen something is brought to the masses, and if the masses are pluralistic in their cultural background and physical needs, it is diffused.  There will be people who maintain the roots, and other people who enjoy the individual elements of the thing.  It’s a pretty normal process.  I’m not sure if this process is something that can be stopped in its tracks, for anything.  Because you will always have the person who who has minor but constant back problems…has an affordable class near them (and usually affordable = commercialized), and they have their own spiritual/non-spiritual beliefs and all of that already sorted for themselves.  Idk why they would make any other decision than to go to yoga class.\n\nI make the joke - I came to yoga for the workout, but stayed for the ancient philosophy and life changing wisdom. \nI started yoga because I wanted to get in shape. Eventually I found teachers that incorporated philosophy into the practice. I was very drawn towards (what I know now to be) their dharma talks, which led me to my YTT, which led me to a complete spiritual awakening. We should be grateful that asana is a gateway to the larger practice. There’s no need to judge another’s path. We can just lead by example.\n\nYour frustration is valid, as that is the general view to the public. \n\nI think due to demand and supply, the asana part appeals most to people and that’s how it got popularized. Yoga classes that focus on the other limbs are just not high in demand. \n\nEven so, I appreciate that the instructors in my classes always incorporate the other limbs in their own way. The classes are vinyasa classes but there is usually light talk about the other aspects of yoga during the class. I’m reminded that yoga isn’t just about the poses. So I agree with other posters on finding another studio.\n\nWhy does it bother you the paths that other people pursue? The traditions are well-preserved. Traditional practices (and people to teach them) can be found in the West. Anyone can follow them if they want to. I see modern, American, asana-based yoga as cultural syncretism, which is a really common process in the New World, particularly when it comes to religious practices. It serves what many people here are searching for. I am overcoming multiple surgeries and injuries, so the physical dimensions are of primary importance to me. And no, you don’t get what asanas can give from any other sport. Everything else I do for fitness is externally-focused. Yoga forces me to focus inward and on wherever my body is in the moment. It’s wonderful and has acquainted me with my body in a way that no other practice has. Does it feel threatening or do you wish that more people were familiar with the other limbs and what a holistic practice might bring to them?\n\nMy pet peeve isn’t asana v. other limbs (although I am really interested in studying Tantric Shaivism). It’s Power Yoga/some Vinyasa classes/teachers who make up their own flows v. more traditional practices/trainings like Ashtanga and Iyengar. I find I get a lot more out of classes that are taught by teachers steeped in those traditions. I leave class with my entire energy body and meridians open. Although it still holds value, in the other classes, I am more likely to get *only* a good workout/stretch. The sequences of poses and timing are really important and come from deep wisdom that’s hard to replicate or improvise if you deviate from it, unless perhaps you have a very deep understanding of those traditions. I prefer more traditional classes but still go to the Westernized/improvised classes, if that’s what fits my schedule/geography. I’m just grateful that no matter where I travel, and (almost) no matter what time of day it is, I can find a class.\n\nFrankly, it's just fun imo to do those crazy poses. But also sometimes it's too hard to do anything but a workout. After I had a really tough loss I just went through the motions of a physical practice for awhile. Everything else was too hard and I wasn't ready. I think there are benefits to short changing yoga at times because eventually it draws people into more.\n\nIs a person who has been doing yoga for 40 years I'm frustrated with the whole yoga scene also. First it was people doing yoga with their dogs, now there's goat yoga classes, then there was trapeze yoga.. yoga on its own is sheer perfection in it's simplicity. The rewards are from the practice, not all the bells and whistles are different animals that they want to throw into it.\n\nTell me about it.\n\nYama, Niyama, Pranayama, Asana... and the asanas come from other sources, not Patanjali. some limbs of Yoga go far back into the Upanisads.\n\nWhat you are saying is extremely valid. I experience that too. But this is not even the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThere is a difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation or assimilation or erasure.\n\nWhile people can do whatever they want for whatever reason because they have the free will to; every action comes with consequences. Someone might do asanas to keep their body fit and that is fine. Not everyone wants moksa. People's choices come with consequences. What you and I find valuable, not necessarily others will. We have to do what is best for us. Preserve this knowledge for those like us who will come after us. Embody this knowledge for those who are seeking the same.\n\nI grew up under the guidance of some spiritual masters (spent weekends at ram dass home, was in India at a young age, did seva in other countries, etc). It’s not just yoga. We have commodified everything. Self-expression and individuality exist on the online plane but day to day we fit the mold at risk of our livelihoods. We’re supposedly more connected than ever but we all know we’ve become increasingly ostracized in this strange new world.. The boot of survival is so firmly on many of our throats we no longer have time for dharma. \n\nMaybe I am jaded but it feels like we need something big for a spiritual revival to happen.\n\nThis is a stellar comment. It really is just a symptoms of a systemic soullessness.\n\nThe problem comes from the fact that yoga in the west has to be marketed in order for studios to stay alive. If they didn't market, we wouldn't get any of it. But my personal take on the matter, is that the average westerner lacks physical vigor; and this is a hindrance to the attainment of all aspects of yoga. Being fit is only possible by having some sort of attainment of some of the eight limbs.\n\n\n Perhaps I think this way because I've dedicated my life to studying exercise science and health science... But fitness is largely a spiritual matter for me. There is a wisdom and spiritual quality that I required to find joy in repetitively engaging in physical activities that yield no obvious, immediate, or significant short term benefits, other than the joy of doing it. \n\n\nPhysical fitness completely changed my path in life. I think a lot of yogis out there may reap reward by putting greater emphasis on experiencing the true nature of reality through movement.\n\n\nRunning, cycling, swimming, or walking are all meditations.\n\nFor me, yoga began as a way to help my back (I have severe scoliosis) and I was an atheist. Through practice my spirt grew and I’m more fulfilled spiritually than I’ve ever been in my life. We are all on individual paths and one with yoga in it will likely lead to somewhere greater regardless of the original intention.\n\nI had an unlimited monthly pass at my local studio for years. I loved it, attended a class almost daily, sometimes one in the morning and one at night even. I knew all the regulars and we had a nice little community. Then the owner told us of her surprise pregnancy, which ended up turning high risk early in, so she sold the studio. The place closed for about 2 weeks and when it reopened it felt more like an athletic club. There was an air of competition in every class and most of us that were frequent attendees just stopped going. It was heartbreaking, that was my clan. We tried having a private club where we would meet at each others homes a few nights a week, but the commitment didn’t last. Eventually I started watching YouTube videos and practicing from home but, without my supportive group, I lost motivation. I can’t remember the last time I practiced for more than 10-15 minutes.\n\nI disagree about the mind body connection of yoga being the same you get in any other sport (also disagree with classifying yoga as a sport, fwiw). \n\nThe thing about yoga is you can take what you want from it. Simply because the yoga sub isn't reflecting what you think yoga should be does not mean that you can't still practice it as you like, take what you want from it. \n\nPersonally, I go to a lot of classes that embrace both the spiritual and the physical sides of yoga. I don't love the focus on poses that a lot of studios/students have, but I just don't go to those studios. Yoga is everywhere, you can find what you're looking for without getting mired down in this idea of what you think yoga should be. Just find what you think it should be and do that.\n\nAre you going shopping, eating from a buffet or trying to learn a very deep ancient practice? Take want you want is the culture of consumerism. I'm sorry but you're missing the depth point of the OP.\n\nTo each their own. But I agree with this statement. Asanas constitute probably 20% of what Yog is, they should not be treated as an end goal. But something is better than nothing I guess.\n\nWhen was it that you feel yoga wasn't \"gymnastificated\"? \n\nLike specifically, what year/period?\n\nCan you articulate what you feel yoga should be/look like then?\n\nIt depends on where you study. I studied with Kripalu. They are definitely not doing what you are describing. It was actually so good getting my 200hour certification. A fabulous experience. It was all about exploring each pose not flying from on pose to another.\n\nYoga is like martial arts in a way. You may start out doing it for shallow reasons, but if you stick with it, it can transform you in ways you never thought possible. It can help shed the ego even if you never considered that as a need or possibility. We are still a young culture with many years to go before we start seeing the big picture.\n\nI stopped regularly practicing asana at studios about 15 years ago because to do so came with having to endure the trendiness and gymnastics of whatever the teacher decided was yoga.  I tried diligently to find a home studio and there was one - a mysore only Astanga studio that also had community events on the sutras and kirtans.  While I raised my daughter, I was rarely able to visit that special place.  They do exist.\n\nFor me, my yoga time is a private morning quiet time to get my body moving and I guess connect with myself. I don't go to a gym and don't want to. I will never be able to do spectacular poses, but that's okay. I can still push myself to do my own personal best.\n\nI agree, and I’ve observed that it depends on the culture. During my YTT, we discussed a lot about accessibility, and not doing hands on adjustments, while I’ve met a friend from another city where students are looking for the physical touch adjustments and doing advanced poses over meditation and philosophy as their idea of yoga.\n\nI see your point, but I think that there’s a type of yoga for everyone and every “community”. If the more “gymnastic” yoga gets the gymnastic types on their mats then that’s all good. Likewise for those that like a gentler type then that’s available too. Horses for courses.\n\nHaving said that though, the “look what I can do” is annoying. There is definitely a bit more work required on letting go of ego to do here!\n\nAs long as you are breathing and in the right frame of mind, it’s a moving meditation, even if you are doing handstands and not practicing the other limbs. It totally transforms one’s relationship with one’s body. I think it’s beautiful that this appeals to so many people and all the gifts it has brought to people who practice, even if they do so the “Western” way.\n\nWhy not start some discussions around topics you'd like to see then?\n\nI agree with you completely. \nI find the McYoga to be quite upsetting. \nI’m moving soon to a state in “the middle” and in looking for a studio for alignment yoga I am only met with aggressive “yoga” with adjectives like CORE! and HOT! and EXTREME! This is not very satvic, not very yogic.\n\nI find this sub very frustrating as well as it is very much about physical workouts and advancements and not about the preparation of the body and breath for the evolution of the Self. But I haven’t been able to find anything else. There’s an Iyengar yoga sub, which is my lineage, but it isn’t very active.\n\nI think once you start following the yamas and niyamas you’re no longer interested in spending time on social media. May we both find a good outlet for discussion and practice of true yoga. \n♥️\n\n\"McYoga\" is the best way of defining it hahahaha\n\nYour gatekeeping, condescending tone is pretty unfortunate. I do yoga because I need to stretch and it’s a great way to do it that makes me feel good. You most certainly cannot get that “from any other sport”. \n\nI'm genuinely glad you've found something that works for you; anything that makes people's lives better is worthwhile. That's really not my point at all, and that point is held in anything but a desire to \"gatekeep.\" Quite the opposite. That would be pretty hypocritical given the nature of what I am defending. \n\nIt's unfortunate you've misunderstood my message so profoundly\n\nPerhaps you should articulate it more clearly then.\n\nIt's resonated with plenty of people. It's okay that you're not one of them. I don't believe this makes either one of us better or closer to the truth. \n\nThere's really no reason to hold this matter with bitterness.\n\nOof this is insufferable \n\nI feel the same way. Finally found a studio that includes some philosophy but not as much as i would like. However in my class, i incorporate it. If i am teaching yoga i am going to teach the BIG PICTURE of yoga.\n\nCommercialization of yoga is not new. I feel you. This sub is not focused on yoga but rather asana and what pants and mat to buy. Fortunately once in a while there’s an insightful comment or post. \n\nLots of better subs here if keen on philosophy and meditation. \n\nI can suggest a retreat in addition to YTT to incorporate the holistic practices you seek. If you can make it to NorCal I personally vouch for Spirit Rock and Ananda. Silence is profound.\n\nCould you point me to those subs?\n\nMade me think of this lol [https://www.instagram.com/p/C7aNTJevOoA/](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7aNTJevOoA/)\n\nSPECTACULAR\n\nFor most people asana and sometimes pranayama is just easier to understand, which may or may not naturally evolve to the spiritual and other limbs. Either way is fine and doesn’t really affect your practice :)\n\nThere’s many ways to practice yoga. In a yogic lifestyle, there’s no need to project judgment towards others that are working on improving themselves. Your energy is best used towards radiating love and understanding towards all. Use your voice to share what you believe in and practice with others with whom it may resonate ✨\n\nYoga was not traditionally specifically \"community and service-oriented\" beyond the general sense that Hinduism sees individually fulfilling dharma and striving towards moksha as beneficial to all life. If anything yoga has gotten more community and service-oriented as time has gone on.\n\nI think Sevā fits that role, and that's certainly not a new concept\n\nYeah, I’m 50 and all of the teachers I had 25 years ago that are older than I am are retired. I live in a mid-sized city and I can’t find a single Iyengar class (the only REAL yoga, that’s how snobby I am) \n\nI quit yoga and just meditate at home now. My hot flashes are enough hot yoga for me 😂 \n\nEvery trend dies and comes back, so I’m hoping “authentic” Iyengar yoga makes a comeback soon. I’m looking at you, gen Z. Force the millennials to give up contortionist hot yoga like you made them give up skinny jeans 🙂\n\nThis makes me want to do an Iyengar teacher training. I went to my first Iyengar class (wasn’t billed that way but that was the teacher’s training) and loved it. My jam is Ashtanga.\n\nDo it! I wouldn’t do any other training. \nAlignment is everything and I love how iyengar slows down and focuses on every part of every pose. It changed my posture. I learned more in those classes than I learned in 25 years of hatha and vinyasa classes. \n\nI’m too lazy and undisciplined for Ashtanga.\n\nI went to a teacher who mixed some aspects of Ashtanga with what was essentially an Iyengar practice. We did some Vinyasas, in my mind just enough for the purpose but not the crazy high number you have in the Ashtanga primary series. And the rest of the class we really spent a good amount of time in each pose. I had some significant openings and self-realizations as a result. I loved it. \n\nI love flowing from standing to folding to plank to chatturanga to upward dog to downward dog. It’s great. I haven’t enjoyed teachers “flowing” through more complex asanas without giving us time to actually get into the pose and achieve its benefit. I’ve taken to ignoring the teacher’s timing if I find myself in an asana where I am finding benefit and rejoining the class when I am done with the asana.\n\nIyengar trained, I only practice at home now. Though I did do two series with instructors one on one. It was great to get the focus and adjustments in that setting.\n\nI had one class that literally changed my life. She taught me how to truly stand up straight. \nIyengar ruined me for vinyasa. I can’t do endless floppy burpees anymore.\n\nYour frustration is valid. Yoga’s essence is beyond asana—rooted in philosophy and mindfulness. The current trend often misses the depth of the practice's true purpose.\n\nWell, I think it depends on where you’re doing your training. Who you’re practising with? I’m in my mid 60s. I’ve been practising yoga since I was a teenager. There was a time when I found Yoga to be just that only about Asana, but those that I practice with now, really have taken it back to the original, meaning of yoga. I also did my teacher training, but I found that depending on where you were teaching, they didn’t like you to bring spirituality and the true meaning of yoga into the class you have to pick and choose where you’re going to teach if you want to lead\n\nI’m in my 70’s and I love Yin now.\n\nYou're just hanging in the wrong places.  There are plenty of people teaching and practicing the deeper aspects of yoga all over the world.  The corporate chains, gyms, and modern studios might be more interested in Asana and quite frankly that's ok.  Thru the body is a necessary step ... Most new 200 YTTs get sooo caught up in this worry about people not practicing yoga right because you're just finally learning the limbs and sutras.  Just know, you're barely scratching the surface in your 200hr so don't get too caught up in what everyone else is up to just yet.\n\nI totally get ya.  Many (most?) are unaware that hatha yoga is but one rung (the bottom rung) of one of many kinds of yoga.  And that it is meant to facilitate the experience of freedom on higher levels.  But I see it as nothing new, it has been this way for at least a decade and a half (and most likely much longer).  I stopped complaining about it when I realized that even though many people focus on just the physical aspects, its growing popularity will spread awareness and attract at least some practitioners who will become exposed to and feel an affinity toward its spiritual dimensions.  If even 1 out of 100 people choose to explore yoga further, I consider that a win for humanity.\n\nFrom my narrow perspective (I do yoga for a long time but more 'in the side', next to martial arts. Only recently, I do more meditation and yoga (since 2 years, really intensified it the last three months).\nI tend to see there is more emphasis on the meditative aspect of yoga and meditation in general. Even in a common pilates class... People don't look at you strange (well, less then before) when I tell them I did a yoga class with meditative loud mantras. \nOn the other handz true, internet and fora are full.of videos and photos about accomplishments and questions about how to meditate 'the right way' to 'achieve this or that's.\n\nEven if it was just a long list of practical asana, that would be an improvement.  But it’s just a lot of pride over getting handstand/ strength poses down.  Like yeah that’s cool, but show me how to stretch effectively.\n\nThe west has completely lost the definition of the word yoga.  The Bhagavad Gita has a few explanations of it that i really like; “the path.. skill in actions.. (at its essence) the mind stands by itself, unmoving, absorbed in deep meditation.. unbinding the bonds of sorrow.”  But to be fair, it’s much trickier to make a video of all that then it is to do a handstand.\n\nCan you go a bit more into what aspect is missing and how we could potentially go about cultivating this ourselves?\n\nSubreddit concerns aside - is this a trend you’ve noticed at your yoga studio? Maybe a different studio would have a philosophy closer to yours. I feel like my studio is pretty good at balancing the asana and mind/philosophy aspects of yoga. Maybe try a sampling of classes at different places and ask around about what different studios are like. Best of luck to you ❤️\n\nModern yoga started in the 1900s and was very influenced  by calisthenics and gymnastics.  The yogis of that time intentionally brought these practices to the west as much as the west influenced the use of more physical practices for physical health during the early 1900s. \n\nLook for Raja yoga or other types that are not focused on asana.  Have you read any Vivikanada?  He was a modern yogi that only focuses on the spiritual side.  And as others have said you are going to be a yoga teacher, which means you can teach the yoga that is meaningful to you.  A lot of being a teacher is about knowledge and intention.\n\nI actually love this aspect of yoga. I think with the difficult poses there is an understood “earning” of that. A background of consistent practice that has culminated into this beautiful ability of the body to do something impressive, steady, or strong. \n\nI think your mindset is just your own and maybe your disdain and comparison for other people is making your self conscious. Just let people exist and let practices evolve as they may. If you don’t like something, just stop giving it your attention and awareness. :)\n\nI found yoga through reading Bhagavad Gita. After that I had read Yoga Sutras, Hatha Yoga  Pradipika,  and several books on pranayama. I learned a lot about the philosophy of yoga long before ever stepping foot on a mat and attempting Hatha Yoga. My experience was quite the opposite of that of the average westerner who finds yoga. \n\nI say all the time you can be a yogini or yogi and never step foot on a mat. The prerequisite for practicing yoga is the realization that you are a soul, not a body, and that there is something divine out there that you're attempting to reconnect with. When you strip yoga of tnr spiritual aspect, it no longer is yoga. It basically is a sort of German gymnastics.  \n\nThere's value is Hatha Yoga,  but that limb shouldn't get the emphasis that it gets in the west. The only asanas I'd say are truly important for the practitioner of yoga are seated asanas. Hatha Yoga has its time and place but we can't get too wrapped up in it. It is nice when people get into yoga through the physical practice then decide to delve deeper into the spirituality amd philosophy, however.\n\nYoga is not black and white.  Use your skills and knowledge to create your style.   If you plan to teach with your YTT, you'll attract and keep those practitioners who relate to your style and may pull others who are growing in their journey.   When I began 15 years ago, it was for the athletic components. Over time, I've grown into the meditation and spiritual aspects, resulting in a much more fulfilling journey.\n\nI really don’t know what yoga practice looks like in India. Is it a business at all there? That’s going to be the main reason it looks like a fitness class only in the west. Because it’s done to make money and people are paying to be lead through a fitness class. \n\nYou can’t make other people practice yoga how you’d like them to practice yoga. Keep doing what you’re doing to deepen your own practice and work on letting go of the need to control what others are doing\n\nYoga in India does not occur in “studios”. There are ashrams you can go to that are for serious study. I was there in 2023 and yoga classes were held in someone’s apartment, or other places like that. But to them yoga is not an asana practice it’s a lifestyle.\n\nI am horrible with the poses and thrive with the mental aspects of yoga. I give it praise and credit for saving my mental health. Too bad that most don't see what benefits can come from it. I know for the poses I need to practice more but I love the mental side more I think.\n\nDevelop and teach the practice that is true to you. For me, good yoga is asana and pranayama and meditation in each session. Photos of people meditating are boring, that’s probably why there are so many pictures of poses.\n\nAs my teacher told me: \"If you're not being conscious, then you're not doing yoga, you're just exercising\". \"Poses\" are ego-driven. But, unfortunately, just a few people live within yoga's philosophy. So, many are called, but just a few are chosen. ;)\n\nI mean, I am happy you can go about it on the spiritual level. I went on my first yoga class cause MY BACK FRICKIN HURTS.  I am having a very hard time with the spirituality of everything, not just yoga. That's why I will never teach other people yoga. I have so much respect for my yoga teacher cause she's really, really devoted, but I can't be, mostly because I am not lucky enough to have time to consume all the media and learn about it. Yoga is the only thing that helps me with my spine now that I can't afford physiotheraphy. Being proud with \"gymnastics\" I can make came second. It was just about relieving the pain. Guess you've never suffered from chronic pain, or you wouldn't say that. It's really not as simple as you think it is. \"westernization\" made this classes so popular that I can afford them cheaply. Normal gymnastics, for example, is still rare where I live.\n\nThe lineage I teach incorporates breath work, reflection, meditation and karmic yoga in every class, and you need to have your own practice to teach. Many people don’t like what I offer, cause in their words it’s “too easy”. But what I hear from my students is “I can go so deep inside myself”, “I feel like I belong and can listen to my body”. And I have many students that have cultivated a HOME practice!\n\nIt can be a chicken-and-egg problem.  As a  teacher I have definitely heard \"I just want to work out, I don't care about the spiritual stuff\", so I have to weave \"the spiritual stuff\" in the most subtle ways in order to not alienate those people. I've even come across someone who isn't comfortable with a lot of \"opening\" language as they believe it will allow Satan in.\n\n\nIn addition to that, like it or not, social media is pretty much a requirement to teachers trying to market themselves, and a handstand photographs a lot better than a meditative state: knowing I am being photographed takes me out of meditation, and taking photos of others meditating (or asleep in Nidra 😁) feels like a violation of consent.\n\n\nWith that said, I often incorporate a tiny bit of pranayama as an appetizer or palate cleanser, or a mini Yoga Nidra \"dessert\" at the end. I would recommend the book Threads of Yoga by Pamela Seeling. It was suggested to me by a much more experienced teacher, and I love it for anyone looking to deepen their own practice or enrich their classes.\n\nFantastic post. Don’t feel bad. It’s a real issue\n\nI think this means you may be *actually* interested in yoga and not just as a gimmick for cardio\n\ni am in my 60s and have been doing yoga for over 30 years. i have never taken a class but own probably 20 books. i don’t enjoy it as much as running or lifting weights. but i recognize how important it is for my health especially at my age.\n\n&gt; devoid of philosophy and the limbs of yoga\n\nKinda like your topic?\n\nHow so? Genuine question.\n\nNothing about this post or attitude is welcoming or community minded. \"If you aren't focused on the areas of yoga I focus on you're doing it wrong and should just do something else\".\n\nSame feeling has led me away from yoga and into martial arts. But I’m so grateful to yoga for giving me the strength, balance and flexibility to take up taekwondo in my early 40s\n\nIsn't yoga asanas Scandinavian gymnastics to begin with?\n\nAs a former gymnast, I would probably never have given yoga a second look if there hadn’t been any similarities. I struggle to find balance or relaxation without movement.  \n\nThe studio I go to offers a range of classes and I tend to go to the ones that suit me. Surely there are enough classes and enough teachers that you can find what you’re looking for.\n\nI mean are you really surprised with where society has/is going with the advent of social media?\n\nI completely understand your frustration. It's true that modern yoga, especially in the West, has become heavily focused on the physical aspect, with asana taking center stage. The deeper philosophy and spiritual elements, like the other limbs of yoga, often seem neglected in favor of more performative or aesthetic goals. \n\n\n\nHowever, I believe there's still space for the more traditional, holistic aspects of yoga. It can just be harder to find or requires more intention to practice. Perhaps the commercialization of yoga has contributed to this shift, but those of us who value the full spectrum of yoga—mind, body, and spirit—can help by staying connected to its roots and sharing that approach with others.\n\n\n\nUltimately, yoga is deeply personal. Even though the external culture might seem to prioritize physicality, we can each maintain a personal practice that aligns with the true essence of yoga, and seek out communities and teachers that honor that as well.\n\nI could write a 10 page essay on the harness this does. Specifically to the disabled and differently abled populations.\n\nIt is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something wrong with us.\n\nThis is what happens when you let book-yogis and youtube-yogis become your teachers.\n\nI suspect the opposite, but have no proof. Other than that I've only ever met people trained from YTTs teaching in studios, and I've never taken a class from just a book/YouTube teacher. Which could totally be a bias, but I would assume books mean self interest in other elements. Youtube...not so much.\n\nTry kundalini yoga\n\nCapitalism.\n\nI feel you. I haven't practiced much since COVID killed the habit and I tried out a local place recently. Apparently their \"thing\" is fast paced workout. We finished with ACDC core burnouts (boat pose, planks, etc), it was ridiculous. The instructors complimented me on my \"practice\" but my guys,, I could not have been more mentally checked at all. I'm just strong and relatively flexible for a man. That's it. I come to yoga to get my breathing right and train my focus. If you want your booty blasted, pick up a barbell.\n\nIt all changed when Yoga (union of mind body soul) became fitness instead of the healing modality it was destined to be.....\n\nHey, I would like to recommend a book- Do Your Om Thing by Rebecca Pacheco\n\nIt's a great read and talks more about the philosophies and how to add them to your life. It's very approachable and I think it might be helpful for you.\n\nI think it’s because the of yoga studios who charge 100$ or more per month that only teach aasanas\n\nSeek out reddits that focus on the philosophy. TantraSadhaks is a good one I know off the top of my head :) \n\nEverything can be a yoga practice: washing dishes, driving a car, communication... it's the attitude and intention. Remember, most of what we call yoga asana are derivatives of military Scandinavian military exercises from the 1800's. Yoga, all aspects,  will morph, evolve, and spread in many directions."

    "all_comment_text": "My brother, I made yoga my addiction a year and a half ago and couldn’t be happier. I’m of the opinion of you have addictive patterns, weaponize the addiction to postive things like yoga, meditating, eating healthy. \n\n\nIve got a couple good ones. Working on the rest. \n\nNamaste\n\nCouldnt speak more on weaponizing the addiction towards positive things - this helped me so much\n\nagree.  I am now addicted to spring water too.\n\nPublic Service Announcement: PLEASE make sure you're brushing with fluoride toothpaste thoroughly. When I was a kid, my parents got addicted to fresh water from a natural spring in the woods. They would save 7 or 8 (clean) plastic milk gallon jugs and fill them for our drinking water. \n\nI was a half-assed brusher as a kid, I admit, but I never got *so many* cavities until that year. After we went back to fluoridated tap water, the cavities stopped.\n\nCongrats on your clean living!\n\nThank you.\n\nI would be dead without yoga. I practice 3-4 times/week. It is the only way that I've been able to process my emotions outside of therapy.\n\n\n1500 days today. Thanks for sharing 💜\n\nYoga has helped me a lot in my recovery too. Good work brother.\n\nI don't remember my first day doing yoga. And I don't specifically remember my first day in the studio, but I'm damn sure glad I started truly showing up for myself and nobody else, and it probably would have taken me a lot longer to figure out had I not gotten on my mat.\n\nGlad to be on this ride with you all.\n\nI too trade one addiction for a much healthier one. Good for you!\n\nCongrats on your sobriety! I also found solace in yoga in recovery in 2021. I recommend yoga to anyone trying to find a path to sobriety…there’s something that just fits there. And plot twist (for myself…I never saw it coming) I’m a yoga teacher now.\n\nLol same!! Same timeline! I graduated YTT in 2021 and became sober early 2022. How's your teaching going? 🥰\n\nIt’s going great. I teach several classes a week and I’m loving it!\n\nGreat post. I have done yoga on and off for 15 years. Most of that time as a typical drinker. I remember feeling healthy and proud bc I went to yoga on a Friday night but then drinking beers after. Now sober for two years, doing yoga is completely different. When you are not derailing your progress and stunting your growth you can really grow stronger mentally.  And I never had the discipline to have a home practice until I quit drinking. When you replace inorganic dopamine (alcohol) with organic (exercise) your inner and outer worlds become 10x more beautiful. Congrats!\n\nI did yoga and drank for about four months before I quit. I remember thinking that drinking was getting in the way of my yoga.  yoga kind of saved my life.\n\nI found evening classes for after work, so I wouldn’t just go home and have a drink. It helped to taper it off to nothing. Nights where there was no yoga? I found a tai chi class, and a singing bowl meditation class. If I could fill the first couple of hours after work I was home free!\n\nI also choose hot yoga over drinking these days. Glad to hear.\n\nHot yoga is so much better.\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety\n\nWay to go!\n\nNamaste!\n\nCongratulations! I've been in recovery since 9/17/20, although I was doing much better overall I would occasionally relapse every handful of months. Fast forward to this year I started yoga and within a week I knew that I would never relapse again, now 6 months later &amp; the positive changes coming to my life are mind blowing. Yoga has opened my eyes in many ways I never imagined possible I'm so excited for the future, I have completed one YTT and enrolled in another because I feel a deep desire to help others in the recovery community with yoga\n\nthat's great. good for you.\n\nWell done!!  A much healthier addiction!\n\nWe should be thankful to the guy that invented yoga, but who is?\n\nPatanjali. An ancient sage who was descended from a cobra. 🐍 \n\nBut seriously, he is the one who wrote down the yoga sutras that had been passed orally prior to his scribing.\n\nPatanjali’s sutras have to do w/ meditative yoga and not modern postural yoga.  The literal translation of asana is “steady comfortable seat.”  The asanas the Patanjali referred to (in an obscure fashion) were secondary to meditation practice and have nothing to do w/ postural yoga. \n\nPlease, fellow yogis, I implore you, read Shearer’s The Story of Yoga - it will really open your eyes.\n\nIt developed far more recently than we are lead to believe.  Google “krishnamacharya” and also read The Story of Yoga by Alistair Shearer.  This helped me understand how Western postural yoga developed and why it is often conflated with meditative yoga, which is ancient.\n\nCongrats.  I have 12 years in recovery and, coincidentally, 12 years doing yoga.  Thank you for your post\n\ngood for you. I'm catching up to you ;-)\n\nWell, let’s hope not but good stuff :)\n\nThis stranger is proud of you ❤️ I too am in recovery…200 plus days now. I’ve been practicing for 15 plus years now. I’m back to teaching yoga and it’s been the most integral part of my recovery. Keep it up! I\n\nthanks.  and good for you.  I find yoga has given me a new identity. I'm not a drinker. I'm a yogi now!\n\nI replaced drinking with yoga almost 5 years ago too!! My life has done a 180 as I’m sure yours has too! Yay us!!!\n\ntwins!  yes. it's a night and day change.\n\nGood for you. Yoga helped me get (and stay) clean, 12 years now. 🙏\n\nthat's awesome. yoga is very under-rated IMHO.\n\nSuperb!!!👏👏\n\nLove to hear it congrats on finding a healthier motive! ☺️\n\nYoga found you.  Makes me happy\n\nthat's what it felt like. yoga picked me.\n\nNamaste my friend\n\nYoga is a great addiction to have.\n\nCongrats and thank you for the message!\n\nI began my practice through Recovery 2.0 and the work of Tommy Rosen. Absolutely essential to my recovery and the re-connection with a true higher power. \n\nAll the best to you!\n\nthank you. and well done you.\n\nI’d much rather be addicted to yoga than booze! 11 years sober. Congrats on 5!\n\nYoga saved my life after my liver transplant (due to drinking.) I teach now, and I'm so grateful to be able to pass this on to others who are struggling.\nOnly downside is I think it will fix everything for everyone. (because it will! 😘)\nCongratulations!\n\nWow. Congratulations. Yoga is magic IMHO.\n\nI’m so happy to hear this. Stay strong, friend.\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety! Love this!\n\nProud of you\n\nI don't think going to a yoga studio everyday is extreme 😁 \n\nIn fact, I think it's incredibly healthy - daily movement, daily mental healing, and daily sessions of deep breathing - basically, a daily practice! - are so helpful.\n\nNon yoga people think it's a bit extreme.  I find it harder NOT to go to yoga everyday now.\n\nOut of curiosity, how has your body changed since you started doing yoga everyday? Did it drastically change your body composition?\n\nmy body has changed 100%.  I now look like a yoga guy.  even have abs. at my age! ;-)\n\nThis is inspirational. Thank you for sharing! \n\nyou're too kind. thank you\n\nDiscussions like this give me hope for humanity!  So much positive energy and mutual support here.\n\nI have a theory that yoga people are just more positive than average.  the mental benefits are many.\n\nWell done, bro.  71m here so- think of me as your future talking to you.  I practice yoga 4-5 times a week, along with archery, walking, knife throwing, slingshots, and shepherd’s slings.  When you don’t throw your money and time away on alcohol, you have money, motivation, energy and time for healthier pursuits.  One day at a time.\n\nDaily studio time is not extreme - there are lots of activities that we do daily, eating, sleeping, attending to bodily needs, etc. You found a way to add yoga.\n\nhey future me! what you say is true. Also, an hour  of yoga is less than 5% of my day, as a teacher once said to me.\n\nWell stated, past me.  While I will be long departed from this plane when you reach my age, perhaps you will reflect back on our chance meeting and strike a fierce Warrior II or maybe a reverse archer in my memory.\n\nKeep moving!\n\nThat’s amazing 🙌🏽 congratulations ✨\n\nCongratulations! Happy \"birthday\"! 🥳 \nCelebrate yourself today and every day!\n\nCongratulations 🎉🧘🏾‍♀️\n\ncongrats OP, that's amazing!! wishing you all the best for the next 5 (and then another 5, and another 5...etc etc)\n\nAwesome 😎\n\nLove it! I also love what yoga has done for me. I've also learned some other traditional poses and forms from Inner Matrix Systems that make such a big difference. Breath and movement are everything\n\nHey! That’s great!!\nBeen practicing daily for over 20 years. Everything in my life is better because I practice asanas.\n\nThat’s amazing! Great to hear.\n\ni'd be on like my 7th year if lockdown hadn't upended so many lives including my own.\n\nYoga saves lives. Congrats on your milestones.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nBy the grace of God , alcohol is not a problem for me, but I definitely can relate to compulsive behavior. This thread has really inspired me to less dabbling, more doing. Thanks.\n\nI definitely have a tendency to numb feelings. Alcohol did that. Yoga gives me strength to feel things. If that makes sense.\n\nFinding a studio you love is key.  At my home studio each teacher runs their individual program.  The variety is awesome!!!\n\nI got lucky. The first studio I attended had just opened and had no students. So I got Lots of one on one instruction in the basics and correct form.\n\nEver hear of Y12SR, yoga 12 step recovery created by Nikki Meyers and designed to work in addition to your 12 step program. Check it out\n\nhttps://www.y12sr.com/\n\nWow. \"The issues live on in our tissues\". love it.  This is basically what accidentally happened to me. It's a great idea (in retrospect). Yoga kind of saved my life.  Thanks for that.\n\n🙌🎉🎊"

    "all_comment_text": "I think it’s a few things. She has a deep array of content that is beginner friendly. She has very approachable Yoga flows that will allow for you to get comfortable with the poses and flows before getting too physically challenging. She is a good instructor, you can follow her cues easy without paying too much attention to the videos. Her personality is genuine and welcoming with a contagious positive energy. Lastly, she has many variations of intro to yoga and 30 day series designed to get you used to daily practice.\n\nEdit* used the right word for cue\n\nShe also has a very cool dog who features prominently.\n\nCame for Adriene, stayed for Benji. 🐕\n\n[meirl](https://reductress.com/post/woman-wastes-shavasana-thinking-about-adrienes-dog-dying-someday/)\n\nYep. I started one of her January things with encouragement from DIL, and as soon as I saw Benji, I was hooked.\n\nThis x100 - She's also very thoughtful and slow for beginners, down to earth (but also Benji!!!!)\n\nI love Benji. I always think of this [picture I took](https://i.imgur.com/YVpx1dX.jpeg) of him when I paused my TV. Had me cracking up for way longer than normal\n\nSir, this is a human\n\nOmg I love this picture\n\n🤣🤣\n\nI cannot let sweet Benji down.\n\nEven if I didn’t do yoga I’d still watch Adrienne’s videos so she’d have extra money to buy Benji treats\n\nI'm an OG YWA fan, so I was around when she had her previous dog Blue. Benji was made for this role! He has been on camera since he was just a wee pup. I would love to know if she has any kind of pre-shoot exercise routine with him or if they ever have to edit out any barking. He is a pretty high energy breed but also insanely smart.\n\nThis sold me immediately and I’m now looking up her content 😂🫣\n\nShe also is really mindful of the breath and gives so many vocal cues on when to inhale, exhale, etc. I find that’s missing from many other beginner-friendly yogis on YouTube (or maybe I just haven’t checked out the right ones). I really love her for the breath cues\n\nThis was certainly an important point for me when I started. I needed those cues and she was one of the only YouTube instructors who was super consistent about it.\n\n&gt; She also is really mindful of the breath and gives so many vocal cues on when to inhale, exhale, etc.\n\nEvery teacher should be doing this, or at least those teaching beginner classes. It amazes me so many don't.\n\nPersonality is the main one for me. Lots of yoga vids are someone doing the poses while some disembodied ‘ethereal’ voice calmly (monotone) describes the poses. She is endearingly corny and fun while explaining what you need to know in plain language.\n\nThis ^ i went from completely sedentary to  doing her yoga videos everyday 4 yrs ago and still do them as my active rest days now and what ive learned in her class helps me when i do pilates which i started last month to ramp up my workouts\n\nSame. I just started pilates this week, and there’s so much I’ve brought from following Adriene’s practice, especially in my form and transitioning between positions. Her videos gave me such a great base of knowledge and conditioned my muscles that I think will help me move safely as I’m starting more vigorous workouts.\n\nAlso, secular so appropriate for anyone\n\nsorry to be that guy, but I think you mean you can follow her \"cues\" not \"queues\" (prompts not waiting lines)\n\nHa! Well you are certainly correct! Thanks\n\nScrabble subreddit anyone?\n\nAnd it’s FREE\n\nShe's truly one of the best instructors in the business. She's creative, explains poses &amp; cues, breath work is important\n\nTo add to this, she doesn’t make it all ‘spiritual’. I dislike going into a studio just for that reason.\n\nShe's been posting online for years so she has a HUGE array of content and practices. Personally I like her as a beginner because she shows variations of poses if you need more practice of a particular one. Also I find the 30 day challenges very fun and engaging because it's a different practice every day and if you stick to it ... 18 days now I have improved massively: my strength, balance and mind. At first I quit on day seven and spent about 2 weeks practicing poses, downward dog especially because I found it very hard. After that I started back at day one and have stuck to it this time. It's worth noting I have always been a bit frail and weak so I had to build up slowly before I started the challenge. She got me into yoga so I'm biased I suppose.\n\nThe variations on poses is a huge help! My mom wanted to start doing yoga with her mother to help keep her active, and I felt totally comfortable sending over YWA. Of course there were still things she had to skip, but a lot of floor movements had something she could do!\n\nExtremely kind energy, endless content for every “issue” or desire, free, gentle, Benji.\n\nMan I did her flow for anger like 30 times when everything sucked at the beginning of covid. She really does have a video for every day.\n\nI loved that she didn’t address COVID when it first started. Major respect for her keeping the safe space safe when it was all anybody could talk about.\n\nWow I didn’t even realize that, and you are so right. She really saved a space of normalcy for us. Man that’s making me emotional for some reason lol.\n\nShe has one for stress that I say she beats the stress out of ya lol\n\nI followed a stress &amp; anxiety one and was WIPED OUT by the end lmao. Like I couldn't possibly feel wired and anxious anymore when I was down for the count in savasana for like 10 minutes after it ended\n\nIf I’m having stomach issues (regular) I hop on YT and find a ‘yoga for gut health’ or ‘detox yoga’ or w/e video. Same with back issues, knee problems, post-run stretches… she has everything.\n\nAnd she doesn't go through the flow at light speed like some other yoga channels\n\nHuge array of videos, from 10 min to longer sessions - I think she’s just been at her game the longest. Like at one point Michelle Pham was one of the only beauty youtubers but now there’s tons. She also has a nice calming voice and there are no ad interruptions which is a monetary sacrifice not every channel is willing to make.\n\nCame here to say this. I read an article once that said she’s likely turned down millions in revenue because she won’t allow for ad breaks in the middle of her videos. The viewer experience comes first (plus I’m sure she’s doing okay for herself regardless!)\n\nBecause Benji.\n\nPerfect answer\n\nI like Adriene, but I prefer Kassandra if you wanted some alternative recommendation.\n\nNo shade to either of them to be clear, just personal preference.\n\nBig fan of Kassandra here!\n\nAgree, yoga with Adriene talked waaaaaay too much for me\n\nI used to think she talked too much too, but then I sort of started loving her and now I really appreciate her talking. But I do know what you mean.\n\nOh, jeez, I do enjoy Adriene's energy during a flow... but after several different videos when she talked and talked the whole way through savasana about non-savasana energy things, I gave up. Savanna time is too valuable.\n\nHere's another vote for Kassandra — but also for Yoginimelbourne. I so appreciate Paula's gentleness and excellent cuing (and years of videos for all different needs).\n\nI've actually never seen an Adriene video. I found Kassandra on my first time doing a YouTube yoga video and have never left. The way she talks is very calming to me.\n\nSame for me. But she appeals to many. Glad folks are giving yoga a try.\n\nTotally! I am picky about both yoga and pilates styles, and the beauty of the internet is we can all have our preferences :)\n\nSame. I’ve migrated to Kassandra recently. \n\nI sure miss Benji though.\n\nKassandra has cute kitties in her vids sometimes\n\nKassandra’s cats (and occasional foster kittens) are very cute though!\n\nBig fan myself. I was a Yoga with Tim fan, but am now following Kassandra because she has good long yin sessions which I really really like\n\nYeah her Yin practices are truly lovely! Even for someone as inflexible as me 🤣\n\nAlso big fan of Kassandra! (As well.)\n\nA lot of people have lovely answers, but I’ll had; her messaging has a really strong psychological punch. I’ve learned immensely from her in terms of my yoga practice; but I’ve learned even more in regard to: my relationship with my thoughts and feelings, self acceptance, sitting with uncomfortable feelings and sensations, awareness of present moment and actually being present through my day.\n\nShe is truly a gem and I often joke she has been my best therapist of the past decade. Sometimes she can be a bit chatty, but I think that’s partially her way of getting us to hold challenging poses longer - although the combo of her talking and you trying to be strong in a pose can be frustrating 😅\n\nI think she generally makes yoga very approachable and unintimidating. She’s very casual and relaxed in her approach. \n\nI’m personally not a fan, I just don’t like her style. Yoga with Kassandra is my daily go to, and I prefer her delivery and explanation style better. She has a lot of beginner videos, as well as more intermediate and advanced. She also does many different styles of yoga and explains the difference between the styles. I think it’s a more well rounded practice than Adrienne, but that’s just personal preference. \n\nKassandra’s yin yoga videos are my absolute fav\n\nYes! I love them ❤️\n\nI also prefer Yoga with Kassandra. I think her cues are more clearly explained and she has a little more of the soothing yoga-teacher voice, Adriene is more conversational\n\nI feel Kassandra is for intermediate level and Adriane is for beginner level.\n\nKassandra has a wide range of good intermediate and advanced classes, but her beginner classes are good too. Adriene sometimes goes off on tangents, which is distracting, and I think more often she just cues poses by name, while Kassandra more often explains how to move into and out of the pose, which is better for beginners\n\nI always found with Adrienne that she was so chatty that inevitably I would be stuck in a right side pose for longer than the left side pose or vise versa.\n\nThis is my issue with YWA! I love her but the rambling on and on got draining especially what feels like 5 mins one side and then oh quick do the other side.\n\nYES. Soooooo many times and I'd be yelling at my laptop to even it out or save the chatting for after class 😁\n\nCame here for this! Love Kassandra.  Her voice and pace are so good for me.  I'm sure I've done hundreds, and I love that she has meditations as well, though I personally prefer unguided meditation.\n\nHave tried a few of Adrienne's videos and can never make it to the end.  And her voice bothers me for some reason.  But she seems like a great person, and I'm glad she resonates with so many people!\n\nAgree with everything. I’m just not into the “hey party people” vibe with Adrienne tho I do understand why people would like her. \n\nKassandra is my jam 100%! I love her slow flows.\n\nI love Kassandra! I love her explanations. I also really like her books. They’re great.\n\nI enjoy the flow of Yoga with Kassandra but I remember I did a video a while ago where she had an affirmation along the lines of manifesting money and it didn’t sit right with me. Personally, I like to manifest values on the mat and I didn’t like bringing money into it because this unconsciously brought stress onto the mat for me. \nBut great flows! \nI’m bias towards YWA though because she has helped me a lot in times of need :)\n\nYeah, this is a big reason why I like Adriene because she's very non-dogmatic (other than Benji, lol) and she doesn't say cringe new-agey/pseudosciencey stuff like this.\n\nI used to be somewhat caught up in what I've come to see as the \"culty\" aspects of the North American yoga scene and so if an instructor says stuff that evokes that mentality, it's a huge turn-off at best and an actual trigger at worst. Adriene's approach feels very safe to me.\n\nYes this why I prefer Adriene over a lot of other YouTube yoga people. I get that she’s a bit chatty from time to time but overall she keeps it very normal\n\nKassandra did address the ‘manifesting money’ controversy on her recent 10th anniversary stream/video. She owns the mistake and has learned from it.\n\nYeah, I completely understand that. I don't like the manifestation talk and I'm not into like the more mystical aspects that some people bring into yoga/feel is an integral part of yoga. For me personally, yoga is a mind body practice. It gives me time to be peaceful and thoughtful while also releasing stress and building strength. It's not spiritual for me in any way.\n\nI just kind of choose to ignore those flows where she's doing the manifestation stuff, but I understand why it would bother you.\n\nShe recently did a reflection on her 10 years of yoga on YouTube and actually said this was her biggest regret! The money affirmation which was shared during the COVID lockdowns specifically. The series was filmed before that of course\n\n+1 for [Yoga with Kassandra](https://youtube.com/@yogawithkassandra)!!\n\nWe need to settle this with a yoga battle: Adrien vs. Kassandra. Like a rap battle, but they say punch for punch positive quotes and ideas at each other, while doing asanas. Room full of people goes “ohhhhhh!”\n\nCame here to say exactly this, I prefer Kassandra’s vinyasa, power yoga, and yin flows much more than Adrienne. Adrienne’s vibe is great, but Kassandra has amazing sequencing. Very beginner and intermediate friendly. \n\nDef check out both, they are both awesome free resources and good yoga\n\n[removed]\n\nThe variety in length of video is so good. I have chronic pain, and some days I can’t manage much more than 5-10 minutes of practice, and she has videos for that!\n\nIf you have not tried her yoga, try it and decide for yourself. If you have tried it and either like it or not, why do you care what others think? A lot of people recommend YWA because her style fits for them and they enjoy it. She has a large following, so you will see a lot of people recommending her. It's really that simple.\n\nThis. She isn’t for me but lots of people love her. I do love Benji.\n\nHer style of teaching and beginner friendly content. It really depends on what style works for you.\n\nI also really like CharlieFollows but her flow feels more advanced so it's a work in progress.\n\nTry them all out and find which suits you best.\n\nPicking a yoga teacher is like choosing any type of teacher: you want one that you like spending time with, you like their teaching style, you like their voice/vibe etc.\n\nYoga With Adriene: I'm a fan. Seems basic, in a good way. She's nice, has a chill vibe, takes the practice seriously, but not too seriously.\n\nSo yeah, it's not anything groundbreaking, just a solid yoga channel that's easy to recommend to friends. Definitely you can browse around and find a teacher that's right for you.\n\nI like her disposition and she's easy to follow along.  Huge variety of content to choose from.\n\nI have been practicing at home with YWA since 2013ish and always come back to her. I've never been an in-class yogi I just get too caught up with what others are doing and how my poses \"look\" whereas with Adriene, her guiding phrase is always \"Find What Feels Good.\" I actually think she's gotten a little more serious and spiritual as her presence and channel has gotten bigger, but I have always been drawn to her approachable, no-judgment, kind of goofy way of explaining things and just making sure you are not doing poses just to do poses but instead focusing on finding what feels good for YOUR BODY. She has such a huge catalog of videos now that you can find everything from very basic beginner flows to 40-minute, sweat-inducing workouts. Completing one of her 30 day challenges always makes me feel like a million bucks and you really notice your personal improvement over time. Her dog Benji is almost always around and a welcome plus!\n\nShe’s definitely gotten more serious and spiritual, but more in a “she has grown up” way than a “yoga is serious, not fun” way. She’s still got a sense of humor and is very humble, and even when she brings in the spiritual stuff, it doesn’t feel like she’s trying to make you believe it, more just like she’s musing about it. It’s honestly pretty nice\n\n100% agree! Just meant that she definitely makes fewer sexual innuendo jokes than when she was just starting out lol...but you're spot on how her musings and wisdom don't feel preachy. In my opinion, she very much embodies the \"take this if it works for you, leave it if it doesn't\" mentality of teaching which I appreciate.\n\nI like Adrienne because she doesn’t put pressure on you or shame you if you can’t do a move, and gives good modifications!\n\n1. free\n\n2. organized\n\n3. nonsecular exercise based\n\n4. bite sized... 15 min sessions to one hour. \n\n5. talks about mods right from the get go\n\n6. she goofy\n\n7. dog\n\nShe has a great sense of humor when i first started 4 years ago id be struggling in downward dog (it can be a difficult pose for a beginner 😅) and shed say something funny and id laugh and it would get me through the difficult pose and if she makes a mistake she corrects herself and she says \"im human youre human no yoga robots here\" or something like that \nPoint is she doesnt take herself too seriously\n\nI see why other people would find her chattiness annoying, but I love it. That chattiness can distract me from the frustration of struggling in a pose that would otherwise lead me to stop. I love how open she is and acknowledging her mistakes, and I love how she will make comments about poses, both offering variations and talking about how it ties into the other parts of yoga outside of just asanas.\n\nWhat everyone else is saying, plus I just found her to be so KIND and understanding. A lot of youtube yoga \"gurus\" are more fitness based; that or they say they are beginner friendly, but aren't really. \n\nI find her to be very supportive in the way she instructs, and she offers a lot of variation in poses for whatever phase you're currently at. The way she speaks is very comforting, which is encouraging when you're first getting into something.\n\nPlus, Benji\n\nThat's true, a lot of people love her, she was even popular when I was still more of a beginner several years ago and it her popularity only grew. She has a friendly tone and lots of beginner-friendly videos. Personally her classes were not for me but go ahead and try it. Remember not to limit yourself though, try different approaches and enjoy.\n\nAdrienne has been practicing for years and it means her online catalog is EXTENSIVE. There's a video for anyone, with any amount of time, at any experience level, for whatever body or mind element/muscle group/focus point they'd like to work on. Her approach is very friendly and she's strong as hell.\n\nAlso, I love her interactions with her dog, Benji. His presence really makes her practice feel like it's at home. I practiced with her (doing the 30 the day challenges) for two years before I ever ventured out to an in-person class\n\nBrett Goldstein (Roy Kent on Ted Lasso) mentioned Yoga with Adriene in his standup show. I’ve been meaning to check it out too. This post just reminded me that I need to do that.\n\nI appreciate that she takes the time to explain things like alignment and breathing vs rushing through a flow. It makes me feel like I’m getting the fullest benefits in the body and mind even out of a very basic practice. \n\nI also like that she references the other limbs of yoga. She’ll take a moment in an asana to give a little theory lesson. It’s not incredibly prominent or the main focus of the channel, but it’s clear she is very knowledgeable. Some people hate this chattiness, others like it. \n\nI’ll say that a lot of folks will talk about her in a way that feels rather dismissive “oh she’s good for beginners”, “I mostly like it for my rest days; I’m at a more advanced stage on the day to day”, but there’s a lot to dive into if you really focus on proper form and philosophy with her vids.\n\nIm a man and started with DDP YOGA.\nHurt myself after a while. \nShe calms you down… explains better and gets you more relaxed. She’s good. \n\nAfter her I graduated to yoga by Tim who explains how to get into position better than anyone. \n\nGood to switch instructors occasionally but Adriane is great and I would recommend.\n\nCannot overstate how excellent her dog Benji is\n\nBecause some of the things she says are so funny and real- you feel like you’re friends and shes just teaching a class in your home! YWA really saved me during covid. I will always be so thankful for her spirit.\n\nWhat got me into her was her 30-day programmes. I am easily bored by doing the same practice everyday, yet want some continuity - that’s exactly what those programmes provide. She also seems very nice to me, and I like her voice, although her talking to her dog can sometimes be a bit distracting.\n\nI recommend her channel to everyone of all ages. My mom started doing her 10 minute slow flow videos just to move her body. Also, I think she’s great for those who need to modify a lot of poses, my mom specifically is on dialysis which has weakened her a lot physically so she can’t do certain poses so Adrienne has helped modify them for her so she can slowly build her strength back up.\n\nI really like Devi Daly myself but never checked out YWA. I think I will today lol\n\nI'd also like to add that she was the very first prominent yoga creator. There's now thousands who have copied her. She's the og.\n\nBenji and her random sexual entendres.\n\n\"If you don't have a yoga block; you can use a blanket, a couple towels, or a firm couch pillow. Hey Ohhh!\"\n\nShe's kind of a weirdo who knows her stuff and has a kind and gentle energy. I'm there for it.\n\nWhy don’t you check it out and make the decision for yourself?  People recommend her because she has a great channel. Sometimes there’s no underlying negative reason.\n\nI like her variety of content and sometimes goofiness. I can find something for whatever my issue is (back pain, neck pain, hip pain, anxiety) or the time I have available. My daughter loves her goofy content like yoga for interspace travel and plankinspine. I do yoga at classes when I can but it’s far away and at home my daughter frequently does yoga with me.\n\nThose goofy practices are the greatest thing sometimes\n\nShe has a wide variety of content and, in my opinion, is a great online teacher.\n\nI love yoga with adriene! I love her personality, how she guides through the poses, its been so helpful for my mental health\n\nCole chance all the wayyyyyy\n\nAdriene has done a really wonderful job of breaking down yoga for all skill levels and really providing a space for building on those foundations. If you are new to yoga, or even more advanced and looking for something specific to work towards in your practice, I believe she is a wonderful place to start looking. \n\nThat being said, as I began looking for more variations, additional flow, less talking, I found that the Down Dog app suited me much more in terms of personalization and adjusting to my bodies needs day-to-day than any of the YouTube instructors. It really just depends on what you’re looking for. Adriene has a huge collection of diverse videos, challenges, and is an amazing resource to the yoga community. She is one of the first resources I go back to when looking for something specific. However, her style of teaching simply doesn’t maintain my interest long-term. Definitely recommend giving it a shot and deciding for yourself.\n\nShe just has a lot of content. I haven't watched her in a while but that's where I got started back when I was injured in 2017. Now, I'm training to be an instructor. I think she is very beginner-friendly. Helped me heal my sciatic pain. Her personality is very calming. I loved following her flows.\n\nYWA got me into yoga for good! She's so incredibly judgement free, and gave me a sense of peace and company while I challenged myself to move in ways I never had. She also has the perfect balance of meditation and self love practice plus engaging yoga. I recommend her 2022 \"Move\" series, it was amazing!\n\nI watched her videos for a long time but I found she talks too much, so moved onto different channels.\n\nI’ve been using ywa 4 x a week since 2017 :) for me she explains how to get into the pose better than any teacher in any class I’ve ever taken. She is able to do a power yoga video without making it feel like Pilates or something different because she’s still so conscious of the breath and flow. \n\nShe also has short videos that are full body and really strengthening, that are simple enough to do anywhere. I’ve gotten so much stronger thanks to Adriene :,) &lt;3. \n\nShe’s not all or nothing, she promotes rest and daily practice and says a little goes a long way! I used to be very weak, but now thanks to Adriene I can hold a plank for 1 min 30 secs and do a wall sit for 3 mins 30 secs! That was a huge deal for me. I’m very petite and small and for the first time in my life I feel strong and it’s helped my self confidence so much. I’m in my body and I love my body now for what it can do for me.\n\nShe’s a terrific and real teacher. Not too much woo, no overt sexiness, a feeling that this truly is for everyone. She saved my life during the pandemic.\n\nHer content is all about her mission of keeping yoga free and accessible to everyone so that the most amount of people possible will practice yoga consistently. She tailors her videos for watchability and makes them easy to maintain a practice over a long period. She is kind and humble, and just a darn good energy with Benji.\n\nShe's humble and positive and explains things really well. Phrases like \"Come to your breath, eyes soft, ground your feet, open the heart\" etc aren't automatically understood by everyone.\n\nAdriene has the perfect balance of everything\n\nAlso she has both the beginner version and more intense version of the same exercise, and some gradients as well\n\nAlso her attitude is so heart warming and welcoming\n\nShe got me with her self-depreciating humour, the 30 days series’s and that she had videos that were for any situation not just the same yoga flow aerobics that everyone else does. I actually learned stuff and stuck with it because *she* kept me coming back\n\nIn my case she made me feel kind of bored\n\nI tried her videos, and I genuinely don't get the hype. She talks too much, about anything besides the yoga she's doing. I stopped before I pulled a muscle, from whipping my head back and forth to try to keep up.\n\nShe talked to much for me too.\n\nHer teachings go far beyond just physical asana. IMO she is a Bodhisattva.\n\nYes I love her energy, you can tell she has a deep spiritual practice.\n\nShe's a good starting point\n\nIt's what got my wife and I into Yoga. I'm your stereotypical male, 6'3 ex football player, who thought yoga was for \"girls\" \n\nGod I wish I could go back in time and punch myself in the face bc I regret not starting yoga when I was younger. \n\nShe's just super chill, easy to listen to, and doesn't force you into any philosophies, etc. \n\nShe also just has a ton of content and we love her new journeys each Jan. \n\nAnd of course... My boy Benjie (no idea how to spell it sorry!)\n\nI like yoga with Cassandra also\n\nIf you’re looking for a different recommendation, I love Jen Hilman\n\nFollow the teacher with whom you feel a connection . Try some of her classes . See for yourself .\n\nI enjoy her wide array of content. It's honestly easier to pull up her channel to find something than try something new. Prior to having internet, I was using the Gaiam DVDs. Sometimes I enjoy repetition.\n\nShe makes videos that are not super intimidating for a newbie or for someone who’s not super into moving their body but wants to. Anyone can follow her videos and she has many variations that are beginners friendly, but she also focuses a lot on meditation, mantras, and all the inner work of yoga since too many people still believe that yoga is a workout and not a spiritual practice and philosophy.\n\nBenji is the answer.\n\nIn one of her travel/early morning routines, she spends like 5 minutes at the end being excited about an Otter that shows up in the background.\n\nBesides all her breathing cues, as others have mentioned, her genuine enouragement feels genuine, but she also does the cute little cuts and look, her absolute *Joy* when she's excited about the otter is deeply infectious.\n\nher yoga for depression actually helped my depression! i was surprised. she has something for everything. i love her period cramps one. i didn’t even realize i could expand my lower back and how much pressure is on that area during that time. now i do it all the time.\n\nShe is sunshine in human form ☀️\n\nI starter YWA in 2012, knowing nothing about yoga. Her introductory videos are amazing simple explanations for basic poses and even breathing. I learned to breathe with her. Her videos helped me literally  through grief with acceptance and patience.\n\nWhen I first started years ago, Adrienne and Yoga With Kassandra were god sends. They are both incredible at explaining how to move and position yourself without the need to look at the screen and they’ll tell you what to look out for/how to fix it and give a reason. They both have a very serene vibe and lots of styles to choose from and that definitely makes them my go to choices. Plus they both have some adorable pets who visit!\n\nI've done a lot of YWA. She's just not my cup of tea. She talks way too much. I prefer Yoga with Cassandra. She has a much better balance. She's my fav.\n\nI really love Five Parks Yoga. She has SO many classes, and most are intermediate, so I can push myself. Big recommend. She's very straightforward, there isn't that cutesy vibe.\n\nErin was recommended to me by my cousin who lives in CA and I followed her chanel for years.  It turns out Erin lives down the road from me!  I actually got to take a class in person with her, and she is a really kind individual.  I like seeing her succeed and her instruction is top-notch.  I'd love to go to her Costa Rica retreat.\n\nME TOO! Yes, I really enjoy her style and flows.\n\nAw I don't know why you got downvoted. I also enjoy this channel. Definitely more difficult but I actually get into a flow with five parks, whereas I can find Adrienne a bit distracting honestly. As a very beginner I liked how Adrienne explained everything but now a few months in of near daily practice and her chattiness grates on me a bit. Five Parks breathing cues help *so* much\n\nPrecisely.\n\nI prefer yoga with Tim. He has better cues for form and safety.\n\nYWT is amazing. I subscribe to it now. Down to Earth, no cheese, very informative\n\npersonally, i prefer yoga with kassandra. her energy and temperament more align with my goals for my practice\n\nYeah I think she’s really un-intimidating. She’s not “froo-froo” about it. She feels like a friend showing you her yoga knowledge. I personally prefer something that has more atmosphere to it, but she’s fun.\n\nCool fact: her dad lives in Austin tx and when I was an actor here, I starred in a play with him. It was not long after she had first launched her channel and it was starting to take off! He was so proud. It was really cute.\n\nPersonally I don't enjoy her videos. I do love Kassandra, Shaunekka, and Yoginimelbourne.\n\nI've been practicing with her for years. She feels like an old friend.\n\nI named my cat in Stardew Valley benji because of Adrienne &amp; her dog. She is just easy to follow as well, great for beginners. She has some 30 day challenges as well that help you make it a habit.\n\nShe's literally the only yoga instructor who's videos I watch. I like her vibe, it's very wholesome, and she's very beginner friendly.\n\nI started with one of YWA’s 30-day challenges as baby steps just to get into the groove of doing daily yoga as a beginner. This helped tremendously, as YWA is very beginner friendly, so if you need a good starting point, I definitely recommend her. YWA also has videos about breathwork, and talks you through proper form for beginners. Eventually after 2 months, I found myself moving onto more challenging content such as Nicole Wild and Charlie Follows which fit my yoga needs much more to this day.\n\nI love yoga with adriene! I love her personality, how she guides through the poses, its been so helpful for my mental health\n\nShe has a very approachable way of introducing yoga to people with no experience.\n\nI've tried YWA, too, and just don't prefer her style.\n\nTry Two Birds Yoga on YT. I love Fiona's practice and instruction style. I've been doing her videos since 2020. And, she also has a dog who makes appearances on occasion. \n\nI've also been using the Down Dog app since 2017. \n\nBest of luck!\n\nI really like Travis Eliot on YouTube, although I don’t think that he’s for beginners.   More intermediate/ advanced.  But I like his voice, his style, his flows.\n\nI like her because she's very thorough with her instructions, and she has a video for damn near anything you'd want to do yoga for. Sore legs? Got it. Stress relief? Yep. She even has some for grief release, or just getting to sleep. It's like coming to a good friend for some yoga practice.\n\nI don’t use videos often but I find she doesn’t talk excessively or do what feels like pandering to the “mmmm yeah so spiritual” banter. \n\nSilence is fine. Some people really fill those gaps with banter and I don’t need it.\n\nI began my fitness journey with her. Her videos have helped me lose 30 kilos without being overwhelmed or feeling inadequate. She's a superstar 🌟🌟🌟🌟\n\nI actually don't like her. I like David procyshyn from do yoga with me the best\n\nMy favorite is Erin from Five Parks Yoga. Adriene is great but she doesn’t resonate with me as much. There are many great options, find who and what works for you.\n\nBenji matches my Dax and I like her voice.\n\nI feel like she’s very down-to-earth and chill, which I appreciate. Plus, Benji.\n\nIt’s just super approachable. Very simple to start\n\nHave you tried and watched her? I mean that would answer if she is good for YOU. She is quite good and pleasant and lots of people like her.\n\nShe got me into it! A lot of her content is free and so approachable.\n\nLots of good content, but someone who is more gentle is Jessica Reich. If I’m traveling and need a gentle practice to end my day on the road, I usually pull up one of her videos. Both have great yoga videos.\n\nJust chiming in to say that if you don’t get her, that’s ok.\nI’ve tried them and they aren’t my style. \nHer informal style just takes me out of it. \n\nMy preferred teacher is Fiji from DoYogaWithMe because of how much focus she keeps on the breath in each practice. It’s something I struggle with so that’s a good fit for me.\n\nWe’re fortunate to have many creators so everyone can find someone they really connect with .\n\nI tried her a few times but couldnt get warm with her, i prefer Yoga with Kassandra\n\nAdriene knows exactly what I’m feeling and when. I couldn’t even hold myself up in a tabletop position without my wrists hurting when I started yoga. Then, Adriene mentioned something like “It’s okay if your wrists hurt. With practice that will change. Take a break whenever you need to.” I felt so validated and not pressured. She’s done that with other poses too. She just gets it!\n\nShe's great. I stop going to classes and use her every other day. She has hundreds of videos for all levels.\n\nI began with YWA (loved her initially) then went on to Yoga with Kassandra once I had mastered the moves and to be honest, wanted less talking and more yoga.\n\nI agree with the other comments and I just think she’s a little magical. Her classes got me through a really terrible time. There’s just something about her….beyond how good her classes are. I really feel happier when I finish one.\n\nShe's really good for beginners. She's accessible, educational, fun, spiritual, and can be challenging. Plus she'a free. \n\nA gaia.com subscription has way more variety, though. And Meghan Currie's yoga is amazing if you like more advanced classes.\n\nI'm an avid daily practitioner and typically stick with the Down Dog app or the NTC app for power vinyasa, but when I'm not in a great place mentally/physically or just need more encouragement, I go to Adriene. \n\nI've laughed with her, cried with her, and leaned on her for comfort. She's so gentle, thoughtful, and kind. She's a great teacher, particularly for beginners, but also just for anyone who enjoys a positive, laid-back yoga experience.\n\nYoga with Tim is very good. I find him better than YWA, she's okay but he's funny and educational\n\nHer personality 🪄✨✨✨\n\nI began practicing with her 3 years ago and the way she builds you up and guides you is just so pleasant. She's pretty awesome and making you feel like \"you got this\".\n\nI started taking her classes in 2015. I had just quit smoking and i told myself on a really hard night that im going to try yoga to keep up my non smoking. Got on YouTube, found her and i am coming up on 10 years smoke free! I like that she offers a variety of classes that dont “feel” like exercise. I prefer gentle yoga on rest days or to wind down in the evening and she has all of that. I also live in Austin, and i met her at the yearly turkey trot. Told her my story and cried. She was the sweetest most genuine human I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.\n\nFor her dog\n\nHer voice is so soothing\n\nShe’s lovely and calming, I get why she’s quite loved. If you’re interested in trauma informed yoga (life changer for me!) high recommend to check out Our Echo Yoga on YouTube\n\nShe’s very funny- and her ease into yoga approach helps me do it at 5:00 in the morning. She has me hooked. I rarely miss a day. I’m just doing the free monthly challenges\n\nThe channel is entirely accessible: from her to teaching style to her affirmations - I have yet to find someone who encompasses Adrienne's down-to-earth compassion for the frailties of the human body and who can also be so gently motivating without the in-your-face/pump-it-up/only-pain-is-gain attitude that we tend to favor in the US. Also, she's done this for so long that she has a video for just about every person's need/flow.\n\ni loved her videos when i first started! she walks you through it so well that you feel like she’s right there. one time i even started crying (in a good way) because the session i did was sooo good for the soul.\n\nI personally prefer Charlie Follows. Just like another commenter said no shade, just wanted to share an alternative option.\n\nShe is just so normal! Just someone like me doing yoga.\n\nShe's dominated the algorithm I think because she's very good at articulating, verbally what your body needs to be doing. I will still defer to her if I'm trying to master a fundamental skill because she's great for fundamentals.\n\nYears on though Yoga with Kassandra is my main YouTube yogi and I also think Adison Briana mobility based yoga videos are really awesome.\n\nShe is down to earth, really appreciates and loves her audience, is simple to do at first and her videos are long, short, or in between. And she has her cute dog in every video. A huge following.Talk about mental health and shows modified versions as well as the harder moves.\n\nI like that there's no distracting music she constantly reminding you to only go as far as your own body can go and saying you should congratulate yourself if you just showed up that's all very helpful to me. She doesn't make me yawn incessantly like so many other yoga instructors. I love her dog and every now and then when she unintentionally says something that could be a euphemism she says \"ay ohhh\" 😂 it's great.\n\nI did yoga on and off with her videos and other creators over the years, and now I’ve actually made it a habit. I’m still very much a beginner due to my lack of consistency before, and she makes it easy to show up each day for practice. She really puts effort into helping me understand how I am taking care of myself by showing up each day, and she doesn’t want her viewers to focus on perfection. Although lots of people watch, it feels like a personal experience which I appreciate.\n\nI'm especially a fan of her themed classes like Bride of Plankenspine, Yoga with Alien, and the one she wore a skeleton costume 🤣\n\nShe has super easy beginner videos that are around 20 minutes long. A great start.\n\nSometimes when I feel like I need more emotional support than yoga instruction I’ll turn to Adrienne :)\n\nTypically I do classes with Fiona of Two Birds Yoga. She and her classes are wonderful. \n\nWhen I first started I did years of Yoga with Tim classes. He gives extremely good form cues. All three have hundreds of free classes available for all different levels. Hard to go wrong with any of them.\n\nAt home yoga. Do it anywhere in the house, anytime, wearing anything or nothing. Completely approachable and do-able!"

Have you always been flexible?\n\nThanks 😊 I wasn’t always flexible, I’ve worked on it for many years. Sometimes I can’t believe the things my body is able to do nowadays :)\n\nwell that's encouraging to hear.  I know what you mean. kind of.  :-)\n\nWow my hammies could never haha\n\nThere was a time I didn’t think I could either 😅\n\nAlways love your content.  It seems you really approach with attention to technique.  Thank you for sharing.\n\nThank you :) Technique, intention &amp; energy are the foundational triangle of my practice ✨\n\nOm\n\nHi V, wow, just awesome control  with supreme flexibility. The mindful concious control and continual adjustments needed to master these  manoeuvres demands superlative concentration. This is pure poetry in motion. Thank you for sharing in such a delightful manner. It was a joy to behold\n\nYou’re too kind ✨ thank you for watching and taking the time to write such lovely words!\n\nI can literally feel my lower back opening up and getting all the pops out watching this. So jealous.\n\nAhhhh this feels SO good on the lower back!\n\nThis asana Improves your hygiene after you smell your feet for 10 sec straight\n\nWell personal hygiene is very important :) happy I don’t have smelly feet 😂\n\nWow. How long have you been doing yoga?\n\n12 years since I started, very on and off at first and now very dedicated :)\n\nDo you work on flexibility outside of yoga or did you get to that level only doing yoga? In any case, it's very impressive, I've gone from very inflexible to decently flexible myself, but you're on another level!\n\nWow. I’ve been doing it for a year and I’d say you’re 12x as flexible. \n\nWow. That flexibility is really impressive.\n\nThanks :)\n\nAmazing!\n\nThanks :)\n\nwow! Didn’t know it this was even possible. I know theoretically that this could be  possible with consistent practice, but as a late 40s male, is it a goal to work towards? Not just from physical possibilities point of view but also a tinge of mental health angle… in terms of adjusting to failure of not achieving it.\n\nI didn’t know it was possible until I saw someone doing it a few years ago, that’s why I like to share different variations of known poses :) I personally don’t set goals and just stay consistent out of love for the practice and let my body surprise me from time to time. \n\nNo expectations makes the practice so much sweeter in my opinion. If you practice your folds consistently, whether you get a super deep fold and elbows touch the floor or not, you will still make significant physical improvement and discover new things about yourself in the process, so it’s always a win ✨\n\nUgh that is such a beautiful view! I love that, and your flexibility is impressive! I hope i can get to that point some day\n\nThank you! Just stay dedicated, consistent, practice with love and have no expectations :)\n\nHow can I learn this?\n\nStart [here](https://youtu.be/XMj_StK_CME?si=qdEZPd46van5RF2s), stay consistent, practice your folds often and see what happens :)\n\nOooo I didn't know you had your own channel! This is great news :)\n\nFlexibility with yoga!\n\nThis is awesome!!\n\nThanks :)\n\nIncredible and inspiring!\n\nThanks :)\n\nWhat does comp mean on these posts?\n\nIt means “check out my pose”. it’s required when posting photos/videos here, otherwise they get deleted.\n\nThanks 🙏\n\nGorgeous!\n\nThanks :)\n\nWhere do you live, if you dont mind me asking? :)\nIts beautiful!\n\nI live in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, Peru :) it’s so pretty and magical here 💚\n\nHow do you keep your knees/legs from hyperextending/locking in when you're bent so far forward? I imagine it takes a lot of leg strength?\n\nI was taught to not hyperextend the hamstrings in sitting forward fold, and it seems like this pose could easily lead to that, so I'm just covering my bases in case I ever eventually get my palms down on the ground. ;D\n\nEither way beautiful forward fold, thank you for sharing, and I hope you don't mind the inquiry.\n\nMy knees don’t hyperextend easily, but I keep them safe by engaging the quads and rolling my knees up, which also allows my hamstrings to relax and lengthen a little more. \n\nSome teachers exaggerate the whole hyperextending thing a little too much which prevents students from exploring their possibilities out of fear. Unless you’ve got hypermobility or you can feel pain on your knees, I wouldn’t worry too much about it.\n\nAppreciate the insights, thank you.\n\nThat's clean\n\nYour videos bring me happiness. Never stop sharing your gift with us.\n\nAmazing\n\nThanks :)\n\nThis is really amazing congratulations.\n\nThank you :)\n\nso good yoga\n\nThanks :)"

    "all_comment_text": "The cat was like \"not this again\"\n\nI think my cats are fed up with me interrupting their morning bask to film my videos, I might have to start bribing them with treats 🐱\n\nMy yoga teacher often says, “you’re only as young as your spine is flexible” but I feel like this is taking the proverbial out of that statement\n\nI love how strong and controlled you are as you come put of the pose.  Believe me, after practicing my best approximation of any camel variations, especially for this long, my abs will be shaking visibly as I lift back up to seated.\n\nThank you ✨ All the front lengthening actually feels really good on my abs (nowadays). You can find the sweet core engagement spot in backbends so that your abs are active but not getting too tired or crunching too much and you’re able to lengthen as well as support your back. Back strength also helps take some pressure off your abs supporting you and they don’t get as exhausted :)\n\nWow! Your flexibility is inspiring. I've never seen these variations before. Well done! 👏🏾\n\nThank you 🙏🏽✨ These aren’t very known but are super fun and a great way to work towards Kapotasana eventually. Most people will go from camel to Kapotasana and that’s a bit wild 😅\n\nDddddddaaaaang!!!!!!! Cosmic ujjayi. Time space continuum spine 🌀\n\nI love that place backbending practice takes me 🌀 The center where everything is connected and all becomes love &amp; unity 🙏🏽✨\n\nNice! Very fitting that you have a cow cat too. =)\n\nBella the cow-cat! 🐮🐱\n\nLovely! I’ve been working on my camel pose lately and this is very inspiring to me. Thanks for sharing!!\n\nHappy to inspire ✨ Thanks for your kind words :)\n\nI'm sorry, this is highly impressive, but is that a hummingbird in the background?!?\n\nYes! Multiple kinds of hummingbird visit my garden everyday 🥰\n\nHow gorgeous!\n\nGoddamn, every time I see a post of yours it makes me want to work on my back stretches\n\n\nThanks for the inspiration!\n\nSo happy to provide a bit of inspiration ✨ I hope you do it, backbending is such a lovely feeling :)\n\nyou make this look so easy!  Well done!\n\nThank you! It really isn’t easy though 😅\n\nMe, now that I've gotten used to your posts: \n\"She's gonna touch her head to her feet\"\n\nI was right! 😄\n\nFeet to head is so fun 😅🙈\n\nNo ocean view today?\n\nI’ve moved from the beach to the Andes :) I don’t think I’ll be visiting the ocean for a while, as beautiful as it is, I feel more at home surrounded by the mountains 💚\n\nI have no idea how to move when asked to push my chest out.\n\nIt’s so tricky at first 🥲 Learning to push the chest and engage the upper back takes time because most of us are more used to hunching - the opposite! But if you take the time and practice often, eventually it will click! \n\nTry standing or kneeling with a neutral spine and with an inhale arch your back, exaggerate sticking your bum out and chest forward, take a moment to observe what your chest is doing (going forward and up), play with this moving slowly and mindfully :) I explain this in the first few minutes [of this video](https://youtu.be/tLZrpLGNRQo?si=z3CDmD-AetCLlIWm) if you want a visual. You can also work on opening a stiff upper back with poses like puppy pose (I suggest any variation on the floor and puppy with the wall as well) and supported fish pose with blocks is amazing too! Keep practicing and little by little it will get easier ✨\n\nThank you soo much! I will try and let you know how it went!\n\nLovely variations! What an open back you got there too lol must’ve taken a while im guessing to work up to that. How long you been practicing if I may ask?\n\n12 years :) For the first few years of my practice, camel pose felt completely unbearable, and the fact that it made me feel so dizzy and uneasy made me skip it in most classes I took. Things have obviously changed over time and lots of practice 😅 I didn’t really expect that this would become a happy place for me.\n\nOh that’s so awesome. It’s crazy how a diligent consistent practice gets you to do these crazy things you never thought you could do.. and actually enjoy hahaha\n\n🤍\n\n❤️✨\n\nHi V.  Just awesome.  Such supreme coordination and concious contol running through these beautifully expressed transitions into variations of camel pose.  The concentration, breathing cobtrol and power is evident in every tiny variation. Beautiful to watch and such inspiration to persevere in our endeavours to achieve such sublime mindful control. Thank you for sharing\n\nNamaste\n\nThis was so soothing and relaxing. \n\nNo jealousy, calculating, or analyzing today. Just enjoying watching a beautiful practice and being grateful you exist.\n\nThank you for your kind loving words 🙏🏽 Grateful for all of you watching and taking the time to connect ✨\n\nImpressive\n\nThank you :)\n\nLove this! Camel has to be one of my fave poses.\n\nCamel is like instant bliss 😊\n\nWhat am I doing wrong that my camel attempts feel like I’m being choked? I feel like I can go further in the pose but my esophagus strains and I have to let up\n\nMy first guess would be that you’re dumping the neck down without engagement and/or holding your breath, make sure you’re opening/lengthening your throat area and engaging the back muscles of your neck. My favourite way to practice and teach neck engagement is in a cobra pose because you’re supported and can move slowly and controlled, starting the pose from the top of the spine by first bringing the chin up to the sky, opening the throat and engaging the back neck. That way you can slowly explore the movement and notice how the neck feels when it’s properly engaged, first practice a low cobra and once you understand the neck and chest/upper back you can move into a high cobra where you use the entire spine. I explain the cobra neck engagement and top to bottom movement in the first few minutes [of this video](https://youtu.be/xyZmO3ZHnII?si=AjRV2TEG3EgjxRRe) if you wanna take a look. Practicing this often will translate into your camel and other backends too :) \n\nAlso, if you don’t use your neck to backbend often, you might also need to strengthen it, my favourite way to do this would be to go into a puppy pose and (if you can already have your chin and chest touching the mat) work on gently &amp; slowly lifting your neck up, hold a few seconds and down, you can do 5-10 slow reps about 2-3 times a week would be great.\n\nGood luck and remember to move slowly and take it easy with your neck 😊\n\nGreat tips - thanks!\n\nNice. Someone has put in the work.\n\nThanks 😁\n\nHi V. Wow, awesome. This is such a beautiful demonstration of your supreme mindful control and coordination of the transions of these various variations on the the camel pose. Mesmerizing and masking the extreme effort and concentration ncessary to practice at such an advanced level.  You are an inspiration to us all  a spur to encourage us to persevere in our own endeavours. Beautiful ro watch, thank your for sharing\n\nNamaste\n\nAnyone else's back not bend this much? Asking for a friend.....\n\n😂\n\nSoo inspiring to see what some bodies can do with a lot of training 💪\n\nThat garden is beautiful\n\nBeautiful, powerful, serene. Thank you for sharing!\n\nScary flexibility."

    "all_comment_text": "We applaud after the final “namaste” bc our instructor is 92 years old and every day this man can get up and do this for us is a blessing🙏🏽\n\nWow! Dude must be a beast worthy of every applause.\n\nI am in absolute awe of him and the other seniors in our class. Nothing like watching a bunch of 80+ year olds smoke you in pretty much every position…humbling and motivating for sure!\n\nI’d applaud in that case too\n\nOkay I would applaud for him too honestly\n\nIf it's **true**. Then it's really something else.\n\nSouthern Californians know who I’m talking about…and he’s as real as his class I’m going to tomorrow.\n\nI’m glad i’m not alone. I’m not a fan of clapping after yoga. It’s not a huge deal, but it’s not my preference and I don’t participate.  I find it a little jarring after a meditative cool down and quiet Savasana. The lights are dim and we methodically get into a seated position usually with hands at Anjali mudra.  There might be a chant or affirmation. I personally like to hold onto that zen feeling as long as possible. I’m an anxious person so holding onto that calmness is important to me\n\nI agree. I also think it’s just weird\n\nSame. \n\nMy brain just had a much-needed rest. The last thing I want is something jarring like applause.\n\nIt’s like a round of applause when a plane lands after a perfectly standard flight lol. Thoughtful, enthusiastic, and confusing 🤣\n\n\"Hooray! We didn't die!!\"\n\nI don’t know why I always blush and sink into my seat when it happens, I get *so* awkward and clearly I’m not the pilot haha. \n\nLike y’allllll stawwwwppp, but it’s adorably well-intended so also please ignore me and carry on... 😆👏 Shy people problems.\n\nThis is SO RELATABLE honestly. Me in so so many situations.\n\nI feel the same when people clap after films that aren’t crew screenings. Like… I get it’s just an act of appreciation but it makes me cringe a little ha ha. Like, James Cameron can’t hear you lol.\n\nHaha, you’re right!! I will say the only time I wholeheartedly accepted and participated in movie theatre applause for a large film was in Avengers End Game when the portal opened mid-battle loss and Black Panther and the Wakandans walked out and everyone in the theatre lost their minds as all of the lost superheroes emerged. I’ve never seen more shared excitement among strangers in all of my years of movie-going 😆 🤓\n\nThis sentiment applies equally to making it through a yoga session for some of us.\n\nI clap for Ryan Air for this reason. The rest I expect to live.\n\nI sometimes say “Hooray, I didn’t die” after some power vinyasa classes. \n\n(I do miss them, though. Those were awesome workouts).\n\nThis is the exact vibe lol\n\n[removed]\n\nUntil now I never thought of yoga instruction as a kind of performance…interesting. But I definitely show my gratitude without clapping lol\n\nthank you for the flair!\n\nIn my experience, people clap only after a really good class. You can sense it when souls were touched and bodies were challenged.\n\nAt this one Pilates reformer studio I went to, the instructor would say “give yourself a round of applause for completing the workout”. It felt nice to appreciate and thank your body for showing up, and I started doing a small silent clap after yoga.\n\nThat makes sense. I can see that\n\nI like this way of looking at it.\n\nthis always happens in my classes, i thought it was to applaud the instructor\n\nNo, the claps are for the group. \"The claps are for the students\" is what instructors say who clap\n\nOh, i’ve never heard that from an instructor! Usually in my classes the claps are followed by “thank you” or “that was a great class” so i assumed it was applauding a good class/instructor.\n\nThere’s usually a brief, gentle clapping after my classes, and I’ve generally thought of it as gratitude/showing appreciation for our teacher and ourselves. Never occurred to me that someone would be bothered by a show of kindness.\n\nSame in my classes. It's not loud or jarring and I think it's a nice simple way of showing appreciation to the instructor. \n\nI have never been in a class that claps. we just quietly say thank you.\n\nAbsolutely not normal 😂\n\nMany classes I’ve been to clap at the end\n\nYeah IME it really depends on the class. The non-yoga classes at my studio (barre, pilates, the various boot camp-y ones) more often have after-class clapping. The more traditional yoga ones (vinyasa, hatha, etc.) rarely do. The in-betweens (power, aerial), it depends on the particular teacher and students.\n\nExactly, makes it feel like a performance maybe?\n\nNot normal. After savasana I think hearing clapping would be quite disruptive to the feeling of peace personally\n\nI lake to say good game\n\nI can’t stand this. Let me keep my zen and stop with the loud noises.\n\n+1000 upvotes\n\nThat would be a lil awkward for me.\n\nIt’s considered polite to clap after a dance class. I imagine it’s just reflex for some people after growing up doing dance as kids.\n\nTrue, I grew up going to dance classes like this!\n\nI’ve enjoyed a peaceful, quiet ending to my weekly yoga class. Started a Pilates class in the same studio. The end of class applause was a thing I’d never experienced until that class, and my face literally looked like this the first time. It’s awkward and I don’t like it. \n\nI’m with the guy in the GIF. I’ve never clapped in a yoga class ever. Lol.\n\nPeople have started doing this recently in Yoga and in my Tai Chi classes too, and I probably sound like a curmudgeon but I hate it.\n\nNahhh that would piss me off 😭😭\n\nWe do in my class, very light clapping, it’s like saying thank you to the instructor\n\nI find this is more common at chain gyms (speaking as someone with a budget gym membership lol).\n\nmaybe a lot of dancers in the class? it’s customary to clap after dance classes esp ballet\n\nMy current studio we say Jay instead of namaste. I’ve been on retreats where people clap after the last class of the trip and it seems appropriate and like a joyful closing.\n\nI never do it. Don’t really care about cultural appropriation, it’s just not necessary or accurate.\n\nAccurate?\n\nThey clap at my classes too. I think it’s a bit cheesy so I don’t do it. I’ll say namaste or thank you to the instructor instead.\n\nAbsolutely not I would quit the studio lol\n\nIt’s funny bc they didn’t do this when I used to go. Same gym, same instructor. I took a 6 month break, I come back and suddenly we are clappers 😭\n\nThis is a new one for me. I prefer the silence after the practice.\n\nI have never had that experience and thankful for it. After a good class I feel so calm I don’t want your clap clap sounds shocking me back to the grind.\n\nCore power last night. Heard the N word in several of the instructor selected music along with clapping at the end of class. I am ready to exit this planet as soon as it stops spinning.\n\nWhy not just exit the class?\n\nUsually where I take class it's just a chorus of thank yous at the end.\n\nWe always say Namaste and there's a pattern we bang on the floor before saying Jai!!\n\nI don’t think it’s a big deal. I get that it’s a “noise”, and that can be bothersome. I have an auditory processing disorder. If you google it I have almost all the symptoms listed. Yet sound doesn’t bother me during shavasana. It just is, it comes, it passes by, it goes. I take that with me regardless of what other people do. Nothing can interfere with that. In fact, I feel gratitude for the “noise makers”.\n\nI was doing that too before realizing I was the only one. Don’t. No loud noises which might disrupt meditation.\n\nWe're taught that it's to applaud the class for having united through the experience. It's not supposed to be for the instructor alone.\n\nMy secret theory is that it wakes everyone up from their meditative state and reinfuses energy / movement into the room. Which could be considered counter to the entire yoga class experience's purpose. But also it gets students up and atem faster so the studio can get cleaner and the next class can get set up for 😂\n\nThis happened to me for the first time last night! I wasn’t expecting it at all. The class ended with Namaste and then everyone just starts clapping - I was so shocked. I was glad the lights were dim because my expression was bewildered 😂\nIt wasn’t an exceptionally great class either. It was fine but not life changing.\nI appreciated the class of course, don’t wanna sound ungrateful. Ive just had never had a class end with applause before. 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nYeah one of the classes I go to does this every week. It's a little odd but just part of the culture of the group, I don't see the harm. Too many yogis flying with Ryanair or smth\n\nThis is insanity. And ruins savasana lol. Wow.\n\nI take yoga classes at a gym and people always clap at the end. This is also the type of environment where if the teacher mentions the advanced variation of a pose, everyone’s immediate reaction is to twist/force themselves into it. No one bothers with props and they also stretch before class. My issue with all these behaviors is that our teacher doesn’t step in. Disclaimer, I’ve never taken a teacher training and I don’t know the responsibilities of the teachers at my gym, but I do wish these teachers would educate students on the concepts more, like how to express gratitude in a way that maintains the benefits of the practice. \n\nWhy would it be bad to stretch before Yoga Class?\n\nI’m not sure if it’s bad. But I think most of the people in my class do it to warm up or prep for the class. But our yoga class slowly builds up with a dynamic warmup and slowly gets deeper with poses. So when people stretch before class, I feel they may not understand the concepts of warming up the muscles during class and of not pushing themselves into a pose they are not ready for and could injure them. \n\nI think those are two different concerns honestly. I also stretch before a class sometimes, if my body asks me to. I would imagine novices like what you’re describing would feel the need also, not having the benefit of years of yoga already!\n\nidk but I don't even say namaste anymore\n\nI hate saying namaste, it feels so disingenuous to me.\n\nexactly\n\nIt's the upper-class-white-womanifcation of yoga. All the rich southern baptists in my area are scared to say namaste because it's not Christian\n\nDo you live in the southeast USA as well? They will vote for a rapist president but draw the line at uttering a few words that honor a culture they don’t understand. I’m southern Appalachian so yeah.\n\nWe’ve got Holy Yoga ™️ in NC.  My timbers were shivered when I saw it pop up on the roster. And then I blew a gasket because that’s not what yoga is for, I’m tired of people bastardizing the practice, and then I got double mad at myself for being judgemental and gatekeep-y. \n\n*sigh*\n\nYes - Knoxville. And I agree, it's wild out here.\n\nI used to have a boss who told me yoga is demonic and I was summoning demons. I wanted to say, \"well, if that's what it takes to feel better and improve my mind state, meh.\" lol\n\nI'm guessing they don't know \"namaste\" is Hindi for \"hello\" and \"goodbye\".  🙄\n\n(Sidles up to the church pulpit and polishes buttons) I’m a recovering southern-baptist so I can shed some light on this. Your guess is correct: they don’t know those Hindi words; furthermore, they are suspicious of the translation  “the light in me sees and honors the light in you” because that implies God is within each of us. Wrong, sinner! It’s sinful vanity to think a human being can embody god.  The only true religion for them is one where God is a literal old white man in the sky who smites homosexuals and poor people.\n\nBut that's literally the translation of namaste. I've only been studying Hindi for a year but I do know that the sentence  \"The light in me sees and honors the light in you\" would contain some forms of dehkna (see), prakash (light), aur (and), and you (aap).  They are quite literally reacting to something that isn't being said.\n\n&gt; I've only been studying Hindi for a year\n\nNamaste is Sanskrit. It's obviously also used in Hindi, but to ascribe its Hindi usage elsewhere is putting the cart before the horse.\n\nI stand corrected.  Thank you.\n\nHappy cake day! Yeah, you just can’t apply knowledge or logic to fundamentalist religion.\n\nThanks!  Yeah, silly me.  SMH\n\nMy instructor said she once taught at a place that had banned using sanskrit names for poses\n\nThat's so strange to me. It's like the opposite of Boulder. Here, I've had teachers that barely spoke a word of English, I'm thinking of a specific teacher, who was from Greece, but she was able to instruct anyway because the local culture is to use Sanskrit pose names and she really only needed a few other words.\n\nAgog.\n\nDue to the happiness feeling that yoga generates in our mind. \nClaps 👏 to express gratitude\n\nI clap as I am glad it’s over… in a good way, as I am exhausted ( I do hot yoga 26 positions) !!!\n\nAt the gym I go to for yoga everyone claps at the end including me.  I blame clapping entrainment AKA peer pressure. At the studio I go to nobody claps at the end.  Once I got used to the clapping which was weird for me at first I didn't care anymore and I just went with it and to me now it's no different than the other place where there is no clapping.\n\nHahah I’ve been to a studio once that did this and I was shocked, but it was a nice communal moment.\n\nI’m not sure how I feel about this, I’m normally sleepy and relaxed after a class so a round of applause might be a shock 😆\n\nWait! what? they do that?\n\nI don’t clap or sing in yoga.\n\nIs westernized yoga seriously just a cult at this point?!\n\nMaybe because I really only go to yin classes, this does not happen. And I would be very irritated if it did after an hour of meditation.\n\nI always give the instructor a hug at the end. And some other students may share their experience in class, and I like that. But we all try to carry the peacefullness home with us.\n\nYeah the clapping is nice and as a yoga teacher it's a nice compliment but it really kills the calm quiet vibe 😅 I'd strongly prefer clapping or everyone saying namaste at once or something. \n\nI have to cover my ears, I absolutely hate it\n\nPeople did it at my the gym I used to go to. It always seemed weird to me. Nobody does it at my current gym.\n\nIt’s the emotions are high\n\nAnd this is why we have the word Americlap\n\nI never say Namaste at the end of a class I am teaching- because generally it means hello or in some cultures it’s a greeting to a teacher or master. Such a weird thing to say at the end of a guided practice.. \nAnyway.. I subbed a class once and the students clapped at the end and it surprised me. I said: \n“Oh wow. Thank you very much.” I wasn’t sure what else to say 😆.\n\nMost must be Puertoricans, they clap when plane lands. 🙃\n\nAlways\n\nBecause we can. Who cares?\n\nThat is part of the yoga\n\nAbout 35 years ago? a yoga studio on Ocean Park Blvd. a few blocks off Venice Beach - or at the Santa Monica Y yoga classes? Envelope is at the back of class, tuck some cash in to thank the teacher.\n\nLove it in AM classes bring the energy get people excited for rest of the day\n\nSo weird people are still saying namaste….\n\nAbsolutely not weird at all in a yoga session\n\nwait...why is it weird to say namaste after a yoga class?\n\nbecause they think you're appropiating other's cultures by saying a word typically said in such activity.\n\nyour typical too-much-time-in-their-hands stuff.\n\nOh… if that’s the mindset then they shouldn’t be doing Yoga in the first place.\n\n&gt; because they think you're appropiating other's cultures by saying a word typically said in such activity.\n\nAnd because of the subset that point only to the word used as a greeting at present and overlook its older use so they can feel self-righteous on their soapboxes. They opt to assume anyone who dares to say the word is just trying to look authentic.\n\nWhat do you have against other people's cultures?\n\nYeahhh it is normal and interesting!"

    "title": "Judging others for not following yoga philosophy doesn’t align with yoga philosophy",
    "body": "I see many posts judging others for solely practicing asana and the western “bastardization” of the practice, or for “showing off” by doing handstands and other advanced postures. I just want to challenge these judgements with some of the things I’ve learned through my studies.\n\nOne of the main teachings of the Sutras is that yoga focuses on quieting of the fluctuations of the mind so we can experience the world through our higher consciousness. This is in part achieved by awareness of our thoughts and feelings that come to us through our senses. \n\nWhen we see someone doing a handstand and think, “look at them showing off”, that’s just mental chatter that pulls us away from our higher consciousness. \n\nIs someone doing a handstand or posting a photo of an advanced posture on instagram causing harm? Or is it our ego at work putting thoughts of comparison in our mind? That we’re doing yoga the “right” way and they’re doing yoga the “wrong” way.\n\nWe forget that we all have a collective  consciousness within us. We’re all sharing this existence together. When we think these negative thoughts, we are the ones doing harm. To ourselves and to others by creating this false separation.\n\nWhen we live a yogic lifestyle, others will be drawn to us. If we want others to follow the path, we can lead by example. If someone is drawn to yoga for the asana, sharing our dharma can inspire them to dig deeper. And if they don’t, then it’s not their path at this time.\n\nNone of this is to say that I have it all figured out. I just invite you to be aware of your thoughts and judgements and remember that we’re all a small part of the greater whole.",

    "all_comment_text": "IDK if I can trust such a rational take from someone that didn't shoehorn in the fact that they started YTT.\n\nAt this point I think the complaints about the westernizing of yoga is just self validation for having done YTT\n\nBeing snarky is definitely yoga.\n\nHave you not listened to these gurus rip people new assholes in the most snarky way possible? 😅\n\nThis post is so level-headed and insightful that I regretfully assume it will just be swept aside by the next tide of “everyone is doing yoga wrong except me” posts.\n\nBut wait, are we now judging the “everyone is doing yoga wrong except me” posts? 😀\n\nah, but you see, unlike OP who is trying to spread wisdom, i am a dedicated hater\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance\n\nlol\n\nSomething interesting I read is that tolerance isn’t a paradox, it’s a social contract. Engaging in behaviour that isn’t tolerant of others is in breach of the contract and should exclude you from benefiting from others adhering to it.\n\nMy other playful comment aside, I agree with you. I think OP’s post deserves to be pinned to the top of this sub!\n\nAt one point, I realized that I didn’t want to envy the people around me, and that made me want to work harder so that I could also show off, and it made me want to wear nicer things.\n\nFor a while, I wore namebrand leggings and got my nails done so that I would feel less envious. Eventually, I realized I didn’t like getting my nails done and I didn’t like tight clothing. After that, I didn’t feel so much envious. Just relieved. \n\nNow I wear baggy pants, and I am making gradual progress towards things that I can show off. Sometimes it surprises me when people act like I did something. I like to laugh and say that I am basically a bumbling fool. I remind people of what I looked like when I started out. I realized that once I start being able to do something, it doesn’t feel like showing off, just struggling. All of the people that seem to be showing off are also struggling.\n\nMaybe the people who are judging others, are actually wishing that they could act like them. If they were at peace with not acting like those people, it wouldn’t bother them so much.\n\nThis was a delight to see after reading a few posts about the bastardization and gymnastification of yoga. Completely agree. The critic always bares so many assumptions upon the person they are critiquing. Also, yoga is a never ending journey! Accomplishing a handstand takes time, dedication, patience, and discipline.\n\nTotally agree! Also, the more centered and grounded I am, the better I'm able to actually do poses like handstands. When I'm thought spiraling and stressed, I fall out immediately. I almost find it a good way to gauge my mental state and it motivates me to improve it.\n\nExactly! For me, I struggle with consistency (with all things in life, whether it be yoga or laundry). Accomplishing a difficult pose demands my consistency and mental acuity to tune into how my body is responding.\n\nI completely agree with you &amp; OP!\n\nYour post is like a breath of fresh air, thank you for sharing this insight with us. This is the point of view that inspires me to keep learning yoga. I'm at the very beginning of my journey, having started just this year, but I've found that many of the things I learned from years of practicing mindfulness and meditation were probably borrowed from yoga philosophy 😅\n\n🎯🎯\n\nI do appreciate this take, what I think bums me out is when I invite friends or family to come to a class they ALWAYS say \n\n\n\"Oh no, I can't do yoga.\" \n\n\nI explain asana is just a piece,  and there's no wrong way to do it as long as they are being safe to their body. As well as the classes I like are slow. Meditative , not fast paced call out of yoga poses.\n\n\nBut this is what so many people think yoga is, and so they stay away. : ( I'm not on other soical media sites so hopfully the word is getting out yoga is not just asana to the layperson! \n\n100% agree it can be harmful not just physically but holistically. I don’t think calling a spade a spade a problem.\n\n&gt; \"Oh no, I can't do yoga.\" \n\nWhen people say this, I tell them that saying they are not strong/flexible enough to do yoga is like saying they're too dirty to take a shower :)\n\nThank you. Well said. There was a an online yoga group that I was bullied off of years ago by yoga gate keepers. This resonates rather strongly with me.\n\nWise words here. I practiced asana for many years before I began to learn more about yoga as a way of living, much more than the physical practice.  \n\nIt was my entry point in my yoga journey.  And I am grateful to have entered there and had the opportunity to learn more and grow my practice.  \n\nHad it not been for the asana practice I first started 20+ years ago, I would likely never have become a teacher, never taken my Ayurveda training, never broadened my personal practice to include meditation, breath work, chant and yogic philosophy and I doubt I’d have my current business guiding others with Ayurveda inspired yoga therapy.   \n\nEach one of us is on our own unique journey.\n\nSome tension just drained out of my body when I read your words.\n\nThe goal of Yoga is the destruction of the ego. A hard task.\n\n[removed]\n\nHaha I feel this, but I mean no judgement those judging, just offering food for thought! We all learn in our own way and in our own time.\n\n[removed]\n\nLove the awareness you pointed out! I think we’re all prone to judging anything that’s put in front of us. But whether we choose to believe those judgements and act on them, or choose to observe them and let them pass makes the difference.\n\nI think this post just achieved world peace\n\nIf you are following patanjali you could argue even being on social media to see the post is equally as non yogic as making the post, since that would not be renouncing and removing yourself from the world. I used to judge some of that stuff especially the “namastay for a beer” type classes but ultimately realized if it’s getting people who wouldn’t normally give yoga a chance involved it could lead to something great. Perhaps an alcoholic namastays for a beer or somebody decided to do an inversion challenge which leads them to becoming a great yogi and having a profoundly positive impact on society someday.\n\nIs the yoga community is any different than any other group? The expectation for extreme kindness is probably unrealistic. Most are supportive but there always a few in every community who detract.  The more yogis who keep shining bright the community will continue to evolve into what we want it to be - I think it starts by welcoming ALL people to the practice\n\nThank you for sharing this!  It was the yoga community that truly helped me with both physical and emotional problems years ago, and I was truly grateful to be allowed to be part of that.  So whenever people start the judgment and criticism, it stings, because I feel it should never be an \"us versus them.\"  Yoga to me is all about the \"we,\" and what we can do to support and encourage each other with our collective practice.  Each practice will be unique, and like you said in closing, \"all a small part of the greater whole.\"  So glad I was able to read this tonight, so thank you again for expressing what needed to be said.\n\nYASSSSSSS!!!\n\nI'm not judging anyone, it's just that if you are doing it only as a workout you're not doing yoga.\n\nI 100% agree. Yes, it takes time and dedication to do a handstand but that’s not yoga, it can be part of your practice for sure. You move your body but it’s not a “workout”.\n\nWell put.\n\nHear, hear.\n\nGatekeeping is about as far from yoga you can possibly get.\n\nAs a therapist, where appropriate, I have shared with clients about the benefits of yoga for both mind &amp; body. It's hard enough for many to even take the first steps into a yoga practice, esp if they are unfamiliar. So all the gatekeeping I read here is so frustrating to me! The benefits of breath + movement are amazing...we need to let yoga spread in all ways possible. The medicine works even with imperfect doses.\n\nThank you, I was close to quitting this subreddit due to those posts, but you verbalized things better than I could have. Difficult asanas are fun! There’s a lot of joy in yoga that the judgement of others strips away.\n\nLove this and has been resonating with me a lot too\n\nYoga is about quieting the mind, not judging others. Instead of criticizing those practicing asana or advanced postures, let's lead by example, inspire others, and remember we're all connected in this shared journey of consciousness and growth.\n\nThank you. \n\nthank you for sharing this insight with us...\n\nJudgement? On this sub? *clutches pearls*\n\nHard agree\n\nI love this outlook.\n\nEventhough you are correct from a philosophical point of view, you have to realise that it is a practise as well. It needs to be maintained and allowing it to be reduced to just one aspect of it, will lead to it's ultimate demise. We need people to push back for others to realise that it is not just an exercise but a way of life. Most people are not taught the yogic philosophy because it is not lucrative. So practitioner would never know that there exists something that goes beyond the asanas and unless someone points them out, they will never know.\n\nYES! And it’s also harmful.\n\nThere is certainly a lot of banter about the cultural appropriation of yoga and how it's been \"ruined\" by the West.  There is no doubt that in many places yoga has been reduced to just asana and creating shapes and there are plenty of yoga teachers that are simply what I call \"flow facilitators,\" and they don't teach the entire subject of yoga. However, these same people are helping to spread yoga in some form across the planet. \n\nWe tend to also forget that there are lots of paths under the umbrella of yoga such as karma yoga, bhakti, jnana, etc which all lead to the same destination. Some more physical, others devotional and so forth. I can't even count the number of times I hear yoga teachers say that their yoga is the right way and everything else isn't yoga. Just smile and turn around and walk away is my best advice.\n\nThis is absolutely spot on\n\nSpot on, thank you for this.\n\n🖤🖤🖤\n\nI just took the deepest inhale whilst reading this through followed by an exhale in exhilaration/ validation. \n\nThank you fellow human🖤\n\nFrom a teaching perspective ,\nI’ll wholeheartedly in respectfully disagree. \n\nWhen I know that I see someone competing with another student to see who can do a more intense posture, I’m only making that judgment so that I can say something as far as safety goes to try to prevent them from injuring themselves.\n\nPointing out egotistical behavior in one another is also a part of strong &amp; mature yoga community. \n\nI understand where you’re coming from. There’s definitely safety responsibilities to consider when teaching a class. But I think it’s possible to offer adjustments and insights without casting judgment.\n\nAllowing students to dig into their motivations by asking them to consider whether they really need to progress so deeply into the posture or if they’re risking injury trying to prove something, lets them figure out for themselves how they want to proceed. I don’t think it’s up to the teacher to decide someone’s motivations.\n\nWe can adjust the postures we offer or ask someone to find another class. But at the end of the day, we have no control over anyone else’s behavior.\n\nYou see that’s where a wholeheartedly disagree. I teach seberal yoga classes each week, and I am responsible for my own behavior as well as every other person’s behavior in the room.\n\nHere’s a real life example I experienced recently:  if a man is going out of his way to reach over, onto another persons mat and repetitively touch a  woman, I’m judging that as a violation of normal personal boundaries and asking them to never come to my class again out of respect For the comfort of everyone in class. \n\nIn that same way, if I’m taking a class with a male instructor and he touches me without asking permission I’m going to stand up and smack the fuck out of him. Make a scene, class is going to be ended, owner is going to be called in asap. &amp; yes, Same with a woman. You know why? in my state, that’s perfectly legal &amp; normal reaction for physical assault. \n\nWell said &amp; written my friend.\n\nThank you\n\nThis seems to be a deeply profound observation, or maybe I'm just not witty enough to see it's simplicity.\n\n I like to look at extreme consequences of arguments to help me to understand them. Tekken to an extreme then,  does it mean that we should apply this rationale to all of our internal critical commentary, because all criticism is negative? Clearly that's not the case, so perhaps the argument is flawed because in reality criticism of others helps us to protect ourselves from the snake oil vendors and charlatans who sell us our hopes and dreams in a bottle?\n\nLike most things in life, particularly things we see on social media which now offers extremist thinking as a default, there's a balance to be had. Our view of where the balance lies is going to be determined by our own values which have been formed from life experience. I guess the really hard part is trying to understand why someone may have such radically different views from our own, especially when the view that they have is so far from our own that it just appears to be obviously wrong. And yet  the view that they have is so strongly ingrained that it has as much validity for them as our own view has for us.\n\nFor me, I favour OPs argument, whilst acknowledging that others will do that which I find hard not to judge.  And that's for me to work on. Do no harm, I guess.\n\nUnderstanding people is hard though, I think, and I'll be pondering over this for a few days yet; like a stone in my shoe. 😲😲 Thanks u/AccountabiliButters\n\nThank you for your response! I’m no expert, just a student who has been deeply touched by the teachings of the Sutras, Yamas and Niyamas. These are just my thoughts on your reflection:\n\nWhen it comes to internal critical commentary, I think self-study is key. Are you living a life of non harming and truthfulness, but plagued by thoughts like misconception or imagination? Or are your actions out of alignment with your values?\n\nWhen you find yourself judging others, are they causing harm or is your ego playing a game of comparison? I’ve found it very helpful to separate myself from my mind. My mind creates all kinds of stories and judgments in an instant. But my true self can observe those thoughts without giving them power and without accepting them as truth. \n\nAnd if you find yourself in judgement of those truly causing harm, the Sutras challenge us to find indifference while always living by the guideline of non-harm.\n\nYoga is a lifelong practice that you get to live with every choice you make. We’re all perpetual students!\n\nYes!\n\nI would argue that,since so many traditions of yoga attach a karmic judgment to your ability/inability to do asana, yes they are potentially causing harm. And since a lot of folks who dig into the lifestyle receive that message without it necessarily being said outright, they’re being set up for exploitation\n\nThanks for going to bat for all yoga practices. I'm nowhere near an expert but I've certainly already learned that I can't quiet my own brain in a calm pose. Maybe that means I need further training, idk. What I do know is that my brain is very quiet when I have to put all my energy into not falling on my face. \n\nSo for me at least, nailing a difficult balancing pose is not only far more brain calming than laying flat on my back but it's an accomplishment that leaves me feeling strong both physically and mentally.\n\nI love yoga since i was introduced to the practice. I grew with it, suspended after long hiatus and returned, suspended again. The thing is at some point I realised I was far from knowing the vedas and the spiritual behind, I was a low-middle class kid with some money and luck to find it was something I enjoyed. And I'm gonna live it like that.\n\nThere is awareness and understanding and then there is judging. I’ve been to yoga classes that were not only not helpful but harmful in so many ways. I think being discerning about teachers and practices is 100% on the path. As far as social media goes, I’m disappointed that when a person is interested in yoga and what they find are a bunch of people doing handstands and backbends. I’m also disappointed that so many people have a perception that yoga is about what your body can and can’t do, how you look, what kind of class you take and what you wear and it’s a huge barrier for many.\n\nWell said, thank you. This has also been bothering me for reasons it's difficult to articulate - honestly, part of it is that I suspect some of the folks complaining about the bastardization of yoga probably found their way to their practice through a more western approach. I know I did - I started practicing at Lifetime Fitness and then found Corepower, and then started doing more workshops and classes at smaller studios, exploring philosophy and meditation and the sutras and diving much deeper into the traditions. So I guess there's a big part of me that feels like OK, Western yoga is it's a very watered down version of yoga but it's also an entry point for a lot of people to find their way to a deeper practice.\n\nFinally\n\nHi all. We each of us have our own unique paths to follow. It is the responsibility and collective obligation to respect the paths of others and help support them in their endeavours in all aspects of this ancient devotion. \n\nRest peacefully in meditation. Choose your paths with wisdom and take joy in the fufillment of the challenge that is your journey in this life.\n\n🙏 Namaste\n\nThis 👏🏽✨\n\nI feel bad for being a meat-eating yogi because it’s against the tenant of nonviolence.\n\nPerfect is the enemy of good\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo, the recent post was about people only being “in it” to practice asanas and not the other limbs.\n\nI agree. But also, in a world where we are mindful of appropriation, beer yoga is problematic lol\n\nThis is beautiful. Thank you for taking the time to share it.\n\nBut being judgy is human nature, so therefore not judging is not being true to thyself.\n\nIt should be critiqued though\n\n\nWhat has happened to Yoga as a whole is very sad. \n\nIt’s kinda like when People have the Aum or a Ganesh tattood on them. Or they wear a Ganesh work out shirt , or Aum.. incredibly disrespectful. \n\nI don’t think ppl should be judged. But critiqued?? Absolutely. We should not only be concerned with Yoga Asana but Yoga as a whole. If you actually respected Yoga and the people it came from  you would agree..\n\nUnderstand the difference between appropriating vs appreciation.\n\nso i cant have a ganesh tattoo? why\n\nFirst I’ll ask, Why would you want to ever get one ? That will help me explain the answer to you\n\nI like him as an icon. I like his mythology. But sure tell me why.\n\nIt’s important to understand that Ganesh is not an “icon” He is a GOD. It’s embedded in the daily life , and spiritual connection to Hindus not just mythological stories with pretty art. getting a tattoo of Ganesh or any depiction of their Gods on the body is frustrating to a lot of Indian people, I have talked to many about it during my YTT. I was fortunate to have a teacher that was from the states but respected Yoga for its truth . We spent a lot of time on the difference of appropriation and appreciation.\n\nOne of the elders in the group opened up and told us that they saw a girl with their sacred symbol on the backside of her yoga pants. it was hurtful as so many in the West just take surface level understandings of their religion and use it for their own. Then of course after one wears the yoga pants , they proceed to throw it in the hamper… that is also incredibly disrespectful to their religion and to Ganesh. \n\nPeople who actually worship him don’t get tattoos. They don’t believe in it. It’s bad form. This is coming from people who practice this religion. If they are saying this , it’s important to take note. \n\n\n\nI suggest creating and altar instead 🫶🏼\n\nAn icon is a god especially when there’s 10k choices. I almost hear you on the clothing thing especially about throwing them away. But I’m gonna do what I want to do just like i do in yoga. I’m gonna feel 0 guilt and not a single lick of cultural appropriation. You’re also implying that I’m somehow insulting the religion by saying mythology. If I was talking about Christianity or Islam in the same way I would say mythology as well. Don’t take this the wrong way but you would probably get along great with some of those gate keeping sticks in the mud and I would probably hold handstand just to irritate you for giggles. Do yoga. Be a good person. Don’t be judgy. That’s what I get from yoga. Hope I never meet you so I don’t have to hear about my Sanskrit and future Ganesha tattoo being super wrong.\n\nIf you want to disrespect ppls religion go ahead. Nobody is being judgy it’s about respect. You clearly are not from this culture but want to use it for your own understanding and cause. That’s not how it works… you can’t just take something and mold it to whatever you want. \n\nIt’s tacky , uneducated and completely foolish to galavant around doing whatever you want with something as sacred as this. But go ahead… this is exactly the problem Yoga culture faces. It’s ppl like you who don’t care  lol \n\nTake care!\n\nOh thought of another response during yoga. I think Ganesha probably would go with the Neil Gaiman set of rules and any acknowledgement and respect is good acknowledgement. But live your life of rules and what seems to be unpleasant disposition of control and enforcement. Please be a more open and accepting person.\n\nAgree. In the USA idk if this is really an issue tho\n\nSpot on. I don’t do handstand for others. I do it in the flow because that’s what my body and mind want me to do. To be fair sometimes I do hold it long because it really upsets a few of the tryhards that act like it’s some type of race or competition. The whole thing is a listen to yourself and generate power in a room together. If you don’t laugh or smile or cry during this practice at some point your not really in it. \n\nWhy would you want to purposely upset anyone?\n\nCause they are sticks in the mud and gate keepers of yoga. They get mad at me for helping someone with handstand instead of taking their 50$ workshop and they can’t even hold handstand. So yes. I do tickle the bull. My yoga. My way."

I’d love to eventually be able to do what you did in this video\n\nHappy to share 🙏🏽 It takes time, but it’s totally doable :)\n\nI appreciate your content so much.\n\nI've always struggled an insane amount with touching my toes, and I knew it was because my hamstrings were tight, but I've never been able to figure out how to stretch them.\n\nThis, though? This does it. I can feel them now.\n\nIt'll be a long time before I reach my goals, but I have a way forward now.\n\nThank you.\n\nYay! That makes me so happy 🙏🏽 \n\nMaking videos doesn’t come easy to me, but just knowing I can be a little helpful on someone’s journey makes it worth it ✨\n\nOh wow I have no idea how I got into r/yoga subreddit but this video was extremely helpful. I always thought I was somewhat flexible 'cos I can touch the ground behind my legs but this one is challenging and gives a great stretch.\n\nIt is such a great stretch! And r/yoga is a wonderful place if you wanna stick around 😊\n\nI'll join the sub for this. Hopefully I get to see more similar content ! :)\n\n[removed]\n\nAwww thank you 🙏🏽✨ You’ll get there with consistency and patience :) \n\nAlso, including some repetitions (lift hold 1-2 sec then lower) of three legged downdog and standing splits (you can use blocks under your hands) in your practice will make your floor front splits stronger/easier. But also make sure you don’t push your hamstrings too much and enjoy the process 😊\n\n[removed]\n\nThat should be alright. I’ve never used ankle weights but I know some people who do and seems like a good way to gain strength :)\n\nJust commenting here so I remember to come back to this!\n\nThis is awesome! helpful and inspiring\n\nThank you! I’m glad to know it’s helpful :)\n\nI LOVE this tutorial! I’m totally going to do this at my next yoga class!\n\nHope you enjoy 😊\n\nWhat's so amusing? lol\n\nAs someone doing teacher training right now I have enjoyed your videos.\n\nThank you 🙏🏽\n\nthank you for the heads up, never thought of it like that to focus the back out\n\nHope you enjoy exploring the pose this way :)\n\nGood video!\n\nThanks :)\n\nI have such had lower back pain from doing this incorrectly for so many years. I'm definitely going to start doing this now. I just watched your video three times.\n\nI’m sorry to hear that 🥲 I did that as well for yearssss into my practice! \n\nPracticing this way will protect your lowerback :)\n\nHoly cow! That was incredible!\n\nThanks :)\n\nThis is very cool, but I think with some pain on my lower back (perhaps exacerbated by tight hamstrings) I will never be able to “bring my forehead to my shins.” \n\nI say that last part jokingly, but would this technique be okay if you had lower back pain caused by previously a herniated disc?\n\nYou’re 100% in the pose even if forehead and shins don’t touch :) \n\nIt depends how long ago your injury happened and how well you’ve recovered. Entering with bent knees and straight back is the best way to protect your lower back, just make sure you’re careful at first, move slowly and observe the sensations and don’t push if you start feeling any pain around your lumbar area. \n\nI would recommend you also pay attention to strengthening your lower back and core as well to protect your back more and avoid injuries 🙂\n\nThanks so much! I tried it today a little bit and I felt less strain on my lower back.  Very cool! I’ll keep giving it a go to stretch these crusty rubber bands I have for hamstrings! Thanks again!\n\nThat’s awesome! Happy to hear that 😊🙏🏽\n\nThank you. I’ve been curving my back. Appreciate your guidance 🧘🏻‍♀️\nYou have a smooth voice.\n\nThank you 🙏🏽✨\n\nNeed to get to this. Thanks for post\n\nYou can do it! 😊\n\nReally helpful cues!\n\nHappy to know that 🙏🏽✨\n\nI’ve never had it explained this way before. Thank you. This just made it SO much easier\n\nYay that’s awesome! Happy to help :)\n\nThis was so helpful!\n\nthis was a helpful video as a yoga newbie—i integrated your cues and it made such a difference. thank you so much!\n\nAmazing V, thank you for the insight."

I’m working on my straddle press right now. If you want to start trying, elevating your feet (like with blocks) makes it easier — that’s the only way I can press up at the moment\n\nI came to say I like the laundry….\n\n😉 awesome job.  Beautiful straddle\n\nThank you! And lol. Let’s just say it adds character 🤣\n\nAmazing! So much strength!  How long have you been practicing yoga?\n\nThank you! I’ve been practicing for over a decade, but only started getting serious about inversions and arm balances about a year ago.\n\nI started yoga a year and half ago I still need wall for handstand. How did you progress so quickly?\n\nI can’t say for sure but I do have a background in weightlifting, so I already had a lot of strength coming into this journey. I also do drills and exercises that are specifically designed for building the body awareness and control necessary for inversions (I can elaborate if you want).\n\nBut above all, don’t compare yourself! I know it sounds cliche but we all have our strengths and weaknesses. For example, I suck at backbends and getting myself to do them is like pulling teeth. You can probably do lots of cool things that I can’t!\n\nGreat control! \n\nAlso, the reddest walls on earth.\n\nThank you! It’s my favorite color if you couldn’t tell 😂\n\nFantastic\n\nTruly amazing. Kudos to you.\n\nNice homie\n\nomg i’ve been working on this too, all the best to you\n\nThat looks amazing. What is that that you do there to protect your wrists?\n\nHi there! I always start and end my practices with wrist stretches and weighted wrist exercises to strengthen my forearms ❤️\n\nHow you move in slow motion?\n\nMagic 😎\n\n👏👏👏\n\nThank you! Love your posts 🫶🏻\n\nWow very nice 😊 goals of mine too. Have a great day.\n\nThank you! I believe in you! 🫶🏻\n\nThank you ❤️\n\nWhat resources do you use for yoga routines that get you here? I’m using downdog app which is great but it o oh ever goes as far as some arm balances. Nothing like this.\n\nHi there! If you ever want to switch apps, I’ve learned almost everything I know from Dice Iida-Klein on Yogaglo. Phenomenal teacher. But as far as free resources, there are tons of great YouTube videos on learning how to handstand! Some of my favorite channels are Kelsyogi, Katrina Razon, and Paul Twyman.\n\nAmazing thank you. It seems it’s around $30 a month for that app? I’m only paying around £8 a month for mine. I’ll give it a trial and see what I think though. Thank you\n\nYeah it’s a bit pricey 😔 They’ve been slowly increasing the cost over the years\n\nShri Yukteshwar on the wall 💚\n\nYes! 🙏🏻\n\nWhat kind of gloves are you wearing? I’m still working through wrist issues and hadn’t considered gloves\n\nYoga paws! 10/10 recommend. The funny thing is they’re designed just to keep you from slipping on the mat, but I’ve actually found that my wrists feel so much more stable when I practice with them vs without\n\nNeat! Thank you\n\nI hate you.. you are freaking awesome\n\nAwesome! I'm going back to yoga classes soon, not sure if I could still do head/handstands. This is inspiring 👏🏻\n\ngoals 👌🏻\n\nI always avoid laundry by doing yoga.\n\nAll the cool kids do 😉"

    "body": "I used to belong to a local, corporate yoga studio. I paid $99-$125 a month.  Covid killed it and a new studio started. $250 per month.  I.just.can't. A smaller studio nearby, $230 a month.  I could manage maybe $150, but after that, it's just too much.\n\nI'm a teacher myself. I work for a smaller studio but we don't offer a lot of variation. I miss the big classes, the energy, etc.  I learned SO much from those classes.  Yes.  I know there are classes online (yoga by adrienne, etc), and they're good. But I miss the energy and communal vibe.  I loved being a part of that collective.\n\nJust venting. **I understand teachers need to get paid.  I teach, too.  But it feels very exclusive when it's that out of reach for yoga!!!!\n\nAlso, Class pass is VERY bad for studios and teachers.  They get paid a fraction ",

    "all_comment_text": "I remember $7 classes - paid on the honor system in a brass box\n\nMy city has a studio that does basically “pay what you can” for classes.  If you want to reserve a space online it’s $10 minimum.  If you’re willing to wait until class starts you can literally pay $1.\n\nThe level of instruction and individual attention isn’t near what it is in a smaller studio where you pay more, but it is so nice to not feel like you’re going broke to go to glasses.\n\nMy closest yoga studio does this too but you can choose $15 for their “community” rate, $25 for standard rate, or $30 for “donation”\n\nThere’s a fellow school teacher where I work who does an after school yoga class on the honor system also. $5. It is a super chill beginners class but I just love it. It got me into yoga in the first place.\n\nI went to an amazing community class in Las Vegas when I was expecting - filled with new parents and expecting parents and toddlers - it was beautiful chaos and they had that kind of donation box.  If was so lovely at that time in my life.\n\nI teach at a community center and charge $67 for eight weeks of unlimited classes. We're out there, just running under the radar\n\ni miss life being affordable.\n\nedit: since i'm the top comment here i'll just add on that your local studio is struggling. they don't want to charge you so much. we're BARELY making ends meet, and we're charging $150/mo CAD for memberships. if we could be charging under $100, we most certainly would be. personally i wish we could be funded through canadian health care and people could be coming for free.\n\nMe too.  It sucks now\n\nI miss life being affordable as well…. 😫\nI know at the studio I go to, they do have discounts for First Responders.\n\nThis is why I’m committed to building new affordable towns.\n\nI completely understand your frustration. The sense of community and energy in in-person yoga classes is irreplaceable. It's tough when prices rise, but supporting local studios, even occasionally, helps keep that spirit alive. Hang in there!\n\nMoney supply inflation acts as a hidden tax because it reduces the purchasing power of existing currency holders. When new money is created and enters the economy, it dilutes the value of the existing money supply. Those who receive the newly created money first (such as banks, governments, or certain businesses) can spend it before prices increase. By the time the new money circulates to the rest of the economy, prices have typically risen, effectively reducing the value of the money held by everyone else. This transfer of value benefits early recipients at the expense of all other currency holders.\n\n$230 and $250?!? That’s a lot. May I ask where you are located? I’m in a high COL city, surprisingly yoga studios are very affordable at $120-150 a month, or $1200-2000 a year.\n\nWest coast.\n\nWhat area? I'm in Orange County, and the two small studios I go to are $105/mo and $149/mo for unlimited plans.\n\nI'm in a beach area of Los Angeles and unlimited is $189, can't imagine where OP is 😵‍💫\n\nI’m looking in my area and here’s what I got, $159-199. That’s in Thousand Oaks.\n\nIs DTLA too far? Boheme Yoga studio is a good one. I personally already pay for the gym so that’s where I go. Not the same experience as a yoga studio but it works.\n\nis it o-p-en by chance? i used to do their digital membership ($20 a month for unlimited livestreamed classes) and stopped bc i started going to CPY in person. i really miss that time (except for the covid part, just the digital yoga haha), and was curious what the in-person membership was. i checked the site and saw its about $35 for a single class (cpy is about the same) so i can't fathom what a membership costs there 😵‍💫\n\n i pay about $130 AND i do basic cleaning and 130 is still steep.\n\nI'm in the El Segundo / Manhattan Beach/Hermosa area. Check out Sol Seek.  It's like $150/mo but there are lots of promos that bring that to about $125. Owners and staff have a great vibe. Clientele culture/vibe is a work in progress but improving.\n\nGotta be either SF, Portland, or Seattle.\n\nThere would be riots if anyone in Portland tried to charge that much for yoga.\n\nDunno, CPY is almost to $200 monthly on their all access plan at all 3 Portland locations\n\n*almost $200 = $179 all access + parking fees\n\nYou’re paying parking fees? Where? Bridgeport has no parking fees. ::knock on wood::\n\nOr Vancouver! Toronto prices are out of control too.\n\nI just checked my studio in Toronto - $145 if you buy an annual pass, $160 for monthly, $30 for drop-in. Just checked the Parks and Rec classes and even they're $90-130 for less than 10 classes.\n\nNot a recreational activity for the minimum wage workers :-(\n\nThe only reason I can afford my studio in Toronto is because I’m on a 7 year old membership lol.\n\nI was thinking Salem.   \n\nI will say to check your local YMCA, they often have several yoga classes included in the membership.\n\nNope! Portland is 150-180max\n\nDefinitely not Seattle, the highest I have seen is 180 but on average about $150.\n\nSF isn’t near $250 / month for most studios. I see $180 as a pretty normal monthly price which is still hefty. I get great yoga classes through my climbing gym at $110 / month and then supplement with Pilates at a yoga studio once or twice a week at $20 / class\n\nBaptiste yoga in presidio is $120 / month and new mission yoga is $200 / month at the high end\n\nI’m in OC too and the studio where I teach is $108/ month for unlimited yoga. Amazing instruction and variety. Oh Yoga. Check them out if you’re in central OC\n\ni go to Oh Yoga and its only $108 unlimited membership no penalty at all for cancelling, even last minute. it’s so worth it\n\nHey can i have name of studio please?\n\nOH Yoga in Orange and Costa Mesa is the less expensive one (but it's so good) and Shaanti Yoga  in Mission Viejo is the more expensive one (which is also good and my main studio).\n\nThank you so much\n\nWhat area of Orange County are you in? I’m over in Buena Park and so far have been unable to find a more affordable studio :(\n\nI'm in South County, and all the studios are far from you unfortunately. OH Yoga in Orange and Costa Mesa is $105/mo and Shaanti in Mission Viejo is $149/mo. I live closer to Shaanti but would sign up for OH if it was closer.\n\nI live in Vancouver which has a notoriously high col and pay $150 monthly unlimited. It’s probably one of the best deals in the city but my studio is pretty awesome… I’d shop around OP. Even in an expensive city you should be able to find a studio for $200 or less unlimited classes. Good luck 💕\n\nOf which country?\n\nYep I’m in SF and it’s super expensive. So I use class pass and avoid the fancy studios even though I love them (corepower, hot8) and go to less popular studios for fewer credits. My plan is only $50/month and I can usually get 5 classes out of it.\n\nWas going to comment this advice - ClassPass is a gem if you do off-peak hour clssses at the right studios!\n\nSame in Colorado. It’s sickening\n\nI was going to say….i think I pay $1399 &amp; taxes/year 🇨🇦\n\nThat’s insanity. I’m in NYC and some classes are unreal in terms of cost. I found a small studio who charges $10 a class and it’s such a great place. It took some searching but definitely worth it.\nEdited to fix a typo on the pricing.\n\n[removed]\n\nHaha same 🤣\n\nRight?!? Now I’m rejoicing!\n\nI'm assuming outside of Manhattan and inner-Brooklyn? I haven't seen a studio in the city for under $30/class in a long time.\n\nIt’s in Manhattan! St. Mark’s Yoga and I actually made a typo with pricing… it’s $10 a class. I first learned about when searching on this sub.\n\nthat's the old yoga to the people building (closed due to the founders being terrible ppl). Cool to see someone else use the space though, it was very nice.\n\nThat's surprising. I looked at it quickly on Google and it actually looks pretty nice! The EV is kind of out of the way for me, but I may have to go and check it out.\n\nI really like it. I practice at home a lot but when I want a class in person they are my go-to.\n\nThere is also baby cobra in williamsburg that offers all classes by donation. their teachers are great.\n\nI'm in NYC too (bushwick), and the studio where I teach charges $150 for unlimited. There are more expensive studios out there in manhattan, for sure, but there are also places where you pay by donation that still exist.\n\nWhats the studio???\n\nSt. Marks Yoga\n\nIt does suck, I'm sorry you're experiencing it. I'm on the west coast too. Not all on the west coast are super pricey. I'm independent and teach in the parks for $15 a class and packages for 3/5/10 classes with discounts and yay people still don't want to go because so and so teaches in the park for free. \nThere is a struggle on both sides. A studio needs to make money to pay their staff and keep the lights and heat on and then there are the incredible students who literally make up the industry. Not to mention practicing the ethics and the eight limbs of yoga trying to make sure everyone has access to learning the practice in its entirety, not \"just\" the asanas or postures. \nSo location and \"competition\" can make a big difference. For example, my small city has approx 250 YA registered teachers and about six studios who allow teachers. You almost need a 500hr and a lot of followers to work in a studio here. So long story short, there may be some less expensive ones that may not be in a studio. I really hope you're able to find the community you are desiring. Many blessings!! 🌈\n\nHow do you find those types of situations?\n\nI advertise on Instagram, local community Spiritual practitioners websites and MeetUp. You can try some of those. I have also posted my business card in metaphysical shops. ❤️\n\nThank you!\n\nI cant stomach the idea of even paying $100/mo., but miss when drop ins were $12 and I would do drop ins. At $18+/class I wont even go. I can't be the only one.\n\nI’m on vacation at the beach at a very touristy area and decided to do a drop in class. $30 😳\n\nI paid $33 for a drop in in the Chicago suburbs. What the????\n\nI was in Switzerland earlier this year and they were $40-50 in Zurich lol\n\nthe studio in my small town increased the price to $30. when I told them it’s unaffordable and really makes it classist, they just said “we think our prices our very fair” and teachers need to be paid etc etc. ofc teachers should be paid fairly but… $30 is crazy to me\n\nI feel you!  I was in a mid cost of living area and my studio went from $100/mo. unlimited to $300/mo. so I just do yoga at home now.  I wonder how many other ppl dropped out when the price tripled.  It seems to me that a better business practice would have been a small one increases to maybe $125 or $150 and most ppl probably would’ve kept their memberships still.\n\nHonestly, that's insane. I don't pay $300 a month for Lifetime Fitness, which is a luxury gym with unlimited yoga, pilates, a full gym, Pickleball, 6 pools and a spa locker room. And, we're in Boston, which is always somewhere on those \"Most Expensive Cities\" lists.\n\nYeah I was gonna say, the Lifetimes around me are about $250 and that’s on the higher side of options. I’d say $150 is more average; I’m in the Twin Cities\n\nI think we are paying $450 but that's for 3 adults and a child. And, it includes free childcare while you're working out if you want it at the Kids Club.\n\nWow, I’ve been going to a Bouldering Project for about 7 years now and they just raised their monthly rate to $90 (lol). They do really good yoga classes with some options for advanced practice.\n\nTeach at a bigger studio. Then you’ll get free classes there.\n\nThe studio I go to has it so teachers that teach there can have unlimited yoga. They also have a program where, if you do one shift a week in the studio (just like a work shift), you have free, unlimited yoga….and they have an assisting program….where if you assist at a class a week you have free, unlimited yoga as well (you do have to talk the assisting training though).\n\nI taught at the most popular studio in my area of northern Virginia in the wealthiest county in America and teachers still paid $145 for the discounted unlimited membership\n\nWe had to raise prices earlier this year due to a lease renewal that bumped up the rent by 25% (from when it was last raised, three years ago). Our monthly membership is now $85, but - for as long as we can, we are ‘grandfathering’ students who had monthly memberships at $69 and $79 per month. Walk-ins are $18. Five classes $85 and ten $155.\n\nWe’re in a traditionally low cost midwestern city that has experienced significant growth and inflation since 2020. 14 instructors, 20 classes per week (soon to increase to 26), workshops on weekends and two 200 hour training groups per year. I have a few private clients and we have a few companies we travel to each week as well as volunteer work at a prison, a family shelter and a hospice and the occasional mindfulness session for nonprofits holding conventions, etc. I do not pay myself (and don’t want to) and the studio just about pays for itself. 2020 was ok because we got SBA loans that were forgiven. 2021 and 2022 were nightmares. 2023 broke even. So far 2024 has been better.\n\nMy gym has multiple yoga classes a day and the monthly fee is $65! I was not expecting some of the teachers to be so good (because it’s gym yoga) but I was pleasantly surprised\n\nME TOO! The best thing you can do is become a founding member at the next studio that opens somewhere close to you. I did that and scored $100 unlimited. It’s now over $200 since it’s in full swing. \n\nThe only reason I’m not giving up the membership is because it’s so cheap and clean. Friendly staff and cold eucalyptus towels always. Yoga classes themselves are subpar and I don’t feel challenged. The studio offers restore and a set sequence that never changes. Two powerful flows per week that are still not very powerful. I hate to critique so harshly because I know YTT is an expensive and I know creating a good sequence is hard.\n\nMeanwhile teachers are still being paid 25-40 per class\n\nI feel you, I’m sitting at $200 a month… there’s $7 classes at my community center but it’s the same flow every time and no mirrors.\n\nDefinitely not into same flow every time, but no mirrors is one of the things I love about one place I go, haha\n\nSame. To take it further- I prefer no mirrors, no music, no heat and that’s almost impossible to find where I live\n\nCouldn’t agree more. This is why my outdoor yoga in the park instructor could charge pretty much anything he wanted for that class and I would pay it. \n\nAfter a few years of a very minimal outdoor class that was supposed to be a temporary Covid thing that turned into the regulars favorite thing, most studios just don’t have what I’m looking for… Which is nothing…\n\nExactly this. I get it. Here in Melbourne, my partner and I started an accessibly priced yoga studio - we hire dance studios out by the hour, rather than having our own permanent space. Classes are pay as you feel on a sliding scale, starting from $15 AUD. However if someone can’t afford to pay, if they’re tight on money or lost their job, we just let them practice. 5% of our profits go to a charity in Northern India called CHIRAG. We host longer classes (75 &amp; 90 min) and have two teachers in the class to crate a safer space and provide more hands on adjustments. It’s less commercial and transactional, more human centered. We’ve got a lovely little community brewing. It’s called Shared Space, if you’re in Melbourne come and check it out - even if you’re not… feel free to follow our journey. Find us on Instagram @shared___space\n\nI miss yoga studios in general. So many of my local studios have closed since COVID 😪 it sucks that small businesses like yoga studios have really struggled to stay afloat. It’s a double edged sword when it comes to cost of classes/memberships. The studio I currently sub at has sent us a couple emails essentially saying they are barely making ends meet.\n\nI miss life being affordable\n\nI’m a yoga teacher and truly above all I wish monies were not a part of this beautiful life giving and sustaining practice. The reality is that studios and yoga teachers like all professions need to pay rent and eat too. If we could work daily for a decent wage to teach and share this beautiful practice with others would be samadi or heaven. The fact is yoga teachers are highly educated with additional costly training and education but the majority of us are literally scraping to get by day to day. Yoga teachers never go into this profession with money in their brain in my humble opinion; we do it because we are called from something deep inside us that can’t be extinguished. Yoga teachers in house are doing this because of a passion and love for the practice. To share this with others is our dharma. So when you attend a class whether in studio, gym, corporate or karma; please thank the teacher if they’ve done a decent job. We get paid little but rely on the personal reward of bettering someone’s life.\n\nI practice yoga at home. In my pajamas, silently and peacefully with zero outside influences\n\nAll i mean to say is that yoga can be affordable. Just rewire your thinking. Look inwards\n\nI think space can be a luxury for a lot of people (limitations in apartment/home size for example) but it’s always good to remember we create our practice where we can and there are ways to make it work\n\nnah, yoga has been expensive where I live since I was a kid. I had to go to community name-your-price sesh since I remember. Or maybe I was and stil am dirt poor.\n\nI have an annual membership (500/year) to my city’s rec centers. Once the membership fee is paid for the year, I can go to any rec center and take all the drop in classes I want. Today was body sculpt, core conditioning and yoga to finish it off. Best deal I’ve found yet and it’s nice to have such variety.\n\nat my studio prices have steadily risen, and teachers pay has consistently fallen. public classes used to be my bread and butter, but even with higher class prices it just doesn't work out any more\n\nThis is not new as many studios have struggled to make a go of it. It’s why so many corner yoga studios offer teacher training. They absolutely shouldn’t be, but it is a money maker.\n\nI feel this. I joined 24 hour fitness so I can do Yoga. The teachers are good they have different teachers that teach different levels. I paid the yearly plan $275. Even if I don’t go to the gym to workout the yoga has already paid it self. Rather than going to Core power  Yoga or any other Yoga studio. I can bring up to two friends with me to do the class with me.\n\nWe’ve kept ours at $120 but realistically we would need $175 but can’t take the risk of increasing. We have a huge space with relatively cheap rent. We have never recovered from the pandemic and our SBA loans should keep us afloat for another 2-3 yrs but after that who knows.\n\nPerhaps you could raise the rate to $175 and offer the $125 for a need-based membership.  I know that I'd probably pay the higher amount if I knew that it would ensure that the studio would be able to continue on... It's not like people think yoga teachers/studio owners are greedy!\n\nI had to join my YMCA/looks for community pay/honor system events. Not the best way to grow a practice, but after a baby I'm just enjoying the hour.\n\nCheck out where you live. I can find free/yoga under $10/week at least 3x a week. Always on weekend mornings.\n\nMy YMCA has daily yoga classes. Membership is $60/month for both of us because my husband is Military.\n\nIf you live in TX, most major cities now have a Black Swan Yoga — it’s donation based!! You can donate whatever amount you want (even $1). The original owner specifically wanted to make it affordable for people with little to no means when she opened the first one in Austin a little over a decade ago.\n\nIt kind of never was affordable imo\n\nI (M) joined the YMCA and practice yoga there. It works for me. I know some yoga instructors are doing yoga classes at fire stations nearby. Yes, fire stations and low cost. Just so people can stay healthy. \n\nI can PERHAPS see paying $$$ MAYBE if you were wanting some exclusivity reason .... the $dollars filter out some people. But that's just crazy (to me).  Maybe it's a \"who ya meet/who ya know\" club kind of thing. \n\nIn high cost areas, per square foot costs certainly factor in.\n\nYoga is a pretty good place to meet women. Allot better than a bar.  I don't think the women I would be interested in would want to spend crazy amounts of money to a studio. Just saying.\n\nWhat might concern me is how - over sufficiently long periods of time - costs REMAIN high. Collusion? A 'yoga mafia'? Something is going on in that case.\n\nYoga can be done at home for free.\n\nHard to motivate myself to do that though. Too many other distractions -\n\nHate landlords...\n\nFor real… I saw drop in’s for $34 a class at a yoga chain. No thanks. Gym yoga has been way better for vinyasa flow.\n\nOh god that’s so expensive!! \nI’m in a very small town in the UK so pay £40-£70 a month (depending on if I want 5 classes or 9) But before that I used to pay online for yoga with Tim he’s about $22 as I used to pay for a gym membership as well and couldn’t do both so not sure if that’s an option?\n\nI'm in Germany so I feel this is way different than US pricing but I just have lower standards because I don't want to pay much. I belong to a no frills studio where the classes are super basic but it gets me moving and is only 35 euros a month for one class a week.\n\nIs there a university with a rec center near you? They often have excellent group fitness classes, and the instructors have the needed certifications. That’s where I do spin, for about $120 for unlimited classes per fall/spring semester. It’s $60 unlimited in the summers. When I talk to students who are struggling financially, but are determined to only take classes at Orangetheory or something like that, I always remind them of the excellent rec center on campus.\n\nThat's one reason I've turned to online classes. I subscribe to Inner Dimension TV and it's only $100 per year. However, I know those who are new to yoga or have poor body awareness need in-person classes. When I was new, I took classes through the local Park and Rec Authority. Classes at government-run reccenters are usually much more affordable than yoga studio memberships.\n\nPerks of living in rural Ohio... $65/mo unlimited.\n\nHave been living in the same town 20 years. Used to be $5 drop-in and now it’s $60!!! And the caliber of the teacher is worse. I feel you.\n\nOnce teachers stopped doing manual adjustments I stopped paying for yoga classes. I can do a video for free with the same result.\n\nDoes anyone know what kind of margins studios pull in? Because I know yoga teachers ain't getting the lions share of those exorbitant class costs...\n\nIt's not that yoga classes cost that much, but that your dollar is worth a lot less.\n\nYoga by Adrienne on YouTube is where I first started. Now I use ClassPass. I try and visit studios that are more down to earth, community focused, etc. but I feel you\n\nI'm only aware of one studio in my city with what are reasonable rates for me.\n\nWho is that US$$? I pay AU$150 which is US$99\n\nI'm so blessed with being able to follow the yoga classes of my local gym which are actually good and complete.\n\nYeah I wanted to go as well but it was like $100 for 5 classes. Not even like 200$ a month\n\nWow, those prices are insane!! I just moved from a HCOL area where I paid $60/mo to a LCOL area where I can’t find a studio for less than $140/mo and I thought that was bad! When I first started my practice ~15 yrs ago I went to a local studio that offered $5 classes (later they became $10, but still very affordable) so I just really struggle with the mindset of paying so much.\n\nI turned one of the bedrooms in my house into a yoga room and added a TV for YT classes. No, it doesn’t have the feel of a live studio but I can hold my poses for as long as I want and it’s free. I added heaters in case I want warmth. I figure I’ll spring here and there for a live class if I feel the urge but I spent as much to update the room as I would on a month at a studio.\n\nI feel fortunate that I get unlimited yoga, pilates (both reformer and mat), unlimited gym classes and access to a fully equipped gym with swimming pool and sauna for £217 a month. This feels like a bargain to me because yoga memberships now are so expensive.\n\nMan $150-$200 a month feels kind of out of reach for me. But I guess it depends how often you go!\n\nOne of the hot studios I used to go to is $35 for a drop in.  Happily I moved to the country and pay less then $100 monthly\n\nNortheast Ohio here and there are a bazillion different studios and gyms in the area. 4 of them that are within 20 minutes walking distance from me.\n\nMy studio has levels starting at $100 up to $150 a month but is a nonprofit so it's also \"free if you need\". They ask for $12 donation per class if you're not a member. \n\nI pay $100 a month and attend 2 classes a week so it breaks down to $12.50 a class. So it's not terrible. \n\nOthers are $85 with a $20 drop in, $50 with a $14 drop in and $50 with $5 extra per class you take but that one is a gym and has Zumba, yoga etc. \n\nEverything is expensive and we are all feeling the burn. I wish yoga was part of my insurance plan (that I pay $800 a month for an only use a couple times a year!) but ya know 'merica and all that.\n\n.. And I'm paying $50 a month for unlimited (~6 different classes a day) in Sweden. Crazy\n\nLook for donation yoga in your city.\n\nA lot of yoga studios offer energy exchange, one of them being Modo Yoga. The time involvement is not overwhelming.\n\nMy teacher who was charging 12/class per hour is now private at 75/hr\n\nThere’s a reason I only do yoga at home. There’s no way I could ever afford a membership\n\nThats wild. Thats about my monthly invisalign payments.\n\nWhen I started practicing at the studio back in 2010 (in CT), I'm pretty sure I paid 100/month for unlimited and I pay the same now but I'm in Ohio where the cost of living is significantly cheaper\n\n That’s wild! I’ve never been a yoga studio goer I just don’t think I would cope with the ‘pressure’ to get the fanciest yoga clothes brands so I fit in. Now I have another reason not to try it .\n\nOh no no no, my clothes all come from the thrift store. My sports bras are from Walmart, they were a bit pricey but I'm well endowed so  that's always a challenge. I bought my Gaim mat from Amazon on prime day for $20 using a friends prime account. \n\nI don't think yoga is about keeping up with the jones' at least not for me. If someone thinks my outfit is not good enough then that's their issue to work through.\n\nSounds like you need to shop around. Are you in a large urban area on the West Coast? I've been a member at multiple different yoga studios in Seattle proper and never paid more than $125/month\n\nI pay $1200/year at my studio\n\nThat’s extortionate. Bastards \n\nThis might have already been mentioned, and I'm not sure people will scroll through all the responses to find this. But check your park district. They might have classes that are much more affordable.\n\nYouTube\n\nGeez! That’s crazy! Where do you live? The most expensive studio in my city is 140$ a month. Everything else ranges from like 90$-130$.\n\nFree great class: Yoga with a Master on YouTube Hatha 1 Swami Satchidananda has all the elements\n\nMy local studio has a variety of plans (SW of Chicago).  $130/month, but if you sign up and buy 6 months at once, it drops to $99/month.  If you buy/pre-pay a whole year it's $999.  However, it's for attending at 2 diffferent studios.\n\nDrop in is $19.  I buy 10 class paks at $160 since I do only like 2 classes a week, if that.  I travel occasionally for work and belong to the YMCA and have a weekly personal trainer.\n\nI'm really lucky. A local church has 3 classes a week at $3 per class or $25 for a 10 class voucher. The YMCA has lots of classes and is about $50 a month. These may not exactly be a studio experience but I have enjoyed them.\n\nMy library has free yoga twice a week. Maybe there's that\n\nCome join us in India! My *personal* yoga guru charges ₹1200 per class = $15. She works *only* with me in this class, focusing on every minute detail, and all of this is online. Check out Svadhyaya Yoga on Instagram. She is amazing - have been with her for nearly two years now\n\nLook up donation based yoga. I live in a very expensive city and I found a franchise that does this. Or you can do an unlimited membership for $99/mo. It’s called black swan it’s in a few states.\n\nIt sucks bc yoga instructors do not really always want to work for diddly squat or volunteer hours, it’s really not much different training/education/amount of work or effort than massage therapists - who make much more imo 😭 ppl got bills to pay especially studio owners who pay rent to hold classes in a designated location\n\nI’m paying $79.99/ month for unlimited. Midwest suburb of medium size city. Pilates seems really expensive to me, probably due to machine cost/limited space\n\n I’m in NY and in a high price area, and studios range from $100 to $150.\n\nWow, that's crazy. What do yoga studios offer? My climbing gym membership for $70/month also has several yoga classes a week, but I guess they have the benefit of scale\n\nThat’s crazy… the MoreYoga studio in London cost £39 for unlimited classes. Maybe there is something similar in the US?\n\nI blame third party platforms like Class Pass\n\nMine is 75/month. Where do you live?\n\nIn Salt Lake City, the average drop in rate is $20-25, and yes, like $200+ a month for unlimited. I ended up doing work exchange a studio in order to afford a membership. Don’t even get me started on pilates, it’s $30 a drop in and an unlimited pass doesn’t even exist in a lot of places, it’s like 25 classes a month for $250.\n\nYeah, I’ve been mostly practicing at home since covid. I just don’t want to pay $20-25 per class anymore. I used to belong to 2 studios but they both closed because of Covid (and I lost hundreds of dollars in prepaid classes.) I sometimes take the free yoga classes at my gym, but they’re not challenging. I used to spend thousands on yoga, now almost zero. I’d like to take classes at some of the new studios, but don’t want to spend the money. If they were $5-10 per class I would, but that’s unrealistic. Plus, practicing at home is convenient.\n\nI used to bike to a great studio just 5 mins away from my old apartment. They offered $5 hot yoga.  It was a small independent community space. Glad to have just found a confortable home routine.\n\nGo to the YMCA\n\nI knowwwww...Its soo costly these days.\n\nI highly recommend Peloton, they have great instructors. I have a bike and use it to do yoga and more :)\n\nMe too. I remember when hot yoga was 10 bucks. Now it's 25.\n\nHave you taken college courses? I took every yoga and Pilates class offered at the local junior college haha it was awesome and the teachers were great!\n\nI agree with you that it is classist and I think it stems from a misunderstanding of business. If these studios had affordable prices and good marketing they would be packed, but they lose a little business and then raise the prices rather than improving the value and communication because that takes skills but they write their own death sentence.\n\nI looked into opening a studio.  Pretty good deal on an old dance studio for sale here at the NJ shore.  My idea was to make enough to pay the mortgage alone and just make money on the propery appreciation.  When I crunched the numbers it didnt work.  The competition is insane, teacher trainings flood the market, there are 4 studios within walking distance.  Minimum wage here is now 15 per hour, so that drives up teacher salary demands.  And thats not even with me aiming at making a profit on the studio itself, I just wanted to break even with my bills in anticipation of flipping the property in a few years.\n\nGood luck to you but I’d like to see more people start studios with the intention of becoming part of the community rather than being focused on flipping a property\n\nI teach yoga for free to at risk kids, and prior to that, a recovery community.  Was just talking to an environmental org last night about a charity event.  I gotta eat though too.\n\nThat makes so much sense... I live in NJ (Essex) and the studio in my town charges $28 for drop ins. I get it, but I paid $10 in another HCOL city before COVID and the difference is hard to stomach. Gotta do some more research.\n\nDamn! I’m the opposite of you. I hated doing yoga as a group because others were so distracting and I despised the bright lights. I prefer doing yoga at home. It’s free, no loud people, no bright lights, nice soothing music, and in the comfort of my home. I do it right before bedtime. Love it!\n\nThis a result of the commercialization of yoga and the trendy female take on the yogi. Let’s face it most people doing yoga are only doing it because they think it’s a “work out”\n\nIs classpass available in your market? I have 20+ studios within 10 miles of me and have been able to go to 2 classes a week on the cheapest plan\n\ndefinitely think this is an ad with that username but i will admit classpass is a lifesaver\n\nDude I don’t know how to change my username and it pisses me off."

Quick, now do bird of paradise!\n\nI would rip my spine and hips apart, I fear lol\n\nYou're practically there, I would give a try next time! I was surprised the first time I tried it.\n\nNah, you're there! Don't worry about straightenging the bound/lifted leg(yet?ever?),  just go for standing up straight spine. You can even practice half bind to get the feel! Ok I don't really know if you are there, but If you haven't tried in a while, I bet you can do it once warmed up, if you want!\n\nEdited to add \"Maybe even in those pants!\"\n\nBird of paradice with the revolved bind???\n\nThis is awesome, great bind! \n\nThe killshots just make me think this is what the crossover of every dude subscribed to both /r/malefashionadvice and /r/yoga would look like lol.\n\nPeak yoga 🤝 fashion!\n\nI’ve recently learned that ankle socks are no longer fashion, though. Showing my age as a millennial, apparently.\n\nYeaahhhh well, Gen Z can pry my no-show socks out of my cold dead hands! I will forever think they look better than tall white tube socks, especially in summer! Give it 5-10 years, they'll come around. Still can't believe they're unironically wearing puka shell necklaces 😵\n\ni need to target my dating based on a ven diagram of guys in these subs\n\nI'm equally amazed for your flexibility and the fact those pants didn't rip.\n\nYes! More posts like this please. Less fart talk, instructor sucked, or some rant.\n\nThanks man!\n\nBonus points for doing it in khakis. Also thought I was the only one who hits some poses when the office is dead. Love it!\n\nI love this, lol. I can just imagine someone coming in to the office get something they left behind and seeing this.\n\nThis is literally me on my lunch break everyday. Yoga @ work gang unite!\n\nI saw this post yesterday, and today I was inspired to try this bind in my vinyasa class when it was offered! I’ve never tried before and I was able to get the bind on one side and reach my fingers together on the other! Thanks so much for the inspiration!! 👏👏\n\nWell done!!\n\nAmazing, hopefully your ok now, impressed, very impressed, however I can safely say I will never do that position, 😉\n\nNever say never!! This took me months of work.\n\nAmazing\n\nI don’t know what it is but I STRUGGLE with any binding poses. any tips?\n\nWhat is your issue with them? \n\nIn general, think about them as heart openers - focus on rolling your shoulders open and your shoulder blades together.\n\nSomething about the arm in front, I feel like I am struggling to reach it under the leg and wrap it.\n\nGot it - I think it’s a twist mobility thing, then. Focus on hooking your elbow on your knee and cranking the twist deeper, until you can get the outside of your knee onto your armpit\n\nOne thing I found really helpful was deepening backbends, opening the shoulders really helps in binds\n\nThank you so much, I have a pretty flexible back and love heart openers but I definitely know I can improve my upper back and shoulder mobility. I think I need to work on the rotation too. It’s so fun (or frustrating some days 😂) to get to know the body on this level and keep working on it!\n\nHehe sounds like you’re enjoying the journey and that’s the main thing!\n\nYou made me realize how hot it is to see a man do yoga. Thank you. 🥲\n\nHigh praise lol\n\nYour flexibility is admirable. Did you warm up with other poses before practicing this bind?\n\nYes - prayer twists in both chair and high crescent. Practicing hooking your elbow and cranking the twist until your elbow is on your knee and your thumbs are at your sternum. And any behind the back bind is secretly a heart opener so practicing rolling your shoulders back helps.\n\nNice!\n\nFriday afternoon, you must work for the government\n\nGet it 🙏🏼\n\nWhat does this pose do for the body besides twisting your spine? I'm curious\n\nGood question! It’s also a stretch for the outer hips, and any behind the back bind works as a heart opener. \n\nI think the main thing for these kinds of poses is the mental benefits - you need a solid mind-body connection to do them safely and to do the microadjustments to get in the right posture. Plus it looks cool!\n\nKillshot 2 are sick\n\nI thought this was Glen Powell. Well done 👍🏻\n\nImpressive\n\nThis is wow\n\nVery impressed! Nice form and great control👍🏻I salute you, Sir!\n\nI’m often the last person at the office so I should totally do this. I have space in my cube.\n\nRandom question, what shoes are those!?\n\nNike Killshots\n\ngreat！！\n\ngreat！！\n\ngreat！！\n\ngreat！！\n\nNeed more office yoga\n\nHope you get stuck like that one day.\n\nNothing better than some slacks you can practice in, eh?"

I was extremely shocked since it’s usually the complete opposite.\n\n6am classes generally skew male and older\n\nInteresting, yeah I noticed I was on the younger side also, (late 20s). I’m so used to the 6pm classes or mid morning classes where I’m the only male.\n\nWhat is the address\n\n“Asking for a friend”\n\n“The friend is me”\n\n😂\n\nSuspicious username\n\n😂\n\nCare to come to a yin class?\n\nHahahaha nice\n\nI have been practicing for about two years, and two days ago I had my first class with more men than women, it was for of us guys including the teacher and just one woman.\n\nI had to admit it felt special to me because I've become very used to being the sole guy ir one of the few amongst mostly women in class, which is fine of course but I do at times rue the fact that it seems to be more difficult for guys to find the interest.\n\nAnd it was also cool that the other two guys were on their first class ever, they seemed to enjoy it, and one of them was a 19 yo kid I met at the hostel who got interested after I talked to him about my experience, so it truly felt special for me.\n\nBroga!\n\nOh. Gxd. Mildly uncomfortable upvote \n\nThe contrast between this and my other hobbies (which would celebrate the opposite) is pretty funny.\n\nI'm in the same boat. While in college, I'd estimate probably 95% of the people in the classes were male (physics is unfortunately like that).\n\nI love that so much! I've also noticed more and more men in my yoga classes which is fantastic. I even finally got my husband to sign up for a class with me after 9 years of going to yoga myself!\n\nWhat did he think of it?\n\nThanks for asking! I think he enjoyed it and realized that it was more than just doing some stretches here and there. He kept telling me (jokingly) that he's not going to be into it as much as me but he'll go like once a month with me which I'm very happy with!  I go like 5 times a week and sometimes 2 classes in a row so I'm just a *little* obsessed! XD   \n  \nI think my studio does a good job at hosting beginner classes so its not as intimidating as going into a regular class and being totally lost.  That probably helped.\n\nI grew up in eastern India in the 90s. Most students in the yoga classes in my neighborhood were men.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIts has been more of a  Northern and Southern beef probably because the two coasts are not that far off. There is too much diversity among the peoples in each of the coasts to form one collective unit of beefing :)\n\ndude it's just so good for your lower back\n\nI’m a guy who loves yoga and who every once in a while feels out of place and judged in classes. Your post is uplifting. Thank you for that.\n\nI always used to be the only dude, also the younger one as I started at my teens. Sometimes there were older men, new age or hippies, but rarely. Now that i'm in my 30s I encouter more a more dudes, younger and my age.\n\nThis is positive. I think a ton of men skip yoga because they think it’s feminine.\n\nImpressive. Usually it's 90% women\n\nThat’s interesting.  Out of curiosity,  type of yoga was it?\n\nHot Vinyasa!\n\nThat’s really really unusual and kinda great. There are only a few guys in my classes, if any!!\n\nI love this! I have a class I teach on Thursday pm which is predominantly men &amp; I love it! Great to see more men getting into yoga &amp; lovely watching their progression! 🤝🏼\n\nUsually I am the only guy!!!\n\nFun! I’m a woman and I would find humor and excitement at being the only woman in class 😂\n\nomg! I have been to several yoga session and mostly are women! I am happy that more men are doing this too!\n\nWord is getting around.\n\nThis must be a US regional demographic thing because my classes were about 60/40 women/men ratio. \n\nAgree that we should try to eliminate any pre-conceived notions about genders and excercise/sport.\n\nI wanna go to that class!!! 🙂\n\nThat is great!  Where I practice I have never seen a man in class.  Only women.\n\nIt makes me so happy to see more and more men becoming yoga practitioners!! \n\nOn a side note, I went to a yoga class recently and sat beside a father and his new-to-yoga ~13yo son.  There are some little things in life that make me feel like things are alright ❤️\n\n[deleted]\n\nExcept Gomukhasana...personally speaking\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'll agree with that. But, I tell ya, nothin busts my balls quite like some good cow-legs!\n\nTry eagle. Double triple wrapped\n\nWeirdly enough I find eagle perfectly fine. Floor bow is what gets me the worst. Feels like I need to balance right on genitals. Sucks.\n\nLean forward onto the soft part of your belly\n\nI don’t know. Have you tried doing floor bow with male genitals?! Doesn’t feel so good now, does it?\n\nGets that pubic bone for us!\n\nG...G...Genitaliaaaa\n\nWas it a loud class?  All of the men, who I practice with in my classes, breath and grunt and groan so loud.  I love it though\n\n#🤨\n\nThey are so loud. They missed the part about yoga breathing. \n\nI don't mind men in class, but I don't set up next to them. Too odorific. 😄\n\nI always think it's cool when half of the class is  men, especially men of color. A full class of men would have me in awe. I'd think I ended up in the wrong class lol\n\nI have yet to meet men of no color. Oh wait, I know why I haven't.\n\nIn the yoga classes I go to, there’s actually a lot of guys and the ratio can even be &gt;50% male. \n\nI remember one time where it was almost all guys too (but there were at least 2-3 women and not just 1).\n\ntbh when i do yoga, i don't give a fuck about other practitioners' gender\n\nMy places we often are at least 50/50 or dudes outnumber girls sometimes. :)\n\nMan I love 6 minutes from NYC and can't even find a yoga class in town ☠️\n\nPeople in the U.S. tend to forget that yoga was originally created by men for men. The asanas (the postures practiced in yoga) are the third of 8 limbs of yoga. Through the practice of asanas, we develop the habit of discipline and the ability to concentrate, both of which are necessary for meditation.\n\nThank you for saying this- it’s important to know the history of the practice &amp; it is getting lost in the US\n\nI'm usually the only male in class (and almost always the oldest person) but last night it was almost 50-50 and even the instructor made a quip at the start of the class that it was almost evenly divided.  (And as someone that's been going for years... it does seem that the novelty wears off for a lot of guys and they don't keep up with their practice.)\n\n[deleted]\n\nConsider that you may be the sheep among the wolves, my dear.\n\ni wish\n\nI don’t know where you live, but most of the ladies that attend my classes carry guns.\n\n I’m in the deep South where most females won’t hesitate to defend themselves. Lol I will never forget the amount of men that asked me if I needed to be escorted to my car after class. 🙄\n\nThe Deep South… of a war zone?\n\nNo, there is no war happening in America. \nHow gross &amp; heartless of you to pretend like there is when there’s ACTUAL war going on in many other countries.\n\nYikes, I hope you aren’t carrying a gun. Maybe you do need to be escorted places though. Bless your heart\n\nYou hope I don’t exercise my legal rights? Where ya from bud? California?\n\nYes, I hope that you personally do not exercise these rights, for all of our peace of mind. (I’m from the Deep South though)\n\nSo, if someone attacks me and the small children I care for, you hope I don’t pull a gun on a potential kidnapper or someone who’d assault me?\n\nDon’t refer to women as sheep\n\nHow did they behave? I mean , if reddit has taught me anything ,it's that a woman alone in a room with men means constant harassment,  misogyny, and sexism toward the woman./s\n\nAwesome! I have a question. Do you feel safer without yoga pants? Or like, do you feel more worn down by the male gaze when you wear them?\n\nMen do anything to prevent real therapy, and following the instructions of a therapist IF they go.

    "all_comment_text": "Never thought of using a bolster to support the body, thanks!\n\nDefinitely try it! It helps give a nice solid base to press your upper arms into for more stability. Also, if there's an asana that's really hard for me, using a prop to help me get into it all allows me to have proprioception, and then getting into it without the prop is much more accessible. Now that I've done it with the bolster, I'm finding doing it without the bolster is easier! I'm not fully there yet but I'm getting there 😅.\n\nWow!!! You’re an INSPIRATION!!\n\nWe so often see people in the “perfect” pose, and don’t have the opportunity to see how much REPETITION and PRACTICE goes into getting there. Thanks for sharing!\n\nThank you! Omgosh I wish you could see all the falls! lol 😂.  I've got to admit, for a while there I'd come to terms with the fact that my \"legs were too long and I was too bottom heavy\" for this pose. It seemed completely out of reach. That's the funny thing with yoga. You start yoga and just touching your toes or doing triangle pose right seems really daunting, but then you practice and you show yourself that you can do it! All of a sudden your doubt in yourself fades away and your confidence boosts. Until you hit the next tough thing that you feel like you can never achieve. And we go through it all over again :). \n\nActually, here's some photos of me practicing in my living room ! You can see that I could barely get my knees off the ground even in a shorter pose (which makes it easier) and I'm unable to get my face off the ground even an inch 😂. There's also a picture of me laughing at myself after falling 😂\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/OzT6hAi\n\nThis may be a totally naive question but I’m legitimately wondering…why is this NSFW? This is clearly a skills video in reasonable workout attire for yoga and is not focusing on shown skin but a really impressive achievement of a skill.\n\nYou know I have zero clue why this got flagged not safe for work. I've posted on this Sub a few times and one other time I also got flagged while the rest I was wearing similar clothing and never got flagged so at this point who knows? If you're a moderator maybe you could help explain it to us?\n\nNot a moderator but sounds like it’s not consistent. Anyway…great job! This takes so much strength!\n\nBeautifully done, btw.\n\nGreat job, dude.\n\nThank you so much 🙏\n\nCongrats 👏🏼\n\nThank you! I've got to say, felt like I was pushing so hard to try to get into this pose for so long and then when I finally did it it's almost like you feel weightless. It's the strangest thing! Getting into this pose is the closest I've ever felt to flying and I  am addicted! I've been skydiving too and I have to say this is better 😍\n\nSo hard to get feet that high! Beautiful pose. Definitely one of the harder arm balances. I’ve been trying to work the transition from handstand down to mayurasana. Definitely unlocked a lot for me in this pose when I realized it’s a lot of back body strength, hamstrings, erectors, glutes to make it happen. I would focus on those muscles in the gym with weights to help get me there. Also, lying over a yoga block below the rib cage and allowing it to push into my stomach as I try to engage the core and push back on the block. I love the never ending  journey and countless variations to work towards in the asana practice.\n\nThe journey is incredible. I couldn't touch my toes less than 1.5 years ago. Incredibly grateful for my practice and teachers ❤️\n\nLooks grrrreat! 😍\n\nyay! i bet you are so happy. keep it up yogi!\n\nOk so I need a bolster!!!!\n\nGreat job!💓\n\nGreat job!\n\nVery nice! Congrats!\n\nGreat job!\n\nGreat job!\n\nVery nice! Congrats!\n\nVery nice! Congrats!\n\nGo girl!!!\n\nAwesome. I’m still struggling to do the little jump thing.\n\nWhat is the little jump thing?\n\nThis [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVbqL5yVdA&amp;pp=ygUReW9nYSBqdW1wIGZvcndhcmQ%3D) teaches it. It’s the jump from downward dog into the forward bend. I’m struggling to not look like I’m playing leap frog.\n\nSmart use of bolster. It looks good! My advice would be to make your feet much more energetic in their point. Really, really point the hell of them. When you do that, you’ll have a stronger line of energy throughout your legs and your whole body and the whole pose will be more integrated.\n\nYes! I will definitely work on that.\n\nIt took me a while to get fluent with. my feet in poses like this and it makes such a huge differece! I have no doubt you'll be there soon.\n\nvery nice! I've never tried this pose before. I just tried to but it will take a lot of practice. my forearms are too tight right now to do anything but rotate the arms that way.\n\nI know some people do this pose with their hands and arms in Chaturanga form but I was taught to do it this way.. maybe try the other way too? I'm not sure why one variation would be taught over the other or if one harder than the other  but if someone reading this is more experienced I'd love them to weigh in on the differences.\n\nWell, I think it's good for me to try it this way because my range of motion is really bad when it comes to rotating my arms in that direction.\n\nGood job!!!  I never thought about a bolster either. But I have never really used props. I only have an 80% success rate for this one.\n\nThank you! Totally suggest you try the bolster it is truly awesome. Props are incredible. I used to have an aversion to them but I realized it was my whole talking and now I use them all the time. 🙏\n\nThis is brilliant. I will get there one day.\n\nThank you and yes you will!!  🙏\n\nHey, this is very cool. Thanks for sharing. And i like what you said in a comment above about using props to aid your body’s proprioception. Props have been such a handy tool for me along my yoga journey, i am so grateful to always have their help when needed🙏🏻 \n\nQuestion for you, if i may- i have a real fear of face plants and it’s affecting my practice. How badly does it hurt? On a scale of 1-10? Idk why but i’m absolutely petrified of getting hurt and/or damaging my face lmao that’s sort of embarrassing to admit bc the latter is probably just my ego talking 🤷‍♀️ but anyway. Do you have any tips?  \n\nTLDR- I am able to be humble with prop use but not with balance poses due to fear. Seeking guidance for how to move through this. Thanks for reading and namaste\n\nHey! I think this is a totally normal fear. I remember even just learning bakasana when a teacher would kill me to lean forward it would really freak me out. Similar to inversions! In a lot of ways we're defying gravity and these poses so it makes perfect sense that our brain is telling us this might not be safe so please don't be embarrassed! \n\nthat being said, to answer your question, it doesn't hurt at all lol! You're so close with your chest to the floor that you're literally dropping a matter of inches to your chest. I've never hit my face but a lot of people will make a pillow puddle in front of them in case they're worried about that. I think the only time I ever felt even the slightest amount of pain from failing while practicing this pose was bumping my knee on the way down. So I'd say a one out of 10 :). My only real tip is try with the bolster. I think you'll find a lot more stability. That and make sure you do a lot of warming up before you get into it. I achieve this pose after a full class of core strengthening, wrist stretches, and back body strengthening poses. Hope this helps! And when you do achieve it please post it and tag me! I'd love to see it :)\n\nHi! Thank you for taking the time to reply.. and thank you for the encouragement! It’s funny, i do still feel the fear in bakasana.. it’s like, i know i “have” the pose.. my body is capable, but i just keep getting in my head about it. Bleh. I suppose i ought to thank my brain for the protection 😆 and honestly i think i will try to keep that in mind for my practice tomorrow. \n\nI love the “pillow puddle” concept, i might utilize that for bakasana next time… and definitely will be trying the bolster for mayurasana prep. Also appreciate your warm-up reminder. \n\nThank you again! This made my day. :)\n\nOh the bolster is so smart. My problem is I always feel like my elbows are so pointy and it hurts my gut to lean into the pose to get lift off.\n\nI also noticed that w/o the bolster if I wiggle my elbows down into my hip crease it feels better!\n\nVery cool good job! I’ve been playing with planches, I think I’ll give this a shot it translates well\n\nI often see people working on planches in the bodyweight fitness sub. Is there any difference between a planche and mayurasana? Do the feet go up as high?\n\nIt’s very similar with some minor differences around hand placement, like if you’re using bars. You could get some planches pretty swiftly I think, you’re strong\n\nWhy not use the scrunchie to put your hair up?\n\nNSFW?\n\nI did this the other day and immediately put my back out\n\nHey Suzie, at least you got carpal tunnel in a cooler way than just sitting at a computer all day\n\nThis is carpal tunnel prevention"

I do it at home though. Definitely not in a studio with other people, lol.\n\nBreastfeeding took me from an A cup to an F so 🥲\n\nThere's a curious lack of archery gear in our yoga studio.\n\nNext time I’m showing up topless, in a g string, but with my compound bow. It’s all about balance friends .\n\n\"My bow dares you to say anything about my state of dress.\"\n\nThe G string option is looking very attractive right now except I sweat a lot lol\n\nVery interesting to see this and then remembering how judgmental people are about what people wear to yoga.\n\n Just something about this makes me laugh if people from ancient times were not that judgemental of what woman are wearing why are they now I think India had a humid climate so that's why they used to wear lighter clothes \n\nLook up victorian influence on Indian women's clothing. It's astonishing how much of the now conservative dressing preferences can be attributed to the British influence on Indian culture over a century.\n\nthese paintings are from the 18th century though not ancient times. people judge women now because the clothing has been designed without yoga in mind. no yogi would intentionally wear tight synthetic clothing. plus the majority of the judgment is toward women who introduce a sexual aspect to yoga, which is seen as disrespectful seeing as yogis see the sexual desire as the greatest imprisonment of the mind.  the clothing is designed by men who want women to look sexy while doing yoga. let’s just admit it. if a yogi designed the clothing it would be loose and natural or they would say not to wear any at all. that’s why the clothing here is very minimal. unfortunately modern society cannot handle nudity without making it entirely sexual.\n\nWhat's sexual about a body? They didn't wear leggings and similar because they didn't have the technology. Loose natural fabrics aren't particularly conducive to stretching and movement, they just didn't have other options.\n\ni never said anything about the body being sexual. i said it’s the people making it sexual through their clothing which has been designed with sex in mind and worn to be sexually appealing. it has to do mainly with the intention of the people making the clothing and the person wearing it. a body on its own is just flesh and blood. \n\nas for tight clothing, absolutely not. in yoga it’s a very commonly accepted thing to not wear tight clothing and the ideal has always been to wear no clothing at all or just a loin cloth. this is because tight clothing restricts the subtle energies of the body. when someone advances in yoga they become aware of the finest and subtlest aspects of the body. an advanced yogi can even feel the way her organs operate. so tight clothing no matter how stretchy is not appreciated by yogis. least of which is plastic tight clothing. and you can look at yogis in india today, most of them wear loose cotton clothing if they are doing yoga in public. it works just fine. \n\nsexuality is a big part of life and so we cannot simply ignore it. traditionally men and women were separated in yoga classes so as to eliminate the issue entirely—so that only yoga can be focused on. but if you want to do some yogic sex then tantra is always available. but for all right handed paths kindly refrain from bringing it into the space as brahmacharya has always been an ideal for developing yogis. sexuality is the fundamental force of maya.\n\nWhich clothing has been designed with sex in mind? What does it matter to you what other people wear? If someone is more comfortable in tight clothing how does that affect you?  \n\n\nShould we go back to segregated classes? What about gay people? The thing is, people did things a certain way because society and technology was different. Because something is traditional it doesn't always mean it's better.\n\ni don’t think you’re listening to what i’m saying. i’m not saying that because something is traditional it is better. i have given very clear rationale why it’s better. if someone wants to wear tight clothing then all the power to them!! they may discover in time that it is a poor choice. all i have done is list a few reasons why they might not want to. principally: respect for brahmacharya, energy flow, and heightened sensitivity in higher yogic states dictating no clothing. i mean it’s very simple and obvious that no clothing is the best for yoga. not only have perfected yogis all throughout history been saying this, but it’s just plain obvious that a system of movement emphasizing least restriction of the muscles, ease of energy flow through the body, and alignment with the natural perfection of the body would have nakedness as its ideal costume followed closely by loose fitting natural fiber unstitched clothing. \n\npersonally i do think we should go back to segregated classes, but i can acknowledge that modern society is not fit for that. “classes” in general have never really existed in yogic culture. it was always a guru who was teaching usually a small amount of dedicated disciples. this way everyone feels comfortable wearing a loin cloth.\n\nedit: oh and the clothes i’m talking about are obviously tight fitting yoga pants that emphasize the butt and skimpy tops which show off the belly.\n\nI'm listening, I'm just not agreeing. You seem to think your points are obvious but none of it is clear or obvious to me. And if naked is not an option, I don't understand why as close to naked as possible is not the next best thing. If you think athletic wear is designed for sex that's on you, it's not.\n\nYeah I agree with Serious Escape here. Nobody can make a body be sexual through clothing. It's all in our mind. The sexuality is in our mind. The clothing make trigger our minds to interpret a body as sexual, but that's not the body's fault. It just is, it's an emotion, a judgement, we can just acknowledge it and let it pass.\n\ni never said anything was “the body’s fault.” we live in a mental world. that’s all any of it is. and what goes on in our minds is especially important in a system which seeks to break down the barriers of the mind. hence why yogis have always stressed that clothing which was created by impure minds must not be worn, and that yoga should not be done in a sexual way unless practicing tantra.\n\nwe’re talking about two things here so maybe that’s why you’re confused. the next best thing to nakedness is almost naked, yes. i already said that when i said the next best thing is to simply wear a loincloth. see, it feels like you weren’t listening. \n\nmy main point is that the clothing designed for modern “yoga” like yoga pants that hug and accentuate the butt and crop tops that show and accentuate the breasts and expose the bellybutton were designed by people who operate under the misogyny that sees women as sexual objects. it’s not about “sports” or yoga at all. tell me why women in sports have to show their cleavage or have form fitting clothing that hugs the butt. it makes no sense! but when you wear nothing, nothing in particular is being accentuated. so while the bellybutton, butt, and cleavage are showing, nothing is being highlighted in a sexual way. so the problem is only on the person looking unless the person doing yoga is specifically doing it in a sexual way, which is another problem for another day. \n\nbut here’s the other thing which i mentioned. modern society is not capable of looking at a woman’s body and not sexualizing it. women are sexualized everywhere you go. so real yogis who teach men and women at the same time know this and prescribe loose clothing that does not accentuate the body in a sexual way or as a sexual object. this is so there is no confusion in anyone’s mind: that yoga is not about sex. leave your sexuality at the door. the problem is that inevitably some people’s sexuality sneaks in… so measures have to be taken. \n\ni also mentioned that the ideal is that men and women practice yoga separately and in smaller groups so that women can wear “what they want” or so that the guru can prescribe the ideal costume which is nakedness or a loin cloth. the other problem is that there are no real gurus in the west, or hardly any at least. \n\nif you are not confused and disagree with any of this i suggest bringing up the specific point which you disagree with. or what exactly doesn’t seem true to you?\n\nShorty shorts FTW!!!!\n\nI figured there was no way they were wearing uncomfortable restrictive tops like today\n\nI want to do yoga topless casually\n\nYoginis in bikinis are coming down the stairs 🎶\n\nYoginis in bikinis are chasing teddy bears\n\nOh no, look what this post made my brain do to the bananas in pajamas song!\n\nAre they wearing them because that's the intended attire for the activity, or is that all the clothes they feel the need to own, in a very hot country?\n\nOr indeed had access to. Maybe they'd have preferred a sports bra with lycra if they had the option.\n\nBra or covering breasts weren't norm in indian subcontinent until the Victorian morals were enforced\n\nMy yoga teacher said one girl came and took her leggings off halfway into a hot yoga yoga class... At least she had underwear on. Maybe she was just more educated, and had previously seen these paintings.\n\n\nBut Im like, who tf wears underwear to yoga lmao.\n\nIs it not normal to wear underwear to yoga?!\n\n[deleted]\n\nMy vedic brother, you gotta get the running shorts with the mesh lining! Avoid the indecency charges AND the swamp-ass!\n\nAgree with the running shorts, but I’ve still occasionally had a “NYE Ball Drop”. Thank goodness the studio lights were very dim.\nEdit to add: Highly recommend [Soffe Shorts](https://www.soffe.com/product/M020/soffe-adult-original-ranger-panty.html). I love them for yoga, basic liner and ultimate mobility\n\nJust find the ones with compression shorts inside :)\n\n[deleted]\n\nWow really ?? Completely fair but I love my built in compressions haha\n\nIf you have thighs that are close together, the compression shorts end up pushing your balls up and into your dick, which then makes a nice imprint in your shorts once they're soaked in a hot yoga class.  No one signed up to see the exact location of any dude's mushroom.\n\nThis is not a \"hidey-ho-i-gotta-big-dick\" comment, it's just about what some built in underwear do to people with no ball room between their legs.  Regular undies are fine, there is just something about the built in ones, regardless of brand.\n\nCamando under leggings for women is a popular choice.  \n\nHuh, it has never occurred to me not to wear underwear to yoga classes. I just wear a cotton thong under yoga pants. I think I’d feel too exposed without them, lol. Also I always feel sort of…too damp when I don’t wear underwear in general haha\n\nI thought we were all commando tbh\n\nIdk why this is downvoted. I also just assume everyone is commando. I’m commando anytime I’m in leggings or at home.\n\nIt seems there are many yogis out there who were not ready to accept the underwear-less reality. Tsk tsk.\n\nThat’s hilarious! Must have been when Lululemon was labeling their underwear as yoga underwear! When they did that I had my own questions!\n\nMe 🙋‍♀️ I wear underwear to yoga. I wear underwear every time I leave the house. I can’t get my head around people that don’t wear underwear.\n\nI can't even wear jeans or slacks without wearing an undershirt tucked into them. Commando is not for me either.\n\nWell, I wear underwear under normal attire like jeans or sweatpants.\n\n\nBut, as a runner, swimmer, and cyclist... I do not wear underwear when I'm getting sweaty, as that is prone to causing chafing. When I'm wearing thick lulu leggings in a hot vinyasa, they are made with extra fabric in the pelvic region, that eliminates the need for underwear. I'm pretty sure the women's ones are like that too.\n\n\nLycra is very commando friendly! I love lycra.\n\nMe too, I just can't imagine the seams and stuff. Plus I like an extra layer to absorb sweat.\n\nLangot or g string underwear are traditional yoga attire\n\nIf you want to learn More about yoginis and their customs then you can go through this wiki article. \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogini\n\nI must find these shorts, all dhotis i can find are full length.\n\nReinhard Gammenthaler wears what seems to be a really simple loin cloth. As far as I understood, it is just a long piece of cloth (around 1.8 m long) that is just wrapped around in a certain way.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvnmdbg74fzd1.jpeg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eae958186dab513385c64aa0f296f9ea763822e2\n\nI was very interested in yoga (still am), so I made myself the same thing. It is still the most comfortable underwear I've come across.\n\nIt's called [langot ](https://images.app.goo.gl/1SKtZBz7xoAsNTzD7) \n\nYou can see it on third picture\n\nOr kaupinam, I know"

    "title": "My sacrum popped into place after five years… thanks yoga!",
    "body": "My sacrum has been misaligned for five years (at least). I had been doing hot yoga for a month, when one day after a Yin class, I sat down on the couch, stood up, and my sacrum and entire pelvis shifted and popped into alignment.\n\nIt was wild. What was even wilder was that my entire pelvic area felt loose and unsteady for two days afterward. And, the shift had apparently broken up a bunch of scar tissue and the muscles were inflamed so I could barely move for a week, it was so painful. Took a break from yoga, obviously.\n\nBut it’s been a hot minute and now I’m back in the saddle. And, holy cow the difference is amazing. My hips are able to open way more than they used to, and I’m actually *slowly* making progress towards achieving the birds of paradise pose. Also my sciatica is practically gone, which is a miracle.\n\nAnyone else have any crazy bone shifting due to yoga?",

    "all_comment_text": "Yes, good for you! Getting my lower back loosened up was life changing for me. I used to get that stiff back thing when I stood up from sitting a while, no more!\n\nOmg, how did you fix this? I've been struggling with this for a couple years now and NOTHING helps!\n\nI'm not sure how to describe it, I guess just lots of yoga. There was like 6 months or so I focused on my back, core strength and twisting. I had some old injuries in my back I worked on for a while and when they released my back felt great and I haven't had any pain.\n\nThis honestly gives me so much hope. I was beginning to think it was hopeless and I'd never feel better. I'm definitely going to up my yoga hours!\n\nMy physical therapist aligned my lower half, including my hips this month. I evidently had a sacral torsion and my doctors were just trying to medicate the pain away. She did in a week what my doctors have not been able to do in three years.\n\nThat's great! I tried physical therapy but they weren't very good and ended up causing one of my nerves to be pinched making it worse. Maybe I'll try that again with a different physical therapist\n\nWas it through manual manipulation or exercises or what? It's been a couple years and it's really killing my quality of life.\n\nVery gentle manual manipulation and thorough checking at joints (for lower half) and spinal column / vertebrae (for upper half of body). We did it over 3 different full sessions, going slow and gentle. \n\nShe is the 5 th PT I have seen in 5 years, but the only to actually check my alignment. Amazing how such a short targeted time and gentle movement, can make such a huge difference\n\nI wish I had known previously to ask for a pt who could check and fix alignment\n\nThis gives me tons of hope too! I’m a CNA and my lower back has been wrecked for a couple of years now due to my job. I go to the chiropractor and she’s said my right psoas is so tight it’s pulling one of my lower right ribs out of place and hitching the right side of my pelvis up about half an inch, so my left lower back is what’s in loads of pain, plus the right rib. Every time she sees me (weekly) she comments about how incredibly tight my left lower back is. She can realign it but the muscle tension just pulls things back out of place. I’m trying to get to PT for the issue too, but I really need to practice yoga again. I’ve heard that the psoas can tighten in response to trauma, and I’ve got a hefty history of severe child abuse I’m working through as well. I don’t expect miracles with yoga, but I’m hoping it’ll help!\n\nMake sure you are raising those beds up, even just to change sheets but especially to roll or change or slide patients. Don’t ever bend over. \n\nI know my psoas is tight, thats the muscle that seized up when the PT pinched a nerve. It's awful when that sucker just won't let go. My spinal erectors are also so tight. Every doctor, chiropractor, physical therapist, and massage therapist that touches them comments on it.\n\nTry poses/stretches that target your Quadratus Lumborum (QL) and extension poses.\n\nhttps://www.doyou.com/5-poses-to-stretch-your-quadratus-lumborum-34024/\n\nThank you!\n\nWow that is awesome, this is what I am hoping for soon for myself. \n\nMy hips and back have been so fucked my whole life because of trauma and I have done a bunch of trauma therapy and somatic work, so I feel progress with my patterns of chronic tension starting to change, especially around my pelvis and sacrum, and there are times in yoga where I can almost feel myself right on the cusp of what you’re experiencing but it hasn’t quite tipped over the edge yet, it kind of spooks me. \n\nI’m just waiting for the day I’m in pigeon and this finally happens and I let out a guttural grunt as an earth-shattering pop occurs lol. \n\nDo you happen to remember what yin poses you were doing earlier in the day before this happened? I’m curious what nudged your sacrum in the right direction.\n\nI wish I could say there was one pose that helped, but in actuality it was a multitude of different things. \n\nThe first thing I think helped was being in the hot room. I know people can injure themselves really easily in hot yoga because of the muscle relaxation, but I think it helped my chronically tight muscles finally begin to relax.\n\nAs for specific poses, pigeon is a good one for me. But I think the poses that are supported and last for long periods of time really made the biggest difference. Note, I had/have an anterior pelvic tilt, so your mileage with these may vary. Some of the most effective for me:\n\n- Supported glute bridge \n\n- Supported butterfly (with the block under my sacrum)\n\n- Supported frog pose \n\n- Child’s pose\n\n- Supine spinal twist with a block supporting my knee\n\n- Happy baby\n\nA lot of these poses I would do at home right after my hot class.\n\nThey’re kind of a combo between Yin and Restorative yoga poses. Yin is supposed to be active stretching, and Restorative is about relaxing  into poses for healing without any pain for long periods of time. But the poses definitely would cause me discomfort, but only in the area where it was supposed to. Supportive frog was my favorite and the most uncomfortable, my whole body could relax and I could just focus on my pelvis. I would hold these poses for a minimum of 10 minutes.\n\nWhat finally popped it was the simple act of going from sitting to standing. So if I were you, I wouldn’t actively try to pop anything, just focus on stretching and relaxing and your body will follow through.\n\nIf you are trying to get there with a good pop, make sure you have anti-inflammatories. I had to take a lot of ibuprofen, Tylenol, magnesium bath soaks, and ice packs just to somewhat function. That shit *hurt*. Hence, why I wouldn’t try to force it. I can’t imagine how much worse it would have been if I had tried to manually jerk something into place before it was ready.\n\nPutting a block under sacrum and doing butterfly/supta baddha konasana is such a good stretch!! Really stretches my hips and is a nice restorative backbend to boot. I was taught to do it while holding a strap around the ankles to help engage your shoulders\n\nI chuckled at your “guttural grunt” … I am also hoping for this!!\n\nHave you tried TRE (Trauma Release Exercise)? I also have a lot of pain caused by trauma, and felt a huge relief after my first session. My instructor, a longtime yoga teacher, has a lot of trauma from early-childhood as well as from being in the military, and his 12 year back pain disappeared after his 3rd TRE session.\n\nYup. Years after a back injury, I sat back into traditional child's pose and my hip went \"ca-thunk\" into place. \n\nOMG. I lept around like a gazelle afterwards. I moved so much more freely.\n\nNot as bad as yours sounds, but yeah, my hip was loose for a few days so I took things very slowly. It caught back up quickly and has been so wonderful since. \n\nSo glad for your improvement. Thank you for sharing.\n\nMy spine is fused T2-L2, when I go into extended childs pose, with my legs wide, after a few moments I can feel all the muscles relax around the hardware in my spine. A lot of \"popping\" its that \"good\" pain? You know where you feel a bunch of little air pockets are breaking down!? I dont know how to word it! But it finally lets everything that is so tight, just let loose!\n\nYesssssss. That’s the good stuff. My favorite is when that happens and you feel the pain sort of ease away and it’s surprising because you didn’t even realize you hurt. It’s like an extra little treat for my day.\n\nDid your misalignment cause one of your hips to be higher than the other? I've been dealing with pain since I was 12 due to this and wonder if this is my problem as well.\n\nYeah one hip was higher than the other, one was more forward than the other, and I had/have an anterior pelvic tilt in general.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt’s not nearly as twisted that’s for sure. I wouldn’t say my hips are 100% even though, my left SI joint had been injured and my right leg had been compensating for a looooong time, so I wouldn’t say I’m 100% healed. That kind of thing doesn’t get fixed overnight.\n\nThat being said it is *WAY* better than what it used to be, just still a work in progress.\n\nThis is my problem too, it causes one of my legs to be slightly shorter than the other which gives me knee and hip problems. I love yoga but am inconsistent with my practice. This gives me motivation to be more consistent!\n\nMaybe we should make a support group😂   everyone always makes fun of me for acting like an old lady when im only 24 but god dang it I threw my back out at 12 and it's never been the same!\n\nOne of my legs is half an inch shorter than the other, and my pelvis is regularly “at an angle and also slightly pushed out towards my back” as described to me by a chiropractor once. Left leg is shorter, right leg is longer, and my right sacrum is effed so to speak. Have had issues my whole life due to this misalignment. \n\nThe fact that i had a personal trauma related incident specifically involving my right side of my sacrum over a decade again doesn’t help issues, and i have had a bad back since my early twenties (I’m in my mid thirties now). Sometimes yoga can help pop my sacrum into place, but not always. I’m just used to always being in some level of pain lol. Right now it feels like a big ball of pressure about to pop but it hasn’t yet. But this  (the pressure ball) is also normal for me, so 🤷🏻‍♀️😅\n\nI finally found a great chiropractor in the town I moved to and he's the first one to actually explain to me what my back was doing! Once I get things settled I'll probably do a combination of chiropractic work and yoga to help it. After he adjusted me my left leg was so sore because I was finally splitting the weight between my legs rather than keeping most on my right.\n\nYoga will fix your shit, I am doing things I never thought possible with my body. It’s taught me I am worthy of loving my physical form, which is contrast to a hate that wanted to damn existence as a cruel joke. Yoga is the roadmap, life is the trip, if you do the work you’ll realize your goals.\n\nOo, lovely…delighted for you! Not as dramatic but yoga helped me release my TMJ (temporomandibular joint) after years of my jaw being stuck on one side. One fine day, in savasana, I yawned and was able to open my mouth wide for the first time in years and everything released, clicked into place and went back to normal. Such a sweet release!\n\nDid you any movement for that in particular? How did you manage to get to that?\n\ni have also noticed this and starting to think i’m not grinding/clenching my teeth when i sleep anymore. i assume it’s just from stress relief in general 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nNgl I thought it said scrotum which would have been much more impressive. Still, quite impressive.\n\nHaha yeah yoga snaps me back in place every time, after the session I always take a long hot shower and I can feel all my bones and joints click, clak and realign. It feels great. And also if I don't practice for a couple weeks it does not feel as good, so basically you work to maintain a great feeling.\n\nI'll have what she's having!  \n\n\nSeriously, good for you!\n\nI thought this said scrotum and was deeply upset\n\nMe too 😆\n\nTalk about bone shifting!\n\nMalasana is my go-to pose for hip / sacrum release.\n\nDefinitely didn’t read this as “sacrum” … but good for you 😁\n\nI have dreams of this for sure.  I’m very happy for you. I’ve been at it a very long time and I’m doing my best to overcome a decades old issue. I just keep trying to be a little better today than I was yesterday. Thanks for encouraging me too!\n\nI’m so jealous. 😭\n\nLove that for you!\n\nDuring and after pregnancy, I had some significant skeletal shifts, all in the hips, lumbar and sacrum. Right now, any time I do yogi squat, my humorous pops out of my pelvic bone and it is a major relief of tension within my inner pelvis. Both sides. I can also get a series of vertebral adjustments when I do forward folds, and it is sublime. I am able to get significant pops about twice per day, maybe three if I'm particularly stiff. I make sure to take breaks to decompress my spine when I'm feeling tense. Yoga is seriously life changing.\n\nWhen I first started going to Hot Yoga religiously my neck would pop out of the blue in certain poses and it was the best.\n\nOften. It’s my MO for spinal/ hip realignment. I’m being extremely patient with a severe back injury from 2018, but even that’s getting better to the point where I can believe in it’s trustworthiness again, that it won’t completely mess me up again \n\nWhat exactly popped?\n\nI had a severe shoulder issue that my orthopedic doctor called a shoulder impingement. I was in so much pain and discomfort I was losing sleep at night. I got a steroid shot and it didn’t help. I did one month of physical therapy and it helped a little bit. I started doing Yoga everyday and it pretty much went away. Yoga is pretty amazing!\n\nMy height on the passport when I was 20 says I’m 191 cm.\nIn my thirties it says 192cm\nIn my 35 it say 193cm.\n\nHaven’t check my height lately.\n\nI have had terrible pain in my low back/hip/buttock for years and years too. I got an inversion table last year and it shifted my low back/pelvis area the first time I used it. I have basically been fixed ever since. I would highly recommend looking into an inversion table to fix your back if it gets out of alignment again. It seriously saved me and I use it every now and then if I feel like a nerve is starting to get a little pinched. Never again will I live in debilitating pain like I did before.\n\nI’m in PT now and finding that in addition to my anterior tilt my hips are misaligned and I’m compensating in one side of my body. I just started having hip pain within the last few years (following pregnancy). I would love some tips of things to add into my yoga routine!\n\nI went to a yoga retreat for 10 days years ago and at the end of the retreat my back was completely pain-free - for the first time in years. The pain slowly returned when I went back to the office, but damn the feeling was amazing!\n\nMaybe not my sacrum but the lower lumbar popped once when doing yoga and ive been looking for that kind of relief ever since hahahaha. I didn’t even know it needed it\n\nDid anyone else read this quickly and think it said scrotum? 😆 Whoops. \nGlad to hear about the sciatica disappearance! "

But I was also preparing for entry into fallen angel.\n\nit's by no means a problem or \"wrong\" to do it, but it's super helpful to be aware that it's happening in the first place. i was oblivious for years.\n\nJust looks like you need to breath\n\nouch for your neck.\n\nLeaning Jowler!!\n\nI get this reference!\n\nAttempting that jump back would've broken my big toe! Well done.\n\nI broke my big toe last year 🤡 not doing this jumpback but from a different transition lol\n\nVery cool, I've only seen this done once before.\n\nWow, well done. I can’t even do a regular crow. I suck!\n\nHEY! None of that negativity here! You don’t suck! Everyone is on their own journey with yoga and it’s not a competition. I believe in you that you can get your crow one day :)\n\nAbsolute unit\n\n🔥🔥🔥\n\nlol no.

Did you attend local classes? \nI’m so confused about where to start that feels systematic… following different YouTube video doesn’t feel systematic I think\n\nI go to quite a few classes a week and also try to go to workshops as well. It definitely helps to go to in person classes where you can get individualized feedback from instructors.\n\nGood\n\nnice. you don't need to double twist for side crow. try planting your hands in line with your feet to the side.\n\ni've played with that entry before and it just doesnt work for me. toe stand is still my preferred way to get into side crow, and even then it's pretty hit or miss. some days i have a pretty strong side crow hold and then other days it's like i can't even connect the arm and leg haha.\n\nMakes sense. It’s a hard pose. Worst injury I ever got was an oblique strain from doing it."

    "all_comment_text": "Yoga, like with all physical activities, it’s like investment of energy with return in the future.\n\nFirst you need to invest energy. After some time - you have more energy back.\n\nIf you are low with energy, because life drained it all, there is nothing left to invest.\n\nBut once you are in your routine, you have more energy so there is no problem to overcome the resistance - you have energy to invest.\n\nThat’s my view, maybe it’s helpful for your situation.\n\nSeconded. I've read people procrastinate when they view the energy required for the task as being greater than their energy levels. Usually this is perceived energy cost as actually doing it isn't as hard as we think\n\nSame goes for times of stress. We perceive the energy requirements of tasks as higher than usual while having lower than usual energy levels\n\nneeded to see this!!\n\nSpot on.\n\nthis is such an amazing take and makes so much sense that it just clicked something new in my brain. thank you for this!!!\n\nDid the same thing for me ❤️\n\nBeautufully said. I mentioned, when I had the least energy to put in, I felt the best emotionally and physically after the class. I was in my best shape because I added yoga when it was hard, like I was crawling to the class, but after the class I was flying.\n\nI love to tell people \"I don't want to go yoga, I want to have gone to yoga\"\n\nFor me is that I don’t want to think about going or even being on my way, but the second I get there I’m fine. Despite knowing this, I still convince myself not to go\n\nThat's it !\n\nlol I was debating whether or not to go today but I guess this is my sign to go\n\nOften when I feel exhausted and don’t feel like going if I force myself I feel so much better. Occasionally I have a shit class but that could be on a good day. The body is a weird thing.\n\nYeah!\n\nEvolutionary biologists say the body is designed to be lazy. They say the body is still afraid you'll encounter harvest failure or famine or drought or some other disaster. This is what makes sitting on the sofa too addictive. So don't beat yourself up. Work with it.  Obviously we know better now after 10,000 years of civilization we've nailed most threats. But respect you're body and thank it for its concern and care looking after you. \n\nA way to deal is to tie the yoga to something pleasurable. For example get a beautiful yoga mat. Or make a friend a yoga buddy committing to do yoga same time even different places and check in after.\n\n[removed]\n\nThis is brilliant. Saved for a day when I'll need it (likely tomorrow morning!).\n\nWow I love this. I almost always feel better afterwards but it gets ugly in the middle sometimes\n\nI am the same way. Completely normal. 15 year practice here. First 10 years studio 2x a week. Pandemic came studios ckosed and I didn't do any even though free on YouTube. Argh! Why no home practice? Then it occurred to me that I was used to doing 90 min hatha or 60 min vinyasa in studio but what if I didn't subscribe to that format? I was still going to the gym and running so my thought was any exercise is good ex but I needed yoga. So I started looking for other formats. 10 min. 20 min. Fine just do something. Then I found Travis Eliot Power Yoga and started doing it at home religiously bc I liked his philosophy. And the I found Somatic and fell in love with that. So my suggestion is try different formats and time lengths and through a diversity of instruction you might be more consistent. The psychology of being able to do a 9 min one day and a 30 min the next worked for me. Bc who doesn't have 9 minutes?\n\nFor me when I'm at home I think of all the stuff I \"should\" be doing but in the studio it's practically free of distraction\n\nI’ve never heard of Somatic yoga but I like Travis Elliot. Should I go down this rabbit hole?\n\nHaha. I like Body Illuminations Yoga &amp; Pilates w Rebeka (YouTube). Somatic is great for recovery.\n\nIt’s human nature to resist discomfort, it’s literally written into our DNA as a way to prevent bad things happening to us. The way I overcame this, was making my physical activity habitual and completely non-negotiable, as much as going to work or brushing my teeth. I don’t think twice any more, I just do.\n\nSame. Made it such a non negotiable that I actually forgot it is an option to not go to the gym lol\n\nThat’s so funny and exactly what I mean. Like you wouldn’t think twice about brushing your teeth in the morning, it just becomes second nature. I write this from my very quiet gym this morning!\n\nOne time my roommate was like “Oh why don’t you just not go?” and I was like “Wait.. I genuinely forgot you could do that.”\n\nmy teacher always says, \"the hardest part is making it to the mat\" :)\n\nReframe your expectations of yoga: instead of ‘I’m motivated therefore I’ll go to yoga’\nTry ‘I’ll go to yoga and then I’ll feel motivated’\nAction usually precedes motivation.\n\nA wise person once told me: everything that you want is on the other side of something that you don’t want\n\nI like that because it reminds me that good things are after a struggle but I also have to focus on the journey and the journey is not always easy.\n\nI'm the same. I like to do yoga in the mornings to warm up my body for movement. And I really just dont feel like doing it first thing in the morning. I want to eat breakfast, and then I really don't want to do yoga after eating! But on the days I decide to do yoga I feel so much better and happy that I did it. And I think to myself also, why is it so hard to just do it? It's only 20 minutes and it's done!\n\nA spoon full of honey gives me the energy I need to yoga without the downsides of a full stomach\n\nHi. You don't resist you put it on the shelf in your mind called yoga instead if putting your mind in the box called yoga.  Turn it around live in yoga every move you make, every breath you take let it live in you. Not on the shelf.\n\nFor me yoga is a way of life that develops with you. It is not just doing sets of poses in sequence, it is a mind set. Conciously  observing how you respond and react to external challenge We are all unique and therefore react in different ways. Your journey is yours alone. So far mine has been both enjoyable and far reaching and developijg in ways I could never have imagined. Enjoy your journey\n\n🙏 Namaste\n\nEdit:\n\nPS: I don't go to classes I practice where I happen to be🙂\n\nMe. Too. Here are some of my \"issues\" that I'm totally open to being argued. I can't leave my mat out because my cats scratch it. So that's a tiny but real barrier. I used to just go to my rug but my joints are too old for that now. \n\nIt doesn't help with stress once I'm done. Because I have 2 super challenging kids. If they are home it's almost guaranteed I'll get interrupted. If not interrupted, they will stress me out working 10 minutes of ending. \n\nBoth of these are ridiculous reasons to not yoga.\n\nwell \"ridiculous\" to some -- but in the real world these are very valid reasons!\n\nThank you\n\nI found some “yoga knee pads” that you can slap down anywhere (or maybe the kittie would leave alone?) and they’ve helped a lot with my motivation\n\nOh dang! Looking that up right now! Thank you! Now if you could fix the arthritis in my thumb I'd be all set lol\n\nI feel the same way about a walk or bike ride outside, even practicing spirituality in general sometimes. Perhaps I should limit my phone and tv when I have downtime…\n\nStarting things is hard. It's that same transition spook we have as kids. It's the same with getting in the shower, going for a walk, doing chores, starting that painting you've been wanting to do. Actually starting is the hardest part, and it can be the hardest part every time because transitioning is a skill we build over an entire lifetime.\n\nThank you for this post. I just went through this today where I was so stressed out and I literally walked around the block where my yoga studio was instead of going in debating if I should just go home and then with like 5 minutes until class I finally went in. Of course it was awesome and I feel so much better after.\n\nI was thinking that I must be a crazy person lol\n\nI have the same issue, but I have found it helpful to attach my reasons for doing yoga (or any other activity I truly enjoy) to my values. It has to be a first priority. I've been great about keeping on track with meditation and yoga since Sept but this weekend we have company staying at our house and it won't happen and I'm afraid I'll be off the wagon by Monday again. Trying to set the intention ahead of time that no matter what the weekend brings, I'll go hiking Sunday to reset and wake up Monday ready to go back to my routine.\n\nPeople with a history of trauma deny themselves things they enjoy and partake in destructive behavior/activities. It is a way to punish oneself for the acts done to him enabling him to maintain an image of innocence of his Perpetrator, and to self-reinforce the Abuse.\n\nthis is fascinating -- thanks for sharing this.\n\nYou are very welcome.\n\nI’ve come to realize that it’s a form of self-harm.\n\nWow! Do you know how we could get out of this mess? Looking for practical steps because therapy wasn’t helpful.\n\nI am a survivor of childhood sexual and psychological abuse with a severe dissociative disorder. It took 15 years of therapy for me to develop the tools I needed to overcome the things that happened to me. Ashtanga Yoga was an important component of my journey. The fixed series bring a sorely needed sense of consistency and control to practice. The self led practice can be done in the safety and privacy of your home. Here is a [Wonderful Introductory Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHexi-x3sqw) by long time practitioner and Teacher David Swenson. Wishing you Peace ~AIC\n\nI’m sorry that happened to you! But I’m glad therapy and yoga were helpful. I will definitely check out the practice you suggested. ❤️\n\nThe yearly cycle brings many changes.  When changes complicate life, we have to work to weather the storm.  Keeping a diary for a few years, you will gain insight into your patterns.  Preparation for them will help you get through them more easily.   I am a teacher, so every September, January and Summer I have to prepare for and navigate a great deal of change.  My yoga practice changes every year.  My goal is always consistency, but reality comes and I have to modify, regroup and carry on.\n\nIt's because you are stuck with the idea that you want to do what you want when you want to. \n\nPhysical activity isn't something that you want to do. It's an obligation that needs to be done every day no matter the circumstances. How willing are you, in general, to accept new obligations? \n\nOf course you feel better but in order for you to feel better, you lose a little bit of your own free will.\n\nIt seems like everyone has the same issue. Me too. I found a yoga teacher who figured it out, though, so I have some theory about how to resolve the issue, even if I haven't managed to perfect it in practice. \n\nYoga does make us feel amazing. If done well, it puts us in a state of sattva, primed for growth and insight. The trouble is, if we only we only work on that during formal yoga sessions, it sometimes feels like too much of a struggle to get back there. That's why yama and niyama are taught before āsana. The yamas help us avoid throwing away large amounts of energy. The niyamas help us to build energy. Staying mindful of the yamas and niyamas throughout daily life can therefore help us to be better ready for sessions of āsana and meditation. It's less of a struggle to get into that lovely state, because we're already a bit closer to it thanks to the yamas and niyamas. \n\nThat's the theory, anyway. In practice, well, it's a practice, it doesn't always go perfectly. That's why we call ourselves sādhakas, yoga practitioners, not yogis and yoginīs! We're still in training.\n\nI know, in my situation, I’m gonna get my bitt handed to me.   I get nervous before most classes.  But once I start, I’m fine.  \n\nSays every Vata Dosha type everywhere! 🤷‍♀️ I struggle with the same issue!\n\nHahaha. Wait. Lol\n\nI find that making mini-routines for *starting* and *ending* activities helps me a lot. As little as \"first, I stand up\". Similar to how transitions between yoga poses are as important as the poses themselves.\n\nI struggle with things like knowing how long it takes me to get ready to go somewhere so focusing on the small steps between \"get up\" and \"actually in the car, driving\" has been helpful. This could be useful for doing yoga at home. Also, maybe you need some more active movement before yoga, like a 5 min walk around the block. I prefer doing it at home after other exercize. \n\nTry to identify what your body and mind need to *want* yoga.\n\nME TOO!!! I know why ;  personally…..I have so much  that I am afraid to let go of…. It’s a mind fuck.   I just gotta do my  yoga &amp; breathe through it all and release the damage!  In theory it’s beautiful;  in action it’s really challenging &amp; not everyone s’  journey is meant to align.   Yoga does heal.   🪭🪷🪃\n\nOP thank you for this post. \n\nIt’s the best thing on the internet. \nThese answers are priceless and I think so far all make sense, so fascinating. I love this validation, too!\n\nDo you also feel amazing during yoga? Or just after and in between?\n\nFor myself, I usually do but I am subject to this syndrome as well of not making it to the mat!\n\nIf I had to ‘go’ to yoga I probably never would. I practice at home so it’s easy to roll out my mat, put on a video and just do it.\n\nI feel great after yoga but can’t make it a habit.\n\nI go through that too! It’s the transition not actually the workout itself.\n\nI started practicing yoga 3 years ago with an old dvd from P90X. I love practicing at home, it gives me the freedom to do it whenever I want and for how long I want with no distractions.\n\nSame, saaame! I dread it every time.\n\nBecause feeling amazing all the time isn't your priority.\n\nOne of those things where you have to decide and do. And remind your self you will never regret jt\n\nIm the say way I had a pinched nerve on my left side so when my body gets tight the pain comes back alittle in my neck but I absolutely hate yoga working on doing better.\n\nBecause you don't feel good until AFTER you do it and doing it is hard.\n\nYour brain is keeping you safe and doesn’t want you to make changes. Those are the most important times to do it for the brain to show you want to change\n\nADHD? For the last 3 years I've taken the whole winter off like, November to March, the first year I had a bad knee injury so OK, but why the last two years.  Grr. This year has been my best yoga year by far and I'm determined that it's not going to happen again.\n\ninteresting -- thanks for sharing this perspective.\n\nSelf deprecation, self handicapping, shooting yourself in the foot. These are all phrases for sabotaging yourself. It’s a way where you can subconsciously excuse some of your behaviors later on.\n\nUgh! 🧘‍♂️ thank you.\n\nLike anything we put off, we don’t see the immediate value. Like any exercise, we don’t see the immediate  results. Yes you feel great right after but that feeling soon fades away. Could be we resist because we feel that discomfort doing it. We often make excuses, to do something that is far easier.\n\nThank you all for the post and comments! One of the best I ever read here. Very helpful\n\nWhat app do you use?\n\nMe too 🥹🥲🙃\n\nI say this every single time!! Every time I do it, I tell myself “I LOVE how I feel. I need to do this more!” Every time.\n\nHahaha. I always say going to the gym takes more an effort than working out.\n\nI personally procrastinate doing yoga when I feel I don’t ’deserve it’. Because it makes me feel good I view it as a ‘reward’ and have to make myself earn it by doing ‘actual work’. Which is so distinctly American evangelical carryover into our American work culture. \n\nAlso sometimes I get depressed and feel like doing yoga ‘won’t actually help’ and if it doesn’t.. then what? What if I can’t feel better? But ironically I have my most transformative sessions when I start with this feeling. \n\nJust my perspective. Hope it helps\n\nDoing yoga is the only thing about yoga I don’t like. You might also feel like you need to be good at it or have some expectations around it which I do myself. \n\nIn my limited experience since I’m extremely new to it, yoga is like life. The more I try to do it perfect and control every aspect of it , the worse it gets. The minute I let go and just put one foot in front of the other and breathe, it becomes a different practice all together.\n\nOn the day I said “I do” I started letting her win!…. “my heart” every time.\n\nI must be really lucky. Most of the time I look forward to going to yoga."

Love it 🩷\n\nI went to class today and tried what you did here… how the hell??? lol very impressive\n\nThis is not something you learn at the first attempt 😅\n\nEvery time you went deeper in your back bend I was like no way she's gonna touch her foot.\n\nBut ya fuckin did it. Insane.\n\nThank you :) It’s so much fun!\n\nWow!! I can only dream of having this level of flexibility in my shoulders. What stretches were most effective in helping you achieve this?\n\nRegular shoulder flossing (with a strap or a belt) was a game changer for my tight shoulders! Also puppy, extended puppy and puppy with the wall (basically all puppy pose variations) are a must for me before deep backbends like this 👌🏽\n\nI always take the time to prepare my shoulders because it’s the stiffest part of my body! Good luck :)\n\nCan you describe what shoulder flossing is? Thanks!\n\nKitty!\n\n🐱\n\nThank you for the time you take to explain how different poses should look and more importantly how to move my body into the pose the correct way.  That’s the practice of yoga that doesn’t happen in the studio.  Thank you it truly makes a difference and I hope you’ll do more sharing.\n\nOne of my favourite poses for the last year or so.  I think everyone should practice this regularly.  No need to bend back until your ready.  Focus on your hip flexor.  Great for athletes too.\n\nI agree! Anjaneyasana is so great, best hip flexor stretch! And there’s many ways to modify, you can also access a gentle backbend grabbing onto the knee interlacing the hands or using blocks on both sides for support :)\n\nGOALSSSSS \n\nhow long have you been practicing ?\n\n12 years :)\n\ni'm going to dub some spooky music and post this on r/aliens\n\nLove that 👽\n\nWe salute your Divinity 🙌🌀🧬💎🙏\n\n🙏🏽✨\n\nWoah thats a nice ass door\n\nRight! That’s why I locked myself out of the house to film this 😅\n\nGoals!\n\nYou got this!\n\nwow. hope I can work up to this someday\n\nThis is hard and takes time but it’s totally possible! \n\nPractice with consistency, love and no expectations and just see what happens :) Whether you’re able to catch your ankle or not, your body will surprise you with awesome things.\n\nMy back and shoulders are always stiff, so they are some of the weaker points in my practice. Any poses I should incorporate into my flow to buildup to this? \n\nAmazing stretch &amp; the cat!!!\n\nthis is impressive, i love it!\n\nThank you :)\n\nMy back felt better just watching you do that!\n\nBackbend bliss :)\n\nHow long did it take you to do that?\n\nwow this is amazing! 😻\n\nThanks 😊\n\nWhoaa I can feel the stretch from here LOL you are amazing!\n\nAhhh such a good feeling!

This promotes an anterior pelvic tilt and you’ll have trouble staying up in headstand.\n\nAmazing flexibility n flow!\n\nThank you!\n\nWow\n\n😊✨\n\nI had one classed booked today but this video just motivated me to book doubles. \n\nThat upward facing dog of yours is pure poetry.\n\nThank you :) No need to double book, but rather stay consistent and you’ll see the magic happen little by little ✨\n\nOutstanding, so graceful, strong, in awe of your strength and balance. 🤍\n\nYou’re so kind ✨ thank you!\n\nNice side plank, sage pose!!\n\nThanks :)\n\nHi V, AWESOME. Thank you for sharing this beautifully controlled display of these flowing variations so perfectly and mindfully executed with obvious concious  concentration on form and presentation .  As ever you are pure inspiration. Thank you\n\nNamaste\n\nThank you for your kind loving words 😊✨\n\nHi, just wanted to say how grateful I am for your uploads. I've had quite a problem with consistency on my practice but since I found you here and on YouTube it helps a lot. Not only I found tons of great advice in your videos, you're also truly inspiring.\n\nThank you.\n\nSometimes I wonder if making these videos is a waste of time…then I get messages like this 🥹🙏🏽✨ Thank you for taking the time to reach out and motivating me to create/share/teach more!\n\nBeautiful flow!\n\nThank you :)\n\nYou have a lot of thoracic mobility!\n\nMy t-spine used to be so stiff but now it feels so good after years of mindfully working on it 🤗\n\nExtended puppy that's a new one for me. Great sequence, thank you.\n\nIt’s such a yummy pose! As long as the shoulders and back are ready for it :)\n\nBeautiful house, beautiful lady, beautiful yoga practice. Some people seem to have a lot of things for a happy life. 😉🙂\n\nThank you for your kind words 😊🙏🏽\n\nAny advice on “getting good”? I follow along with yoga videos, mostly Brett Larkin and Yoga with Adrienne, but nothing takes me this deep. This may legit be the first time I see full cobra. It’s always baby cobra.\n\nHow long have you been practicing? My only advice is keep practicing, keep exploring and trying new things. Little by little with love and conscious breath, the body starts opening :)\n\nAlso, what I’m doing is a high cobra, full cobra (purna bhujangasana) is another pose where the hands grab onto the ankle. [Here’s a video with cobra variations if you’re curious](https://youtu.be/kHK9wYYWZgY) :)\n\nThanks for your response! I have been practicing beginner-intermediate level on and off over the last 7 years.\nI have been thinking of going to a studio vs only having a home practice using YouTube.\n\nSO INSPIRATIONAL. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR FLOW !\n\nThank you for the love 😊\n\nMy wife wants to know where to get that outfit.\n\nYour down ward facing dog looking too much hiperextended regarding the back, no need to push the chest so much into the thighs.\n\nFeels good for me ✨ Every body is different :)"

    "all_comment_text": "That's one of the most difficult moves I have seen. Hats off. Needs a lot of balance and self control.\n\nYou’re too sweet, thank you!\n\nYou are so strong...way to go!\n\nThank you! 🙏🏻\n\nI'm kinda in the same boat (doubt it's even 1/10 though). Do you think core strength is the most important for consistency there?\n\nThat definitely plays a big role but I think (at least for me specifically) it’s mostly about shoulder mobility and strength. I can only land it when I’m really able to push the ground away on the way down. But like you said, core compression is huge too\n\nNice catch! How’s your lotus? Have you tried the karandavasana negative?\n\nMy lotus is solid but I haven’t tried that for some reason. It’s on my agenda for tomorrow now!\n\nyou really gotta focus on rounding the spine a lot and crunching into a ball to make it easier.\n\ni can't believe i've never tried pincha to baby crow before. it looks harder to me, but am not sure. gonna try it tomorrow lol\n\nonce you have a solid karandavasana negative, you can start working handstand to urdhva kukkutasana.\n\nI’m sure you can do this at your skill level! \n\nUrdhva kukkutasana is on my bucket list but I’m scared lol. I can do handstand to crow no problem, but I have some kind of mental block about having my legs bound in lotus while coming down.\n\nIt seems less intimidating from pincha so I’ll take your advice and try that first\n\nway less scary from pincha. fear is a big part of it, but there's also genuine risk for your knees. i tweaked my knee doing lotus in handstand before i was fully ready for it. shelved it for six months, and now it's totally fine. go slow with it.\n\nthe thing i found from playing with the lotus negative was it was safer to just hold the lotus and crash on my butt than trying to quickly take the legs out of lotus. those quick jerky movements aren't ideal.\n\n👏🏼\n\nThat was beautiful! What a great result of your hard work and dedication to the practice\n\nThat’s so sweet of you to say :)\n\nAs always amazing girl 😻\n\nThanks girlie!! You’re amazing too 🤩\n\nImpressive!!\n\nCore and arm strength!\n\n Great control and i love your room!\n\nThank you! 🙏🏻\n\nUgh the sounds my vag would make...\n\nLegit almost choked on my coffee reading this 💀 lmao thanks for the laugh\n\nExcellent control. Goals.\n\nI appreciate the kind words!\n\nWOW. That’s amazing.\n\nThank youuuuu 🫶🏻\n\nBeautiful!! \nI had that same poster in my kitchen, it's so cute!!\n\nThanks! And I know right? I have another from the same Etsy shop that’s the wheel of the year and it’s super cute too\n\nPincha to baby fucking crow!?! I've never even heard of baby crow. That was super cool\n\nLol thank you!!\n\nThis is all super impressive but I’m amazed at how your foot doesn’t cramp after that super long toe point. My feet would cramp up into a pretzel. 🤣💀\n\nThat does happen to me from time to time. It definitely tests my focus when I’m upside down 🙃\n\nI love your wall color and you set goals for the rest of us with that strength and balance!\n\nSide note what does [COMP] mean? I tried looking in the group for acronyms but couldn’t find anything.\n\nThank you so much! And it means check out my pose\n\nSomething new to try. Thx you. Don’t think I can but falling is half the fun. "

Nope.\n\nMy recommendation is to focus on the process, not the outcome. This pose seems excessive to me for most people, although this is obviously a value judgment on my part.\n\nIf you want to increase hip flexibility and/or balance, start by doing parts of this pose in a seated position. Work on hip openers routinely until you can comfortably place your foot on your shoulder while laying down. Then try standing and doing balance poses (e.g., Warrior III) with adaptations that involve raising your leg toward your body. Eventually you may be able to safely attempt a pose like this. That said, everyone has different flexibility limits, so it’s important to listen to your body.\n\nAgain, yoga typically emphasizes focusing on the process rather than the outcome. But if setting a goal like being able to do this pose helps motivate you to engage more meaningfully, then go for it. Just be safe, and remember not to push.\n\nAbsolutely! I do focus on the process and journey of yoga and my flexibility, this is just something I’d love to work my way up to! :)\n\nThis just looks like hypermobility\n\nYep. I bet I could’ve managed this with little training in my 20s. Now in my 40s my hips are so fucked that I can’t even do child’s pose.\n\nStarted yoga in 2009 at 24. On and off and studying for 15 years. Thought things were so “easy.” Now?!?! My sciatica has my left leg so fucked I can only just barely touch my toes *on a good day*\n\nI was thinking it looked like a body contortionist activity!\n\nI saved this exact same video!!! Never seen it anywhere else in 18 years of yoga. I'd love to learn it as a party trick or to teach as an advanced peak pose, but I think the risk of injury surpasses any mobility or functionality benefits. That being said, in the video she entered this from a standing figure 4 variation, bent forward, placed her hands on the ground, brought her foot onto the shoulder &amp; gripped w/ her toes, then rose up. So you could start with slowly practicing those components. I would not recommend this if you don't have leg behind head postures yet in your practice due to the hip rotation needed to pull this off.\n\nThis is basically an advanced dragonfly or grasshopper pose. Maksikanagasana. \n\nVery flexible hip joints are a necessity.  You may practice your entire life and never be able to do this. For instance, I have been a runner/lifted weights my entire life so my hips will probably never be this open🫠. \n\nAs others have said, It’s more about the journey.😃\n\nTurtle. Lizard. Standing split. Warrior 3. To name a few. \n\nAll poses contain all poses. It’s how you visualize and imagine your body that connects them all, then physically too\n\n100%!!\n\nWould birds of paradise make a good intermediate goal perhaps?\n\nI can do BOP though🥲\n\nWhen you attempt tbe transition what is the challenging part for you? Because if you can do BOP u probably are flexible enuff, maybe try a different entrance?\n\nIf you can do that, but not the pose above, I would really work on forward folds so you can put your leg essentially behind your body to come up on your shoulder. Forward folds are also essential for firefly. While firefly pose is on the ground, you begin in the pose with your legs on your shoulders. Hope this makes sense!\n\nYou need all of them. I truly believe that it is the journey that takes you there is what matters. Getting in and out of poses is up to the individual and no right or wrong way necessarily (unless you are hurting yourself, I strongly encourage you to stop if it hurts). Me personally, to even get loose enough to attempt this I would have to stretch, go for a run and then yoga to build up the mobility and flexibility I feel I'd need.\n\nShe should get that checked out\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/C6WeNPvveJR/?igsh=MWoxN2x4cnE1aWIzbw==\n\nI found this on Instagram. Hope this helps. 😃\n\nTHANK YOU!! 🤗\n\nUgh…I did not know that this was even physically possible. I need to see the video. The thought of doing this alone boggles my mind.\n\nI found it on instagram by @_theyogagirl It’s one of her reels!\n\n…it’s the journey not the destination…..\n\nImagine she takes the other step and levitates\n\nThere’s an entire generation of yogis who had to get their hips replaced because putting your foot behind your head was all the rage. This is “cool” but at risk of long term injury? No thanks.\n\nThis pose can fuck tight off! I just did a one-legged chair, and this is like the first thing I see coming on Reddit. lol\n\nWhat’s the source? Give credit please\n\n@_theyogagirl on Instagram is where I found it :-)\n\n...excuse me?\n\nWtf\n\nI can do that with foot on mid shoulder  but it never comes to the top of the  shoulder Any tips ?\n\nLizard? Warrior 3?\n\nTake of leg off at hip joint place foot on arm. Is tge only way my body will ever do anything near this.\n\nhow to achieve: be born double jointed?\n\nDang 😳😳🤯\n\nDude, I can barley keep my balance with the bottom half on its own never mind the leg on the shoulder 😅😆🤣🤦‍♀️🧘‍♀️\n\nThe girl featured in this picture is my clg friend. And yes she does that with utmost care and proper warmup .\n\nAstavakrasana -eight handle pose may help. Like from seated, you have to wrap your knee around you shoulder. Could get things moving in the right direction. Id look up drills for that specific pose. Or the one I mentioned and any other massive hip opening ,groin stretching, poses alike.\n\nAnd to add, I'm sure if there's flying dragon there's a dragon that isn't lol. Same with pigeon/flying pigeon I assume? Maybe start with the normal one first\n\nWarrior 3, standing splits and maybe hurdlers pose? There are poses to warm up to those poses, too, though. : )\n\nDo not attempt something like this without years of training under your belt. You WILL injure yourself. This is a variation of Uttan Eka Pada Sirsasana   Standing foot to head pose.\n\nAlmost perfect, there is no fire though. 8/10 from me. \n\n\nJokes aside, that is incredible.\n\nOsteoarthritis, here it comes.\n\nAnything is possible with photoshop\n\nIf you can visualize a deep lizard pose,  like [these](https://www.elenamissyoga.com/tutorials/poses/lizard-poses-variations/ ) it’s really just a standing version of that.\n\nExcept it was a video on Instagram loll\n\ncan you link the video?\n\n@_theyogagirl it’s a reel she posted! :-)\n\nthank you\n\nThe photoshop pose will help\n\nPhotoshop."

    "all_comment_text": "I really don’t miss this weird, “everything is demonic” flavor of Christianity.\n\nI grew up with this and I can’t stand it \n\nThe beat of rock music was somehow inviting the devil in too 🌚\n\nSo was watching Disney movies 🌚\n\nAnd Halloween! Don’t get me started on how the devil loves costumes, candy, and pumpkins 🌚\n\nUgh, I’m sorry.\n\nYoga has been instrumental in helping to rid me of my evangelical Christianity demons - lol\n\nHope you’re doing well these days 🙏\n\nI did too. Ironic that after being told so many things I was doing were satanic that were benign, I now find actually satanic movies, music, games etc fascinating lol.\n\nWell I absolutely love Halloween and everything spooky and ghostly\n\nSame lol\n\nI grew up like this too! Everything \"of the world\" could put literal demons in you. My dad honestly thinks I am straight up possessed by a devil because I'm transgender lmao. Haven't spoken to my parents in a decade and it is the healthiest thing I've ever done for myself. I live in peace and kindness and try to practice ahimsa for myself and for others, and if their god has a problem with that, he isn't worth my prayers or devotion.\n\nHugs and good luck\n\nThank you, I will never regret choosing my own peace and truth over someone else's fears about the outside world. I want the joy that I have found in truly living as the person I am for everyone.\n\nAnd Harry Potter!\n\nlol so as a trans person I obviously am not the hugest HP fan any more, but I grew up in the rural south in a very religious environment and they did honest to god book burnings for that series when I was a kid in the 90s. I had to read them in secret at school.\n\nWhat do you think of right wing nuts using the output of the Wachowsky siblings as their metaphor for their idiot ideology?\n\nOh you mean the red pill/blue pill thing, right? It's funny, because in the context of the film, choosing the red pill means choosing to live in truth. The first step of transitioning is to admit the truth to yourself that you are not what people see you as, you're not the name or gender that was given to you at birth, and that is the the real first step on the long and scary road of transitioning. Actually taking the \"red pill\" isn't an act of sinking into nihilism about the world around you and externalizing your pain to blame others for your unhappiness, it's about stepping onto the path of truth and self-discovery that will lead you to the person you really are. I've chosen to live in my truth, and so have the Wachowskis.\n\nThat’s what I think too. Congrats btw.\n\nThe right wing nuts choosing this metaphor of all possibilities for their blind run into a world of lies is something that only a slapstick or satire movie could bring onto the screen. For all other formats it would be too much over the top.\n\nI went to Catholic school growing up and I remember there was a day when the pope or whoever approved of Catholics reading those books and my classmates cheered a little.\n\nMe tooooo, I wasn't allowed to watch Disney channel or cartoons because they're apparently \"Demonic.\" Instead I watched science documentaries, drifted away from Christianity, and then fell in love with science, and now I'm a scientist. Fuck yeah.\n\nI must be the devil\n\nI stumbled down a YouTube rabbit hole of anti-yoga born-again Christian-types. It was pretty funny to be honest. They say things like certain postures are explicitly to worship certain Hindu gods and that when you do them, you invite those gods and other demons into your body.\n\n  \nI'm like, bro: if you are Christian you don't believe those gods are real. But several of these Christian Youtubers seemed to believe in the Christian God but ALSO believe that these Hindu gods exist and will take over your body and soul if you take on a posture used to worship them. Wild stuff. Yoga, like any spiritual practice is about intention. If you are not intending to worship a Hindu god you don't do it accidentally by happening to sit in the lotus position.\n\nJokes on them I can’t get into those positions 😇\n\nWell, you see, every God that is not the Christian god is actually a demon in disguise and as a lot of Christians will tell you, demons are always out to get you. 🤓\n\nOhhh I watched some YouTube’s like this and one stated specifically that “yoga makes your body into an antennae for demons.”\n\nI love that about it!\n\n🤣\n\nI remember having lessons on religion in high school (in my country it's purely catholic, not learning about other religions as we're monoreligious as a country). Priest was suspended for belittling literally every student in the classroom. My favourite ones:\n\n1. He saw a guy from our class and his girlfriend hugging, he'd then spend entire lesson telling us how all women are evil and exist merely to tempt us (worth noting, the class consisted of 23 girls and 7 guys)\n\n2. He called a priest from my church to tell him I'm possessed and should be sent to an exorcist, until then I should not be allowed in the church. It was surprising as I was still religious back then and was an altar boy. Still no idea why he did that.\n\n3. Would consistently say that if you wear black you invite Satan to your body and soul, it shows you are depressed from the lack of God as well, and our families mourn when they see us. When pointed out he wears black he said it's different.\n\nHe tried teaching in several schools from what I know, would always get kicked after less than a year. Wonder why.\n\nGosh that's horrible. I'm sorry for what u went through \n\nBased on the social media reaction during the olympics, it’s making a huge comeback. It never really went away but it seems like people are scrambling to make sense of the world right now and they’re cycling back to satanic panic.\n\nI think you’re right 😞 It’s really ramped up since the pandemic, in my view.\n\nChristian apologists in ancient Rome labeled all the ancient gods of Rome and Greece as evil demons.  It was part of a strategy to to overthrow the pagan Roman Empire.  It’s all about domination and control.    \n\nMe too... it is a very strong vibe I am happy to pass on.\n\nAs a catholic I find this ridiculous. You can be Christian and practice yoga just as it is. People are weird.\n\nIt’s more than weird, racism and hatefulness also play a role\n\nI agree completely\n\nPeople talk about yoga in The States being westernized. A part of that is separating the spiritual piece - especially to a specific religion. It’s like these people think that somehow they’re able to take that a step further??\n\nHonestly seems like at best it is a grift to try to get money. But at worse it’s based in hate.\n\nIt reeks of greed! The greed to \"tap into\" the Christian groups' wallets.\n\nI have a Catholic coworker who insists that yoga is wrong, because \"you're praying to another god, whether you mean it or not\".  It's definitely an odd stance, but she won't be changing her mind any time soon.\n\nAs an ex-Catholic, you can obviously be Christian and practice yoga as it is. Hell you can read the gospel while worshipping an icon of Satan if you yourself want to. But probably 70% of people in your congregation will discourage it or silently judge the hell out of you, and that’s how we get this bullshit.\n\nIt’s kinda crazy when you think about it though because Catholicism involves so much movement of your body. Sit up, sit down, kneel, genuflect, etc.  Obviously not yoga moves but movement all the same.\n\nIts only ridiculous if you are not the one making money out of gullible people.\n\nYeah. My Christian mom made a point to let me know how I'm opening myself up to demons by practicing yoga. 🙄\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;Orthodox Christians\n\nI think you might mean fundamentalist Christians? Or do you mean Orthodox as in Russian/Ukranian/Greek Orthodox?\n\nRegardless, Christian Yoga is wack 🤣\n\n[deleted]\n\nOrthodox Christian and educated are mutually exclusive terms\n\nI am Greek Orthodox &amp; and yogi. Even an instructor. This is ignorant, some of us can think for ourselves.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAs long as they come with a good attitude they're welcome to join me in my practice. :)\n\nAsk her which demon exactly? Because we’ve got a ton of them. My favourite is Lanka pati Raavan though I personally am like Bakasur (my wife says so, based on how much I eat).\n\nYes, I've heard this and many other stuff/bs, like Halloween is demonic or eating peeps on Easter is wrong! 😔\n\nGrew up fundie-adjacent and definitely heard about the evils of yoga 🤣\n\nYou're not making Christianity better. You're just making Yoga worse.\n\nOne of the best King of the Hill moments was at that Christian Rock concert\n\nThat scene is very funny.\n\nThe evangelicals are at it again.\n\nOh my God, a completely separate page I follow shared something like this today! She essentially runs a yoga page and teaches yoga classes, but made some post about how she's anti yoga, and will always call what she does something else, because yoga is worship and that's BLASPHEMY UPON JESUS CHRIST. Just the same sort of strange, paranoid \"if I move my body in a certain way I'll summon the devil\" type stuff.\n\nSuper weird and unnecessary.\n\nThere's no such thing as Christian yoga.\n\nWellll, let me invite your kind soul to my Christian Breathing and Walking course. It's 12 weeks, one for each of the disciples.......\n\nOnly 7 “donations” of $99.\n\nor $666. if you're in Boca.\n\nIt’s yet another grift to a susceptible population.\n\nChristian yoga? Did they rename tree pose to \"dying on the cross\".\n\n🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣\n\nI don’t like the way they openly used oriental to describe yoga\n\nWhen people use vague words like ‘oriental’ or ‘African’ to describe specific cultural practices it means they probably don’t have any actual fucking clue what they’re dealing with beyond some cartoonish stereotype\n\nIn the 70's, it was \"ethnic\".\n\nSooo racist to use oriental.\n\nTHANK YOU I thought that was especially yucky\n\ncultural appropriation final boss\n\nTo use the word of the week from my governor, this is just plain weird.\n\nAh the age old technique of stealing and downgrading something only to adopt it with convenient omissions/additions.\n\nLike the Bible.\n\nYour faith isn't shit if somehow yoga is seen as a threat to it.\n\nMy ex-in-laws used to say that yoga was evil because it could make you “accidentally worship the wrong god” (with some slurs sprinkled in) and I thought the same thing. First it was the acknowledgment of other gods that surprised me, then wondering how weak their faith is if they can just oops I’m going to spontaneously give up my lifelong, deeply held belief system because exercise. They didn’t appreciate that discussion.\n\nHow weak would one's faith have to be to \"accidentally\" worship the wrong god?  \nSeriously, do these types listen to themsevles ever? That's a self-own of note.\n\nI’ve had weird Christians tell me every yoga pose is a prayer to another god…. No. You aren’t Hindu for practicing yoga. Knowing its origins &amp; using Sanskrit words is just respectful, point blank.\n\nI mean, the point of yoga, the union part, where we recognize the true essence of our being and the divinity within ourselves and all others as the same as us - could be interpreted by some (not me) as a direct affront to Christianity, in the sense that Christians don't believe as a general rule that humans are divine - God alone is.\n\nBut Christian’s believe we’re made in gods image, it shouldn’t be an affront\n\nI always tell my mom that she believes in these gods more than I do and that I'm probably blasphemy-ing in both religions at this point. I'm atheist but my mother thinks I'm just a lapsed Catholic and I don't really connect with the spiritual practice of yoga. by her standards I'm insulting both religions but of course she's really only salty about the one. IDGAF but it's been hard to practice because I still live with her and if I do it in her presence she'll make a bunch of comments. So in a way I am inviting the devil (AKA her weird ass comments). 🙄\n\nJesus probably did yoga\n\n[deleted]\n\nWe all are Yogis brother\n\nSo I was invited to paddle board yoga once by a woman I kind of knew, and I went, and it was christian yoga.  \n\nAll the poses had names like \"armor of faith\" and \"sword of righteousness\" and I seriously just laid down on my board and closed my eyes and seethed with rage for almost the whole class.  I couldn't just paddle back because I was on the far side of the group and had never been there before and didn't wanna get lost on my way back to the dock, and wanted to be polite to the woman who had invited me.\n\nI did a couple of my own poses (not following) and would confidently say that paddle board yoga is probably  10/10, 0/10 with evangelical christian rhetoric.\n\nthat’s really … weird. I (Jewish) practiced “torah yoga” on a birthright trip (booooo, before i grew in my politics) and frankly that was weird too. yoga’s historical, cultural, philosophical foundation is so rich and stands on its own; it’s unnecessary and disrespectful to twist it to western tradition and religion. both / all can exist in harmony if practiced and studied around their central pillars (love, community, resilience, wisdom, ethical action, etc) (said as a Jewish secular Buddhist)\n\nYoga doesn't even tell you to believe or not in God😫\n\noh i just watched some of these videos. so upsetting.\n\nPractice Pilates or create your own moves if you have such a problem this is just disrespectful at this point. Yoga is a lifestyle\n\nSome people (I'm not one of them but have seen this come up) object to Christians practicing Yoga, which is perceived as a non-christian religious tradition and therefore incompatible with \"being a good christian.\" This isn't a widespread thing in predominantly Christian America, but not unusual in more fundamentalist areas. Those people may try to separate the practice of the asanas from any spiritual underpinning, resulting in a stretching and strength practice that \"looks\" like Yoga but is devoid of breath/body or any mindfulness, meditative, or potentially non-Christian spiritual content (nevermind actual 8 branches of yoga actual yoga...). It's a thing.\n\nEw. What weirdos. \n\nKeep yoga sacred. Or don't, that's also fine. Have fun and do what you find fulfilling in this life\n\nThis is the way\n\nThey did the same thing with the winter solstice...\n\nWesterners need to stop conflating Christianity with westernization. It’s of middle eastern origin and is practiced all over the world. The most Christian nations are Korea and Kenya ffs\n\nAmericans and main character energy. Name a more iconic duo.\n\nThe Ethiopians are some of the oldest Christians around!!!\n\nThese people are idiots\n\nMy aunt freaked out when I started yoga. “thats worship of the devil!” \n\nIt helped me fix my mangled foot, patience, sleep. everyone ive met has been awesome.\n\nMangled foot, really? Curious to know more on this if you are willing to share ...\n\nI think this is a really good grift. They’re monetizing a growing outrage-fuelled mob. lol\n\nVomitballs.   But also totally consistent with Christianity. Christians have been going around the planet stealing things of all kinds (land, ideas, sacred medicine) and claiming everything as theirs for a really long time.  Many spiritually related things. If they couldn’t steal it for their own benefit, they tried to destroy it or ban it.  Like all the videos where Christians say yoga is evil blah blah. That didn’t work. So now they gotta steal. It’s basic Christian playbook.\n\nJesus did yoga. He was a jnani and ishta-devata bhakt. He fed the multitudes and washed feet, karma yog. Teaching from the old testament, svadhyaya. Crucifixion was isvara pranidhana.\n\n💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 You get it.\n\n“Just let ‘em have it.”  That’s my new life motto. \n\nTrust that people can &amp; will figure out a happy medium that leads them to wholeness &amp; unity.\n\nCondemnation never promotes meaningful, healthy change. \n\nFucking weird\n\nI mean, a majority of Westerners completely cleave asanas from the eight-limbed philosophy of yoga all in the name of a good workout. Why not keep doing that instead of shoehorning Jesus into a space where he never asked to be?\n\nThe problem the people who do this kind of yoga face is that they’ve got pastors and “Christian” media telling them that they can’t and that wanting to do yoga is temptation by the devil. Saying some prayers and giving their poses a new name gives them “permission” to do yoga in the eyes of their community. They’re literally taught that it’s wrong to do yoga in its original form.\n\nUnfortunately I grew up very religious (Pentecostal) and pretty much was always told yoga, meditation, and freeing your mind is a gateway to allow demons and the devils into your brain.\n\nMy mom used to nanny for this white family and the she said yoga doesn’t work because the wife would always feel sore and barely walk (she worked in the hospital, so I’m sure it was more to do about being on your feet all day).\n\nAnyway, when my friend did invite me to yoga and started in my 20s it was really cool and chill and ultimately, I felt good. My body felt good.\n\nSo I simply cannot imagine god being like hey don’t do this thing people invented that helps you not feel tight.\n\nI still practice today and while I have a more linebacker stocky body, I crush yoga pretty well. Instructors always assume since I’m not a lean guy I will struggle, but I actually set the pace 💪🏽\n\nI saw this post and came here to call bullshit on this practice. Cultural appropriation. If you want to practice yoga fine but don’t diminish where it came from\n\nI’m gonna open a business where we do atheist baptisms and communions!\n\nI’m a Christian and I teach yoga. It’s not “Christian yoga,” it’s just yoga. I also taught English, not “Christian English.” I don’t do “Christian laundry” or cook “Christian meals” lol. This isn’t hard. \n\nBut on the other hand, if it gets people working out I can only complain so much right?\n\nJesus himself was a Yogi. Read the book Autobiography of a Yogi by Yogananda.\n\nIt’s been out there a while.  I have teachers that don’t close class with namaste\n\nI get that. I don’t close mine with namaste but it has nothing to do with religion- it’s more so because in India it’s a greeting, and the meaning western yoga teachers have given it isn’t super authentic. I know western yoga isn’t authentic to the original either, but it’s just a personal preference.\n\nI don’t spend a ton of time thinking about it.  If the teacher says it i say.  If they just do some positive affirmations then I’ll respond with a” thank you “\n\nShould you close with Namaste? I thought it was a greeting?\n\nIts just a greeting like hello its so weird watching white people do that\n\n[removed]\n\nI remember yoga classes in India being opened and closed with prayers (at ashrams not yoga studios). I think this is just a shorter way of saying the prayer. Personally for me it is just a way of thanking the teacher.\n\nIs it weird to watch white people say adios or hola?\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’m under the impression it means “i bow to you”\n\nThen why is it only weird when white people say it.  Shouldn’t be weird regardless of race?\n\nI bow to you 🙇‍♀️\n\nPrevious to about 2 years ago every class i has ever taken ended that way\n\nYup because many non-Indian practitioners don't understand that Namaste is just a greeting like hello and not some esoteric, mystical yoga thing.\n\nWords are esoteric and mystical ¯⁠\\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯\n\n? Yeah many non-Indian practitioners use Namaste incorrectly at the end of the session, am guessing they feel it creates some kind of mystical, 'oriental' aura. It's meaningless and you wouldn't see that happening in any yoga class in India.\n\nNamaste short word for Namashkar, means the Brahman in me bows to the Brahman in you. Here Brahman is the eternal soul. \n\nIt's actually a word closely linked to Advaita Vedanta, a school of Indian philosophy which says non-dual consciousness, Brahman, appears as everything in the universe. Advaita literally means 'not-two', this makes me feel some exciting connection with Yoga, which also means unity! \n\nSome really good explanations here [r/AdvaitaVedanta](https://www.reddit.com/r/t5_2szu8/s/qg8ziQGitA)\n\nThey seem to be the Cracker Barrel going types.\n\nTo be fair, cracker barrel slaps\n\nAh, yes... father Amorth approved this 🤦‍♂️\n\n\n(https://www.lastampa.it/vatican-insider/en/2011/11/27/news/the-devil-does-yoga-1.36921614/amp/)\n\nKill me.\n\nIs this real?  I feel like it's a prank.\n\nI went to a Christian college and that’s where I started my yoga practice.  (It was a required class).  This is bullshit.\n\nMore people doing yoga is good, they can call it whatever they want.\n\nI might be an outlier here but as someone who grew up inundated with Christianity (dad’s a preacher) I believe Christianity is actually more akin to the teachings of yoga than Christians might realize. Especially when you look at some of the gnostic texts and how they round out the story \n\nFunnily, you may find more agreement in India to your findings then you may realise. Some believe that Jesus spent many years in India, and lived life very much akin to the values of Hinduism. \nI’ve approached the topic with some skepticism over the years, but the more I study, the more I’m surprised by the inherent similarities. There’s definitely something to explore there.\n\nThere’s a great quote from Alan Watts about this: you tell a Christian that you realized you are God, and they’ll call you a heretic, but if you tell a Hindu, they’ll say “congratulations you finally figured it out!”\n\nYeah, the book \"Autobiography of a Yogi\" by Yogananda talks about this.\n\nIt was reading that book that made it click for me \n\nLovely.  Christianity on it's own doesn't make sense but It starts to do so when interpreted from a non-dualistic Vedantic framework.\n\n\nSwami Sarvapriyana has also talked about it:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3sVv3dqlUjA?si=1ejX0kKfDbMWjFTI\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VVAmqjbL9NE?si=0AotAIb0hBnBxtHb\n\nExactly. When I learned the symbolic meaning of the first 5 books of the bible and how they relate to the inner process of alignment/misalignment, and had heard the same principles laid out through yoga, it was an “ohhhh, ALL of this has esoteric meaning and how the Christian church teaches this misses it completely”, and actually ends up being functionally about the same process of reuniting with the true self in a relationship with it’s embodiment \n\nExactly 👍\n\nThat's how it works. First Yog Vidya gets westernised to be called Yoga. Then ignorant westerners start to tweak thousands of years old culture as they like and put their brand name on it to brainwash the population and get the business from them.\n\nTHIS!\n\nThe ignorance and arrogance of certain people is astounding. This is wrong on so many levels. 😔\n\ncolonizers gon colonize\n\nThis is wrong on so many levels :-(\n\nYoga is vedic practice. When you do Namaste, you're worshipping the vedic God. Don't you like it ? Don't do it. Don't call other religions evil, fake, etc.\n\nIt's stupid, but I could almost see it as a way to give people \"permission\" to do yoga without offending their current god. Which is kind of the idea with stuff like confession anyway. You do something bad and are then forgiven. Like do Suriyanamaskar B and then say two Hail Marys and an Our Father to cleanse yourself lol. Luckily I can practice my yoga however I want regardless.\n\nI went to a “Holy Yoga” class once (basically restorative practice with scripture reading/music )- mind you I have been practicing for years - and it honestly felt like an intrusion of my personal safe space on my mat. Rather than freeing the stress, inviting peace, and opening the heart, I felt heaviness. Could just be me as someone with trauma from the church. But it’s also just feels ~off for what yoga is all about.\n\nThat is beyond stupid.\n\nHonestly, if Christians are developing a healthy relationship to the human body, the world will be better off for it.\n\nWhat an experienced yoga teacher would tell you? Snooze.\n\nAs long as people do yoga, that’s all that counts. “They’ll get it.”\n\n:-)\n\nI have not read the original post, I bet it's weird and very bible thumpin' baptist.\nI am a Christian that does not believe in Hinduism, does believe in demonic spirits and practices yoga for stretching.\n\nI think an interesting difference that COULD define Christian yoga (silly as it is, give us all your holidays and practices!) Is that instead of emptying your mind for meditation, Christian meditation is to rather focus your mind on things that are good and Holy, aspects of God, praying for your community. I actually did this last night after muscle scraping my forearms, I held a fairly painful forearm stretch and decided to take that time to pray for members of my community.\n\nI share this as it's something I sorta just started doing and learned about biblical meditation from Bible College. The concept seems rather silly, and should not be focused on driving away the demons. At that point it would be better to practice actual yoga and empty your mind.\n\nChristianity makes proper sense when you interpret it from a non-dualistic Vedantic perspective.  God and Atman (Individual soul) are not seperate.\n\n\n\"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you\" type of stuff.\n\n\n\nIt is said that Jesus travelled to India and  learnt from sages in there. It is in the book \"Autobiography of the Yogi\" by Yogananda. \n\nWhat if Jesus once visited northern India and studied yoga..\n\nAbsolutely disgusting. Cultural appropriation with no shame. If they didn’t like that yoga had religious background, then they shouldn’t force theirs onto it. And to be fair, yoga gets into the religious space at more advanced stages and depending on the determination of the practitioner. They should’ve been like the navy seal guy that made those yoga videos but focused on the physical aspect of yoga.\n\ni don't see them calling hinduism evil.\n\nsomeone rando commented on evil spirits or something, that's not their fault.\n\nSigh....white people....\n\nImagine stealing something from a religion which benefits you. Repackage it according to your needs and proceed to call that religion \"evil\" and \"satanic\".\n\nThis is so sad and infuriating.\n\nI heard similar comments when I explored doing yoga in my late teen years. I was a member of a nondenominational Pentecostal ish church community. Glad I got out of that. A lot of weird takes on things.\n\nMagic mushrooms vs therapeutic ceremony grade psychedelic mushrooms\n\nIt is merely stretching if it is not authentic yoga, which can be ok too?\n\nI’m not a yoga expert and I have more skip days than I probably should, but growing up in the Bible Belt, I can understand where they’re coming from… sort of. Not trying to oversimplify or offend here, this is just my take and I’m only sharing because it seems like a lot of people aren’t as familiar with evangelical Christianity.\n\nThese are not my views:\n\nA lot (though not all) of conservative Christian communities are quite literally taught that the devil is lurking around EVERY corner. This gives some of the more hardcore believers a deathly fear of any kind of eastern philosophy because they truly believe that demons exist and will harm them. Anything labeled as “woke” is seen with immense suspicion because that’s what they’re taught by their pastors, family, and Fox News.\n\nFast forward to a modern world, lots of people like yoga, conservative Christians like these see it in media, and they want to try it too. The problem is that they’re taught that wanting to do something popular, but that’s also not Christian, will allow the devil to tempt them into sin. \n\nThat’s where these YouTube videos come in. By changing some names and saying some prayers they christianize yoga. This gives them permission to just do yoga, but without the fear of eternal damnation. Add the prominence of Christian nationalism and they’re not worried about cultural appropriation or whitewashing (biblical reference) yoga.\n\nIt sounds like a whole lot of stress and work to just do yoga to me, particularly when a lot of Americans already skip yoga’s Hindu origins.\n\nAdding to an already too long post: \n\nThe YouTube channel allows them to not just do yoga, but to also share their faith. For evangelicals, it’s a win / win.\n\nAgain, not my views or beliefs, just sharing what I know from growing up amongst them.\n\nStop trying to make yoga a competition.\n\nLiterally appropriation, as stated in the cross-post. They're taking a system of which they have no cultural or developmental connection to, rebranding it to fit their desired optics whilst stripping it of its cultural heritage, and then trying to make money off of it.\n\nlol such nonsense. They probably vote for the antibchrist donnOld.\n\nThere is NO Christian yoga."

My previous yoga spot was much more of a “boot camp” kind of place. \n\nMy daughter teaches yin and plays the bowls for sound bath. I love to hear how much people enjoy it.\n\nSound baths are incredible. The first time I went to one I had a deep emotional release and just started sobbing. It was right after a close family members terminal illness and death and I think everything I had been pushing down for months came to the surface. When it is paired with a gentle yoga practice, it is absolutely amazing. So glad you got to experience that!\n\nSame for me. Tears dripping on the mat along with sweat.\n\nGentle yoga isn't just for \"old\" folks. If you want to increase the challenge, hit each pose a little deeper and activate more of your muscles. Take up a notch by mindfully and intentionally engaging your core for the entire class. You'll find a new appreciation for slower classes\n\nAgh yep I didn't mean to imply that! It's def for everyone :) Mostly just meant it in that it's mostly old people at my studio. That makes me feel a lot more welcome because I'm a huge klutz and have a hard time moving my body right, so seeing old people doing things just fine makes me feel like I can do them too.\n\nHahaha I used to go to a studio in an area with a lot of retirees. Truly some of the best classes I’ve ever been to. Gentle is my jam.\n\nI LIVE for a sound bath\n\nAlso i use a liforme for a studio mat. Very grippy.\n\nI’m extremely sweaty and love the liforme mats. I baulked at the price initially, but have found they were a worthwhile investment for me as I practice in studio 4-5 days per week.\n\nI went back to the website a few times.\nLike no way I'm paying that much.\n\nBetween how grippy it is and the alignment guide or whatever you want to call it it really makes me thing a whole lot less about hand placement and foot alignment in poses. I really enjoy a gaiam mat for somatic movement but other than that I'm team liforme\n\nThanks! Will look into it :)\n\nYou can also bring some thin microfiber towels to lay on your mat and use as extra grip and to absorb sweat. Works great.\n\nThe studio I go to does this at 7:30 pm, I call it sleepy yoga, and I love it! \nThe instructors voice could put me to sleep but probably bc I associate it with the class and bowls. \nI’ve also attended a class that was only the sound bath where everyone was laying down with pillows and blankets!\n\nA 72 year-wise teacher routinely kicks my 59M butt in gentle yoga, so let's put that aside. \nI've heard the gong bath is a trip, I may take the plunge.\nEdit: Read your comments here. I'm in.\n\nThe gong is something else! One of my first yoga classes had a gong bath at the end and let me tell you that was the most intense trip I’ve had while sober. I couldn’t believe how just sound can elevate your senses so much.\n\nGet a towel and put it over your cheap-o mat.  Also, you can play soundbath soundtracks on Spotify\n\nyes, with headphones in! highly recommend.\n\nSound baths are incredible. Feels like it really helps with retuning my mind and cells of my body when the sounds like ring through me\n\nAlso have a listen to Devi Prayer if you want some otherworldly sounds\n\nIf you plan of sticking it out, an expensive mat goes a long way. I’ve been using the same manduka for 14 years and travelled with it on planes. Still in impeccable shape where cheap ones wear so fast\n\nMy first proper yoga mat is B-MAT and I LOVE IT. Game changer for me. Keep enjoying life, mate 💛\n\nI have a cork mat- Body by Yoga. It's great to prevent slippage.\n\nB mats are great! Love this post… I’m happy for you\n\nMy yoga studio offers a class called 'slow flow vinyasa' as well. I first discovered it a few weeks ago. It was life changing, it has quickly become my favorite class they offer. Only problem is it's a morning class and most of time I'm at work. :/ \n\n\nHighly recommend checking out everything your studio has to offer. Cause you never know what the class will be like until you try it! Always try to go into yoga with a beginner's mind.\n\nI bring a hand towel sometimes so when hands are slippery I put that down by hands\n\nDude yes, Yin and slow yoga are where it’s at. Took me years to realize it too. Sound baths are the only time I truly reach a meditative state. As for mats, I sweat from my hands and slide around on most mats, and I swear by the Manduka ProLite. It takes some time to break in— I highly recommend giving it a gentle salt scrub to help break down the coating— but once it’s broken in, it’s sticky and lasts forever. I’ve had mine for 8+ years.\n\nSo cool you had a great experience! Your post is reminding me I need to get a little yin with my yang. As far as mats go, I highly recommend The Mat from Lululemon. I do hot vinyasa style and it’s perfect for me because it’s non slip. It has this smooth but grippy layer that is cushiony but also dense and supportive. They also have it in longer lengths too.\n\nSlow flow/hatha is my absolute favorite. It’s fun to discover all of the different styles!\n\nSound baths are amazing. It’s that feeling of just disappearing.\n\nLove this!  On the physical side you get a better stretch. On the spiritual side there is more grounding and a good opportunity for quality breath work. Good post!!\n\nSound baths are amazing.  Was it gongs, bowls?\n\nI have the JadeYoga mat and that thing is GRIPPY. But even then I add a towel on top for extra hot sessions. For yours, you can just try to lay a thin towel on top, I usually drip a little water by the hands and feet (top and bottom) of the towel to “activate” the grip when I’m not sweating enough.\n\nInvest in a good mat. (I love Manduka). I’m a heated room slow-flow vinyasa kind of guy and I use an inexpensive [hot yoga towel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V31TF2Y?ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_product_details&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1). It absorbs all my drips and keeps me from sliding around.\n\nSlow yoga can be quite challenging because you have to slow down your mind and hold the poses for longer. Many people find them more challenging than faster classes. And if the sound bath was included as part of the class you are quite lucky! Usually I see those offered as a workshop that costs extra money. I agree that it's a very cool experience.\n\nI have a Jade harmony mat and a B mat and I find both great for not slipping. They are similar but different. They both have a textured surface but the Jade mat surface feels rougher. The B mat feels squishier and the edges can roll up, but the Jade mat feels floppier and always stays flat. My Jade has started to flake a bit while the B mat hasn't.  Jade also sells a grippy towel that could be an interesting choice. There are lots of options out there!\n\nGentle yoga is all about the alignment. If your hands are slipping in down dog you might need some adjustment. I would say get into table top and then into down dog and flex your tailbone up and try to bring your hands inward a little so that it almost does an open triangle. Sound bath is the best especially after all those poses. It brings me into such a peaceful state ready for the next day\n\nWait until you do a sound bath and they put a crystal bowl on your chest and hit it gently… bruv\n\nAny time I do a hot or power class, I put a yoga towel on my mat. I have a grippy mat, but I like that the towel soaks up the sweat &amp; keeps my mat cleaner for longer. I use Nomadix towels for the most part, but you can use a plain towel you already own- big beach towels or Turkish towels work well!\n\nYou just need a yoga towel for your mat. But a better mat would probably be good too if you’re gonna be practicing more frequently.\n\nSo I haven't done this myself yet but it's on my to do list - I learnt that if you salt your matt (pour salt) scrub it and maybe leave it out in the sun (?) and then rinse it out, it removes the oils and slipperyness\n\nYoga Paws! They’re little gloves and foot slippers with grip. Got mine on Amazon, have been using 4-6 times per week for about a year and they’re still going strong. I’m also a sweaty beast :)\n\nYou have stumbled into yoga’s best avenue on life’s road.\nDefinitely up your mat to reduce slippage.   Expect to pay around $100 for a mat that will become your best friend, and make anti-slip your search parameter.  My favorite brand is Manduka, but there are other premium brands.\nCongratulations and enjoy.\n\nHey as far as slipping on the mat goes get a yoga towel for sure to lay over the mat. I slip and slide all over the place without a towel no matter how expensive the mat is. Towel is a game changer\n\nCork mats help with sweating, or just get some yoga gloves. Fingerless gloves with little traction rubber on em. Have fun !\n\nGrippy mats like Hugger Mugger's para rubber, or any grippy mat for sweat are worth the investment. I'd stay away from Manduka unless it's the Eko bc they are slippy. Also, a mat towel is good to try.\n\nLay a towel over your mat to avoid slipping.\n\nIs there a YouTube video you could recommend?\n\nWait until you go to your first Nidra class!\n\nI go to this one teacher regularly because she does the bowls for savasana.  She the bomb and I love her style.  She is older but far more capable than some of the hot young ones!\n\nI am curious to try out sound bath now.\n\nI do slow yoga at home. There are multiple YouTube channels with sound baths, and I’ll often play one while practicing. Very relaxing.\n\nI experienced my first sound bath after many years (it’s impolite to ask how many 😬) of yoga practice. There is an involved background story and I was not expecting much. I was overwhelmingly surprised. I can’t express how light and, there isn’t a word, but it was a wonderful experience after years of hard work. What happened during it gave me peace and affirmation that the work, positive steps and positive people in my life have brought me to a better place.\nAnyone at least willing to try should.\n\nThis was one of my first experiences with formal yoga. I started out with the highest standard and now  most other yoga classes dull in comparison!"

    "all_comment_text": "On one hand, being upfront about the culture you want to foster is great. Ackowledging your limitations as a teacher or practitioner is also commendable. On the other, the tone of this post sounds like the writer just finished a heated discussion about this topic and posted this before calming all the way back down. Without *saying* they're shading other classes, it reads as though they very much are.\n\nPersonally I don't consider calling postures by whatever name fits the practice and practitioner appropriation any more than I do when ordering international cuisine. I don't plan to start calling gnocchi potato noodles or burritos spicy meat rolls simply because the words are not natively English.   Yoga itself is a sanskrit word, so this is all a little inconsistent.\n\nThis says it really well. Using appropriate words doesn't feel like cultural appropriation to me; love the gnocchi and burrito examples. I actually think it's really respectful when my teachers do it because to me it feels like they are honoring the history of yoga and its roots when they do so.\n\nThis ^.  It’s “trikonasana”, not “bent over sideways kitty”.\n\nAnother one that I know of that kind of irks me and yes I'm a white person so I don't know if y'all are gonna agree, but here's one that I think is super freaking stupid. I know the actual names or at least the translations of these names are easy pose and/or Lotus pose. So why in the hell would you call this pose crisscross applesauce? This was the name of the lotus pose that was being used in a bunch of California schools back in like 2008 or 2009? It was something about how yoga was too religious or something. What the actual hell? I'm still learning I'm I'm still a bit of a novice. I like learning about other peoples religions and cultures and different movements and stuff like that.\n\ncross legged and lotus are two different poses anyway\n\nOK thank you for the info. I'm still trying to learn about different things and sometimes I'm a bit susceptible to weird rabbit holes. So I do apologize.\n\nIf I was practicing at a studio, hearing \"criss cross applesauce\" instead of \"lotus pose\" would have me promptly leaving the studio as I laugh at the absurdity. \n\nLike, wtf actually is that? Intention and vibration are very important in the practice, and I'm not here to be 'babied' through my flow. \n\nThe pursuit of yoga (for me) is one of reverent focus and profession. I'm here to _practice well_, and cutting these corners is disrespectful to the wealth of tradition that we stand upon.\n\nI'd walk out in protest like my daughter did in kindergarten when they wanted her to do it. 🤣\n\nI was taught cross cross applesauce in kindergarten.  Are yoga studios actually calling it that??\n\n[deleted]\n\nRight? Lol I was taught the term in 90’s. It’s a term that’s decades old now, and it’s a hell of a lot less offensive than teachers using the phrase “Indian style.”\n\nBecause calling the easy pose \"sitting Indian style\" is culturally insensitive – both to South Asian and Native American \"Indians\"... Anywhere where there aren't enough chairs around...so the kids of all ages learn the euphemisms - especially if they sound \"poetic\"\n\nOh I get it. I've always learned that word when my mom was a kid because of course my mom and I didn't know any better when I was a little kid. But in school I've always heard cross your legs. That could just be me remembering things. But I'd like to see who or what discovered the chakra system because I always thought it was from India.\n\nWe were taught to sit “criss-cross applesauce” until someone complained that it was biological appropriation.\n\nWhat? From the insect world?\nMaybe I should stop calling that mat pilates move I do, stop calling it \"dead bug\" and just call it supine bent arms and legs flailing about\".. no economy of words there ;)\n\nWhut. This is a joke, yes? I can biologically identify as applesauce still right?\n\nPlus it helps teach the Sanskrit language roots in English.\n\nTri- three and kon- angle.\n\nIMO, it reads like they are addressing complaints from studio goers who want more spirituality and tradition incorporated into their instruction. While I also approach yoga from an athletic perspective (not a spiritual one), I think sending out this message is unnecessarily adversarial.\n\nThis. You can be \"right\" and still an asshole depending on your delivery. That's why no one says \"I told you so\" without getting shit back. Bc, it's rude, and it negates the information you're portraying. I think it's perfectly fine of them to be upfront about the focus of their studio. But you don't have to say it like you're yelling at everyone in a flippant tone when you say it. It just puts your studio in a bad vibe. And it makes it more likely that you're going to miss say something because you're too heated and then your message is completely lost.\n\nI'm going to start calling burritos spicy meat rolls! That sounds fun!!\n\nHow will you be able to differentiate between taquitos, flautas, burritos, and chimichangas? All of these are spicy meat rolls! 🌯🌯🌯\n\nBurrito is big spicy meat rolls, chimichanga is medium crunchy spicy meat rolls, taquitios are small crunchy spicy meat rolls, I am not sure about flautas though.\n\nIf we’re going to insist that something is cultural appropriation, wouldn’t it be worse to call something yoga and then refuse to acknowledge or even try to incorporate some of the traditional aspects of it? This is hypocrisy.\n\nThis was my thought. Not giving credit where credit is due IS MISAPPROPRIATION! Crazy Crazy\n\nThis is where I stand on the matter. I'd challenge just about anyone to identify anything that they do that doesn't appropriate something from somewhere.\n\nObviously not all of Reddit is from the US, but basically this is true for most westernized societies. Every single thing we do is from another culture at one point. I’m sorry it’s entirely ridiculous. If there is disrespect in a given behavior that’s one thing.\n\nThe American obsession with cultural appropriation is just another way to divide people.\n\nThat's a really great point! If instead of screaming 'mine!' when someone adopts an idea or practice, people acknowledged the recognition, it would be unifying. The 'appropriation' complaint seeks to undermine this wholesome exchange of good things.\n\nThis thread right here conveys my exact thoughts as well. I’m not saying there isn’t such a thing as cultural misappropriation, but the current US obsession with it is just another symptom of how broken we are right now. Everything doesn’t have to be “mine” or “yours”. Sharing something with acknowledgement and recognition of its roots and history is how varying communities connect and human civilization evolves and grows.\n\nYes, exactly. And don’t even get me started on the American obsession to categorize every ethnicity that isn’t “white”. Todays term is “person of colour”. Or to label people as African American, or Japanese American, etc. aren’t they just American? How is it appropriate to call someone African American if they are descended from slaves?? They’ve literally been in America for hundreds of years.\n\nExactly. How can one scream mine about something that isn’t even tangible?\n\nCulture is meant to be shared. Often it’s shared with our children and grandchildren, but if a neighbors comes to us wanting to participate, why wouldn’t we want to share it? \n\nIn that vein, if a child does the tradition “wrong” do we tell them to never participate again? No! We encourage them to try again, or even to make it their own. Why do we not give our neighbors the same grace we give children?\n\nIt’s ironic because Instead of celebrating culture and appreciating it the current trend is to isolate it and as shown above strip it from its origin. So in the name of “cultural appropriation” they are causing cultural erasure.\n\nI don't think it's limited to Western cultures, every tradition is because an idea spread between people\n\nexactly. It's just how civilization evolves - and has been for tens/hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nYes, literally taking the poses from yoga and refusing to call them their Sanskrit names is the appropriation. You aren't \"appropriating\" a language by calling the poses their proper names.\n\nDuring my YTT, we were taught about the importance of not white washing yoga any more than it already has been. Learn the terms, do your best with pronunciation, have at least a base knowledge of Hindu goddesses and gods, understand chakras, meditation, chanting, OMing.\n\nAs most of you know, the physical aspect of yoga is not as old as many think, and it was created to help practitioners ease into deeper meditative states. If all of this isn’t being taken into account, I’m not sure what’s being taught can/should be considered yoga.\n\nWouldn't doing and even teaching yoga itself be cultural appreciation, by their own logic?\n\nExactly, seems like laziness about learning Sanskrit cloaked in social Justice language. \n\nIt’s fine not to use it if you don’t feel comfortable pronouncing it, but to pretend it is some kind of better ethical choice…. \n\nThat must be a very shaky high horse.\n\nRight…. and the best teachers do incorporate these practices into their daily life not just a “one hour class” and do strive to be “studied” to the best they can based on the resources available to them. This is not the flex they think it is.\n\nIt seems super arrogant. You get the same with Judo and people who insist on being taught Judo but get annoyed by the Japanese names, even though the convention of Japanese names allows the art to be shared across the whole world and everybody to know what to type into Google, or how to refer to a technique in a foreign country. \n\nBallet does it, fencing does it, karate does it, yoga to a lesser extent….\n\nI personally love the Sanskrit words for asanas. How the hell else am I supposed to explain that pose where you are sitting on your knees with your butt pressed back against your heels and the tops of your feet on the floor. I can just say vajrasana.\n\nIt’s down to intent. Are you bringing these things in for the appearance of authenticity or because it’s a genuine appreciation? A lot of yoga studios will have Hindu statues but they can’t even tell you who’s being depicted. When people do stuff like this, imo, it’s worse than just doing nothing at all. \n\nI'd rather have someone be honest about their limitations than be disingenuous and masquerade as something they're not just to swindle me out of my money and waste my time because it's going to get exposed pretty quickly and they'll lose my respect and trust in the process.\n\nNot to mention how the physical asanas as we know them in the West are not really thousands of years old. They can be traced to Scandinavian gymnastics and military training exercises taught to young people (like Krishnamacharya) in schools during British rule of India.\n\nEverything is influenced by something. It is also worth noting that the chakra system was discovered and being used by indigenous people on the other side of the globe who had no way to connect with anyone in India.\n\nCan you explain what you mean? Because I've always thought that chakras were an Indian concept. Like I always thought it was from India. What do you mean by other people discovering that system? I hope you don't mind me asking. What indigenous groups are you referring to? I would like to know.\n\nI don't mind at all! This topic fascinates me. No single culture \"owns\" the subtle energy system. I mean obviously we can sense it for ourselves. And I should have referred to it as the subtle energy system rather than specifically \"chakras\" because the energy centers have been sensed and understood differently by different cultures throughout the ages....\n\nIt is my understanding (thru reading and listening to anthropologists) that shamans across various indigenous cultures in the Americas worked with energetic centers as they related to healing on the level of the soul, and they recognized how it manifested physically in the body as wellness or illness.\n\nOf course, there's also the meridians in traditional Chinese medicine, similar to the nadis, with prana being recognized as qi.\n\nAncient Egyptians had their own understanding of energy centers that echo those of the Indian chakra system.\n\nI've read that the association of the energy centers with the rainbow is actually a relatively new Western concept sparked by the New Age movement in the 70's. To my knowledge, the Vedas and ancient Buddhist and Jain texts didn't connect colors with the energy system. From what I remember (and someone correct me if I'm wrong), there may have been some correlation to the elements, but not the rainbow system as we know it.\n\nIt's interesting how cultural traditions inform each other throughout generations. After the teachings of Yoga came to the west, many things were adapted and added and then reflected back to India and taught there. Plus we now have a scientific understanding of biomagnetism in the West.\n\nIn many ways we're all still pioneers in this practice of uncovering and exploring the subtle energy system. Who knows what connections will be made decades from now. What's most unfortunate is that our modern way of living further disconnects us from our bodies. The best thing we can do is keep practicing and exploring.\n\nAlso, for folks who believe the soul reincarnates into many bodies over many lifetimes, doesn't it stand to reason that humans would have lived in different cultures in past lives? This is something I often ponder...\n\nYes, me too. My Vedic philosophy teacher says that if you are a dedicated student in this life, then you have had previous lives where yoga studies were important to you.\n\nYep. They shouldn't be calling this yoga, it should be \"stretchy bendy\" class\n\n100% agree. My opinion is that the problematic part of cultural appropriation is when the “colonial culture” (for lack of a better term) takes a traditional thing and co-opts it to suit the colonial culture without respecting the traditional culture by doing the thing as it has been traditionally been done. \n\nSo by refusing to use Sanskrit words to “avoid cultural appropriation” in their “exercise class” to teach “western, modern yoga” is exactly the problem. It co-opts and reduces yoga from a mindful, spiritual practice into an exercise class.\n\nYes, you said it perfectly!\n\nIf you’re this worried about cultural appropriation, then why study yoga at all? Teach the Jane Fonda Workout and have done with it.\n\nAdd some leg warmers, and voila!\nBut seriously, she looks pretty good for 80, so something is working. 😉\n\nThis is always the thought I come back to on this subject.\n\nYep. It honestly feels disrespectful the way the post is written. You can say that you're not comfortable using Sanskrit words and do so respectfully. This feels passive aggressive.\n\nAlso the phrase \"modern day yoga\" irks me to no end.\n\nRight, like, “We did away with that boring old crusty yoga and now we’re just doing something from OUR century, okay Boomer? *eyeroll*”\n\nI think it's more disrespectful to yoga than to strip it of its roots and culture and teach it as an entirely Westernized practice.  \n\nI think I'm most put off by the idea that mispronouncing something = disrespect. In my day job, I teach a lot of ESL students. They constantly struggle with pronouncing English words. (Let's be honest, where we put the stresses in words is kind of crazy, like 'lead' can be 'leed' or 'led').  If I thought they were being disrespectful....??? It's insane.  They're trying and that's what matters. Same with Sanskrit. \n\nWhat my students are doing in learning English is also not appropriating--trying to learn something (yoga, Sanskrit, English) often has respect--you WANT to learn the thing, which comes from respect.  \n\nHer attitude has a 'have her cake and eat it too' feel to it. She wants the yoga, without, you know, the stuff that makes it more than synchronized stretching. How is that not literally cultural appropriation?\n\n[deleted]\n\nPeople are insisting on the same with Judo, especially in the BJJ community and it makes me quite angry.\n\nThey say that we use Japanese out of ego and malice and all sorts of malicious reasons that aren’t in any way accurate, but they still want to use and be taught Judo moves.\n\nIt’s not enough that about 80% of their art is originally Judo (with different names now), they want us to teach them Judo on their terms too.\n\nIt’s all applied physics and philosophy at the end of the day, but there are practical and cultural aspects for why something is done the way that it is, and it’s easy to throw the baby out with the bathwater.\n\n\"Yoga\" is a sanskrit word.  If they don't want to use sanskrit in their classes, they should call them something else.\n\n\nI personally find the sanskrit interesting and an important aspect of yoga.  One of the reasons we study the yoga sutras in sanskrit is so that the meaning is less likely to get lost or distorted by translation.  When we divorce the teachings of yoga from their sanskrit vocabulary, we lose part of the teachings.  But ultimately sanskrit is just words.  I tell new teachers all the time they don't need to worry about learning more sanskrit than is required for their courses.  I don't really care if they learn \"bhujangasana\" or \"cobra pose,\" \"ahimsa\" or \"nonviolence.\"\n\n\nBut cutting the cultural and spiritual parts out of yoga of the practice *is* cultural appropriation.  It's practically the definition of cultural appropriation.  And I think it's clear that there is an element of discomfort with sanskrit language here.  It's unfamiliar and hard, and rather than engage with the culture and the language, it's easier to just leave it out.\n\n\nI'm more appalled by the implication that their teachers have no yoga practice, connection, or community where they could engage with sanskrit and yoga philosophy, outside of teaching a one-hour class 😬\n\nThis was my take as well.\n\nThe interesting part is that that they think they are taking some moral high ground by pretending they are being more honest about this, meanwhile they are basically saying \"our yoga is not authentic enough to say it is anything other than exercise\". And yet, they still call it yoga.\n\nI mean, they flat acknowledge that what they teach is westernized, and I like that they don't pretend it's traditional. That is indeed self-aware and open and honest. But it seems they are congratulating themselves for the choice to not use sanskrit, whereas in my mind, there is an element here of that being an excuse to not really do the thing properly. Especially this phrase \"we feel if it isn't part of our daily lives outside a 1 hour class\".... in my opinion, if yoga isn't a part of your lifestyle overall, you have no business teaching that 1 hour class to begin with. And thus you're doing the exact thing you claim not to be:  \"pretending to be a yogi when it meets your needs\"\n\nYou don't need to speak fluently to use a word. A burrito is still a burrito even in Nebraska. Lasagna is still lasagna even if the chef isn't Italian. A cook can \"julienne\" a bell pepper without saying \"I'm not appropriating French cooking, so I just say I cut it into strips\". That's actually more disrespectful to the French than not.\n\nPersonally I prefer sanskrit because it is consistent, and also because the names usually mean something semantically and logically. Whereas western asana names are often totally made up and have silly arbitrary animal names which can change from studio to studio (to be fair some of those animal names come from the sanskrit translation, such as upward \"dog\", \"pigeon\", \"flamingo\" comes from loosely translated \"humble swan-line bird\" etc but this is not always the case).\n\nPart of yoga teacher training should be knowing the proper words for the asanas, and their meanings, and the pronunciation.  It's not appropriation, it's respect. Tradition and lineage is a big part of yoga. Teach westernized yoga all you want and be honest about what you are offering, sure. But that's no excuse for being lazy with your education.\n\nWell said\n\nI think this is a really good point, in re: “appropriation”—if you’re worried about that, taking something you like from a tradition that is not yours and abstracting or cutting it off further from its origins… but still taking the title or existence of the practice as the basis of your business… that more states the problem than avoids it. \n\nNo one is perfect here (I don’t think there is a way to be perfect here, practicing and teaching yoga in the west, especially as a westerner… perhaps much like yoga and life, perfection isn’t the goal). Posts like this do ride on the borderline between sharing a perspective/philosophy/approach (cool) and acting as if you know better so can hold yourself off from implication in or responsibility for problems you see (not as cool). The idea that their “yoga” studio can just claim to “focus on” what they know and so absolve themselves of any need to learn about the roots, many aspects, and diversity of the practice… meh.\n\nAt first I thought this post was just mild eye-roll or unnecessary more than anything, but I am realizing I find the posture of the statement that to take “a language you do not know, do not speak daily and do not understand its full meaning or culture” is cultural appropriation really bizarre and reductive. I know English very well, and speak it (and write in it) daily, but I wouldn’t pretend to “understand its full meaning or culture” (what would that even mean?). I’m one person with one perspective. \n\nWith Sanskrit, that sentiment is just laughable, because very, very, very few people speak Sanskrit on a primary or daily basis. Yes, Sanskrit is importantly related to some common modern Indian languages, but Sanskrit itself is mostly used in religious or academic contexts. And in a society as diverse and large as India, no one is going to meet the bar of fully understanding any one Indian language or its attendant “culture.” In order to posture as the good  “modern yoga” people, they’re themselves riding on an essentializing myth based on a western lens.\n\nI think the post is an admission of laziness, tbh. They are (ostensibly) yogis, it’s literally their job to learn and have knowledge about the thing that they are selling to others. Sanskrit is a dead language, sure, but it would be like a priest refusing the learn or know any Latin because he’s not an ancient Roman. And yeah India is huge, but yoga comes specifically from the north, which helps to narrow it down a bit. I recognize that I am biased though, because I do not enjoy studios that practice a Westernized yoga divorced from its spiritual and cultural origins. For me personally, yoga is as much a spiritual practice as it is physical.\n\n&gt; I think the post is an admission of laziness, tbh.\n\nThis is also how I read it. The vast majority of people I have seen talking about appropriation are talking about a combination of respect and actually making an effort as the solution/answer. Choosing to still make bank while blatantly stating there won't be any effort seems the opposite, even when they're claiming that respect is the underlying reason.\n\nExactly. Like if you are admitting that your yoga is basically just exercise, but still insist on calling it yoga (literally a Sanskrit word), then there’s a problem. It means they are comfortable using the culture as ethnic flavoring and set dressing, but refuse to actually engage with it on anything but the most superficial level.\n\nAnd to add on to what you’ve said…..yoga teachers and instructors have spent hundreds of hours in training alone to be able to “appropriately” (not the word I’m looking for…I can’t think of it…) teach yoga. Through the successful completion of instructor requirements….they have been given permission to teach and instruct the practice…different culture…but I think back to my own situation. I have Ojibway ancestry on my Mom’s side…so I’m doing everything I can to learn and try to re-claim that. If I were given a teaching, I wouldn’t try to give that teaching or explanation to anyone else….unless I had permission to do so from the Knowledge Keeper or Elder from which I learned it from. The instructors teaching the classes have been given permission to teach the classes through all the requirements they have completed in training. \nSo many languages are dying….one Indigenous language dies every week…isn’t it important to preserve what we can of Sanskrit?\nJust some thoughts to add on. \nBut I’m with a bunch of you….I feel like the person(s) who wrote the post should have left it another 24 hours or so before posting their response…..and asked for some outside guidance even from other yoga communities….it more than likely had to be the studio or chain owner(s).\n\nWhat a lovely sentiment! \n\nThis scenario being discussed reminds me of how people who can’t read, speak or understand Hebrew can still convert to Judaism &amp; teach other’s about it. 🤷‍♀️\n\nSame goes for Christianity. The Bible was originally written in Greek &amp; Hebrew. none of the Christians I know speak or read either of those languages. 🙃  But the messages are helpful to many people &amp; that’s what’s the most important! \n\nIf calling stretching “yoga” get’s people to join together &amp; chill out while improving their body &amp; mind, that’s far more important to me than speaking Sanskrit. \n\nThat’s a very good point. The post being discussed doesn’t seem to “get it” about yoga. What we do is expressed through language and although Sanskrit provides the most detailed ‘map’ for the method there are other maps available and for some people redrawing the map is appropriate for them. As long as there is direction inward (and the outward and inward and outward again) there is the yoga.\n\nInteresting you bring that up because that's why pastors have to go to school. They study Greek and Hebrew to have better understanding of the original context which makes a huge difference. We expect the same of our yoga teachers so this post is just like an admittance of refusal to do their due diligence because it's hard 🫢\n\nTaking this thinking to its conclusion, “guillotine,” zeitgeist,” “taco,” “sushi” and so many other words would be classified as cultural appropriation. We use them regularly, we mispronounce them, we don’t understand their etymology and cultural context. And yet they are fully acceptable and useable in the English language. \n\nWe don’t get to police language - ask the Académie Française about their failed battle against words like parking, weekend, camping and Big Mac. Language evolves, and has always done so. It is influenced by other cultures, it grows and changes to accompany  the growth and change of the human experience.\n\nI mean nobody is upset about ballet being taught by non-french people who have never been to France and anglicize the pronunciation of the steps. They don't have to use Sanskrit words if they don't want to but I think their reasoning is a stretch. It more feels like they don't want to put in the effort of learning the words.\n\nThey're so worried about being PC, but ironically you could accuse them of whitewashing the practice lol\n\nThen call it streching muahaha\n\nIt's their studio and they can do what they wish. But it's dripping in virtue signaling\n\n[removed]\n\nExactly this. Plus it feels judgmental.\n\nYoga means Union.\nThat’s the definition.\n\nSharing aspects that we love about other cultures, even if we pick and choose (which you sort of have to do in yoga - in any culture - there is just so much), helps create Unity.\n\nThis sounds like Cultural Avoidance. \n\nI also don’t feel you need to be an expert to share knowledge - is your second grade teacher able to teach math at a college level? Likely not. You still need their entry level teachings.\n\n&gt; Yoga means union. That’s the definition.\n\nJust to highlight the wonderfulness of Sanskrit, union is but one meaning of the word yoga or yog in Sanskrit.\n\nIt can also mean sum, total, addition, connection, or junction.\n\nThis is just one reason why it’s helpful for any yoga practitioner to become a student of Sanskrit. Translations are helpful at the beginning of yoga study but alternative translations are always possible and exploring them along with learned cultural, historical, religious, philosophical, and scientific context gives us so much richer knowledge.\n\nThe post is very “un-yogic….” Or “unyoga-like….”\nTo go with what you said about not using Sanskrit during a yoga practice. I completely agree. How on earth is it yoga without it? 🤔 It’s an important aspect of the practice. And, if people stop using Sanskrit…..that language will become extinct……and as I mentioned in another post….different culture I realize….but an Indigenous language dies every week…..Language is so important to preserve.\n\nThank you, finally someone here said it. People in this sub are way too comfortable stripping yoga of its origins and insisting that what they’re doing is not cultural appropriation.\n\nEarly on, I had a teacher who said he uses Sankrit terms the same way he would do if he was using French to teach ballet or fencing.\n\nAs a white middle-aged male whose first language is English but who speaks some Spanish, I find the idea that using words from a foreign language is cultural appropriation to be ridiculous. What’s the OP’s take on the river named “Rio Grande?” Should I call it Big River now, or no?\n\nHonestly, everything is \"cultural appropriation\". It's so exhausting.\n\nI’m so tired of the phrase and sentiment behind ‘cultural appropriation’. To me, if I want to learn and steep myself in another culture, or someone wants to learn about mine (e.g. Italian cooking) I think that’s the beauty of humans learning about humanity. I’m Caucasian. I practice yoga and memorize Sanskrit. I make reproductions of Mayan and Aztec art. I cook Mexican food. I’m a white DJ who plays soul music. I don’t care what anyone thinks. The Sanskrit in yoga simply describes the poses and the chants are deep and moving and beautiful. I am lucky to have studied with traditional teachers. It seems like this sign is from a studio in a conservative region that thinks yoga is somehow scary, but they still want to do the asanas.\n\nAs an Indian tbh I only ever had one western yoga teacher who used some Sanskrit in her teachings and if anything I enjoyed it. I thought it was very sweet to hear her use the actual terms even if they were butchered. I felt like it was more appreciative that way. I do agree that there’s a certain respect we should all keep towards yoga but for me that includes stuff like not sexualizing the poses or turning yoga posts into OF ads.\n\nDisconnecting the praxis from its heritage (with the names for the asanas) seems like the worse appropriation to me. Modernising it at the cost of erasing its heritage? Not a good take.\n\nUsing another language is cultural appropriation? Are we not allowed to say tortilla or huevos rancheros then? This is such a weird hill to die on\n\nGlad I don't go there.\n\nI'm a 33 year practioner. I studied with direct students of Muktananda and Papaji as well as 2 other \"schools\" outside of advaita. My first 3 of 6 instructors were directly from Bharat, not Westerners.\n\nMy gurus have all stressed learning some Sanskrit to understand the deeper meaning and context of the asana and to read the Vedas. There's much deeper symbolism than just the shape and its description. It goes into the mental map of how we see the world.\n\nI'm thinking...\nMy dad worked directly for Dr. King, and as a student of history, I am becoming concerned. So much of this \"stay in your own lane' attitude and all the talk of cultural appropriation smacks of the same kind of segregationist and eugenics thinking that my grandfather, father, uncles, aunts, and myself have spent multiple lifetime fighting. Perhaps if you're going to practice, that mentality should be the first thing to go.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBye bye cosmopolitism, hello ignorance\n\nCall out culture is boring me, call me in. Tell me what you need from me, you’re not my parent.\n\nAppreciation is acting in gratitude, appropriation is taking without appreciation.\n\nModern yoga was established in India, and most of the early schools originated from Krishnamurti’s teachings. They all established that the poses would be identified in a single language, so everyone whatever language they spoke could go to a yoga class and know what pose was being asked of them. \n\nMaybe this studio’s culture wants to only be for English speakers. Good they put this on door, so you know.\n\nThis is virtue signaling and it’s tedious and unnecessary — and no real yogi would take it seriously.\n\nIt’s about earnestness and compassion infinitely more than the pronunciation of words.\n\nSome disciples were voicing the sentiment, “The best a westerner can do is find a rebirth in India,” and Sri Nisargadatta barked at them (paraphrasing…), “This woman is a more genuine yogi than any of you!”  (Referring to Jean Dunn.)\n\nI get their point. I probably wouldn't have called it appropriation. That has a different meaning. But they are saying they aren't going to talk about something they don't know anything about. You can't do the traditional practice when you aren't from that tradition.\n\n[removed]\n\nShouldn't they call it \"mindful stretching\" then? Yoga is not an English word. They keep what sells and only ditch what requires effort, I don't see integrity here.\n\nYoga appears in the English dictionary. English is a mutt language so we've borrowed some words but not others. \n\n\nI've read through all comments. There are good points on both sides. \n\nIt does appear in the english oxford dictionary: \"a Hindu spiritual and ascetic discipline, a part of which, including breath control, simple meditation, and the adoption of specific [~bodily~](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=97f3021619811473&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;q=bodily&amp;si=ACC90nwdkA2npcVVmNPViiSe8FMKq9YpFUt9JBTInTA3N1uGxMZ60iqd0rworvkwhhYdmedqNenpBJj0vylUfWzuFlH89IkCKA%3D%3D&amp;expnd=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgrojdp7iHAxXGMdAFHUoNAugQyecJegQIGBAP) [~postures~](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=97f3021619811473&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;q=postures&amp;si=ACC90nx67Z8g0WkBmnrPB4IqtqGvSiaqhr0MbWuMTCRoEHSmPsoaGfvc7d9G_RoUhVmxTK2ArmXFWhWCIb43-k-UClaq4o_oBRhwR9ZppzCGxAqQZBF0ixs%3D&amp;expnd=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgrojdp7iHAxXGMdAFHUoNAugQyecJegQIGBAQ), is widely practiced for health and relaxation.\"\n\nSo, it is *literally* defined as a hindu spiritual and ascetic discipline. So a studio that teaches it merely as exercise is not teaching yoga according to the english definition either! Just some food for thought here :)\n\nI was not reading the post as they were denying the origins were Hindu. I was reading it as they were not confident or comfortable as teachers of the Hindu aspects. It's difficult to know from this one post exactly what they're practice is like. \n\nFor sure we don’t know the full context here.\n\nBut if a teacher is “not confident or comfortable as teachers of the Hindu aspects” of something that is *by definition a Hindu discipline*, should they be teaching it? Or should they be calling it something else? \n\nIt’s like saying a person who teaches a class about French cooking is not comfortable or confident with the French technique of preparing food. Even if they are offering Americanized-French recipes, they should have some understanding and respect and confidence for the origins, and in this case should not call the class “how to cook French cuisine” but rather,  “my own French influenced American cooking class”.\n\nYoga isn't just physical stretching though.. this studio is removing any spiritual or philosophical aspect from it, which completely empties it of what yoga is about.. Yoga means union and refers to the union of mind, body, and spirit.. it's much more than being about just poses..\n\nThe people who use the term \"cultural appropriation\" the most are the ones who don't actually know what it means\n\n&gt;  You can't do the traditional practice when you aren't from that tradition.\n\nYou absolutely can, if you have the interest and put in the effort. That's the crux of any gaining of expertise, or even change in religion.\n\nSo now it's cultural appropriation to learn a new language? Wow. Guess I better inform my tang soo do class. We count, name moves, and forms in Korean. \nI really disagree that learning a new language or participating in a class that uses the language of the culture it came from is appropriation. Tang soo do was brought to America by Korean founders, some which are still alive and participate in judging black belt promotions and they EXPECT their students to know the Korean wording for things. To them it's an indication of appreciation, dedication and respect for the culture. Kinda tired of yt people making up gatekeeping rules like this for the rest of us assuming they know better than those from the countries they claim to somehow be protecting. It's wild.\n\nYou have a black belt in reasoning. I figure also, wherever the practice originated, deserves at least a nod. Of course, my introduction to studio yoga happened with ALL Sanskrit, no explanations; and they moved relatively FAST--a slow flow, but I had been well over 50 years old at the time, and never that agile–in late 2008. Yes, that had been their lineage–something also then-respected. In a locality in which classicism in Yoga had its place (ironically, post COVID, even more so). \n\nOk, I strained my neck to see what others had been doing in that class as I am not going to ape a Gumbylady instructor. Aside from my strained neck, I forced myself to address why I had gotten angry. I embraced the challenge, not long after. Not enough to be interested in a teacher training; but for a few years\n\nThe idea that learning a new language is cultural appropriation seems extremely insane and extremely American. Only in the US is learning a new language a rarity. \n\nThere are definitely conversations and discussions to be had about how \"culture\" is used by people in different places, and not all uses are respectful, but the idea we should all just be siloed culturally is extremely regressive and is a cousin of bigoted, reactionary ideologies like white nationalism that claim bullshit like \"white culture is being polluted.\"\n\nPeople are forgetting the real appropriation aspect is that yoga has reduced into a fitness practice. it is actually a spiritual practice. of course you’re appropriating. \n\nNot using sanskrit is not the actual issue. but if you are just using a “foreign language” just to be respectful- you’re not actually paying respect to the origin and true meaning of this spiritual practice. \n\nNames are just names, until you learn the reason why they have those names… \n\nThe whiteness shows here\n\nI can kinda understand where there coming from ie there’s a lot of discourse on the use of Sanskrit etc. it’s a really nuanced topic that deserves thorough thoughtful discussion.\n\nI can respect realizing you don’t necessarily have the capacity to engage right now and stepping back from using it publicly ( you don’t need to announce your every move on instagram but I digress…). If that’s the case. IMO, as a studio, you should create a workable learning timeline to eventually answer your own questions and hopefully reintegrate at least some aspects where appropriate. Also recognizing that this isn’t a one time deal we should be growing and shifting our understanding of how to approach our practice over time.\n\nThis is passive aggressive virtue signaling that only serves to further the watering down of yoga. If you have a cherry picked, secular (some spiritual concepts don’t translate well into English and doing so muddles meaning) stretching/calesthenics practice awesome but don’t call it yoga. There intellectual laziness isn’t fighting cultural appropriation.\n\nI gotta respect the hustle though 😂that’s a way to get out of having to do hard work 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\nYes I did feel like it was very passive aggressive and pretentious, especially from their other posts.\n\n'We make our living selling paella and tacos. But we are not Spanish/Valencian or Mexican so we're going to call it yellow fish rice and salad corn cups. Because we be sensitive like that.'\n\nMaybe they should call their classes \"gringo yoga\"\n\nWords like mother, father, brother, sister, man, name, door, star, night, path countless others sound so similar to their Sanskrit counterparts. It is a significant ancestral language to all indo European languages... And Every word in Sanskrit is meant to be a literal vibrational manifestation of whatever the word is representing. \n\nHere's an idea, use the words but only the ones you study and learn to pronounce correctly.\n\nI'm white, so maybe my opinion doesn't matter as much, but not using the Sanskrit names for poses feels more like cultural appropriation. We're going to take something that belongs to a culture and give it English names instead of respecting the actual names? My best comparison would be ordering ramen, but calling it Japanese noodle soup. Respect the culture it came from and use its real name.\n\nI think it’s fine to advertise that you’re not interested in the culture. I would skip this studio and find another.\n\nIf you can say Louis Vuitton, Prada, Loewe, Gucci.. you can learn the Sanskrit words for what you are doing.. you’re profiting off of it?! How shameful and so typical.\n\nI would never go here. The tone of this post is extremely arrogant and defensive.\n\nNah, this studio’s tone is combative and not helpful. People trade and adopt cultural tropes all the time. Per Pew, yoga isn’t even practiced by most Hindus in India today. Jain are most likely to have a regular yoga practice. \n\nYoga should be available and accessible, however people choose to practice it. All tradition is a game of telephone.\n\nThese dingbats need to have a good discussion with some longtime yoga practicing Indians. Those people will tell you they WANT others practicing yoga. It is good for you. Even if you're, uh, white.\n\nThey WANT to have more people utilizing the practice for better people and a better planet. That's kinda the point. It's why they write books and open studios. They aren't looking to have some reason to complain about whitey. They are ya know, into yoga.\n\nStop telling people what they can and can't do based entirely on their skin color or nation of origin. Stop telling people who are trying to get healthier, happier, become more centered and stronger in life that they should be ashamed of the fact they were born outside the place yoga was invented.\n\nThis is so baseline stupid I can't even go on.\n\nthe tone is very condescending.\n\nalso what is \"westernised yoga\"? i think if you are teaching something to people then you are at an authoritarian position and the responsibility to teach correctly falls upon you. \n\nif people start following this concept everywhere, then things can go wrong. this is like history teachers be teaching their versions of history.\n\nall of this could have been typed out in a much polite and respectful manner. i think that's the very first lesson of yog abhyas.\n\nYes! The tone of this bothers me the most. I unfollowed this studio because of just how I interpret their other posts. Not the type of energy I want to be around.\n\nyes yoga is all about positivity, i am not even doing it for physical health. i just do it for mental peace and positive energy.\n\nThere’s always a fundamental misunderstanding of what cultural appropriation means. It’s using another culture to make money or look cool without understanding or appreciating where it comes from. Using the Sanskrit names can absolutely be done in a respectful way, yoga itself is a Sanskrit word. It’s erasure to teach a Hindu practice and refuse to use the words of that practice.\n\nI would love to find a yoga based practice which completely eliminates Sanskrit words and Hindu religion. And I say this as someone born into a Hindu family, and living in India. \n\nI don’t care much for debates about cultural appropriation, because the world would be an incredibly boring and depressing  place if we all didn’t use stuff that came from elsewhere. \n\nEverything from language we use to the food we eat has travelled thousands of miles and the world is a better place for it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAre they though? They say “when you” and then define a stupidly high bar to who can speak on something (no one fully understands a language or culture, even if it’s their own), and they say at their studio they don’t pretend to be experts as if that’s an edge that defines them from others. \n\nI generally agree with you, but I think the tone and content of this post suggests that they are inhabiting this stance from a place of judgment, not just one of honesty or authenticity.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey shouldn’t call what they’re doing Yoga - call it yoga-inspired exercise at best.\n\nThis is really what it boils down to. They are wanting to capitalize economically on the popularity of yoga practice without the pesky foreign words. That is the definition of appropriation. \n\nI really wish there a movement to use a different phrase for people who only want the fitness aspects. \"Flow Stretch\" or something along those lines better captures what a lot of people are looking for. It's a different type of practice to suit a different set of needs.\n\nI get where they are coming from but I am not marrying a yoga studio or staying with a single one unto eternity. Those words are relevant in most yoga classes and they're not helping me by not using them.\n\nRight? Like literally some poses I just know more by their Sanskrit names. There’s very little Sanskrit used by my favorite instructors (if I even clock what terms they use to signal), but sometimes as a pose reference it’s literally just the most helpful (e.g. for supta badha konasana).\n\nI appreciate that they don’t want to pretend to be someone they are not, or try to teach something they are not completely familiar with or confident with, like Sanskrit words.\nThat requires honesty and is the right approach. By all means, yes, teach only what you know. I respect that.\n\nOn the other hand I see only benefits in learning the language, the correct pronunciation, origins of the tradition as well as other forms of yoga (other than Hatha or yoga asana). And if someone has the knowledge and lives by it, why not share? Even if it’s just 1 hour of teachers day. However, in my view, yoga doesn’t stop once you step out of the mat. \n\nThere are different takes and that’s ok! Everyone should be able to take what serves them. I wouldn’t call the other way a cultural appropriation though.\n\n\nEdit to add that I don’t see Sanskrit as that sacred language that others should not dare to use unless they are Indian perhaps. It is A language! Meant to be used. And a nice one, very logical, organized and connected to a tradition. Just learn the proper way and try your best. They’re making it a bigger deal than it is and sound.. a little too virtuous\n\nwell, its honest, though just call it fitness class then if honesty is the point\n\nModern Yoga is pure cultural extractivism from the very beginning. Look around its (real) history and you will find out.\n\nas most yoga asanas teached in studios are a quite new invention (eg Krishnamacarya-1930 in Myosore, as written in Mark Singletons Book \"Yoga Body\") i am fine with naming them however anyone wants. one the other side, why don't learn how to pronounce something correctly? sanskrit is a beautiful language, there are also several online resources.\n\nThis is so weird.  I’ve never heard of using a non-native language as appropriation unless there is something culturally significant related to that language (ie certain mantras may have cultural significance where they might be intended not to be practiced unless initiated to do so by a qualified teacher).  \n\nIt’s baffling why they are so butt hurt about language but think the practice of doing yoga is okay.  Makes zero sense.\n\nas much i love doing Asanas and a nice warrior flow, i am much aware that i do some physical practice brought to \"me\" by Iyengar, Sivananda and Krisnamaycarya. \n🔅first description of 11 Asanas in detail: Hatha Yoga Pradipika, 600 years ago. \n🔅the much older yoga sutras of Patajanli: 2 Asanas described.\nwhen i do yoga, i read classical texts, i sing mantras, i meditate. i try to learn sanskrit cause the correct pronouncation of a bija or mantra matters in my tradition. \n😎\n\nMuch of the use of the Buddha's image within 'new age' schools and some modern western yoga establishments is, imo, pure exploition, idolotry, sacrillage, shallow, and/or just plain crass.\n\nFor decoration and advertising. 😆😆 Buddha would have laughed.\n\nMaking efforts, however modest and with whatever degree of success, to learn another language and study aspects of another culture-- how could these be anything but a mark of respect?\n\n\nI find this take foolish.\n\nI don't see how it's appropriation. Learn to pronounce the poses correctly and have actual respect, don't sweep the origin under the rug. Simple as that or don't even call it yoga.\n\nRename the studio Yoke Fitness. \n\nCultural appropriation ran amok.\n\nThey can teach how they want, it's the looking down on others I have issue with.\n\nMy fiance is Indian and has been doing yoga his whole life with his parents. When I take him to yoga classes that I started doing around college time he definitely feels a way about it. I think he would agree with this point of view in the screenshot. Don’t try to act like something you’re not, do it your own way while acknowledging the gap in knowledge/deep understanding will always exist\n\nWell, speaking from an a priori point of view, their statement does have a certain je ne sais quoi. Pero, I don't think their use of Sanskrit constitutes cultural appropriation. Do my first two sentences constitute cultural appropriation of Ancient Rome, France, and Mexico? No, they do not.\n\nIsn't it a bit hypocritical to focus on only the physical poses and movements and call it \"yoga\" and then whine about cultural appropriation? Whoever posted that can go blow it out of their ass.\n\nSanskrit is a dead language, just like Latin. I wouldn’t call it cultural appropriation to chant Latin phrases in a Catholic church. I was raised Catholic and I’m not Italian nor have I never studied Latin. When I do yoga, I’m using the Sanskrit terms to honor its beginnings.\n\n\"Look, we have a cookie shop but we've never eaten cookies before and we're not gonna try to learn anything about them to run our cookie business, okay?\"\n\nI’m so sick of the cultural appropriation debate. \n\n The main reason is that you are never going to please everyone. No matter what you do someone is going to be upset, so you might as well focus on teaching what you are qualified to teach and doing it as your authentic self.   \n\n  There is no agreed upon way to actually honor the Indian culture. The default is to bring Sanskrit into the class but when you scratch the surface you see that’s not really making much of a different. These teachers aren’t actually learning the language they are just learning a few vocabulary words. IMO that’s not actually honoring the culture, that’s also appropriating.  \n\n The same goes with iconography, art, etc. Some people will visit a studio in the west without ties to Indian culture and see appropriation because they don’t look the part. Some people will see a studio in the west *with* these thing and also see appropriation because they are trying to look the part but aren’t actually of that culture.  \n\n  Furthermore, when you actually look at the history of yoga and Sanskrit, you realize that the argument of cultural appropriation is nonsense. For many reasons.  \n -modern asana was not developed in India, it was imported from the west and folded into yoga. Is that not appropriating? \n -Sanskrit was used for much of its history by only a small select group of people. It was in many ways a language of gatekeeping.  \n\n  Sanskrit is not the language of the Indian people, it survived as a language only certain people were allowed to use and learn. It hasn’t been used commonly in over a millennia. So how on earth does that actually honor the actual teachings of yoga? Yoga itself was only available to certain people for a while and Sanskrit was a tool of that exclusion. Now, Sanskrit is often seen as a barrier for new practitioners. I could really go on about this all day. But it’s like I said in the beginning of my post. None of these teachers actually speak Sanskrit. They just use it to look authentic. Even if they don’t think that’s what they are doing, they are.  \n\n  Cultures are meant to be shared and spread. Thats what makes the world amazing. That’s why we travel. Italians don’t get up in arms about bastardized pizza they just focus on doing what they thing the right pizza should be. And don’t even try to say that pizza isn’t just as important to their culture as yoga can be in India. Food is a religion in Italy and it’s an integral part of their culture.  \n\n  The fact is that yoga wasn’t turned into a form of exercise by westerners. It was done by Indian men. They appropriated western gymnastic poses, renamed them to make them sound sacred, and now people get mad if you don’t call them by their “traditional” Sanskrit names. The whole issue is rooted in ignorance of the real history of the practice. \n\nEvery part of every tradition in every culture contains a lot of elements of what some call appropriation. It's what humans have done throughout our history. Appropriation is how cultures learn to appreciate one another and how they evolve.\n\n💯 \n\nThe only thing I would disagree with here is that I think you’re describing appreciation and not appropriation. And that’s something that often gets lost in the debate. Appropriation is rooted in profit. But much of our cultures spread more organically. \n\naromatic jeans lavish rock edge enjoy instinctive act wrench tie\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nTbh I’d rather take a yoga class from someone who is teaching from a spiritual perspective, and living a mostly yogic lifestyle in their daily lives. 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nIf I want someone to just show me the moves, I got YouTube for that.\n\nThe meaning of the word yoga in Sanskrit is “to yoke” or “to unite”. The concept of “cultural appropriation” is not compatible with yoga…yoga is for everyone.\n\n“Look at me! Look at how sensitive and aware I am!!!”\n\nAppropriation complaints in anything spiritual is such a contradiction. Your spirit has no race or better yet, it has all of them as we have incarnated many times in many cultures.\n\nWow\n\nI don't have a problem with this.  I also don't have a problem with using the sanskrit words. I have a problem when someone with no or little knowledge of cultural traditions or life experiences attempts a darma talk in the middle of a class.\n\nI think cancel culture is out of control. They do Yoga Asana classes and instead of butchering Sanskrit they use English translation, and they're upfront about it instead of selling you a disingenuous version of Yoga Asana that people will undoubtedly call cultural appropriation as well. \n\nYou can go to different sources for your intentions in Yoga, not every studio, class and teacher is a one stop shop for your Yoga needs.\n\nThey don't speak Sanskrit in India.  They love Bhagavan Das in India, he's from Venice Beach.\n\nYoga has 8 \"limbs.\" The \"exercise part\", is not really talked about that much in India. If you have the time, you can do it, but that is not what yoga is about.\n\nYou are running a \"sports &amp; workout class\", it's not Yoga. This is fine, but you are missing out on the other 99%. Everyone has to have a teacher explain the Bhagavad Gita to them, that's like Life 101. It's required. \n\nSource: it gets pretty chilly in those caves in North India.  Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.\n\n:-)\n\nI think it's fair to state that you don't know enough about something to teach it well and risk making the mistake of passing on wrong information, but I don't think everyone that tries to do it correctly or uses the portions they do know well enough and occasiobally makes mistakes is culturally appropriating either. In vedic chanting, which is very specific for pronunciation, my tradition ends with a chant that basically asks for forgiveness for any mistakes made. If you're going to use the language ij your teaching, just do some due diligence to practice the words from reputable sources, and verify what you have learned from your own teachers by checking other available resources.\n\nWhite washing under the delusion of appropriation.\n\nI feel it’s a perfectly respectable if perhaps possibly a tad pretentious position to take. I don’t think using vocabulary from a culture you don’t fully understand is cultural appropriation, but I also don’t think deciding not to do it for the reasons in the post is wrong, or watering down yoga. In fact I don’t think using Sanskrit names adds anything to the practice per se. There is space for both approaches as long as you don’t pretend your approach is the right one for everyone.\n\nI think this is actually a great and valid point they’re making. One that irks me about western yoga. Only a few studios like iyengar teach true eight limbed yoga. Its very rare for american teachers to be properly trained.\n\nYeaaaaa…. They are making a pathetic attempt to exempt themselves from part of the work and in doing so are actually committing an obscene, embarrassing amount of cultural appropriation and doubling down with a big dose of cultural illiteracy — taking an ancient tradition and perverting it into their own version because they lack the skill and grace to learn! Def NOT folks to be taking classes with, No Way. If they don’t know WTF they’re teaching (and clearly they don’t have clue), they are dangerous, sloppy, unsafe teachers, and shouldn’t be trusted with caring for student’s physical health and well being. In my part of the world, their business would crash and burn PDQ.\n\nA rose by any other name...\n\nIt's not watering it down at all. You can not speak, not travel, not practice with experts and still have a great journey. \n\nI don't know if it's appropriation, i think that's going a bit far. It's just calling the thing the thing's proper name. but that doesn't mean that if you're not an expert, you can't do yoga.\n\nI respect them for their integrity. I don't care if they're calling out other classes for being posers.\n\nAt the end of the day, your practice is about movement, listening to your body, and breath. \n\nThe reasons you become better and get more out of it are to do with you and your body and paying attention. Guidance is key but it's not necessary to overthink it. \n\nDon't sweat the small stuff. I'm not bothered by this at all. Just do yoga. This is not important.\n\nInteresting! All of my teachers swap back and forth between English and Sanskrit names for the poses. They sometimes give a bit more explanation or \"translation, as well.   I've never heard anyone complain about either. \n\nWhat bugs me, and could be considered appropriation, is an ex-coworker always signing his emails \"Namaste\" or using the word as a \"goodbye\", and he's never been in a studio in any of his 70 years. 🙄\n\nErasing the language that created the practice is the ultimate white washing. I don't understand today's progressive ideology.\n\nRidiculous modern day bullshit.\n\nIm always flabbergasted at how much weird shit yoga studios are coming up with when i read this subreddit. 🐸\n\nSo often I feel like cultural appropriation is actually cultural appreciation. I get pretty confused by seeing people turn a positive, respectful enjoyment of something in this world into a negative. I don’t want to live in a world where my eyes can’t be opened to other cultures and experience them.\n\nThis is just avoiding actually learning stuff\n\nWhen I had my teacher training, one of the instructors said she always uses the Sanskrit names out of respect for the culture, and another one said they never use the Sanskrit names out of respect for the culture.\n\nIt’s cultural appreciation. This is just virtue signaling and it’s appalling.\n\nThis is the sadness that internet cancel culture has brought about. We can teach cultural appropriation of yoga AND still use sanskrit words respectably. Erasing the history and language of yoga in mass city studios is worse than there being hints of it around the studio. Or maybe this studio should have a monthly workshop on the history of yoga so they don’t need to completely erase it. They are then uplifting the history of yoga.\n\nThere is a difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation. This yoga studio should learn the difference.\n\n\nRegardless, they are trying to come off as being respectful, but really they are just virtue signaling. Either way, it shouldn't really be that big of a deal, as long as both sides are being respectful to each other and other cultures. \n\nThis is why calling everything cultural appropriation is harmful. Now they’re just erasing the cultural aspects to try to avoid it. Awful.\n\nI do not understand why this protestation is necessary. It assumes that those whose culture it is, are incapable of guiding, educating and defending their own culture. It screams a faux sensitivity masking a parochial attitude. \nIm not indian but I grew up with Gujaratis. Of all the cultures Ive had the pleasure to immerse myself, the indian “cultures” (for there are many) are the MOST embracing, the most inclusive I’ve met. Given the opportunity they will GLADLY appropriate you into their culture. Like the food? Well they will feed you til you burst. Like the clothing? With great joy they take you shopping for your own sari or salwar kameez. \nLike the language? They will teach you as many words as they can stuff into your head, correct you when you butcher the words and laugh like its the funniest thing they ever heard. \n\nSince I grew up with Gujarati, I have an entire wardrobe of saris which I wear on any number of occasions. NEVER has Indian ever been anything but kind and complimentary. Granted some Auntie will come “fix” you if you didn’t get it quite right, but never ever have I seen or heard any criticism from any Indian to non-Indians delving into their culture. \nI also practice yoga and unfortunately my accent inclines me to butcher the language (despite my best efforts) but every native yogi just smiles and helps me pronounce it better, helps me practice the pronunciation and is eager to contribute new words to my vocabulary.\n\nIf they don’t like what you are doing or what you said, they are quite capable of telling you so themselves. You do not have to guess. They will teach you themselves. Therefore I encourage everyone to dive into the Indian cultures (for there are many) as you like. Revel in it, appreciate it, thoroughly enjoy it - for you will be embraced and you will be taught.\n\nSounds like they recognise their shortcomings when it comes to language and traditions and instead are focused on providing a class that will help with your physical wellbeing. Can’t fault them for being honest 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\n&gt;it just feels like you're watering down the traditional practice\n\nYes, that's exactly it. They are looking at a traditional practice that combines historical and cultural context, religion, spirituality, language and physical exercise and going \"I'm only interested in the physical exercise and think I can do that without all the other stuff\".\n\nI'm not sure I entirely agree with the idea that using asana names and similar is cultural appropriation. I also study karate and it is extremely useful to use the Japanese because, generally, it provides a sort of universal vocabulary that can be used across cultures and language, so when you say \"mawashigeri\", you know what's expected wherever you are and whoever you're talking to.\n\nBut it's fair that people can think that the asana names convey some degree of spiritual authority which they absolutely don't and I admire the writer's honesty about what they are offering and what students can expect.\n\n(Also, there a whole other dialogue about how modern yoga is utterly unconnected to historical yoga and was basically invented as a marketing tool to exploit credulous Europeans and almost only coincidentally possesses physical and mental benefits, but that's another story.)\n\n*. I also study karate and it is extremely useful to use the Japanese because, generally, it provides a sort of universal vocabulary that can be used across cultures and language*\n\n  \nAgreed and it's kind of like using botanical Latin if you're interested in plants. Like 'black eyed susans' is nice colloquially but it doesn't split the difference between Rudbeckia *hirta* and Rudbeckia *fulgida* and that's definitely pretentious if you're talking about it with someone who doesn't care about those things but completely necessary in the context of design, planting, management, getting the right plant in the right zone, etc etc. \n\nI'm sure the same is true in all sciences. \n\nA shared language is helpful.\n\nI think it’s wonderful. It acknowledges the depth that is out there, and that what most yoga studios do isn’t that.\n\nNow, let's see how far one gets dropping all Chinese, Japanese or Korean, etc. from the active, and even internal, martial arts. I do not think that goes over very well. Someone is bound to get literally hurt.  What is culturally appropriating is let's say, doing the practice to heavy metal music – and not just because I find that music jangles my nerves ... If yoga is supposed to be calming...start with instrumental music that may be considered calming to many, such as new age or neoclassical...\n\nI’m really confused by your last sentence. I certainly don’t practice yoga along to any kind of music, but do you seriously think that metal music is “obscenity without words?” That’s nonsense, and I don’t understand why it’s necessary to include that.\n\nDuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I love society cause it makes life easy but woah people have really lost it.\n\nI'm first generation Indian on my Dad's side. He passed away when I was a teenager. I grew up in the US, I'm American. I started teacher training and was reading the yoga sutras and I kept thinking about my Dad and the eye rolling he would be doing if I came to him preaching this \"philosophy\" of his people. I quit teacher training because it made me uncomfortable.\n\nNo one speaks Sanskrit daily. No one has since the Middle Ages. It’s a dead language like Latin. Using it for pose names is no more culturally appropriative than using Latin names for plants.\n\nWhy call it yoga then? That's a Sanskrit word right there! Just call it \"culturally appropriated stretching divorced from the mysticism that originated it\" if you want to go the whole honesty route.\n\nExp is ~30 years. I've seen similar philosophies a number of times. \n\nI am ok with it. Nice explanation upfront. Other examples have been similar. \n\nGotta allow for different opinions without villifying and condemning when someone chooses differently.\n\nSurely the best way to honor the practice of yoga is to actually do your best to teach it as it is practiced in the culture that it originated, and to include the spiritual aspects that are so integral to it. Presuming that it's meaningful to you\n\nI cant imagine Indian yogis are loosing any sleep over the fact that western yoga practitioners like to close their practice with a bow and a \"Namaste\".   I'm sure that the accusations of \"cultural appropriation\" are coming from narcissists that want to feel morally superior by condemning and belittling others\n\n  \nAt the school I practice some of the teachers close by saying Namaste and sometimes Im the only person that replies and to me that seems so disrespectful to the teacher when she says it with such sincerity. Its a beutiful gesture and I cant understand how anyone could genuinely be upset by it\n\nThis note would make me not want to attend this studio. Call it what you want, right or wrong, but to me it’s just bad advertising. It’s sounds judgey AF!  No one in yoga is making fun of Sanskrit or the yogic tradition by trying their best to use the original terminology in its original language.\n\nBut is it right to take a traditional philosophy and strip it of its truth….to make it just fitness? In that way we lose the essence of what yoga truly is…what the asanas are for. We lose the benefit of what they were created for…but that’s just my opinion. So yes, in a way this could be seen as appropriation or just a misunderstanding of a culture’s tradition and faith.\n\nI remember a local church started having yoga sessions, people complained about the \"religious conflicts\", so they just started calling them \"stretching classes\". Same poses and routines, just \"American Christianized\".\n\nI kind of agree with this. \n\nAbout 25 years ago I walked into a Dunkin and I was wearing an OM pendant. Long story short, I offended the person who waited on me. This was before “cultural appropriation “ was a thing. It always stuck with me. I meant no offense, I was trying to show my love for what yoga has brought me. Didn’t matter. I get it now.\n\nI get their point but if every use of a foreign language was cultural appropriation then how would anyone master a new language?\n\nAs an Indian and yoga trainer, I can't help but appreciate that guy! He not only acknowledged that he doesn't have in-depth knowledge about the particular subject but also aware of its historic roots! \n\nYoga is believed to be at least 3000 years old and there weren't any Sanskrit slokas at that time but were still passed onto generation to generation! \n\nOp, idk if you have any fight with your trainer or not but I would say from my perspective that we only want our students to be fit, healthy, and happy!\n\nat least they're open about it unlike most western practioners (indian and sri lankan)\n\nCultural Appropriation is just a new version of Segregation.\n\nI always appreciated one of my teacher trainers explaining a bit of The Sanskrit Effect theory and sharing that research has shown positive benefits of hearing and practicing Sanskrit. (Link below)\n\nPart of yoga, if it’s your path, is memorizing the verses and using them in meditation. (I’d be curious how that studio approaches the sutras.)\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/the-sanskrit-effect-and-how-rigorous-memorising-helps-the-memory/article22436878.ece/amp/\n\nTo each their own… but I try to offer a combo because I would not want to limit my students in being exposed to at least some Sanskrit.\n\nIt’s not that difficult to pick up a book and learn a little bit about the history of yoga??? It’s just being lazy\n\nRidiculous."

    "all_comment_text": "If you find a larger studio that employs a receptionist then she may be able to. The reason many studios lock the door is because the lobby area is where all of the personal belongings are there and can’t be left unattended. Where I teach there have been thefts from people targeting the cubbies in yoga studios. \n\nSo for those who think it sounds harsh that the doors are locked, it’s not just about making sure the space is free from distractions or disruptions. It’s literally about protecting your peace of mind that your belongings aren’t being stolen. Yoga classes can put people in vulnerable positions, particularly for those with trauma. I frequently tell my class “I will keep my eyes open if it will allow you to close yours.” If locking the door allows someone to finally be able to breathe and rest, I will do that too.\n\nSo true. My studio had someone leave a class early and rob the cubby room before leaving.\n\n&gt; I frequently tell my class “I will keep my eyes open if it will allow you to close yours.” \n\nThis line had me tearing up. What a beautiful phrase.\n\nMy studio locks the door right as classes start so it's not really possible to be late. They will also live stream classes online to members. If I'm running too late to get to class in person I will join the live stream and do the class that way. In person is better but I'd rather do it from the live steam than not at all.\n\nI lock the doors at the top of the hour when I teach. I’ve had karma yogis I’ve locked out of class. I do announce at almost every class that is what I do so that returning students will know.\n\nI’ve had students show 15 minutes early, start their breathing in a meditative way, and then have to stop and move their mat because someone showed up 3 min late. It’s my responsibility to protect the space for them.\n\nExactly. People are arguing that it's no big deal or has no impact, and we should just \"go with the flow\" and be compassionate. I think the more compassionate answer is to protect the energy of the space and not let the latecomer miss centering/grounding or disturb others who have set their energetic boundaries. Yoga is an energy practice after all. And if we want to turn to the philosophical teachings for guidance here, it's important to remember that lateness is a form of stealing, which falls under Asteya in the Eight Limbs - stealing time from oneself and others.\n\n100% this. There are plenty of students who show up early to prepare bc that time for themselves, at yoga, is sacred for them.\n\nI am similarly compassionate towards the students rushing to get there but showing up late. They likely need the class as well.\n\nBut in a world where you can’t have it both ways, I err towards honoring those on time.\n\nIf they can't be on time, they can show up early and wait.\n\nThis is what I do, I can't be on time for whatever reason so I get there early, go to the bathroom, fill my water, adjust my clothes, and sit in a supported butterfly or recline in a supine supported butterfly and focus on breathing 🦋 much less stress than rushing to be on time!\n\nI'm the exact same! I could never be on time anywhere, so I started being early. I've accepted I can't get my timing just right, and my solution is to inconvenience myself a little, instead of inconveniencing others. I'll always find something to do in the extra time, and it has also made me come across much less flustered when entering a space.\n\nYou are a saint!!!\n\nMe too! I'm also neurodivergent so being early and getting set up for class is a good way for me to feel prepared and get into the right headspace for class.\n\nSame! Yoga is so beneficial, and as a neurodivergent, latecomers really take me out of the flow. Getting there early is really the best answer.\n\nOr just sit in your car and play candy crush! I can be 20 minutes early or 5 minutes late, no in between. I understand neurodiversity but being late to yoga is distracting for everyone else in the room. We have to work with our brains not expect others to (always) accommodate them.\n\nSame! I’m chronically late lol so I make sure to always get to class early.\n\nYeah - I have adhd which affects the perception of time and more specifically how long it takes to do something/get somewhere.\n\nSo I’m always 15-30 minutes early, plus I love chatting with some people before class. \n\nBut outside of yoga if I have an absolutely important meeting that I cannot be late to - I’m often 15 minutes early\n\nThis is the way. As a yoga practitioner who is always early, there is nothing more annoying than than latecomers. Sorry. I realize neurodivergent ppl have rights. But so do I.\n\nAlso neurodivergent here! I arrive 39 mins early to setup my mat, use the ladies room, chat with the instructor, snap a couple locker room selfies, and then lay on the mat in  Savasana. \n\nThere are class times which I’ll probably never attend because it’s too difficult to arrive early. One of the principles of this practice is honoring your current state. So if my current state prohibits me from arriving early, then I skip that particular class.\n\nI’ve never been to a class where the studio was open 40 minutes early. Usually there’s a rotating door of back to back classes and we get max 10-15 minutes to settle in. I’m jealous!\n\nevery class snapping selfies?\n\nI agree! I'm more than twice 21. I'm a tardy person but part of yoga is discipline. It's the one thing I'll be on time for. Work, family, church,  a movie meh. But I don't disrupt yoga class.\n\nThis is the best comment of all. I’m neurodivergent with time blindness. I’m always the first one to unroll their mat because I don’t privilege myself over the group. Strolling into yoga halfway through the class is disruptive especially when it’s a full class and people have to rearrange their mats.\n\nTell me why I’ve struggled with lateness and adhd and god knows what else and never thought of this????\n\nIt sounds like this is the solution for OP although I just want to acknowledge that not everyone has that option.  My first yoga classes, which I was only able to take because of a school discount, had me running from one end of a campus to another after class to catch it.  It took me a few times to get into a routine of going to class in yoga wear and knowing the fastest route to run to not be late.  \n\nThe classes I took would lock the doors at the start but unlock them for latecomers at a less meditative part of the class.  It seemed to work well but it was also not a crowded class.  I think it would be more disruptive if people had to move mats or peoples were coming in during meditation.\n\nright? or do a class at your leisure at home.\n\nThe beginning/grounding part of the class is important- especially for someone with this type of struggle. Coming in in the middle of a class that’s already flowing and then frantically trying to catch up or figure out what’s going on is not beneficial to that person or to the energy of the class. Entering during grounding or first movements would be okay in my opinion, but not in the main body of the class. The rejection is not personal, it’s for the safety of people involved.\n\nI’m a neurodivergent teacher and I have to make it on time to serve my clients. \n\nI manage, because I have learned coping skills and strategies to not negatively affect other people’s lives.\n\nI attend a class where people regularly arrive late and are still welcomed in with a lighthearted attitude — and I'm not negatively affected because I've also learned the coping skills to recognize what is important and what isn't about the practice, and to always want people to join or leave on their own terms, at any time in the class, for their own sake. I think it can go both ways!\n\npersonally i think it’s better to come for some yoga than none. my students all know im cool with them coming whenever - but if the class is started, come in quietly and try not to disturb the other practitioners. i think compassion is key, and id rather be accepting of others over upset they couldn’t keep a timeline - id rather them be there than turned away. some yoga is better than none.\n\nI hear you but I used to practice at Dharma’s nyc studio a lot and I’m pretty sure they had a late policy. \n\nIt all depends. If it’s a candlelight evening class and someone comes super late, it becomes a safety issue for them and others. Or at one of these trendy super-active vinyasa places with sweat pooling everywhere.\n\nMore info is needed for context on this copied-over post for discussion .\n\nIt’s up to the studio owner to make their policy. I do think it’s possible to have a grace period of 10-15 min (depending on class length) to account for traffic and planning but then at a certain point… it becomes disruptive to other people’s peace and the experience.\n\nI have never been to a studio that allowed students to be 10-15 min late, that is absolutely wild and disruptive.\n\nI worked in one that had no limit on lateness, and a couple others that had between a 5-10 minute grace period — all in major metro cities with lots of traffic and subway disruptions. \n\nThe grace period ones I totally understood and I’d account for that in how my classes would start in busy periods…\n\nThe one with NO limit on lateness, was a bit much because people would come in, 30 minutes into a one-hour class, make a ton of noise and disturb people. Seems their google and Classpass reviews are reflecting increased annoyance with this.\n\n(I no longer work there because among other things, they wouldn’t allow me to ask people not to film themselves through the whole class. Privacy of other clients be damned, I guess.)\n\nThis got me to think that perhaps later-in-the day mysore type practices have a market out there. That way it doesn’t depend on a strict start/end time.\n\nSounds like they’d benefit from an on demand yoga program from home like peloton or down dog app. You can start as late as you want.\n\nI use apple fitness+ yoga classes when I can’t get to an actual class and it bridges the gap fairly well!\n\nI absolutely love the apple fitness yoga sessions. I'm not a group class goer anymore, I mostly practice at home and do my own flows, but when I lose inspiration or just want a different flow, I use apple fitness.\n\nI like the one lady, Jonelle, a lot. My son (a 6 year old who has the flexibility of a ramen noodle) really likes to watch and try to do the videos that one instructor Dice does. If he’s all keyed up and acting crazy he’s like “mommy I think I just need to do a dice man video” lol\n\nI love them all, but mostly Dice haha your son sounds awesome! 😁💕\n\nHe pretty much developed the interest on his own, which is really cool. I caught him doing a breathing exercise when he was upset at the store the other day.\n\n😍👏 wow so impressive. My daughter used to do breathing exercises when she was 3 to calm down. But she doesn’t do it anymore 😂\n\nOh, I love this! It will be so beneficial for him as he grows up.\n\nJonelle is an angel. I could follow her instructions all day. I wish she would supervise me doing my work.\n\nI love her guided meditations too. If you haven’t tried them yet, do it. 👌\n\nSounds lovely! Will definitely check them out.\n\nAs a student with ADHD, I understand life can get in the way of things. I show up early to prevent being late, as most studios here at most give you 5 minutes after the posted class time. \n\nAs an instructor, more than 5 minutes late and you are going into the more intensive parts of the practice with no warm up and can be hugely disruptive to people along with me. It’s to your benefit physically that you come on time!\n\nAs someone occasionally late to class this thread was actually enlightening to read and is huge motivation to show up on time 👏👏\n\nThank you\n\nMaybe yoga in the park, now that it’s summer. Less disruptive to enter the space tardy when it’s outdoors.  Otherwise , prioritizing time management and honoring when the energy or moods don’t allow attendance is due. A yoga class is a container and showing up late is not contrusuve to practicing mindfully or even safely- considering the warm up is an integral part of the practice. It’s akin to opening the oven door mid bake , it’s lets too much steam out.\n\nAs long they do it quietly and can slip in without disturbing others, I'm not bothered. In crowded classes, it can be very distracting to have someone walk between mats to get to a free spot.  Even worse are the people who ask others to move and make room.\n\nI recently had this experience. I was in a very crowded class, maybe 2 inches between mats, and a girl came in 5 minutes late and set up where there wasn't even a spot (we register ahead of time for assigned spots in the room). I was frustrated, but I focused on my own practice and not getting kicked in the head (she was directly in front of me, our mats touching). \n\nAt the end of class, I was speaking with her and she actually had registered for a spot, but someone else took it since she wasn't there on time. She got stuck in construction traffic and ended up a little late, forfeiting her spot. She thanked me for making space for her, and I was grateful I was able to make space so she could practice. It had been a while since she was on her mat. Ultimately, I left feeling bad about my initial judgement of her. \n\nWe all need grace sometimes. Maybe one day you'll be the late yogi who needs room. Just my thoughts.\n\nEveryone is late once in awhile as the unforeseen happens. To me, what is different about the snippet in OP's post is her daughter is *habitually* late. It would be very impactful for me (were I you in your example) if this scenario presented itself at most of my yoa classes.\n\nBeautiful, human response. Thank you for this.\n\nLife happens and I think most of us have experienced something like this. Certainly there is room for grace when the situation is out of our hands. I'm not bothered when this happens every so often. Being late on a regular basis and expecting everyone else to accommodate you as you frequently disrupt class is another story. I used to purposely set my clocks ahead so I would never be late. There are ways to get around it, or if you absolutely cannot, take classes at home on demand.\n\nIn a lot of my studio's more popular classes, the teachers will announce \"we've got [however many] more coming\" and encourage people to make room if they can. (Edit - that's usually starting about 5 minutes beforehand, I'd say, when most people are already there and it's already getting pretty full) They also will often start a couple minutes past the official time just to give those people grace.\n\nIt just happened today—the studio was running a reduced schedule because of the holiday, so the midday vinyasa was super full. The instructor made the announcement, and people made space of their own accord. She didn't have to dictate where or anything like that, it just happened organically. And a couple people did end up coming in a little late, but they had places to go, no one was surprised, and it was much less disruptive than it might otherwise have been. Since we did start slightly late, she also announced at the beginning of savasana that it was the official ending time of class in case people needed to leave, but welcomed everyone who could to stay and be guided out with a final meditation.\n\nAll in all, I think it's the most compassionate approach I've seen. It balances respecting everyone's needs as much as possible, just through simple, non-judgmental communication.\n\nNeurodivergent as well. I have felt the frustration of being locked out of yoga class many times. I was chronically late for things and still kind of am, but I am now early for my yoga classes &amp; meditation group because they lock the doors when class starts. Yoga locking is the doors to protect class actually improved me and taught me to be on time or miss out. I changed my habits to pretend class starts 15 mins before it actually does. Now I want to be there when doors open.\n\nI create a safe space for every one of my students. If someone is not on time, and I know they are likely on their way, I set up a mat and props for them near the entrance to the room. When they arrive I welcome them and gesture to their spot. If someone is perpetually late, I may question it privately, but in my experience this is a great place to practice letting go of things outside my control. Students will not always be on time. But I can ensure they feel welcome when they do arrive and their entry to class doesn't disturb the energy of the room. \n\nIf it is a drop in class and I'm not sure how many participants the class will have, I may leave the door open for the first 5 minutes and props easily accessible near the door. After that I close the door and lock it with a \"yoga in session, do not disturb\" sign. But regular students of mine know they are always welcome to come in and set up quietly. Maybe the 40 minutes they can attend of the class is the only peaceful time in their busy week. It's my job to hold space, and withhold judgement.\n\nGreat idea to set up a spot for those who are running behind. Especially near the entrance where it will be less impactful to the other students. I love this.\n\nIt really is a great idea! Thanks 🧘🏻‍♀️\n\n&gt;It's my job to hold space, and withhold judgement.\n\nThis is an attitude adjustment for the whole yoga community at large. (This thread shows that very well). Many of the folks hold judgement, and refuse to hold space. It's spiritual righteousness and a form of spiritual bypassing to act so aloof to other people's struggles. I can't help but imagine how these unloving midsets play out in day-to-day life beyond a yoga studio. \n\nThank you for posting this response.\n\nVery well put! I completely agree. I'm glad I posted my thoughts, I was nervous that I would be met with animosity and I'm happy to see that most responses to my comment have been positive.\n\nYes. Thank you for saying this.\n\nThis is such a kind and compassionate response. This is exactly the type of class I would love to attend. \n\nAs an ADHDer, I’ve spent a huge amount of my life running around (often literally) trying to get places in time and have met many locked doors. It doesn’t get less crushing each time it happens. \n\nA lot of the responses here seem to be attributing lateness to some character flaw or personal failing, when in a lot of cases it’s actually because of a disability. In yoga we try to practice non-judgement. I would love to see this extended more to people too\n\nI have ADHD too, but I take extra steps to accommodate that in advance (extra alarm, leave earlier, etc.). I don't believe that lateness in itself is a character flaw (and certainly not with ADHD), but I think that if we have committed our time to something or someone, we owe them the respect of doing our best to not inconvenience them with our lateness. \n\n\nWhen I'm preparing for a yoga class, I'll make plans to come early. When I'm in a yoga class and someone is disruptive, I practice non-judgment. Both can be true.\n\nThank you. This is so aligned with what I want my yoga practice to be: realizing you have a choice to get upset or to not, and taking the opportunity to be kind to others. \n\nYour choice not only leads you to not get upset but it’s a way to practice and show compassion for everyone. Chances are the person showing up late needs a little compassion  because they are stressed out. \n\nYou sound like a very centered, grounded person and it’s inspiring. Thank you so much for sharing.\n\nI love your kind response\n\nI had to scroll way to far to get to a response like this.\n\nI like this\n\nThis is so sweet. It’s nice to see some compassion on this thread\n\nUnacceptable. Neurodivergence doesn’t get you a hall pass for disrupting a communal experience. It’s unfortunate that this individual is struggling but it’s not the communities problem. \nActions have consequences, more motivation for her to find a workable solution for her issues.\n\nYoga With Adrienne on YouTube. Class is great, but having an instructor that allows you to meet yourself wherever you are, when you can, is better. \nFor some, time management and discipline help inform their practice. For others, acceptance and commitment despite irregularity have to come first.\nIt sounds like this person is just in the wrong atmosphere for their practice.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was going to say my job offers after work outdoor yoga and sometimes 20 minutes into class I'll notice someone who wasn't there before. It's on grass so you basically can't slam your mat or anything, and folks generally sneak in quietly. I have an evening yin where people are late sometimes and that bothers me a bit. It's a super popular class so there isn't always space, for some reason people end up flustered and slam their mat in the hurry to get started. The teacher doesn't mind so I don't say anything but......it's not my favorite.\n\nTwo studios in different cities I frequented started locking doors after someone snuck into the studio during class and stole from the front desk and changing rooms...\n\nNot sure why you’re being downvoted, my studio locks the studio doors a couple of minutes after the top of the hour (allowing for someone to be a couple of minutes late, but not terribly late). It’s because at both of their locations they’ve had issues with passersby coming into the lobby and stealing. It also allows a couple of minutes of grace for a late attendee, but disallows mid-practice disruption. I think it’s the best of both worlds. When I was younger and struggled more with time management, I’m sure I was grateful for that grace. Now that I’m older, I also appreciate that there is a limit to how late someone can be to the class and still attend.\n\nAs a teacher, I want people to feel free to arrive late or leave early, respectfully, if they really need to.  It’s fine with my style of class, and setting, and I won’t let people be disrespectful or less than minimally disruptive about it. But I’ve taught pre-/post-natal so long that I respect that on time arrival is not always within the person’s control.\n\nI also encourage classes that do have no-late-arrival policies, so there are spaces that have that expectation for those who need or want it.\n\nOccasional is fine by me. Regular lateness, I address. If it's clear that it will be an ongoing thing, I offer to set up a spot with props in the back where they can quietly slip in. I dont usually have that though.\n\nJust echoing what everyone else is saying, but as a neurospicy yoga teacher and practitioner myself, I find late arrivals to be inconsiderate and disruptive AND also detrimental to the late comer's practice because they'll most likely miss centering/grounding exercises.\n\nAs long as they're discrete and don't make a big production about coming and setting up,  I don't care. \n\n\nI'm focused on my practice,  as should we all be. \n\n\n\nAlso,  as someone with a very demanding job and slightly unpredictable schedule,  I can't be on time every time.  I come in from the back and set up at the back,  and do so as quietly as possible.\n\nas an always-late dude; yoga is the only thing i'm early to\n\nThis reminds me of a boss I once had.\n\nShe was a great person. But she was what she would call \"very ADHD\" and had several other disabilities she frequently talked about and she would use that as an excuse for everything. She never did anything on time. If we needed her to sign an important document to move it forward, it could actually take her MONTHS to do it but we all had to accommodate her.\n\nPeople started feeling really unfulfilled in the work. They would turn projects in to her that they worked super hard on and she would just...never take the time to look at them and they would fall into the abyss.\n\nShe also wanted everyone to work on her weird schedule. Our regular work hours were 8am-5pm. She worked somewhere around 1-10 with Fridays off. But she was frequently late to meetings and I never actually knew when she would show. She would hold people until 7pm sometimes. She would complain frequently that she didn't get enough contact with the team. However, She wouldn't let us schedule meetings on 3 days of the week because she \"needed the accommodations of down time to get things done.\"\n\nAs a result, our entire workplace stalled out. People became frustrated and eventually, quit.\n\nI also have neurodivergence, and am physically disabled. I struggled so much in the work environment because I was constantly told that these things were for her disability accommodations and I 100% believe that they were and that she needed them. However, her accomodations were flaring my disability symptoms.\n\nit became clear to me as a fellow disabled person that no matter how smart and capable she could be on her best days, the accomodations she needed for the job were unreasonable and untenable for the rest of the team. She was unable to adapt to other people's needs or find coping skills to make it work.\n\nIt is the same with any group activity, yoga included. We are the ones who mostly need to make accommodations for ourselves in order to make the group successful. We can occasionally rely on others to hold that space for us, as we should do for them, but if something is a known issue for us and there is something we can do about it, we need to find a way to accommodate that for ourselves or realize that, hey, this is just not going to work for us and our needs right now.\n\n\nTL,DR: It is still your daughter's responsibility to be reasonable and respectful of other people. She can be late sometimes and it's ok. If she is late every time and she knows it, she needs to take steps for herself to fix it such as setting an alarm or reminder, leaving 15 min early, or giving herself extra time after her last activity to show up.\n\nSorry, no. My favorite studio (which since closed for unrelated reasons) was the one that locked the door once class began. \n\nI use what’s called an idiot buffer. I know I’m terrible at organising my time, so I add extra time for any journey, or aim to arrive half an hour early, so in the usual case where I arrive late, I’m actually on time or slightly early.\n\nPersonally, I don’t appreciate latecomers.  But whether it disturbs my practice likely depends on how full the class is. \n\nIf the class is at say 80%+ capacity, there is no way you aren’t disturbing everyone unless your instructor has made sure the latecomer door spot is available.  In that case, take that spot whether you like it or not!\n\nIf you are attending a class that is &lt;50% full, I think it is much much easier to be late and not disrupt the class as much. \n\nI routinely take a class that is overcapacity.  Being late and expecting to get in would be crazy disruptive. \n\nI’ll also mention that I’m sure your class attendance agreement asks you to be 10 minutes early.  So you are functioning late if you arrive when class starts. \n\nIf it’s like once in a blue moon, that’s one thing. Being late on the regular isn’t okay\n\nAs a yoga teacher this is what I would say before class started.\n\nSome people may show up late. But we aren’t going to worry about them or any noise because we know that yoga is simply practicing on the mat to prepare us for the real world. If someone walking in stresses us out and we find judgment in it, it is the perfect time to begin to train the mind and practice compassion. Maybe they couldn’t help being late. Should we deny them their desire to connect because of external forces? Maybe it’s because what I am saying, they aren’t ready to hear yet on their path…. What we get to focus on is ourselves and going within. This is one of the 8 limbs… Dharana. Have you ever been in that place where you are so focused on what you are doing that you can tune out the whole world? Getting to this point and not even realizing a person walking in is the goal. Blessing them for making it and having the courage to still walk in is the goal. Love and community is the goal.\n\nWe don’t let people in after 5 minutes late because we have no front desk person. Locking the door keeps students belongings safe.\n\nMy studio offers a 2 hour Mysore slot where you can come when you want during those hours, however it's self led Ashtanga style.\n\nAssuming you have space, of course. \n\nBut self led? Why not just stay home?\n\nI think context matters. There isn’t a single answer.\n\nMysore style Ashtanga might work for her, usually people can arrive anytime between, say, 5 am and 8 am with no issues.\n\nI have ADHD and have been a yoga teacher for over 20 years.\n\nI can empathize with the time management issues, but part of yoga practice and part of becoming a functional adult is working towards being more aware of yourself and others. Another part of it is realising that the choices we make in life affect the opportunities we are given.\n\nI've also worked with an occupational therapist who specialised with ADHD adults and one of the most helpful things they taught us was to prioritise the things that were most important to us and to make sure we arrived earlier than normal in order to compensate for our lack of time management skills.  \n\nAt the end of the day, it isn't anyone else's responsibility to make sure you arrive on time to events.  It also isn't reasonable or fair for an entire group of people to be disturbed by people coming into a class late.  \n\nADHD adults are perfectly capable of leading normal, adult lives.  We just have to make some adjustments for ourselves.  When we do, there is much less stress, symptoms tend to settle and quality of life improves.\n\nLogistically, in order to accommodate a late student at the studio where I teach, I would need to see them at the lobby door (meaning my focus is not on my class), then leave the room to let them in during the time I should be getting my students settled and in their breathing, talk to the person in the lobby to make sure they have everything, and then either wait for them to enter the room, or go back and continue teaching after the disruption only for the late person to disrupt class again when they enter the studio space. \n\nIn all honesty, as a student, I don’t mind if someone comes in late. And as a teacher, I wish that I could realistically let them in. But in reality, I am the only employee on the premises, and I have an obligation not only to my students who arrived on time but to myself as a teacher and a professional. \n\nI’m not irritated, I’m not angry, I’m not passing judgement. I mostly have to clear the part of me that feels sad/guilty that the person missed their practice. But I believe it is the fair and respectful thing to do for the group and to set standards for the community so that people can trust and feel safe.\n\nI am neurodivergent myself and have issues with lateness, or more like I have a poor perception of how long it actually takes me to do things. I just leave extra early if I go to a group class. I’d hate to be disruptive, even on accident like if I got caught in traffic or construction. Maybe this person should try online classes, and hopefully the mother is helping teach her time management skills. Just because she’s ND doesn’t mean she can’t learn or adapt. We’re not dumb, just need to try different approaches\n\nPersonally people coming in late doesn’t bother me though. A little kindness and understanding goes a long way.\n\nI set out mats for late comers in the very back. I’m ok with people being late because no one is perfect and shit happens\n\nSometimes it distracts me but it never bothers me. I see it as an opportunity to challenge or reengage my focus.\n\nSomeone entering or leaving a class does not bother me because I feel lighthearted, independent, and in control of my goals for my practice. Even if I got a pain some day, judgement and enforcement does not benefit my body. \n\nWhat annoys me is bad energy next to me and then making fierce unwanted eye contact with me during flows from under their arm. Frightening!\n\nIf she loves yoga so much,  maybe she should get to class on time and gain the benefit of the full practice. Namaste.\n\nThe entitlement is wild! Take the steps to ensure you can be somewhere on time or deal with the consequences of being late. It’s super distracting when people come in late, slap their mat down, go to the prop room, etc. when the class is trying to settle in.\n\nSorry about it, but being disruptively late to anything, especially a yoga class is not acceptable because it ruins it for everyone else. It's disrespectful and just rude.\n\nNeurodivergence is never an excuse for anything. It's an explanation, but never an excuse. Tell her to set a reminder alarm 15 mins earlier than needed and see if that helps.\n\nThat or tell get to do yoga videos or classes online where being late is not going to be disruptive to others.\n\nI always make it a point to get to yoga about 15-20 minutes early so I can be sure I get one of my favorite spots and so I can take my time to set up and relax before class starts. Getting to class close to start time feels late to me. Actually being late and having to setup would leave me so frazzled. \n\nI have ADHD so I am sympathetic to this woman’s daughter but you to have set yourself up for success and learn to manage your time. Not only is it respectful of other people’s time to be on time, but causes fewer problems for the individual who is late. There are financial and personal ramifications to being late. Starting to work on punctuality on something low stakes like a yoga class is a great place to start.\n\nPretend it starts an hour earlier …\n\nThe YMCA doesn’t lock the door\n\n[deleted]\n\nProbably less selfish and more stunted given she’s 21 and her mom is still swooping in to figure things out for her 😬\n\nThank you. I'm like...why is the mom of adult writing this post and still managing her daughter's life. Cut the apron strings and let the daughter sink or swim on her own.\n\nI teach yoga at a local studio. Some studios have policies that are out of the instructors hands,  but as a general rule of thumb, I am happy that someone takes the time for their practice. I am neither offended by people coming late, leaving early, or stepping out for a minute. This is the same for any fitness class. Warm up’s are important. They reduce injury, introduce movements, prepare for what’s coming. Any yet  - I can successfully guide a class through that. Most instructors can. There are things I won’t tolerate during class (filming, talking on the phone, side conversations), but I don’t have a clue what obstacles are in someone’s life or what their schedule is. All this to say - come as you are when you can.\n\nI’m a yoga teacher, I allow my front desk coworkers to let in students after centering/grounding meditation. If they show up, they can come in as long as it doesn’t disrupt others in a meditative state. I also ask that anyone who can’t stay for the entirety of savasana to skip it all together so as to not disrupt the other yogis. However. If someone is consistently late and/or bullying my front desk coworkers to let them in during centering then there will be a conversation (I’ve had these situations before).\n\nI really empathize with her daughter - so after being chronically late for everything in life, I started being super early for everything. I just find things to occupy my time while I’m waiting. \n\nPerhaps she should suggest this to her daughter rather than look for a studio that will excuse chronic tardiness. A set schedule worked for me (although I realize it won’t work for everyone).\n\nThe way you compensate for lateness in neurodivergence is by LEAVING EARLIER. Even if that means you’re sitting in a parking lot for an hour (I’m ND and I’ve done it).\n\nThis is the kind of thing that just rubs me the wrong way. I realize not everything works for everyone, but learning how to compensate for that is an important life skill ND or not. More chances bc you’re ND is one thing, but there are consequences if you abuse the extra accommodation.\n\nWhile I do agree I’d struggle with a class that is super strict on the lockdown time and I think a 5 minute window would be reasonable… it 100% disrupts me when people are arriving late and still having to grab mats etc. And at least she’s trying to find a place that does offer that instead of expecting the studio to accommodate I guess.\n\nTbh a class at a standard gym would be her best bet.\n\nI have ADHD and I show up early to places because of it. She needs to do the same. Also, she’s 21 why is her mom posting like she’s a child?\n\nNeurodivergent person here! This is why I almost never go to actual yoga classes. Or any classes. And finished highschool mostly online. And am self employed… \n\nThere are plenty of great yoga teachers on YouTube, and I can show up whenever I show up. Easy peasy. Sometimes there are classes with this kind of inclusivity in mind, but you can’t expect every single niche to adapt to your particular brain’s lovely uniqueness\n\nI don't mind people coming into class late but maybe it's because I have a lot of experience under my belt so I don't lose focus easily. I'm ND too but I don't think frequent lateness is something that requires accomodation. Maybe aim to arrive 30 min early and wait. Wasting your own time by waiting is not as selfish as distracting others.\n\nI guess I'm in the minority here because as a teacher, I don't care if my students are late provided they are respectful and minimize disruptions when they enter, and they always do. I never lock the door. Life happens. Get all the yoga you can. As a student it doesn't bother me either. I don't even notice.\n\nIt’s sad that you are in the minority. As a student is it a little distracting? For like 30 seconds, and then I get back to it. It’s nothing earth shattering and it won’t ruin my entire practice for the evening. But I so appreciate when I receive grace and compassion and understanding from a community, and I have been lucky to find a few yoga groups that are me as I am where I am. Sometimes I am the late one, and they always have a mat and bolster for me. 💜\n\nGoddamn, the JUDGMENT in this thread. Don’t we all practice yoga? \n\nHow about instead of letting someone else distract you so much that you then become so focused on them you can’t focus on anything else, you work on that issue for yourself?\n\nPeople come in late. Life happens. I would much rather that the person putting in the effort to get to class can participate, rather than caring if they make a little noise while coming in.\n\nYoga should be a welcoming space for everyone, even those *heathens* who dare to be late.\n\nExactly. These comments are wild.\n\n\"Late patrons\"?\nNope...Yoga is for living patrons.\n\nGuess it depends on where the patron is on their karmic journey!\n\nEvery studio I have ever been to prior to my current has locked the doors at exactly the start time which I am a huge fan of. It’s respectful of those that showed up on time.\n\nThe studio I’m at now, unfortunately, is notoriously late. People walk in 5-10 minutes late, make us all move our mats. It’s upsetting but I’m learning to let it go. I’m also choosing to go with the teachers that support timeliness. \n\nI feel like if you’re chronically late, go with a virtual class. \n\nI had a college professor(non yoga) who said if you’re gonna be late, don’t even come.\n\n\nEdit to add: when someone comes in late to the classes I attend, the teacher has to stop to make room for them and then teacher always run late ending the class. Or the teacher chooses to start the class late to wait for the person and then runs late (we have to sign up online). So it impacts every person in the studio. Do I get up at the correct end time and disrupt others in shavasana or do I let myself be late for work? It’s honestly unfair to others. \n\nI almost choose to not stay with yoga studio because of this but I love the owner and certain teachers.\n\nThis almost looks like rage bait or main-character syndrome. \"being turned away is crushing\". How about show up on time and respect the other people in class who don't want to be rattled and distracted at the beginning of class when you are breathing and settling in? The bar is so low it's underground.\n\nThe yoga studio I attend welcomes late comers.. and honestly they have never been loud or disruptive. I understand that arriving late can be distracting for some. Yoga is a practice that includes focusing of the mind. Each persons experience with this will be different. With that being said, Neurodiversity is considered a form of disability. I would be hesitant to not allow someone to attend a class, especially if I understood the circumstances. It’s yoga. My son is Neurodiverse, and struggles with punctuality. He has worked for his employer for 2 years and may be 5 minutes late here or there, but never misses work. His boss is very accommodating of this issue- thankfully. This world would be a better place if we all practiced som temperance, along with our yoga..👌🙏🏼\n\nShe's literally just asking for recommendations for a studio with an open door policy. Not saying that should be a norm. Why not just answer her question instead of preaching and casting judgement?\n\nI don’t mind if people are late. Shit happens. Traffic, pets, kids, etc can all cause someone to be late.\n\nSome yoga is better than than no yoga and life is full of unplanned disruptions\n\nCan’t expect the world to cater to them if they’re unwilling to change. Being late and disruptive takes away from everyone else\n\nSo the yoga studio where I practice and teach is somewhat lenient on being late, but the owner will put you on blast if you leave during savasana.\n\nI don’t mind people who are a few minutes late if there’s room in the class. My main problem is that my studio is quite small so oftentimes a late person can’t just slip in the back. Half the room needs to adjust to add a mat. Pausing the class for a few minutes to shuffle around is very annoying. Thankfully, folks are rarely late.\n\nAs someone who works seven days a week (and a few nights a week), there’s days where I have to walk in just on time or even a couple minutes late. I know it can be a little bit of a bother but I try to come in as quietly as possible, and when possible, come early. My studio has assigned numbers most of the time and has a 5 minute grace period.\n\nmy adhd caused the same issue, so now i just take private lessons. might bit be the perfect solution for everyone, but has been working for me. ofc the class ends on time and however much i was late, that’s how much class i pay for and don’t get. the instructor gets paid for every minute whether i wws there or not so they’re never mad at me either.\n\nBigger box gyms with yoga classes might be a good fit. Places like Life Time will still have a studio feel, but often they'll have folks coming to yoga from other classes or moms dropping off their kids in the childcare center. They'll tend to offer more grace to latecomers.\n\nLA Fitness has yoga classes and doesn’t matter when you walk in. It’s also much cheaper and may be a good way to get her started.\n\nMy studio locks the door when class starts, so no late entry. It's just basically one room with cubbies, so no lobby or reception.\n\nJust do yoga at home. No lateness. No disruptions.\n\nIf someone comes late to class, I am just going to let it roll off my back. But if every single class I'm in someone comes late, especially if it is the same person, at that point it's habitually disruptive to my practice and focus. TIL I learned time blindness is a thing. I empathize. But at a certain point if you want to participate in the practice then I would imagine you can put measures in place to arrive on time— going to a class at a consistent time, a timer for when you need to get ready, a checklist of what you need to do to get ready, a timer for when you need to leave, allowing plenty of time to plan to arrive early, etc. We need to both have compassion and grace for those that are different but the consideration of other practitioners also needs to be taken into account.\n\nHonestly, this seems like a great evolution moment for your daughter. The truth is, someone coming into a yoga class 10 minutes late is disrupting, no matter how you slice it. \n\nTo me, arriving on time shows respect for my instructor, my fellow yogis, and most of all myself! \n\nI also have issues with lateness (will have small anxiety attacks), but it’s MY responsibility to adjust. I can’t be consistently late to work or class without consequences, and the studio is no different. What works for me is:\n\n- putting all my yoga courses in my Google calendar with reminders  \n\n- I pretend every class starts 20 minutes before it actually does. That way I’m always early and have time to settle in before beginning. \n\n- I get anxiety when running late so if it’s unavoidable, I just won’t go. Instead I’ll go home and put on a YouTube flow or join a Zoom class. I still get to enjoy my flow but with less pressure\n\nSet several alarms. Does she drive? Take the bus? Walk? If she drives set an alarm to leave 20 min early, if bus go on an earlier bus…\n\nAs a participant, I don't care at all. I'm very focused on my own practice and I get that others need to do what they need to do to make it work. I am surprised to see so many responses here saying that it disrupts the community - community is often about accepting people as they come.\n\nMaybe this is a sign that she needs to learn to not be late? 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nNot just to yoga class, but to anywhere.\n\nI think it’s important for us to have empathy and recognise everyone is on their own healing journey and not look at lateness in a judgement or shame fuelled way. I am pretty certain no one *wants* to be late but it is possible there are other things going on in that persons life which makes being on time incredibly difficult and equally it’s possible they are using lateness as an excuse or a tool for avoidance because it serves them. Either way, it’s nothing to do with us because the only person we should be analysing is ourselves. I actually think it’s a very mature response from the writer of the post to decide to move to a studio where lateness is more relaxed, so I don’t think they have done anything “wrong”\n\nAs a yoga teacher who has ADHD, I appreciate this topic. (As a student, I have struggled with losing focus in my day and getting to class before, as well.)\n\nIt depends on the type of class. For safety purposes, some studios have a strict policy that needs to be 100% enforced. \n\nBut lateness caused by neurodiversity is a real medical symptom. Not everyone understands. \n\nThese students could greatly benefit from yoga and should seek a supportive community that would offer flexibility.\n\nAnd most importantly, they need to communicate their medical needs to the studio and teacher in advance.\n\nAnyone who is running late to class should call the studio to either let them know they won’t make it OR to see if it is okay if they come in (however many minutes) late. That way the teacher is prepared and can save them a spot that is safe for all students when they enter the room.\n\nKeeping the student-teacher dialog open is important. As a teacher, I would work to help individuals who struggle with this - not by allowing it to be a norm - but by offering grace and highlighting the concepts of focus and commitment in classes with this particular student.\n\nThe studio I go to has some people who routinely show up well after we have started and it doesn’t bother me. I just focus on myself and try to just keep the practice between my ears, what anyone else is doing has nothing to do with me.\n\nI think what she needs is one on one classes if she can’t arrive on time.\n\nI really feel for this parent and I see so many compassionate (and not so compassionate) responses here.  I don't think a diagnosis entitles us to disregard the experience of others who may be disrupted, but for me personally, a locked door policy is just not welcoming, accessible, or hospitable. If I could talk directly to this parent, I would suggest looking for yoga offerings in non-studio settings first. Neurodivergent-affirming options are becoming more numerous and accessible, and their child's therapist, OT, or other support person might be able to recommend or help them find a group or even private teacher while she builds the skills and supports to get to a studio class on time. That could be a great goal for her to work towards! I do think that nuanced, neuro-affirming studio policies could hold space with this family as they support their adult child navigating a world that isn't designed for them, but most studios are not equipped with the processes or expertise to do so.\n\nI find late entries terribly disrupting. The studio is a busy one so it usually involve multiple people rearranging their positions. \n\nTheir best bet will be to join a gym that has a yoga class. Those tend to be more fitness focused and have more room to spread out so late entry isn’t as big a deal.\n\nTardiness is not a neurodivergent issue. Someone who is ND may be late, but that doesn’t mean their mental health makes it so it’s impossible to be on time. \n\nThis person is always welcome to practice at home, there are plenty of YouTube videos that make yoga accessible. That is a good way to support your mental health and your practice.\n\nAsking a studio to allow 1 person to be late can impact the practice of everyone else. I doubt this person understands that tardiness can have an impact on others. If I were in a studio and someone showed up late, I’d probably find a way to ignore it, but as a studio owner or a teacher I’d like to reduce the work my students have to do to get to the right headspace.\n\nMy studio locks the door at start of class. As they should. Framing this as \"crushing\" and blaming whatever condition she has is ridiculous. An entire class shouldn't be expected to not be bothered in the name of yoga\n\nI think the issue you will run into is yoga studios also lock their doors a couple minutes before class for the safety of the community.\n\nIf the teacher is in the room leading a class, they cannot be responsible for what happens outside of the room.\n\nIf there’s someone minding the lobby, I don’t think it’s a big deal if they quietly gesture the person into the yoga room.\n\nYes, exactly. Unless there is someone else staffing the front desk and keeping an eye on things, it can be a security risk to leave the entrance to the studio open to the public. That's how stuff gets stolen.\n\nAlso, if a teacher is opening the class with a meditation, body scan, etc. then it can be disruptive to have people shuffling in, moving props and mats, etc. Particularly for trauma survivors.\n\nFor a yoga group, some of y'all in the comments are pretty aggressive in your beliefs. Part of Yoga is about freeing yourself and your attachment of self. Someone simply walking into class late should not be interfering with you and your practice. Unless this person is obnoxious and truly disruptive then the teacher can speak up. It makes sense that people have a \"no late policy\" but to get upset at someone looking for a more relaxed rule is kind of contradicting your practice of Yoga.\n\nThis person has a disability. Some empathy from fellow practitioners would be nice.\n\nA lot of vehemence in these ‘people cannot be late’ replies. Sending big love to OP. I appreciate this was not exactly what you were asking for guidance on.\nI also appreciate how the anxiety of being late can collide with the anxiety of ‘not fitting in’ and become its own self-fulfilling prophecy. Then there can be the anxiety of being early and feeling awkward/wrong - for all the many reasons the brain can give. Then the shame of ‘not being quite right’.\nLife can be hard living through the goldilocks lense. \n\nBreaking these speed bumps down and creating a step by step workable map has helped me. Class starts at X. This means doors are locked at X and I need to be there X mins before. (This always tricks my very literal brain).\nTo get there I need 5 minutes to walk from X. Or, I need 15 mins to park and walk. It takes X time to get there on bus X. This means I need to leave by X. It will take me X time to get ready.   That is just me. Breaking down my mental obstacle’s and breaking down the time/distance obstacles helps my brain and anxiety.\n\nTell her from me, not to give up. Giving up feels even worse. It’s a process. Keep it fun. For me it’s easier to keep it fun when I ignore the vehemence from others about how I and the world should be, and stay centred in my own quests. Even if that quest is, how can I get to yoga on time (which actually means 5-10 mins early). All the best.\n\nAs your guru will tell you, you ALWAYS make room. Else you have missed the entire point of yoga.\n\nIt’s NOT an exercise class. Most people miss that.\n\n“Struggling with lateness” is wild\n\nExecutive dysfunction is a wild experience and compassion tends to be more helpful than judgement. Not saying that this person should just waltz in late to every class, that would be super disruptive, but they may be experiencing executive dysfunction and need encouragement to find ways to work with/around it. This person's brain is quite literally operating differently so they may struggle to perceive time passing in the same way you struggle to perceive non-visible light.\n\nI'm not trying to aim this comment at you specifically, it's just that seeing this thread as a neurodivergent person has reminded me how intensely I am not welcome in the yoga space even if my practice is disruptive to no-one. It's not just that I may need a timer to get there on time, people judge that I even needed a timer. It's not that I am practicing quietly, it's that I prefer to hold poses with my eyes closed. Even so much as an inclination that a person needs support and it's \"wild\". I am so so so grateful to my past self that I quit practicing in public. I hope the general sentiment around neurodiversity continues to shift, and I hope that this person figures out what they need for their time perception and finds non-disruptive ways to practice in the mean time.\n\nThank you so much for saying this. It’s fine if teachers want to put a boundary and say that for whatever reason they won’t be able to allow late comers - if I know that in advance I probably will just find another class to attend as I know that lack of flexibility won’t work for me. But the absolute judgement that some folks are bringing to this discussion is really disheartening. \n\nI’m lucky to have found a studio that takes a non-judgemental approach. I still remember the anxiety I had the first time I was a few minutes late. I went up to apologise at the end and the teacher’s kind response was what made me keep going back multiple times a week. I explained to her that I sometimes struggle with time. She responded that she could see I probably really needed that practice today more than ever. She was right. I’ve only been late once since, but it was so lovely to arrive and feel at ease, rather than as the ball of stress I had been the first time.\n\nI am so glad you were able to find a studio and teacher that are actually practicing non-judgement and creating an accessible space for people to get on the mat! That's awesome! Hopefully that becomes the norm.\n\nMy current studio locks the outer door 1 min before class, but people still screw around in the changeroom and meander into class late. Some people are respectful and quietly put their mat down and just join in, while others noisily throw their mat on the ground, and step over other mats to collect props.\n\nLocking the classroom door is a problem because I acknowledge some people have bowel or urinary problems that require them to run to the bathroom, and if someone's feeling overwhelmed I think they should have the right to leave a hot room and chill out for 10 minutes before rejoining. But there are more disruptive and less disruptive ways to do this...and not everyone chooses the right way.\n\nI don’t think it’s that deep. Just better be quiet asf coming in.\n\nPart of yoga is learning self-discipline. Arrive on time. That is common courtesy, as well. Your daughter’s “neurodivergence” isn’t an excuse to interrupt other’s practice.\n\ni agree 100%.  empathy is ok but disrupting the experience for everyone else is not the solution.\n\nBe there early, or else you're late.\n\nExpecting people to be on time for a voluntary class isn’t ableism, lmao.\n\nFind a different studio that has an ope. Door policy\n\nMy yoga studio is a little too flexible with this. It's a small and social community, and classes rarely start right on time and people are often a few minutes late. It's annoying, but it's the most convenient place for me to practice.\n\nMy studio locks the door about 5 minutes after class so late arrivals aren’t a worry. But I think I wouldn’t mind because I tend to block out the people around me. \n\nPhysically, I would worry about missing the meditation and warm up sequence at the beginning of class. A person could injure themselves.\n\nFirst thought: my studio, because there's not a warm body in the lobby and the studio owner herself has had her shoes stolen, generally locks the doors at the start of class.\n\nSecond thought: I 100% have the \"15 minutes early or 15 late\" model of ADHD. I've known this about myself since I was a teen, and I plan around it.\n\nThird thought: My anxiety, at the thought of walking into a meditative space late, just...scheduled me some unplanned savasana and breathing.\n\nJoin a big gym like 24hr Fitness (USA) that has group classes.\n\nI'm neurodivergent and I deal with my chronic lateness by arriving very early, over estimating all timing, and sit with a book while waiting. I don't think it'd be fair to disrupt a mindfulness practice of others to accommodate me. Unless the class was specifically for that purpose. Maybe she can arrive early and work on other mindfulness practices, like breathing or journaling?\n\n My particular neurospiciness prefers at home yoga anyway, it's on demand and no one around me distracting me and I can pause to stay in a yummy pose.\n\nMy concern would be for the teacher and students who are expecting to start and finish on time. If you're a person who is always late to a class it's probably best to schedule a different class. It's one thing once in a while because life happens and any sane person can understand that. \n\nWhen a class is not running on time for whatever reason it can screw up everyone's schedules. What if it was someone's lunch hour or they had to go to work on time or be fired. If someone has a kid at the sitter and is late because someone else threw the timing off they may have to pay extra to the sitter. Most people wouldn't want to do that all the time. \n\nIt's not that I don't have sympathy for anyone, I have 2 adult children who are ND and another with ADHD. I raised them to take accountability when they mess up. I didn't and don't infantilise them because that doesn't solve the problems. I help them find workable solutions to ensure that they will be able to live independently and not expect me to come to the rescue when they make a small mistake (like being late to a class).  If they never fall, they will never learn to stand up by themselves.\n\nMy studio has a 5 min policy. I’d rather everyone show up 5 min early, but understand that things happen from time to time. If a student is chronically late, I will discuss with them, privately, why arriving on time is important. In addition to respecting your fellow students and the energy of the room, the first 10 minutes are important for safety. Spinal warm ups, especially. And mentally/emotionally, missing the centering and arrival is as detrimental to your yoga practice as it is to skip savasana.\nI understand some people have particular challenges, but they should respect their yoga class the same way they would a work schedule or anything else where you just can’t be late.\n\nCreate an at home yoga practice. Lots of YouTube options\n\nApps and YouTube are always available if you can't be on time for in person classes.\n\nI’m hard of hearing and wear hearing aides. If people come in late it is literally distracting and I often miss an entire 2-3 min of instructions from listening to the noise of the door opening, closing, people whispering out loud “SORRY” and shuffling loudly with their mat and personal objects. Don’t be an asshole.\n\nMy favorite yoga teacher would say \"Come in, I'm just glad you showed up.  Find a spot.\"\n\nIs it distracting to other students?  Who cares!  Nobody is that self-important that being distracted by someone finding a spot in class is going to ruin their session and prevent their blessed spiritual and physical enlightenment, lol get fucked.  If someone has an issue with arriving on time then that is the person that needs yoga the most.  As long as the disturbance is less than a minute and doesn't actually stop the class from performing yoga then everyone will totally get over it.\n\nVery rigid comments on what is supposed to be a loving, spiritual, accessible and flexible practice. I’m a bit shocked. \n\nThe yoga classes at my gym are very flexible about late arrivals and people leaving early. People who can’t stay for the whole hour are just very quiet when they leave, never seen anyone be disrespectful/loud about it. It just doesn’t seem like a chronic issue. \n\nSome commenters on here need to take some deep breaths and open their hearts more. Maybe this young woman gets hooked on the first yoga session and no longer shows up late. And it was all because the class was flexible and accessible. Who knows? Not the people with such rigid standards surrounding this practice. I think self reflecting on what causes us to feel pretentious is important.\n\nThe studio I go to this has never been a problem. If there are students who are signed up but haven’t arrived by the start of class the teacher will mention that we may have some late arrivals. It’s not really a big deal, and personally think this mindset of being opposed to late comers being disruptive is nearly antithetical to the practice of yoga. \n\nLife doesn’t always fit into a neat little box. People don’t always behave in ways that are emotionally pleasant for you. Yoga, at least for me, is about building mental, emotional, and physical resilience. It’s about learning to find balance even when life is trying to push you over. \n\nI’m not saying all this to point at that other people’s views are wrong, I don’t think that. But I felt like this discussion could benefit from a multitude of perspectives.\n\nCan’t be late if you practice at home\n\nI think a class at a gym would be more open and flexible but it’s still frowned upon\n\nShow up early and wait or pay for private yoga classes. Otherwise, there are a lot of instructional videos for free on YouTube. There's no excuse for disrupting an entire classroom of people because one person can't manage to arrive on time, regardless of the reason.\n\nPart of the yoga life is being respectful of the time of others . So no, it’s your responsibility as a student to arrive on time . As much as it is the responsibility of the teacher to do the same .\n\nUnless she is just 5 minutes late and people are still easing into the session, my class closes an eye, later than that it's not accepted by the class and I understand it, it ruins the energy and flow of the class. Mind you I am also neurodivergent and struggle with lateness and work really hard on it so lets say most times I am either on time or less than 5 minutes late. Will continue working on improving hope your daughter can also work on that aspect of her life.\n\nAs a teacher I personally don’t mind if someone walks in a few minutes late, though I always start right on time out of respect for the students who made an effort to be on time. I’m neurodivergent as well and struggle with time management but for things like this I just plan on arriving early so then even if I’m running late I’m on time\n\nI get that this kind of thing varies, but honestly as long as the late person tries to enter quietly and gets set up and joins the class quickly then I don’t mind.\n\nAccessibility is something I’m passionate about so I welcome any late comers and try to tie them into the theme of welcoming distractions and coming back to the present moment etc.\n\nAs someone who is also neurodivergent, expecting others to make exceptions to the rules is not a great coping skill. It’s your responsibility to adapt. This mom’s heart is in the right place but she is setting her daughter up for failure by coddling her and creating an environment that coddles her as well.\n\nWhile she works on this, I suggest looking for large group classes outside where it will be easier to quietly drop in. Virtual classes are also great and might be a good way to “practice” being on time! \nOnce she feels ready to attend classes that start at a specific time and have closed doors, I would suggest a nearby studio where she can do drop ins so she’s not losing money pre registering and missing classes.\n\nI noticed people who usually come late to my classes are new faces. I tend to think they just miscalculated the time it would take to get to the studio with traffic.\n\nBut this request is annoying because the daughter is chronically late because she's probably a chronic procrastinator, and they want the world to cater to the daughters dysfunction instead of teaching her new skills.\n\nI'm very surprised by the responses here.  Especially the harshness and mean spirited things people are saying about people being late.  \n\nEvery yogi here knows the practices of ahimsa and aparigraha and I'm troubled both by the focus on the behavior of others and the astonishing lack of compassion for what another student might be going through to be late for class or have difficulty managing their time well enough to be consistently on time.  \n\nWe could all benefit from the reminder that none of us are perfect and that we all deserve compassion.  I personally believe that students like this can only benefit from yoga and whatever distraction you perceive them to be creating is an invitation for you to focus on your own mat and let it go.\n\n*how to pin comment on redit post?* thank you for this. Yoga helps pull my life together, grounds and centers me, enables me to overcome things that are barriers in my day to day life. Chronic lateness — for neurodivergence or not — can only be improved when someone is putting in serious work at the mat. It is hurtful to see such disregard for others, lack of empathy, and exclusionary mindsets from people engaging in a practice whose goal is harmony in the mind, body, spirit, and environment. It is difficult to have any kind of harmony when one is carrying such judgement and rudeness in their heart.\n\nMy thing is writing this about your 21 year old “child”. Replace “21” with “12” and I’d be more sympathetic\n\nDon’t be late. Respect the process and everyone else’s time and the studio. \n\nAlso, 21 year old adults should be finding these things for themselves.\n\nI'm in my sixties and the neurospiciness I'm diagnosed with includes time-blindness as one of the symptoms.  \n\nMedication doesn't help with this specific symptom, but over the years I've learned some strategies to stop annoying others with my lateness (or, indeed, earliness).  But some days when it I am particularly badly affected, nothing seems to help. \n\nWhen I was in my twenties trying to fit in with everyone else's perception of time was so difficult that I was completely stressed *every single day*.\n\nIt’s okay to be an adult and also need support in other humans.\n\n“We’re” working on it? She’s 21 years old, not a child.\n\nUsing your mental illness to make everyone cater to you is becoming more popular as a mindset, but it's extremely inappropriate and selfish. I have severe anxiety, depression, and ADHD. That is no ones problem but my own, and it's my responsibility to heal and learn how to navigate life and society. Making excuses does not encourage growth and proper health. This just reminds me of that tiktok of the girl who was crying because employers wouldn't accommodate time blindness for her.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIntentionally or not - constant tardiness is a habit rooted in entitlement-you’re telling everyone in your life whether close to you or total strangers that your life and your schedule is the only thing that matter and that everyone else needs to comply with them… mom get on the ball here - clearly you’ve built this habit from a early age with her that tardiness is acceptable and everyone else in the whole world should be at your family’s mercy… If being asked to be respectful of other people’s time is soul crushing just imagine how crushing it will be when she’ll fired from her dream job for lateness, unless of course you’all own a family business where she’s not expected to show up on time…\nRant over - pet peeve button reset.\n\nPeople really have no grace for different people. If they can do it, apparently so should everyone else. Really sad attitude honestly.\n\nI’ve been late a couple of times and just didn’t attend the class, but I’m blessed that my studio understands and accepts me because I was upfront with them, so they don’t charge me the late cancel fee.\n\nI would be too scared of pissing anyone off to come in late, but frankly, as yogis, you need to work on your practice if you can’t tolerate a tiny bit of disruption. \n\nWhen I’m disrupted, I take deeper breaths and practice compassion.\n\nI just want studios to stick to whatever their stated policy is. I hate it when a studio says “no late entry, no exceptions” and lo and behold they are letting people in late, disturbing me. \n\nThe policy is part of the reason I chose the studio, so it is unfair to say one thing and then do another. If you want to let people in late, then say so upfront."

    "all_comment_text": "I’ve actually found that some of the snobbiest, rudest people Ive ever met were in the yoga community. I only occasionally check this sub because I’ve seen that vibe here. Makes me sad honestly.\n\nI agree. I don’t talk to anyone from my yoga teacher training anymore because they were all super cliquey and talked trash about me and the one other “outcast” girl in our group. I also got fired from two different studios for reporting being sexually harassed by a male teacher by FEMALE owners and told I seemed “quick to tear down other teachers.” 😒 It made me stop teaching for over a year…\n\nAnd it’s just getting worse as it gets more popular, and I definitely see that type of attitude in this sub 🤦🏻‍♀️\n\n[deleted]\n\nThank you 🙏🏽\n\nThis is so awful. I’m so sorry that happened to you and drove you from something you love.\n\nI appreciate that 🤍\n\n[deleted]\n\nMe, too. I used to go to a studio regularly but the people were awful. Now I do Yoga with Adriene at home. I actually mentioned that in this sub and had my ass handed to me about her. I ended up deleting my post because people were so cruel.\n\nShe’s very accessible and helps introduce a lot of people to yoga. I’ve been practicing 25 years and when people tell me they feel intimidated or don’t know where to start, I send them to her YouTube channel. Yoga snobs are the worst.\n\nHow does one diss Adriene? She’s almost the epitome of accessible yoga.\n\nRight?!? She was the instructor that got me into yoga. I was a casual practitioner for years, but then my mom became terminally ill and I needed an outlet for my stress, so I looked up best yoga on YouTube and she was the number one choice. \n\nHer practice and energy has healed my soul in so many ways, and she made me feel like I could be good at yoga. I think the fact that she is accessible is why people hate on her. So many people gate keep yoga and feel like if someone participates in accessible yoga, then you are beneath them and someway.\n\nI’ve being doing her videos for 8+ years and have always loved them. Haters are everywhere 🙄\n\nI love her channel too!\n\nYes! Every time I mention her, people don’t give measured critiques: “Hmm I don’t care for her style” or “Personally I think she talks too much about her dog. Not my thing.”\n\nIt’s always, “She’s terrible. That’s not real yoga. No one should ever watch her videos.\n\nI feel as though don’t preach all the touchy feely impermanence stuff when you (studio owner or yours trainer) have let me get close to you to realize you (hypothetical you) are the most judgmental person I have ever met. Unfortunately turned me off teaching. \n\nLet’s have one another’s backs, no?\n\nI’ve had this experience in person. It made me stop going to a local place. They weren’t directly aggressive like someone might be online (I imagine that might have been easier to defend against, come to think of it), but they were very passive in their judgment and left-handed in many interactions.\n\nThat’s been my experience. It’s very much “oh your practice is beneath me because I’m so enlightened and superior.”\n\nPeople who type a lot online never get to see how the person on the other side reacts.  So if they mainly interact online, they don't learn to see if what they're saying is actually harmful or rude.\n\nAgreed anyone know of friendlier yoga subs?\n\nI do yoga with Adriene so I go to her sub a lot. We mainly talk about the practice for each day and it’s kind of chill but I’ve never had a problem with anyone over there.\n\n[removed]\n\nI don’t really feel like I should have to model appropriate behavior for adults who should know better. However, I have always brought good energy only to be mocked by “yoga snobs”. Whether you do yoga on YouTube, go to a studio, or some other form we should celebrate people’s  journey instead of having some weird superiority complex. Its gross.\n\n[removed]\n\nI’m confused by what you’re saying to me… as if I’ve said anything rude or inappropriate.  I think you’ve taken my response personally when it was a generalization. \n\nI believe you got a negative reaction because you stated right off the bat you are a “yoga snob”. It was unnecessary and negated the rest of your post, in my opinion. Now… all of that being said… I wish you well in your yoga journey.\n\n[removed]\n\nI can tell that this is very deep and meaningful for you. I really do appreciate your response and deep thoughts about all of this. Nothing I have ever responded was aimed at you other than saying that I was kind of put off by your yoga snob comment. I obviously missed the joke or don’t understand your sense of humor so yes, I guess I missed the punchline. There was no ha ha or sarcasm symbol or :]]. \n\nAnd once again, I will remind you that I have brought nothing but positivity to any community I have ever posted on and Reddit. If you have time or desire, you can scroll through every comment I’ve ever made in every community I belong to, and you will see that it is overwhelmingly positive because that is the energy I put out into the world. This is the only sub Reddit I have ever had to delete posts or comments, because people were absolutely atrocious to me. No matter what your experience has been, Mine has been vastly different.\n\nI doubt anybody’s going to be scared off by my response and I would say that most people here want to have positive vibes as evidenced by the almost 300 people that have already liked my comment about feeling this space can be hostile.\n\n[removed]\n\nBest wishes….\n\nI don't know why you're getting downvoted. You're basically saying lead by example and share when positive things happen for you, which is what I think 95% of people in the sub do. I completely agree.\n\nIt’s the first sentence I think… I post about elitism in yoga and the first sentence is “I’m definitely a yoga snob”.\n\nYeah but they are obviously self-deprecating as they then go on to refer to their own \"asshole credentials\". I think people just assume the worst when it comes to tone - I read this as \"I'm a yoga snob and I'm admitting it as bias right up front as I know it's an issue\".\n\n[removed]\n\nI heard you 😀 You're welcome\n\new, no.\n\n[removed]\n\nI think you got downvoted because people just can’t read well\n\nIt’s laced with offensive ideas, to me. Im sick af or I’d expound.\n\nI'm with you. I joined Reddit last fall and was so excited to connect with the yoga community and now I rarely check this sub. The snobbery is so discouraging\n\nI rarely even post questions or discussions on the subs I'm into anymore. I used to think reddit was one of the nicer places online, but people have lost their damn minds since 2020. Don't let this discourage you from the practice. Something about the anonymity makes people say things they ordinarily wouldn't.\n\nI'm glad I'm not the only one with this experience... I post an honest question and I'm being dragged in the comments... And of course I always put the blame on me\n\nI agree....last few years there's been a turn in people. I abandoned social media because of it. Got on reddit because I was trying to research something and couldn't view a NSFW post...so here I am lol.\n\nPeople can be so mean and demeaning online, it's like they forget there's another person they're engaging with. I miss forums, those it seems to me were easier to curate, vet, and foster a pleasant community.\n\nIf you think this sub is bad, you should see the Pilates sub, the people are awful.\n\nOmg heading there now to observe!\n\n…and blow nose I hope!\n\nWhat should I look for, I perused but didn’t see anything standing out quite\n\nIt needed saying; 100% agree, and also, how hilarious that the subreddit that birthed today's \"the fuck is wrong with you, reddit?\" is r/yoga.\n\nOut of all the subs I’m on this might be the most pretentious one when it comes to questions, sure there’s som nice people in here like all of life but the rude ones are always the loudest\n\nI once asked about a certain thing just to get some clarifications, in a very polite way, and everyone started attacking me\n\nSad to say this current state of Reddit in general.\n\nI taught yoga at a large gym chain for over a decade.  I preferred it because I could get students who were often unfamiliar with yoga, and so came in without a lot of preconceptions.  \n\nThe gym also had the policy that we could not teach any of the religious aspects of yoga, allowing only the most circumspect references to the spiritual stuff.  This also suited me just fine, as my \"spiritual\" understanding of things like yoga actually comes from my study of other mind/body integration practices, particularly my years studying the martial art Aikido.  \n\nFor various reasons I never much bought into a lot of the mystical stuff that often surrounds yoga at most studios, so it didn't feel authentic for me to teach it.  Instead I taught *my* version to my students, which I felt was a less ethereal and more practical, things like relaxing even during intense muscular effort, and moving from your \"dantian\"/\"center\". \n\nBut I mention this because one day I had a Sikh guy show up to my class, and I could tell he had a chip on his shoulder because here I was, an American, presuming to teach his people's \"5000 year-old\" traditional discipline.  Either he was very polite or maybe I impressed him in some way, because  after he came over and we had a nice, long. respectful conversation about my approach to teaching yoga, and how I teach yoga as a way to get so deep into the physical it rounded back into the spiritual without being *overtly* a spiritual practice (e.g. no meditation or chanting, which, again, I think of mostly as a kind of window dressing -- useful, sure, but only when properly \"grounded\" in this real world, not when used to \"bliss out\" into the \"astral plane\").  \n\nSo yeah.  After experiencing so many different ways and techniques to get \"spiritual\" I've come to recognize that few people who say they believe in that shit actually know what they're talking about, but most of them can get *really* defensive about it if you ever challenge them.  \n\nSo let it slide, man.  Let it slide.  As my wife says, \"There's no cheese down that tunnel.\"\n\nLol I'm stealing that saying\n\nI've found this sub to be super nasty and shockingly arrogant.  I've been practicing for 20 years and if I went to a studio with half the elitist attitude I find here I'd never go back and warn others off.  😆  FYI the more \"enlightened\" you think you are, the less you are.\n\nTry asking about leggings if you’re a dude. Lots of backlash from that post. Ended up deleting it because I got sick of negative in the inbox\n\nTbf, there have been quite a few very creepy and \"let me involve you in my kink\" posts from men specifically about yoga wear.\nLots of talk about their genitals, pictures of outlines etc. \n\nThese type of posts aren't frequent but as a long time reader of the sub they do turn up so regularly that you can get a bit apprehensive about them. \n\nSorry if you got caught up in it.\n\nOh that sucks. Of course creepy people ruin it for everyone.\n\nI just didn’t like the running compression pants from under armor or other brands more known for running and gym gear. The yoga pants from lulu are ok but fit my body type weird. I found the women’s fit better. In case any other men see this that are looking my finds were:\n\nAfter a lot dead ends I decided to look into the transgender subs and found what I needed. A thread suggested a dancers belt under the ladies leggings to keep things from shifting. It works great for me. No trying to get regular underwear to work. \n\nI went with the Dancejox banner belt. The version takes getting used to but you have the most movement freedom. \n\nI learned Beyond Yoga is pretty true to size for men’s to women’s sizing and men’s clothing sizing. The spacedye fabric is amazing. What they lack is color pallet. Love the men’s joggers hoodies and shirts.\n\nLululemon’s sizing is inconsistent between styles, fabrics and cuts. They have better patterns and colors for leggings just expect more total and error finding the right size. PS the aligns…size down if what should be your size is fitting loose. Even just a little. The aligns I had to size down to get them to work. My body type I should be a 10 but 8 fit way better. I think Lululemon has the best shorts for men. They have awesome colors too. \n\nThe dupes are just that. They don’t fit or feel as nice as the more expensive brands. Not saying they can’t fit or feel better to some I just didn’t think so. But I get that some people really can’t afford anything but dupes. If I were to pick the best dupe it would CRZ and All In Motion at target were good too. Stay away from Walmart.\n\nWow dude lol you also really want to talk about yoga pants.\n\nWelp I was just trying to leave a helpful information in a comment to save people digging around the internet and/or having to figure it out themselves. But I guess I should have just let the dead horse die and not responded to replies. My apologies.\n\nNo worries, I'm a woman and I was listening. Always appreciate people's experiences with brands.\n\nSorry that happened to you. I’ve seen a few men at my studio wear leggings and I honestly didn’t give it more than 1 second of thought. Shorts are more popular for men ofc, but like, wear whatever you want! As soon as I’m on my mat I pay pretty much zero attention to anyone else in the room other than the instructor.\n\nI didn’t mind shorts until one day I was like…what’s so special about these? Then I found the freedom of them! They just weren’t good at keeping things from painful shifts. I’m sure some ladies gossip about wearing them but I never hear it and my studio hasn’t mentioned complaints and I should stop wearing them.\n\nIf they’re bothered by it, it seems like a them problem. Just don’t look at other people’s crotches. Seems simple enough to me!!\n\nImo most except for like 2 or 3 comments are just ppl (including myself for transparency!) saying yes, this is the historical point of yoga! As in, yes totally it’s possible to do what the op was asking abt. I think sometimes it’s hard to read tone and intention in an online comment. There were def a few rude/condescending comments but in general I don’t think it’s rude to just tell someone a fact that is a response to a question they asked!\n\nIt's also wildly misinformed! I study a lot of old scripture for my postgraduate degree and spent last year trawling through some of the oldest references to yoga we have.\nThroughout history, yoga has been transformed in its meaning and meant anything from a state of being, to a state of mind, to a physical practise. \n\nIf anyone tells you your practice is wrong, feel free to criticise them for not practising naked on a flat surface with a deer skin under them. After all, it has to be *proper* yoga...right?!\n\nBeing realistic, yoga is a state of flow and emptiness of mind, and the moves are meant to enhance that flow. However, a lot of people now associate yoga with just the physical aspect. That's fine! Even if you're just doing it for a nice stretch, it's still a way to get more in tune with your body. Sometimes the flow state just appears naturally when you get into the moves.\n\nI see it so often that people just confidently spew the most incorrect information. But also a lot of people show only surface level understanding of yoga whilst insisting that it’s *all* that yoga as. \n\nOne major issue here is that we get a lot of people who think that the texts that got their foothold in the west first (usually Patanjali) are definitive, whilst there are countless Sanskrit texts on yoga which have not even been translated yet (especially most Tantric texts which are often referred to as ‘householder yoga’ - we desperately need more scholars!) and so most of us here don’t even have access to them. \n\nMany people here and in the wider yoga community don’t understand that Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras wasn’t really written for the benefit of householders but Brahmin men who held significant influence at that time. \n\nI’m not saying the wisdom of Patanjali is not beneficial to householders at all but much of it simply cannot be applied by us regular folk. Things like working towards complete celibacy, and ummm the whole complete renunciation of worldly life thing? I’ve had people tell me on here that I shouldn’t charge for my yoga classes and that it’s wrong, which is just one example of complete twisting and misunderstanding of yogic philosophy.\n\n&gt; Many people here and in the wider yoga community don’t understand that Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras wasn’t really written for the benefit of householders but Brahmin men who held significant influence at that time.\n\nThis should be repeated.  Often.\n\n👍\n\nA good way to clean the sub up is block the person. They get blocked a few times they get the message.\n\nJust click on their profile and find the spot. Different versions of reddit are a little different but they all have that option.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Wpa1Cjf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Wpa1Cjf.jpg)\n\nAre you talking about the person who posted and included \"I'm too high for this shit\" in their question? I think that brought out the seemingly 'obvious' answers from people - like explaining things slowly to a drunk person. \n\nIn general, I find this sub to be very friendly and helpful. I've blocked a few rude ones, but that's the same in any sub.\n\nThis. \n\nAlso, I've been here since I started my practice last year and have posted maybe a couple of noob questions. I was worried at first but actually, I have found a lot of help, insight, inspiration, and support, from such wonderful souls in this sub. \n\nThat said, I'd say based on my experience, as long as you ask questions coming from a place of humility and respect, on top of curiosity, a LOT of people here are open and willing to share their knowledge and help.\n\nAnd yeah, just block the rude ones 😆\n\nPatanjali totally wrote that book. People don't read it tho bc it's not about weight loss and fitness as nearly as I can tell.\n\nI quit reading and posting here bc I got tired of being corrected when I pointed out that yoga comes from somewhere and has a history.\n\nI adored yoga til I went to Kripalu for my YTT. I still love yoga, but it’s not on a pedestal any more.\n\nIf they’re in yoga class looking for demons and worried that they’re gonna catch something that Jesus would condemn them for, my invitation is for them to follow their bliss someplace else.\n\nI knew a woman who would not do any “yoga” but only some stretches. I don’t get it.\n\nI don’t stretch — I pandiculate. My spiritual practices and experiences are personal, not professional.\n\nThere’s no such thing as demons. It’s literally all in your head. Don’t kill your yoga teacher or report her to your pastor.\n\nThis is one of the most judgemental, snobby subs out there. They’re also not open to discussion and it’s their way or the highway way. Kind of gross, really.\n\n👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼\n\nPeople need to revisit their yamas &amp; niyamas\n\nClap clap, clap clap clap clap\n\n“I blow my nose in your general direction” 🤣 can we be friends?\n\nIt’s a line from Freaks and Geeks and YES\n\nEvery subreddit is like this now. People would rather be miserable than cleanse their souls\n\nThere's a difference between yoga as practiced by those like my teacher - an Indian woman - and those in the west, who practice a yoga more centralized around capitalization, primarily the teachers and what they eventually give to their students.\n\nAs such, the optics of yoga in the west is more aligned with the opposite of what this psychospiritual liberatory process is all about.\n\nAnyone who would answer in ruthlessness rather than joy and appreciation of being able to assist a fellow practitioner of the path requires more practice and more stillness to abate such a detrimental outburst.\n\nWhile I don’t get behind the generalization of Indian women, I imagine what you mean there and I’m glad you found a spiritual preceptor :)\n\n\n\nYour conclusion is quite appropriate- these folks being cruel at the first chance they get shouldn’t be saying “XYZ is yoga” they clearly need more practice to make theory into embodiment\n\n&gt;they clearly need more practice to make theory into embodiment\n\nExactly. We must embody the path.\n\nSMH. That attitude shows me they’re not practicing yoga. They’re just doing isometrics for assholes. I hope they change, but I’m not holding my breath (modest pun intended).\n\n&gt;I blow my nose in your general direction.\n\nI'm not sure what other post you're referring to you so don't have anything to say about that...just want to say I freaking love this statement and am 100% adding this to my sass arsenal.\n\nMean and selfish people are common everywhere and they often have others and themselves convinced they’re the opposite.  The unfortunate irony is that yoga and so many other paths of “healing” and “wisdom” which have a broad goal of reducing the individual ego and selfishness for the benefit of others become another way to elevate one’s own ego, take advantage of others and justify selfish pursuits.\n\nAnonymity and being a small person irl leads to antisocial behavior on the internet. A lot harder to be an asshole when looking another human being in the eyes.\n\nAss-asana\n\nThere should be a sub for a wholistic approach to yoga.  No one posts about the spiritual side of it here. That’s the part that interests me.  I blow snot too!\n\nI do! Sort of. Heh I see spirit posts occasionally and the good ones come out the wood work.\n\nSo, I had to go back and check the comments because I was one of the people that commented (feel free to check my account for mine). Unless people are deleting them,.only one comment was really snarky and well OP didn't really do themselves a service in their asking of their question - asking if said phenomenon has a name in the sub that explicitly describes the phenomenon - it seems quite logical to assume that OP  was joking lol.\n\nI actually kind of had to read the question twice because, yes, I at first was like well duh that's what we're doing here. And you know, it's okay to have a duuuuh moment sometimes. We'll just welcome you to the party when you get here. 😛.\n\nYour post has probably 10x the snarkiness and rudeness than (at least any remaining comments) do on that post's replies. Actually, many of them were quite helpful. Let OP have their duuuh moment and let the one snarky comment slide by unnoticed (don't worry it was very downvoted) and stop the self righteousness that ironically was never a big deal to begin with. \n\nAnd even so, you didn't answer with love and you mostly did that which you are condemning others for. You lead by example. So while your heart was in the right place I disagree with the larger sentiment of this post. Mostly because it was really only comment that was unpleasant and suddenly you're disgusted with the entire yoga community of reddit ?\n\nI agree, I went and read it too and could not find what the problem was with the replies. The OP's question even included \"I'm too high for this shit\" so everyone kept their answers very simple in response. I think if everyone just blocks the people that they don't like and curates the experience for themselves they they'd enjoy it more - just like in any other social media space. I'm very active on the tarantula sub and I'm absolutely positive some people have blocked me, and good for them! That's what the block function is for.\n\nThe comments were *deleted or altered\n\nThe comments appear to be deleted. \n\nAnswering about “is this an aspect of yoga?” With the rudeness there was “yes duh” is not the same as bringing to light that those comments exist/and elsewhere on this sub. \n\nMy snark is not to an innocent questioning yogi, it is to the jerks who replied to that post in ways I recognize can dissolution someone especially a beginner. \n\nYou’re trying to find the irony and missing the substance. It’s like those folk who comment  “you have a lot of typos clearly your point is not to be taken seriously”\n\nThe title of my post “to the ruthless replies” indicates my post, when referencing “you all” is addressing them. If you missed that, there it is. I am speaking to those people. \n\nIf you wanted to demonstrate your own intellect, and what a bit bad hypocritical I am, check that righteousness where it is. \n\nFurther my comment to that OP was supportive.\n\nWhen comments are deleted I thought they just appear blank with user saying [deleted] I didn’t think they just disappear entirely but I guess I’m wrong, since on my end there no zero comments that day “deleted” and just two comments heavily downvoted but still visible, not deleted\n\nOk. That’s true. The ones I saw just were not there; so perhaps edited ? Idk. \n\nPoint stands on a general trend here. It’s sad for the yoga community even it it’s online\n\nActually I tested it just now. Deleted comments by Mods appear to exist saying “deleted” but i\nI deleted my own comment , it disappeared.\n\nMy behaviour? You’ve no idea about my behaviour\n\nI wasn’t addressing you. I was addressing those who leave rude comments. See title\n\nTo be fair there are some big books of yoga facts to check. Like, philosophically, anatomically, history, physiology, books on technique and progression sequencing, types of practices... \n\nNot to disagree with the sentiment that it could be cooler and kinder to be a community - and practice coming into some unity.\n\nDefinitely understand your point but idk if expressing disgust is going to solve the problem. One of my fave quotes from a show I enjoyed called true detective is “people incapable of guilt usually have a good time” I think it to myself often because it’s a great reminder to redirect my energy into being the light I want to see instead of being put out by the people unable or unwilling to change\n\nWhile you're not wrong about a small subset of people who will do whatever, there's also a larger group of general asshats who will treat others as poorly as they're permitted to.\n\nThis post isn’t to solve the issue it’s to let everyone know , the jerks and the beginners, and others , “I for one do not abide this crap!”\n\nI think it was needed. Sometimes we can be a light, and sometimes people need a stern reminder\n\nI did spread light on their post. And I do all the time.\n\nI fully agree. If there is one thing we have enough of it’s anger, frustration and disgust for others.\n\nVery well said!\n\nMost westerners think that yoga is just stretching and fitness.\n\nWhile unrelated to this post, and while it may be true, have you seen some type of global west surveys on the topic? \n\nThe responses I saw were very short with OP asking a beginner question and also identifying as new to yoga\n\nI guess I should have elaborated on what I meant. Being short and short of condescending isn’t quite practicing yoga or complementary to it. \n\nBut to answer your question. When I was a yoga teacher people were completely unaware and I think in many cases surprised when I was teaching philosophy before, during, or after postures concluded. I have not read many surveys on the issue.\n\nOh I see. Thank you\n\nwoo woo!"

Don't bring your drama here.\n\nThat is a pretty extreme expression of Paschimottanasana. That being said, when I was trying to get deeper into Standing Wide Legged Forward Fold / Prasarita Padottanasana, [I found this anatomically focused guide helpful](https://www.theyogimatt.com/deeper-forward-folds-with-tfl-technique/), and it also led me to deeper Seated Forward Fold. There is a good anatomical diagram on [this Yoga Journal page](https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/seated-forward-bend/) that shows which muscles are stretching and which are contracting, which also helped me.\n\nFinally my two getting deeper tips are ensure your hamstrings and glutes are really warm before you try to get deep and place a block or two at the end of your feet to reach further forward. Don't overdo your hamstrings or you'll end up with the painful and slow to heal yoga butt!\n\nCool! Thanks for your time explaining 🧘🏻‍♀️\n\nHaha great, I'll check out those links, thanks for your advice\n\nWhat is the painful and slow to heal yoga butt?\n\nYoga butt, also known as proximal hamstring tendinopathy, is inflammation of the hamstring tendons at their attachment point(s) of the the sitting bone (ischial tuberosity) – it happens to many yogis hence yoga butt. I had it when I went a bit too hard learning kicking up to handstand when I wasn’t warm enough.\n\nWas just googling yoga butt and I feel like I might have overstretched on one leg. Any tips for that and why it takes so long to heal?\n\nOh ow – I’ve experienced it and it can be quite sore. While it was still tender, I ensured I did a really thorough hamstring warm up that didn’t strain them too much before every class or home drill session, while also using blocks to lessen the load in hamstring heavy asanas. I also spoke with my teachers and they gave me modifications.\n\nAfter the pain subsided and I was able to practice as normal, I incorporated hamstring strengthening exercises into my gym rotation (deadlifts, hip thrusts, curls, squats) and hamstring strengthening asanas into my home practice/drills (bridge, locust, reverse plank, happy baby focusing on resistance and pushing/pulling).\n\nThe cool thing is now my hammies are pretty strong and flexible so I can get deep in forward folds while also have strength to do more advanced back bends with pretty good control. Good luck healing!\n\nThanks for the tips! I never realised it was a common issue, I just experienced a slight pain in my right inner thigh when deep stretching, and found it weird it only happened on one leg. Will try strengthening exercises, thank you :)\n\nYou'll just have to be patient with the healing. The one thing that made a difference for me once I understood I was experiencing yoga butt was to make sure that my abdominals are engaged before I do forward folds; it seems to protect from overstretching the tendons. I saw that tip from a yoga teacher on youtube (google yoga butt) and it really changed my practice.  \nI noticed some of my teachers were recommending that, but never had a class where thar was explained properly.\n\nAmazing links Ty!!!\n\nThis is extreme? It’s always been incredibly easy for me. Makes me wonder if I’ve always been hyperextending something 🤔\n\nHonestly, I think some people are just more flexible than others. Anatomies vary-\n\nMy perspective on forward folds is that it is critical your entire torso is completely flush with your thighs. I imagine some people cannot or will not ever be able to accomplish this... But of the 75% who are (potentially) capable, the best way to improve forward folds is keeping your belly and chest on your thighs, and keep your hips internally rotated. It doesn't matter how much you bend your knees.  Belly. On. Thighs. Straighten the legs micrometer by micrometer. Be patient, and don't push it. Excessive forward folding is a great way to tear a glute or hamstring. Just be humble, and accept your body for what it is and stay unattached to what it could be. Nobody cares if you have a sick forward fold. \n\nI'm going to throw this caveat into the mix of answers you're getting: you might never achieve this depth.  We're all built differently and inhabit our bodies different.  There's quite a bit of hyper mobility going on in this picture also. \n\nNow, that said, enjoy your practice and listen to your body.\n\nI'll push back on that a bit. I started from a pretty big disadvantage (was not aware of the existence of hamstrings for 29 years). I'm very close (and yet so, so far) to the pictured posture. The things holding me back from getting there are: 1) I don't practice regularly enough, can really only count on myself 2x per week 90 minutes, plus like 4x 15 min bedtime stretches... \n\nFrom August 2022 to now (May 2024) I've gained about 12\" of sit-and-reach distance, and can full wrap my hands around the sides of my feet, which is technically only one step away from the image above, where your chest can rest on your thighs. It's a long, slow process that is mostly independent of your body geometry\n\nThat's wonderful.   I don't mean to discourage OP or you  or anyone from trying.  I've been instructing yoga for a long, long time and I don't like to see injuries because someone might push themselves too far or too hard.  I myself have been a cyclist for many years along with teaching/practicing yoga and my hamstrings are awfully tight.  Some days I can bend a little further and some days not.   Again just simply this: we're not all cast from the same mold.\n\nyeah, i’m not sure why “pushing back” was necessary there considering the qualifying language you used.  besides, everyone’s talking about hamstrings and glutes.  no one’s talking about calves and the numerous tendons that have to play along - the latter of which cannot/should not be lengthened any significant amount at all.\n\nIt's great that you've improved a lot, but that doesn't mean necessarily that everyone can improve to the same extent.\n\nNo I disagree, I think my mobility (and the mobility in the picture above) is achievable with regular practice. I shared my story because I want others to believe this, too.  The posterior chain shortens and the hips tighten due to years of sitting in a chair for multiple hours per day. Yoga is the medicine that rebalances and aligns your flesh and bones.\n\nI'm trying to get more length in my hamstrings right now, any advice on how you've had success here?\n\nstretch while they’re contracted; slight microbend in the knees while you stretch.\n\nwhen i was first practicing, i would be doing forward folds, pigeon, standing balance etc while i was watching tv, studying or working. this added up to at least 2 hours a day of stretching for like 4 years. 10 years later i don’t think about it at all and i can get my hands past my toes and head a few inches from feet. it’s possible through consistency and time, the beauty of yoga :)\n\neccentric training essentially. stretching your muscle when it is contracted in order to lengthen it over time. jason crandell has good info on this topic.\n\nI gained quite a few inches of flexibility over the past two years, but I still won't be able to get into the most advanced stretching poses for many years. I just started my first month with 80% of my yoga sessions being purely for flexibility and sometimes I get a deep sweat from just stretching, almost always get massive tremors going through my muscles every stretch, but I breathe effectively and maybe I even enjoy the pain a bit, but I wonder if I am overdoing it and I wonder if I am pushing hard enough through it to injure myself. For example I just did my regular strengthening session then I went into two more short slow flow deep stretch videos. To add some more context, I'm tight because I have ran and weight trained a lot in the past.\n\nto minimize risk of injury:\n\n1) be sure to stretch when you’re warm — sounds like you are already doing this unless there is a break between your workout and stretching time. ideally, you are warming up the specific muscle groups you are stretching through strength training. hack: buy a space heater/humidifier! and/or do sun salutations :))\n\n2) stretch with proper form — this is the benefit of guided stretching. youtube is great but in person is better so a teacher can look at your form. for instance, always have a microbend to avoid hyperextension, joint alignment and specific musculature engagement in particular stretches are very important.\n\n3) balance — stretching i believe is a great way to be introduced to yoga. as you mentioned, the breath is so important and stretching feels good (discomfort feels amazing!!). you may want to consider doing yoga long term, for a balanced and holistic approach. i was very targeted in what i would strengthen in weight training and stretch afterwards (just did ones that felt good aka hamstrings and hips) but was missing out on so many other places to strengthen, make more mobile/flexible (outer hips like wuuuuuut?!) something to consider, but a good teacher makes all the difference :)\n\nWell too be honest I don't think a lot of these online yin yoga lessons are very good because they are just static cold stretching and they require you to figure out what you need to do to warmup and they appeal to beginners. I actually have a degree in Exercise Science so I understand what I am targeting.\n\n\nWhat I am trying to say is there are many papers on chronic injuries related to overstretching and there is a whole lot of subjectivity to what is overstretching. Especially since stretching was never my niche, I often trained with weights and never stretched even though I knew the importance. Now I see that in a class I try harder than everybody else, especially I push myself hard through the stretching and many others don't care for progress, so I believe I am prone to injury, but I still can't guage how much stretching is over-stretching.\n\nif it’s pain, you’re overstretching. if it’s just uncomfortable, you’re fine.\n\nI am not sure I agree with that mentality.  See my belief is that you can push some stretches a lot harder than others, like I never force a backbend for example. I have undoubtedly developed too much strength in my quads, hammies and glutes and have gotten quite tight here so I am projecting stretching these muscles once every two days for now. I have been training quite intensely like this for two years now and I think it's kind of okay. At first I could barely bend the slightest to touch the ground and now I am doing the sun salutations with no issues, you will rarely see that kind of progress in two years. Still if you try to bend me forward in a butterfly pose I will not move a single cm forward and my entire core will be fully flexed. My knees can barely lower either, I know that is quite common in men, but also I think this is an area where I can gain lot of inches.\n\n\nI'll post a link to a video that my old mentor released, he actually loads the knees with dumbells and his routines are often ex military, contrast this with a ladies video who says you should not push down on the knees in a butterfly. I think it is safe to say that you can push a little.\n\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/Capl2WwnQrk?si=WVM5Om_cnt5Uokt7\n\n1. regular practice (daily)\n\n2. mixing up the sequence for your \"extra\" hamstring work (e.g. seated forward fold, standing fold, splits/split fold\n\n3. Lunges, Hiking, and Weighted Lunges - this is the part that I think helped me the most in terms of feeling confident in my leg health/strength while I was doing like intense daily stretching. You've probably heard at least something about \"overstretching,\" which isn't real. What is real, is your muscle tissue, which needs to CONTRACT as much as it needs to EXTEND in order to remain healthy. At a minimum I recommend \\~20 breaths total per day in each Warrior (1, 2, and 3, if accessible). If you can't balance, do your best standing split, focusing on straightening and strengthening the standing leg. \n\n  \nIf you don't balance your practice between mobility and strength, you end up with neither.\n\nYoga is not about the pose or the end result.  It’s about connecting your body, mind, spirit and breath.  Aim for what your body can do for you, safely. Reach for what you want but remember being in the poses is being in the moment with your body. It’s that simple.  Wishing you peace.\n\nIf the body is at all able to bend in any ways, one milimeter at a time, over the span of 1000 days, will reach 1 meter of flexibility.\n\nOkay haha ​​maybe I want to see a result very quickly and I just have to be patient\n\ndon't force the forward motion. Sit at the edge of your tension, and breathe into it, try and get as relaxed as you can, and THEN start extending through the heels and through the crown.\n\nA fast result to bending is breaking 😋\n\nThis answer. I hurt my hamstring attachment (up near the glutes) while trying to do deep hamstring work and had to stop practicing altogether for a few months. It's finally starting to feel better.\n\nThat's how I feel about my forward fold. Some days I feel like I'm further away from my thighs, like how am I going backwards? Lol\n\nThanks\n\nBeen practicing for almost 8 years now, I can allllllllllmost get my nose to my knees. A lot of it has to do with lifting UP and over, lengthening the spine.\n\nUse this video as a help https://youtu.be/UB2gwUzA8PI?si=cyo3exOhbDtAR_TX . I am not affiliated with them, use your own discretion. It sounds rational though. Gist of what he is saying is, if you cannot sit with back straight in the beginning (at 03:46 in video) then first solve it, using a folded carpet etc beneath your sitting area. Keep adding padding till straight back is achieved. Came across this video once upon a time.\n\nWhats the title of that book\n\nYoga, A guide for your practice. Lavender yoga center. The book is in Spanish\n\nYour nails are so pretty\n\nAsana are not goals. They are directions. \n\nSource: my yoga &amp; Ayurveda teacher\n\nThe dream\n\nPut a block on your legs to rest your head on. That way you can relax into the pose without your head hanging out in space, and you can use your head as a counterweight to lean into the pose. Oh. And wiggle the sitz bones back by gently rocking from side to side.\n\nTime, patience, and practice!\n\nConsistent practice and patience. You can not force your body to go into difficult poses overnight without hurting or injuring yourself. \n\nYou'll one day be able to achieve this asana, but it comes with patience, hard work, and kindness to your body. Little by little, you'll get there.\n\nI have had that exact book for decades, that's lovely to see it here.\n\nHaha yes, it was my father's book, he had it a long time before I was born. He always makes that joke with me.\n\nYou can already achieve this asana, but it will look different than this because you have a different body. Yoga is about how it *feels* in our bodies, not what it looks like 💖\n\nBend your knees. Sounds counterintuitive but when you push too hard on your muscles, they’ll tighten up more. In 25+ years of practice and teaching, this is what helped me the most.\n\nDon’t compare yourself to others in yoga!\n\nI'm sure your comment is coming from a good place, but to a certain extent it's simply impossible to not compare - otherwise we wouldn't even be able to get into a pose, let alone work towards its full expression. It's true that we shouldn't *judge* ourselves against other's progress, or become competitive, envious or worse yet egocentric about our own progress. But comparison at its most basic is quite neutral and simply a noting of similarities and differences. It's rooted in reality and it helps us learn.\n\nThey're not comparing themselves to others, they're comparing themselves to how they were doing before, which is exactly what they should be doing. If you don't see improvement in something you're working on it's smart to rethink what you're doing and to go ask questions.\n\nStretch more.  👌🏽\n\nYou need open hamstrings. Start there.\n\nIf one had a person to help with this, would it better to be pulled from the front or pushed from the back?\n\nA gentle push to the lower back or sacrum area.\n\nA tip that helped me a lot for seated forward fold is scoop your belly in. Pull your navel back toward your spine and reach your chest forward \n\nI practice with different teachers and I always have to remember which one insists on flat back and which one wants a curve.\n\nPatience\n\nWhy to you need this?\n\nWarm the hamstrings with a space heater prior. Do the pose last in your series in addition to whenever you do it already. Stop at the point of intolerance, hold that a minute then reach further. Have a partner gently push on your back. Take your time\n\nIt takes time, but the longer you hold the pose, the better it gets over time. Yogis of old would keep this pose up to 12+ hours. Obviously you need to start slow and not over exhert yourself\n\nThat’s interesting; where did you read that?\n\nI'm really sorry that I can't provide any source, I read and ingest so much information that it would be impossible for me to remember where I've learned that. But it's a classic pose for deep meditation and bandhas and yogis hold some poses for a very long time.\n\neat only watermelon\n\nDo you mean eating watermelon every day? Or directly a diet of only watermelon haha\n\ni suppose a diet of only watermelon would accelerate progress (and you’d see a lot of progress in deep twists/maricyasana series as well).\n\nnote: this comes from dharma mittra and is always said with a smile. it would definitely help and might even be delicious for a few days, but steadiness in practice is the surest route.\n\nYipes\n\n[deleted]\n\nWtf Maybe it doesn't make as much sense because I don't speak English natively so it may sound strange but it's definitely a real question."

    "title": "Got shamed in a class today for having inflexible hips",
    "body": "I guess I'm coming here for a bit of emotional support, because as stupid as this incident is, it still left me a bit shaken.\n\nThere was a substitute teacher in my regular class today. The class was centered around hips, and to be honest a lot of the postures were kind of advanced/counting on us being fairly flexible and she didn't really give simplyfying options. \n\nAnyways at one point she asked us to take 3 blocks and stack them in the front of the matt in an upside down T shape (2 blocks in a low setting and the third one on top of them in high setting). Then we were supposed to get into warrior 2 over this construction, and really make the posture deep using the T as a support under the front leg (I hope this makes sense to you). \n\nWell I have very inflexible/stiff hips. I go to yoga regularly at least 2x a week for over a year now, and the flexibility of my hips really improved only very little, so I think mostly it's just how my skeleton is. So when I did what she asked, my front leg was way above the T construction. More people had this issue so she said we should grab more blocks. Four blocks were still too low for me, so I got a fifth one.\n\nAnd she looks at me and loudly annouces to the whole class \"Well but this is cheating already\".\n\nNow I'm 99.9% sure she only meant it as a joke and there was no malicious intent. But it still hit me so hard - like I'm sorry but I didn't realise this was a competition...?\n\nI think my issue with this is she shouldn't have commented at all. I always saw yoga class as a safe space, where I go to do something nice for my physical and mental health, and it's completely up to me how much I participate, or how hard do I make it for myself etc. So when she put me on the spot like this, and for a thing I cannot control/influence...I don't know, something in me just broke. I spent the rest of the class literally fighting tears. Idk, I felt like a chubby kid in PE again being yelled at for not being as athletic as my classmates. And then I got mad at myself for allowing this to get to me this much and well, here we are.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what am I expecting from writing this here, I know the only thing left to do is just process it and let it go. So thank you if you read this far, and if you have any words of encouragement for me, I'd really appreciate that 🙏",

    "all_comment_text": "My challenge area is my shoulders. Super tight and inflexible and I’m also working on it but we also work with the bodies we have. I don’t think there’s “cheating” in yoga - it’s supposed to be about meeting ourselves where we are. Knowing your limits is important.  What looks more impressive might be easy for one person, while what looks simple might be incredibly challenging for another person.  So I say be like Elsa and let it go. Be proud of yourself for doing right by your hips in that pose.\n\nThe only cheating in yoga imo is when you DON'T modify for your particular body and try to force it into shapes that don't work for you and then you get into just the wrong alignment. OP totally did the right thing by grabbing more blocks to make certain movements work for them.\n\nWell put!!!\n\nDefinitely! I used to love Ashtanga, but the rigidity of the practice frustrated me -- especially after I learnt I couldn't do things on a certain side because my legs are actually different lengths. \n\nYou have to look after your own body above anything.\n\nHave you ever been to a chiropractor? I always thought my legs were slightly different lengths and actually found out my hips and lower back were out of line. It was an almost two inch difference\n\nOh wow 2\" that must have been painful! So I did consider a chiro but I've always been a bit suspicious of them because they don't really have medical backgrounds. I opted for physio instead. It's not perfect, but with the stretches and my heal lift, I have a lot less pain now. I'll never be a yogi extraordinaire, but have thankfully learnt yoga is actually about doing all the moves anyway.\n\nI was wary too - mine has been treating my husband for over a decade so I was more comfortable. He also has a physical therapy background (and shares offices with physical therapy masseuses). So I get it!\n\nDid you have to try a heel lift too or did you find chiro/phys helped a lot? Interestingly enough, after I discovered mine, I learnt heaps of my friends (mostly female) had off-balance hips too. Amazing how so many of us go through it without even knowing.\n\nProps are expressly used as an extension of the body to find the pose. To support or extend. \n\nThat's....the POINT. As long as it's safe, it's not 'cheating'. \n\nI would be so annoyed.\n\nI wasn’t in your class, and didn’t see it first hand. And I am annoyed. Blocks bring the floor closer. A compassionate teacher would have come over with an armful of blocks to assist you into position, or at the very least ignored you. But calling you out even in supposed jest as a complete stranger was antagonistic. \nHugs.\n\nInflexible hip havers unite!!!!!\n\nUnlike Shakira, my hips DO lie!!!!\n\nMy hips tell whatever my truth is. If my warrior pose looks too much like a tired triangle, well that is my truth; and it does and I can't do pigeon \"well\", either...\n\nHigh five!! 💜\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you. The instructor attempted to make a joke, and it fell flat. I wouldn't think of it as a reflection on you but a reflection on the instructor. Yoga is a place to work on physical and mental health in a safe environment. I can guarantee you that the comment did not go unnoticed by others in the class. If I heard that, I would probably think yeesh don't want to practice in front of that instructor and wouldn't attend another class they were leading.\n\nTeaching is hard. You try to be funny and you slip up. Give them one free pass and try to let it go\n\nI am not a yoga teacher, but I am a professor, and I can confirm that I have said things that I thought would go over well or lighten up the room and definitely landed completely flat. In fact probably once a week if not more. \n\nNot that the things I say are mean or malicious in any way, just trying to make the class more enjoyable on both ends, it just doesn’t always work lol\n\none time I spent a whole morning thinking about this joke I was going to say during my 10 am lecture, thought it was so funny, ran it by my girlfriend and she said it was funny (she’s too sweet…) and then I just got blank faces and an aura of boredom 🤣. It comes with the gig.\n\nOther days, I dump a bucket of water on myself to explain adhesion and cohesion and they absolutely love it. And I’m rambling, so I’ll stop now\n\nThank you for dedicating so much energy to your students. Teachers like you are precious 🙂\n\nYou’re kind. Thanks :-)\n\nThat last bit sounds hilarious but where did you let the water drain? Did you move the class outside?\n\nGood question lol, I teach an applied science and our labs are fitted with floor drains that run the length of the room. Slope of the room has a very slight gradient to help w drainage. I do move a bit closer to the drains when I do it and away from the podium, though. I squeegee the floor after so our janitor doesn’t have to deal with it. \n\n“Cohesion is the water running off of my body in beads and then droplets. Adhesion is the water that’s now soaked through my shirt and hair!”\n\nAh there's the answer. Great visual representation!\n\nNow I wanna hear about adhesion/cohesion pertaining to the wet shirt! :D I want to learn heheh\n\nI think that's a fair assessment....I've definitely said things just in life that even now make me cringe. We've all done it. \n\nShe could also just be insensitive. Maybe a holistic look at the experience would help clarify whether that's just an outlying playful comment that fell flat versus 'oh god never attend another class with that woman'.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo one is built an ideal way, even teachers.\n\nYou're totally right! It's ok for instructors to make the occasional joke, but never at the expense of an individual student.\n\nI've been doing yoga for ten years and I'm still nowhere near touching my toes. Everyone has something they struggle with and a good yoga teacher should make the flow work for you - otherwise you might as well stay home and watch a video.\n\nUgh me too. I practice every day and barely make any progress on my sinoveal joints. Feels like I’m doing yoga to retain what little I have ATM.\n\nthe yoga teacher made a bad call. intent matters to a degree, so sure maybe it was meant to be a joke, but that doesn't change that it hurt your feelings. I think the easy-to-type answer is don't let this live rent free in your head. What has ultimately happened to you? someone made a careless comment that hurt your feelings, and it is reasonable and OK for your feelings to be hurt. But then it can end there. It doesn't have to stick around and continue bothering you, you don't have to wonder about long-term repercussions to your health, well-being, soul, reputation, honor, whatever. If this sub teacher is someone who you have some level of relationship with or connection to, you can approach them about it and just say hey, i wanted to let you know this comment you made actually hurt my feelings a little, could you be a bit more mindful about comments you make out loud about me in classes? But failing that there's no reason to let this bother you more than a simple acknowledgment of your hurt feelings and reminding yourself that you are OK.\n\nTell the teacher you're not sure if that was a lighthearted joke or a jab but you don't appreciate being called out like that in class.\n\nDazzled by the emotional maturity of this idea and trying to imagine myself saying it.\n\nAnd I'm *old.*\n\nI give great advice that I wouldn't do myself. lol\n\nCall me passive aggressive, but I’m a big fan of side eye. It speaks volumes.\n\nI am a teacher. I would never shame another student for being unable to complete a position that took a lot of flexibility. That is not the point of yoga. Yoga positions, a long long time ago were built around the Master trying to teach the young Yogi to stay present.   the reason they developed more exercises is because as the student developed skill in that position, they movedout of the present and the mind took over. So, if you can’t get into a certain position,  go into another one that makes you feel comfortable, extend , be present with your breath work and feel satisfied.\n\nAs a yoga teacher who probably at one point or another said some stupid shit I meant as a joke at the time, I apologize on behalf of all yoga teachers who say stupid shit they meant as a joke.   \n\nThis is why I didn't quit my day job.\n\nAnyway it's just like, their opinion, man.   Shake it off, go to class, and keep working on those hips regardless.\n\nYikes.\n\nIn my time teaching, if I notice anyone needing additional blocks or bolsters, I take that as an opportunity to grab props and pass them out to everyone. Then demonstrate how the props can support the body properly and where they should safely feel the pose (ie. “If you feel this in your lower back, grab another block; feel it melt away your hamstrings” etc).\n\nYes! Thanks, this is a proper way to handle this!\n\nI totally get this. I would feel the same. Is what you're looking for understanding and validation? Consider it given. \n\n  \n*I always saw yoga class as a safe space, where I go to do something nice for my physical and mental health, and it's completely up to me how much I participate, or how hard do I make it for myself etc.* \n\nI think this is why people go a bit haywire emotionally sometimes. I had a teacher correct my form without prompting, and then a class student weighed in along with her, and they were both talking to me at once, and the class just...stopped...and I had to fight everything to keep from leaving because I didn't want to fuck up my relationship with the studio, which I love. \n\nI never went back to her class. And I freaking \\*loved\\* her. I understand in retrospect what happened - I made the mistake of engaging with her after a class and was talking about working on things and etc etc and maybe I went from being the silent weirdo to someone she could engage with, so next time, she went ahead and did it. But let me tell you: I am not that open a person.\n\nFor me, it takes constant awareness and adjustment to not feel on stage, to not feel self-conscious, to focus on the movements and my body. I accept that struggle, and even sort of enjoy it because it's a personal growth thing. I admire people who give no shits whether they dance like nobody's watching, but for a lot of us, it's a struggle.\n\nSorry that happened to you. Try to toss the memory over your shoulder and don't look back, and I would consider a complaint to the studio if you can do that without seeming crazy (it would be hit or miss for me, but I think if I calmed down I could do it. I could do it now -- I THINK -- but when that happened to me I'd only been going for a few months.)\n\nI still kind of miss that teacher. She wasn't unkind, she just singled out the wrong person, reading signals that I did not mean to send.\n\nSo I’m not a yoga teacher but the teacher of my fave yoga class actually printed out images of 4 different people’s hip skeletal structure and walked us through their differences. I don’t remember technical details but I remember how she pointed out how one each person might be more flexible or less flexible in different spots of the hips and inner thighs. The point was: no matter how amazingly athletic and practiced those people were, some of them wouldn’t have had flexible hips - it just wasn’t physically possible. So I want to affirm your thought that “maybe it’s just your skeleton”, cause it probably is.\n\nAnd even if you were brand new to the practice and had done very little stretching in your life, there is no “cheating” in yoga. The pose works for you, you do not work for the pose. \n\nI will admit I got more heated on your behalf when reading your initial post but reading their other’s comments here I am reminded to give everyone grace - your teacher probably was just trying to make a joke, and it came out wrong. Regardless, your feelings matter and you feeling hurt is valid.\n\nI’m sorry that she hurt your feelings. I hope you continue going to class, and feel safe again.\n\nI thought adjustments like this were called \"modifications\" - not cheating.\n\nI hope you can let it go. If some stranger doesn’t know you or your path , their opinion should mean zero.\n\nI’m so sorry that you had that experience and I am so sorry  that you felt shamed. \n\nHonestly, no one needs to comment on your body. It’s not cheating to use the props. A matter of fact, I’m thrilled that you felt empowered and safe enough to use the props that served your body.\n\nAnd, you stayed in that class and showed everybody how it’s done. Come sit over here  with me, best friend. 🩵\n\nI know there was a yogi that saw you the situation and was grateful that you were there. Because you showed what true Yogi looks like. Someone who is listening to their body. \n\nAs a matter of fact, I use props to demo classes and even when I don’t need them sometimes because I’m trying to calm my nervous system down. \n\nAs a yoga teacher I love seeing students using props their way because that means they are actually doing and living their Yoga on and off the mat.\n\nThis is such a beautiful sentiment 🩵\n\nOP, I hope you know that listening to what your body is telling you, and creating space for yourself to honor your body is exactly what yoga is about to me. You were there for yourself on the mat, as you are now in writing about it and processing your feelings.\n\nEven if the teacher meant it as a joke, this comment really sent the wrong message imo.\n\nEveryone's body is different. We have different proportions, and our joints have different ranges of motion (which can be maximized by yoga/stretching practice but only up to a certain point). \n\nExpecting everyone's body to look, move and function exactly the same is setting students up for shame and failure, and that's what the teacher did here (whether intentionally or unintentionally, it doesn't matter).\n\nThis situation reminds me of an Ashtanga teacher I had who insisted that everyone was equally able to get into an arm balance because \"we all have the same arm length\". Um, nope. My hands don't even touch the floor in dandasana, my dude.\n\nThat's incredible that you had a teacher say that everyone in class had the same arm length. Arm length is probably one of the most variable proportions in humanity, if not the most! I wouldn't trust a teacher like that to be very knowledgeable.\n\nI also used to have a yoga geachter that was very unaccommodating (to me drinking a lot of water). People really seem to get upset about anything that is not their business. \n\nYou really don't need to go to a studio to do yoga. Especially not one like that. You can easily take care of yourself at home. Yoga doesn't require any heavy duty equipment like some other exercises, or even a lot of space. I do yoga at home. I also workout at home. I also go for 3+ miles walk a few times a week. I volunteer in my community. I have a few creative hobbies I enjoy. \n\nFYI I'm South Asian. Yoga is from the region I was born in. Yoga studios/classes were never a big thing there and I don't think it still is lol It's the West that took yoga and made it a trend and came up with these stuff. Yoga has been around literally for thousands of years in the Indian subcontinent as part of many people's lives, but South Asians don't make such a big fuss about it like the West does. \n\nThere are loads of ways to take care of your mental, physical, emotional, spiritual health and they do NOT need to always involve others or the gym, yoga studios, special classes etc.\n\nI’m sorry you experienced this, I believe yoga is an individual practice experienced in community. I cue variations with the direction to choose what serves you in this moment.\n\nThere is no cheating here or something to be called like that. Yoga is about the stretch and posture done in right direction. Not how far you reach while doing it. \n\nYou approached your practice in the right way and no need to feel about it. The teacher need to work a little bit more on group class communication.\n\nShake it off. Just keep going to yoga. \n\n\nYes. You're only competing with yourself. The competition is if you can you be more focused in your asanas, breathe deeper, be more calm, more serene, more focused on ujjayi breathing? Can you live more by the yoga sutras? Can you meditate longer? \n\n\n\nSending you love and light. 🙏🏼📿✨\n\nThis!!\n\nSome instructors are sticklers for traditional practices. Some of the more traditional practices discourage the use of blocks and only focus on building up from the poses that can be completed to perfection. Don’t take it personal. Ask them more about where they learned and what you can do to not have to use so many blocks in that pose.\n\nWow! Crappy teacher. I used to have an awesome instructor. She wouldn’t expect anyone to do more than they were capable of and when I first started I had to basically not do some of the moves. But as time went on, I would do modified poses/movements and within a surprisingly short period of time I was able to do so much more than I was capable of in the first few classes. \n\nThere was never any shaming. Ever.\n\nEven if she was just joking, it’s still a crappy thing to say. I’m out of yoga with an injury right now because I pushed too hard and paid no attention to my very real and valid limitations. Power to you for knowing how your body works and bad cess to her for being such a wet sock about it\n\nHi, instructor was out of order, if she was joking then it was  very bad taste and contrary to the principles of empathy enbodied in the practice of yoga. Every one is different with different abilities and different potential. But, with the same ultimate obective to learn to be one with our selves mind body and soul but seeking union with the universal concience. \n\nDon't feel bad in yourself feel bad for her she lost the path she was following\n\nIgnore the quip you were right in seeking support for self protection. Enjoy your practice and your journey. There wil be other little shake ups, they are but means to finding you path.\n\nNamaste\n\nThe idea of “cheating” with personal fitness just pisses me off, even when it’s a joke. You can’t cheat when it’s for yourself, you can only assist.\n\nShe sounds like a terrible teacher. Yoga is about working with the body you have, and you were!\n\nFuck this teacher. There is no cheating in yoga. \n\nDo you any of you know why some people have inflexible hips?\n\nChildhood sexual abuse and trauma is one reason. Not the only reason. But it’s enough reason to never give anyone shame about their body giving them additional challenges.\n\nBeing swaddled too much, as a baby, is another.\n\nRecovery from injuries…\n\nI just can’t with some teachers.\n\nI thought it had to do with actual anatomy...the joints face a certain way ....\n\nSending you love, friend. Having your feeling of a safe space taken away by an inconsiderate comment or action is not a good feeling, regardless of intent. Sometimes journaling has been helpful to me to release moments like this.\n\nI have deep hip sockets that already predispose me to femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), and I have a history of a torn labrum on the right hip with a possible tear on the left as well. My hips are \"special,\" haha. I cannot sit with my butt on the floor in sukhasana at all - I have to be on a cushion or I am hurting myself. My amazing teacher when I did yoga teacher training in 2021 was so awesome with modifications and suggestions when it came to hips. We are all made differently. Yoga anatomy is a subject so worthy of study for instructors - sounds like yours skipped class that day, haha. I would discuss this with the studio (especially if this is a sub that may or may not be back) because that was probably very alienating for many of you in class, and they should reconsider using this person if she is going to have this attitude. The perfect pose is a myth, our bodies get to where they need to be in that moment. Hugs to you.\n\nI’ve only taken classes from a couple of people, but I’ve never had anyone even jokingly shame me. They either didn’t notice/care what was going on in their class or they suggested alternative poses (I did ask and had approached the teacher beforehand about some ligament issues). Maybe talk to her outside of class about this incident and help you may need?\n\nI'm so sorry this happened. What an unprofessional teacher. My mum had a similar experience during a class and it very nearly put her off going back. Keep your chin up! We all have areas of difficulty. I've been practicing for YEARS and am limber as a pretzel, but if you try and make me balance, I look like a wacky waving inflatable man.\n\nYoga is designed to challenge the mind-body connection but its purpose is to nourish and heal. \n\nIt’s odd to put someone on the spot. When I’ve done  public classes the instructor offers alternative poses including corpse pose if you really just need a nap. \n\nSounds like they might be inexperienced.\n\nI know that sometimes things hit us hard in special ways. Just as we can train to acquire greater bodily comfort in spite of demanding physical setups (through breathing), we can also similarly engage with mental discomforts, ultimately. Both are connected, and don't beat yourself up over being uncomfortable. But also consider that for them it might just have been banter, when for you it was very hurtful.\n\nI feel like telling OP that they're right and teacher is wrong is a double-edged sword and a little too easy.\nNobody can demand someone to not be hurt and it is bad elitism looking down upon them for it. I feel sorry that you're going through this OP. Yet, it's a worthwhile suggestion that one can seek out and heal, and start being less hurt over things that others may not have intended.\n\nI would have kicked my blocks over and done a normal warrior and made uncomfortable eye contact with her the rest of class i don’t play with that. Thats unprofessional and irritating people cannot conform to a teachers plan 100% and its completely ok that ppl dont they only need to follow their own plan…\n\nI would have quietly and quickly packed up and left the studio.\n\nIf exercising in a smart, thoughtful way is cheating, call me a cheater all day. She sounds like someone who is new to teaching or ignorant of social manners. Let it go and just keep being you. If she ever subs again maybe just take her aside and let her know calling you out I front of the class is off limits\n\nI’m sorry! Yoga teachers should not be like that , they should know better that it isn’t about the body  &amp; how it looks , but rather how it feels and that’s different and perfect as it is for each individual person. \n\nIt seems these days people are treating it like some perfect posture parade. Which is the absolute opposite of what yoga is. \n\nYou did your best and don’t let them get to you! Hopefully she realised after too. Go to a better teacher if you can! I find it hard to practice with teachers like this (being a teacher myself)\n\nI went to a jivamukti class last week. Teacher made a show of pointing at the floor in front of me to say get to the front of the mat, but the class was overcrowded so I didn't have enough room to forward fold. Then he decided to correct my posture by pointing and saying no...I explained my neck wouldn't let me do loudly he said \"well just do SOMETHING\" \nI very nearly walked out but I decided to stay after thinking wow, this guy is insecure and it's still my class. Late on in shavasana he said \"if you're thinking why has he picked on me, am I doing it wrong, just let it go\" and I started laughing. Looked him in the eye said thank you walked out and I'm never going back. \n\nAny teacher who a) doesn't check for injuries b) points and makes examples of people in showy ways is ill- trained or ill-suited to teaching yoga imo. All it teaches me is that I know what I need and want from a class.\n\nI really hope you're not put off yoga in your regular class, and if you feel able, giving them some feedback will probably shock them into a bit of self reflection. Or just walk out. It's your class your time and your choice ❤️\n\nSounds like she needs a yoga class. \n\nAka, she is not a good teacher and she needs to chill.\n\nTrust me, as someone who is hypermobile (I have Ehlers Danlos syndrome) I wish my hips were less flexible. It causes me a lot of pain. It’s just a matter of perspective. People are ignorant. You have to roll your eyes at some of the ridiculous comments, people can be really hurtful without even using two neurons\n\nHi hypermobile friend (MCTD)! I knew I found a great yoga teacher when she was able to explain which muscles I should feel engaging in certain poses that other teachers just let me sink into because I \"looked correct.\" She always reminds me how to wake the muscles up and she has helped me learn how to practice so much more safely. Also yes: OP's teacher should have kept her thoughts to herself.\n\nMy yoga teacher always says 'there is no right way to do a yoga pose, everyone's body is different so it will look slightly different for all of us'.\n\nIt's okay to vent! I am sure she didn't mean it in a malicious way but your feelings are valid. Your body is fine the way it is. Hula hooping increases hip mobility.\n\nAll the old ladies in my class put me to shame and I am 30+ years younger. I am always embarrassed by my lack of abilities, compared to them. Our instructor is a British senior woman. In their culture, they like to take “the piss out of everyone”, including themselves. She’s an amazing and hilarious instructor and some of the students will make fun of her and she takes it on well. It’s just a different vibe and culture. May not work for everyone. \n\nOne thing is for sure, there is no such thing as cheating in yoga. You’re all suppose to adjust to your level. Everyone is at a different pace and it is suppose to be a judgement free zone. I would talk to your regular instructor and discuss what happened.\n\nWow, that was highly inappropriate. From start to finish.  Good grief!\n\nCrazy use of props IMO\n\nI’m so sorry she made you feel that way! It should be a safe space and not a competition to see who is most flexible. Hopefully you can put it aside in your mind and keep going!\n\nI know how you feel unfortunately - after returning to a regular class after a couple of months off (pneumonia and then ill children) my teacher tried to push me into a pose I could have done previously and said loudly ‘god what’s HAPPENED to you??!’ \nI wanted to cry and run away.\n\nOh this made my blood boil. I wish they were able to recognise their error and apologise to you. Perhaps one day you’ll be able to explain it to them, it’s not okay and you are well within your right to feel the way you are feeling. It is not meant to be a competition and there should be alternatives to suit different body structures and flexibilities.\n\nJust remember she’s just a flawed human as well as all of us. Maybe she says stupid things, maybe she has impulse control problems or isn’t a great teacher but nobody else could fill in. Also I always say stupid offensive rude things and I can see myself doing this, and internally feeling like it’s become game like being like use another block, another one, what, still not working, this is cheating! \nU should give urself a pat on the back for accepting yourself where you are, and listening to your body. That’s yoga. If u did anything else, strived for more, forced yourself against your abilities or beat yourself up, or fixated on the result, you wouldn’t have been doing yoga at all. stay in your goodness and just let that blow through you and away\n\nThe way I’m built, I would have loudly called her out and embarrassed her in turn.\n\nI’m also very inflexible in my hips and I’ve had teachers be like wtf you can’t do that?? And it does sting but I remember that yoga isn’t a competition and it’s about how you feel in your body. I’ve had some amazing teachers help me with alternatives and give me pointers on improving flexibility there. I would avoid going to that teacher and maybe letting the teacher know those comments are inappropriate and do nothing to help your yoga journey.\n\nI'm so sorry to hear this. While I'm absolutely sure your teacher meant no harm, it was inappropriate none the less. I  was a yoga instructor for over 12 years, and I  always went out of my way to help someone when I  saw they needed a little extra support or adjustment. If my clients made a joke about their stiffness,  (which happens alot as they often felt uncomfortable,  and wished to defuse that with humor,  often in a self deprecating way) I would try to put them at ease by reassuring them we are all built differently and this is not a competition. Maybe your instructor was inexperienced or nervous. Who knows... What I hope for you is that you always listen to your body while in class. Please don't let this experience let you push yourself beyond your ability or prevent you from asking for extra help because you fear being shamed or embarrassed.  Also, I would encourage you to speak up after class to the teacher if something like this happens again. They probably didn't realise at all how it made you feel, and teaching is also a learning process. They need to learn never to create a situation that could discourage a client from asking for help.🙏\n\nIf an instructor uses the word “cheating” in yoga, then they’re viewing yoga as a competition or some type of measure for how “good” one can be at poses. And as many people have pointed out, that’s not the purpose of yoga.\n\nI would ask the instructor if they are open to feedback. Or if you practice at a yoga studio (as opposed to a gym that offers yoga classes) you can also consider approaching the owner with your feedback. But you can talk about the instructor’s wording, how the entire situation made you feel, and if it was a class open to all levels, that they should provide modifications for poses. Especially if they see people unable to get into a pose.\n\nFor a little background on myself, I did my RYT200 years ago. While I liked the physical side, I too have VERY tight hips, and it was the other tenets / limbs of yoga and the safe environment that really drew me in. I taught for a VERY brief time, but as teachers in training, we were taught not to draw attention to anyone. Any adjustments would be made more subtlety, or it was on us to offer a modification or a different cue to help people get into a pose. And we were taught how to accommodate MANY different bodies. We were also taught how to give and receive feedback. I can’t say that all yoga teachers have received that same level of training, but an instructor should want to improve.\n\nAlso, I’m sorry that your safe space felt like it had been violated, and I hope you can find the same level of peace in your practice again.\n\nI'm sorry that happened to you. As a former yoga teacher, I would never do that to a student. I would advise you to go to whoever owns or manages your studio and tell them how upset you were about that remark. That substitute is someone who probably needs to be corrected. If that keeps happening, the shala will lose students.\n\nThat’s shitty &amp; I would’ve been upset. \n\nI have suuuuper flexible hips. And now I’m in my 40s with one hip surgery done and still lots of pain so probably more in my future. \n\nI’ve learned what hurts my body and I respect my limits.  I rarely do child’s pose or happy baby because both poses cause me pain. \n\nSorry this happened to you.\n\nOh, my. I'm so sorry. This reminds me of the substitute teacher we had for a beginner's yoga class. As the class went on, it became more difficult to understand what to do. I finally piped up and asked her to explain a pose. Her reply: \"You should know this. It's not like this is a beginner's class.\" Ummm, yes, it was. She looked shocked when I corrected her. The rest of the class was a little better, but still awkward and difficult. I never took another class from this instructor. \n\nI hope you find peace again in your practice. Perhaps ask the instructor, on the side, for help adapting certain poses for your own physical situation, enlisting her as a partner. You shouldn't have to, as that's her role, but you need to take care of you first.\n\nHip mobility varies greatly in people. Some yogis that practice have “tight hips” when in reality the joint can’t open any wider because the BALL IN THE JOINT WONT MOVE MORE. Teachers are  taught very minimum anatomy and physiology. I have a Biology degree and the amount of fluff taught in 200 YTT is incredible. Remember that the journey is yours and along the way people will make comments.\n\nI would’ve told her that my hips don’t lie.\n\nThe worst part of this is that she didn't even consider that you might have a permanent disability that causes this.  For instance, I had bilateral lat flap breast reconstruction so the top part of my lat muscles were removed and flapped over to the front.  They are still connected with nerves &amp; blood supply to the lays and contract with those muscles so I have some strange sensation &amp; deficits.  Nothing I modify is \"cheating\" and I'd hate to see how embarrassed the instructor would be if they said something like that to me in a class because we'd certainly have to stop for me to educate them...\n\nFor YEARS as an adult, I was too intimidated to attend yoga classes for this reason! Now, in my 50s, I’m a plus size yoga teacher. Yoga SHOULD be safe! It should be inclusive of all abilities and body types! I’m so sorry this happened to you 🙏\n\nI'm so sorry that happened! In my mind there are two \"different kinds of yoga\" and one of them just matters on how it LOOKS like yoga, which is not the core of yoga or calisthenics at all.\n\nYou are very well spoken, if you feel like it, I highly suggest gently taking the teacher aside and explain how that effected you. I think the teacher likes tough love but thats not appropiate for a lot of people especially strangers.\nWith any professional I want them to treat me like I ultimately know whats best for my body, they can make suggsstions or even take me aside and ask me something directly, but that joke was harmful and it changes the culture of the class for everyone.\n\nYeah if anything she should have commended you for doing the regression proper for you.\n\nSome people should not teach yoga. That's all I'm going to say about that. Adjustments and modifications are not \"cheating.\" My example of a similar thing...\n\nMy husband and I were on vacation in Florida and biked to a local yoga studio. We are avid bikers, so use biking as our primary mode of travel when we vacation (and most of the rest of the time, too). I also teach yoga and used to be an acrobat and gymnast. So, my hips are pretty wide-open, even though I have the build of a biker.\n\nSo, he and I get to this class and people are settling in. The yoga instructor is talking loudly to another person we assume is the owner of the studio. The owner says, loudly, in front of the whole room, \"Well, obviously, your going to need to get the straps out,\" as she kind of rolled her eyes. The instructor responds back, \"Ya. And, they biked here. So, we know what that means.\"\n\nI almost walked out right then and there. But chose to stay, instead, tossing the straps to the side when she handed them to me and promptly warmed up doing the splits.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that it does not mean anything whether or not you can do the splits, or whether your hips (or any other body part) is tight. The only thing that matters is that you are using the asanas to create sensations in your body that are helpful to achieving progress in a yogic state of mind. You might be able to lay your whole chest on your legs in a seated forward fold, or, you may hinge an inch. Neither is better or worse. The discipline and the mental state when doing it are the important things. Any studio that does not fully embrace that should not be teaching yoga, IMO.\n\nThis is one of those situations where as you correctly stated, she was wrong to say that. She was wrong. SHE was wrong. Not you.\n\nYoga is about the presence of the moment and being able to make a decision.  The reason you do the poses, or Indian calisthenic exercises is to bring awareness to the sensations that you're having in your body.  The difference between a tight person and a loose person is the loose person has to go farther to feel the same sensations that a type person has to just by showing up.  \n\nSome of my favorite practices are when I come back after a leave.  My body shakes my muscles are tight and it's in those moments that my practice comes alive.  I get to choose whether I'm going to listen to my body and take a break or endure the pain and push through.  I get to choose whether I need a support or modification.  I get to choose how deep I go and how peaceful I can keep my mind and how consistent I can keep my breath.  The practice of yoga is the practice of being present and breathing.  The sensations bring you to a place where you have to be present.  Without sensation your mind will wander and if you push too hard you stop breathing.  Just remember to do a yoga class perfectly you need to feel something and breathe.  You can lay on the floor and shavasana all class long and still be doing yoga perfectly. You can be following the instructors every command and doing piss poor yoga because you're mind is wandering, you are not listening to your body, you're pushing too hard and not breathing.  \n\nBryan Kest if you bring your s*** to yoga your yoga turns to s***.  You just had an experience with someone who brought her s*** to yoga and she's an instructor. Rather than teaching you to listen to yourself she let her ego show.  \n\nNow if flexibility is what you're looking for,  pick a pose any pose get into the point of sensation hang out there for 30 to 60 seconds come out of it give your body about a minute to recover and repeat the process for more times. Do that three times a week and your body will start opening up.  This is not my protocol it's \"movement by David\" you'll know it's him because he ends his videos stay flexy my friend.  But just remember yoga is not about flexibility or strength or ego it's about learning to find a balance between too much and not enough and staying present and being able to make choices. The strength and flexibility are byproducts of the practice not the goal.  Any instructor that takes you out of that is a piss-poor instructor.\n\nThere are no rules in yoga as everyone's body is different and everyone's stage in their practice is different. Who can't do this math? I think it sucks that she said this out loud. She obviously doesn't get the whole point.\n\nIf you are not doing a ***constantly evolving personalized practice***, you are just doing some sort of synchronized interpretive dance.??? What is the point. \n\nYour body tells you what to do, the poses are a guide.  You listen to your body. This is the problem I have with classes.\n\nTeacher should’ve read the literal yoga room she was in. This is yoga, cheating isn’t really possible so it’s a bad joke\n\nYoga should be a safe space for anything! I recently had a yoga teacher yell at me during class and I was also extremely offended. Bottom line is you should feel welcome no matter what you're doing—even if you're not following the sequence, doing everything your own way, and using modifications that fit your body. Any teacher who says otherwise shouldn't be teaching in my opinion.\n\nSounds like some trauma informed yoga training would be beneficial. \n\nBest you can do is maybe send in an email and just express maybe they be conscious of her verbiage and how others are felt in class. \n\nNow I’m sure most of us have gotten into yoga for our physical practice and maybe some of us are in it for more reasons. \n\nBut yoga is deeper than just physical despite the belief, because people believe it to be a safe space. When that’s tainted it’s hard. \n\nKeep doing the yoga!! Yoga isn’t always “perfect” but can agree this is less than ideal\n\nI have noticed a lot of yoga classes are feel like a competition rather than yoga.\n\nHi, well thanks for sharing your story. I think the following: the teacher probably just wanted to make a joke but may have not fully understood what yoga is all about. Otherwise she wouldn’t have said the word “cheating”. \nRegarding your emotional response. I fully understand your reaction. There are some buttons all of us have. When they get triggered by certain things, we react very strongly to it. Mostly because there is some stuck energy beneath it. If you can let it go, if not examine the feeling in a gentle and loving way. It seems to me you can learn something about yourself there. \n\nMuch love 💕🙏\n\nI'm sorry she said that and ruined your class. That sucks! I really hope you can move through these tough emotions and still enjoy the practice you love. \n\nI don't have advice, but I hope you feel better ❤️\n\nI’m so sorry this happened to you. This is a sub problem (insecure, inexperienced teacher I’m guessing, but sometimes veteran teachers pull this crap too), not a you problem. I actually switched to an at home yoga practice for years after an experience like yours and am now trying to gear myself up to find a new class. I hope this sub doesn’t ruin the safe experience of yoga for you 💚 Tight hips are amazing- those hips have kept you safe and carried you around your whole life! Yoga is a chance for you to love and pamper them, not shame them. Shame on that sub! Not funny!!\n\nI'm sorry you had that experience. The final straw for me at the gym I was attending was when a substitute yoga instructor came up to me after a class and said \"wow, so your core is really weak.\"  She actually spoke so quietly and quickly during the class that I couldn't hear most of her cues. I was shocked she said that to me in front of multiple people at the front desk.\n\ni wld be sooo pissed as that sub teacher. ur right. absolutely should not have been said. so not cool or in the essence of yoga. the teacher should have given alternative poses and adjusted the poses to be right for the students in the class. this teacher should be fired.\n\nShould be a safe space…even from badly placed jokes. Sorry that you’re feeling down about it, people can only learn by being told what they did wasnt received well.\n\nThat is so inappropriate and you should let the studio know what happened. That is unacceptable there is no cheating in yoga\n\nI had to stop reading to just give an answer 😬maybe someone said this already but \nI think confronting this could be beneficial \nIf this person comes back to teach again then maybe it’s worth giving feedback and by then you might have it more thought through so you can help the teacher with constructive advice. \n\nNo cheating in Yoga so what does she mean by that comment? Maybe you just thought of a cool modification that can be used in the future for people with less flexibility.\nIts ok to cry in Yoga too maybe you should cry next time and not hold back 🤩\nNo right answer but your feelings are important and some people need help to become empathetic \nA true teacher would want to know how you are doing and be there to assist in your journey into the pose.\n\nGo to teach and say don’t embarrass me in front of the class. I don’t appreciate it. It will help you toughen up a bit.\n\nThe shame!   Booo.  Boooooo.\n\nLooks like you need to get more flexible *and* tougher. Good teacher giving you so much to work on with a single comment.\n\nYour teacher's comment triggered a negative memory from an earlier time in your childhood. What you were fighting were past tears, cried by a kid that felt shunned.\n\nIt is not clear to me if the teacher just wanted to make a joke and you took it badly because of your past.\n\nAt any rate, you're sturdier than this.\n\nLook into your own darkness. Don't run to strangers off Reddit to hold your hand. What was the soft spot that her comment touched? Do you feel like you're not competing enough in the game of life (career, relationships, finances, etc.?) Look into it. Question it.\n\nJung was saying \"We meet ourselves time and again in a thousand disguises on the path of life.\"\n\nMaybe it was good that you felt bad after her comment. Maybe it's good that your head hurts when you don't drink water. It's a signal to do something and correct a problem. Maybe there's a part of you that needs love and support, but also wants to compete and get better and you don't let it out, because you fear disappointment.\n\nIt's clear you're trying to be better at yoga. What you don't want is to be told how far away you are from a perfect position. It's good to have a benchmark and know how close or far you are from it. You wouldn't want your Google map to be vague about whether you're on track or not to reach your destination.\n\nComparison is not the issue. It's the perspective that you have that transforms the result of the comparison into something else and it seems you've been carrying it with yourself for a long time.\n\nLook inside, see where the problem is, and fix it. You're an adult now, not that helpless kid. You can take care of yourself. You know what you like and don't like. Get to work on yourself. No Reddit upvotes or comments will do that work for you.\n\nThis is an odd comment that seems slightly off from OP’s concerns… 🤨\n\nWhy? OP states she wants encouragement.\n\nI'm encouraging her to stand her ground and not allow her childhood to ruin a nice yoga session because of what somebody said.\n\nWhen you're dehydrated and have a headache, would you like somebody to tell you you need a glass of water or would you like them to commiserate with you about your headache?\n\n[deleted]\n\nDon’t take this personally but this is a hilariously bad take 😂😂\n\nReally? Nothing is personal?\n\n[deleted]\n\nit’s “intention vs impact” not “intention over impact.” ya still gotta leave space between the two for accountability."

    "all_comment_text": "Two years later, leading classes for other non typical yogis\n\nAs an Indian the word “Yogi” always surprises me :-) We don’t (never ) associate that word for people who do Yoga !\n\nReally?! What is that word supposed to mean?\n\nDon’t know equivalent word for people who do Yoga :-(  there is no such word (I may be wrong) but we say “I do yoga or he does yoga but never introduce as Yogi”.\n\n   If you ever introduce yourself as Yogi , people may give weird look or max giggle here!  \n\nYogi is very much revered word like one who attained godliness or beyond worldly life . The God shiva who we believe to be introduced Yoga is called Adhi Yogi (first Yogi). Because yoga got more to do with atman (closest word is souls or mind) than sharira (material body)\n\nSo, it's something similar to a boddhisattva?\n\nI don’t know anything about boddhisatva:-(\n\nI’m a month back in the studio after a 3 year break; sometimes I can’t do the poses but I always try and it’s always fun 🙏 and sometimes I surprise myself\n\n\"Yoga looks boring\" - me five years ago.  I now have a drawer full of yoga clothes and go to class every day.\n\nWe should probably remove the “lose 50 lbs” \n\nFirst, you likely won’t lose weight doing yoga. Second, yoga is for everyone, even big people who don’t care or plan to lose weight. Lastly, 10 lbs a month is borderline eating disorder and unhealthy.\n\nI think it's meant to be hyperbolic. How I interpreted it at least!\n\nYoga is not just about the physical effects.  Are you going to burn a ton of calories? No Will yoga give more strength and flexibility that makes physical activity more enjoyable? Yes.  Does yoga teach mindfulness and promote mental health? Yes.  Are all of these things as important to making the changes in your life needed in order to lose weight as an exercise that burns calories?   Probably more important in my opinion.  \n\nIf it works for her who are we to say she is wrong?   We should applaud her growth instead of giving a “Well, actually…”  No one wants to promote unhealthy weight loss, but we know nothing about her starting weight, diet, or anything else to assess whether she is borderline eating disorder or similar. \n\nYou can definitely lose weight with yoga and 10 pounds a month is not unhealthy. I’ve lost 3 in one week by cutting out fast food and doing yoga for 30 min a day. I feel great\n\n[deleted]\n\nBut it’s a part of it and contributes to the weight loss. Yes ANY exercise would be useless if you ate like shit\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’d say 80%, but regardless we can both agree that any kind of exercise does lead to weight loss with an overall calorie deficit\n\nYoga can however change your eating habits, e.g. if you are a stress-eater, and yoga decreases your stress levels. Speaking from personal experience, with considerable weight loss over the last 2 years.\n\ncongratulations! i don’t own any workout clothes right now so i can’t do yoga, however it is nice to read about other people’s practices :-)\n\nI had 3 shoulder surgeries…2 neck issues from accidents….and my weightlifting became difficult…my old USAF buddy recommended yoga….although it was DDPY and it really transformed my life.  Im more flexible…i have less joint pain…and i can lift again…and at 54 im in way better shape then i was in my 30’s .   I start every day with a 10 minute yoga session….and always do a yoga session before i hit the weights.  Its a life changer."

    "all_comment_text": "With a foreword by Rob Zombie!!! Who knew Rob was a yogi\n\nShort for Robert Shavasana.\n\nLOL PLEASE\n\n😆\n\nI believe it is actually Robert Zombieshambasana.\n\nZombasana\n\nI’m so interested to read this forward lol\n\nHell who knew he was a zombie!!\n\nI used crank up Superbeast in my Grandmothers House obnoxiously loud back in the day. 🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾\n\nI think he's even vegan\n\nThe fact the women on the cover were made to arch their back and push their booties out to appeal to the male audience is killing me, that is terrible spinal alignment for those postures 😂\n\nWell it does say “yoga babes included”\n\nWhatever it takes to get people to try it. Ddp is saving lives with his yoga message.\n\nWait? Backing that ass up isn't a yoga pose? It's just a juvenile lyric? \n\nIn all seriousness it's probably how I look trying to get into some poses. I never realized how tight and uncoordinated I was till I started pursuing yoga.\n\nThat dude in the middle tops it off nicely though 🤣\n\nThis is everything wrong with Americanized yoga as a fitness routine so normal frumpy looking guys can *get* 'yoga babes'.  Its like if Andrew Tate sold a fitness routine.\n\nYess they r rly selling “regular guys” 😭 including dreams of being surrounded by yoga babes\n\nlol T'was the cherry on the tippety top\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat’s discriminatory\n\nNo, it's objectifying women.\n\nThat move and the Cat Arch made my cheeks a little sore, especially when doing the forward bend.\n\nThis is so funny -do yoga and this is what you’re getting into fellas\n\nThis! For regular guy and it’s one guy w a dad bod with two hot ladies near him 😂\n\nRegular guys want this though 😂\n\nLost me with “yoga babes included” that for some reason has a hyphen\n\nHaha the hyphen… why?\n\nBecause it got split across 2 lines and they incorrectly treated it like 1 word.\n\nRequest:\n\nYoga Babes Included\n\nResult\n\nYoga-Babes Included\n\nThe lower case “i” tells me they meant yoga-babes\n\nBecause it’s two nouns pushed together.  Yoga isn’t an adjective.  Maybe?\n\n&gt;yoga isn’t an adjective \n\n* Yoga mat\n\n* Yoga practice\n\n* Yoga studio\n\n* Yoga teacher\n\n* Yoga babe\n\n[deleted]\n\nYoga-mat, yoga-practice… etc.  haha.  Just kidding.\n\nYoga flame\n\nYoke those nouns together, baybeee ! The meaning of yoga 🙏🏻\n\nWith a forward by Ron Zombie. Because we have all been clamoring for his thoughts on yoga.\n\nDudes vegan, loves yoga and by most accounts an awesome person but go ahead and be that petty\n\nRob Zombie cast DDP in Devil’s Rejects so there’s the connection for anyone wondering what’s up with that.\n\nMy god, i read that as hymen, not hyphen. Help\n\nHe addresses hymen work in the third (ashtanga) series instillation of the book. For that one, students are encouraged to crack a cold one and enjoy the yoga babes from the comfort of couch asana—the final stage of nirvana.\n\nSamadhi 🙏🏻\n\nI can understand. He gets kinda “bro” with the commentary but the workouts are solid.\n\nI'm with /u/Few_Age4344 .  I get the \"yoga babes included\" because it's kind of tongue-in-cheek bro-dom satire.  \n\nBut I too don't understand why it's hyphenated.\n\nDDP is a bro, and that's ok.\n\nI would really like to know Rob Zombie's thoughts.\n\nSummary: \n\n“If you’re like me, the sound of the word yoga will get you a sarcastic eye roll… it’s girly man, hippie crap, right? … if it weren’t for the fact this DDP guy is built like a block of granite and could crush my skull, I’d be laughing at him. But one day I decided to give it a shot. The first thing he going to teach me is how to breathe… I think to myself “I know how to f****** breathe”… I realize this isn’t what I thought. This shit is difficult and pretty soon I was feeling the burn. …YRG works… it’s a total body workout that kicks your ass and whips you into shape. …Here’s my advice, put the doughnut down, pick up this book and get with the YRG program.”\n\nThis is the skull crushing analysis that I want and expect from Mr Rob Zombie!! \n\nAnyone that’s heard Rob zombie in concert would probably agree, that in fact, he doesn’t know how to breathe …. 😂😂😂 I hope yoga has changed that for him. \n\nRob zombie has some bops that I still listen too!!! It makes me wonder what his playlist is for flowin’\n\nI saw him twice, on bills with bands I actually wanted to see. I hear he has a better guitar player now, but the guy he had then (97 and 99? don't quote me on that) was terrible.\n\nOzzfest 99 opening for Black Sabbath in Atl.  Rob had a great stage show but he was visibly winded during his set.\n\nI went to ozzfest 99 too and can confirm that he gets A+++ for enthusiasm and entertainment, but  has a labored breathy vocal performance.\n\nHe must of had John 5 join after what guitarist you saw. he's a bad ass guitar player. Idk who is playing for him now, though, since John is playing for motley crue.\n\nYeah this was when John 5 was still with Manson\n\n“Hey Yeah!!! I'm The One That You Wanted!\nHey Yeah!!! I'm Your Superbeast!”\n\nHe looks like a giant teaching small humans of to do yoga.\n\nAt his (reported) height of 6'5\", he kinda is.\n\nThey lie about just about everyone's height in the WWE, but he is probably still fairly tall.\n\nDDP is awesome, His work with Jake the Snake and Butterbean is just inspiring. \n\nLots of good stuff on YouTube, my parents love yoga with Adriene. For books a great foundation is Journey into Power by Baron Baptiste, and JivaMukti yoga by David life and Sharon Gannon.\n\nThank you kindly. I do better with books and I saw the journey into power on Amazon. You’ve convinced me to get it. Thank you kindly\n\nI just did my first Baptiste class.  Really liked it.\n\nI had YRG when it first came out, it was called DDP Yoga.  Good stuff, but my practice was already beyond that.\n\nIs this the yoga equivalent of naming deodorants \"OCEAN, ARTIC BLAST, SASQUATCH, SHARK ATTACK, PAUL BUNNION, GUN\" to get men to actually use them?\n\nYes\n\nA lot of the positions are renamed to either be more Bro-y (Touchdown, Bar back, Hood ornament) or more wrestling themed (*Road* Warrior position, Showstoppers) So 100% yes. \n\nI've been doing it for about 10 years at this point and would genuinely recommend it to anyone, but it still is what it is, lol.\n\nnever had a yogi in person or I follow not eventually be fairly weird in some way ... this is a new angle tho!!!\n\n\"Gun\" hahaha\n\nI love ddp yoga, it helped me a lot when I tried it years ago.\n\nPretty grim to see yoga marketed in this way, but on the other side of the ledger, DDP has genuinely saved a number of former pro wrestlers' (and other people's) lives by helping them through addiction problems. I get the impression the \"no bro, this yoga is totally for tough dudes like you!\" marketing has been an important part of reaching those people.\n\nThis is exactly my take on it as well.  It's the only type of Yoga my friend will even entertain learning about, so it's a great gateway for people.  The hope being they get deeper into a practice or into a studio to help add the philosophical components.\n\nDIAMOND CUTTER!!!  HOOD ORNAMENT!!!  OIL FOR THE TINMAN!!\n\nI actually owe DDP for getting me into yoga many years ago when my wife drunkenly bought the dvds online.  At the time I hated anything traditional yoga and wouldn't be caught dead anywhere near it.   I got nothing for you as far as similar other practices- all I can share is I eventually moved to various other teachers and styles, along with general PT/mobilty.  DDP was kind of an interesting hybrid of a bunch of things and good jumping off point.  \n\nIt isn't yoga, but lately I've been into https://davidgreyrehab.com - who does a fantastic job of really cueing the subtle movements that make a huge difference.\n\nI also enjoy andy speer's content on peloton. (Which I also endorse- they have tons of content you can do just on your phone, including yoga/stretching/mobikty/strength/meditation - all with good music....)\n\nThe more I do this stuff there's such a huge overlap of yoga, stretching, mobility, core work, PT - it's like a continuum -  you see the same poses with different names.  (Which was kind of DDPs thing and rebranding it). Eventually even the chilliest hippie stuff you come to find the value in.  The biggest thing is finding an instructor to explain the details in a way you can relate to and truly apply to your body.  I find out every teacher can explain something slightly different and you can learn something from all of them even if you've been doing the same poses for years.\n\nYup! He may like Dennis Morton's yoga flows on Peloton as well! I love Andy:) great mobility&amp;strength.\n\n\"yoga babes included\"?? I’m all in favor of reaching out to people who otherwise wouldn’t be attracted to yoga — but I don’t like to see it done in such a sexist way\n\nYou gotta meet people where they’re at\n\nIn the 80s?\n\n🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯\n\nNot that serious; clearly he’s being silly.  Look at that face and shirt.😆\n\nIf you’ve seen any of DDP’s yoga videos you know he doesn’t take himself that seriously\n\nDidn’t his yoga training help a veteran paratrooper with serious spinal injuries walk again?\n\nI remember that viral video. It was touching watching that fella go from crutches to running after hard work and dedication.\n\nP90X has a yoga routine they video taped\n\nThank you kindly. I just skimmed at some videos and I think it’s what I’m looking for.\n\nYeah it's good, definitely different from what you'll do in a yoga studio, but it's good for a home workout.\n\nGreat. Home is where I’m comfortable doing this until I can get enough balance to hold these poses longer than 4 deep breaths.\n\nHave you tried the ddpy app? There are tons of options on there from many different teachers.\n\nI haven’t. I thought the app would link you to the website where he sells the dvd’s. I’ll have to try it.\n\nTheres free trials available too\n\nGo on YouTube and search for power yoga, find a teacher you like and get at it.\n\nCool and thank you kindly. They showed a lot of Ashtanga yoga and it seems intense. I hope I can work up to that.\n\nI use Charlie follows and she gives alternatives in her power yoga videos if you can't do exactly what she's doing.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBrainrot answer: When dudes were the powerful guys.\n\nDude looks like he stretches to Limp Bizkit and hydrates wirh baja blast montain dew\n\n😆😆😆😆😆\n\nI use the peloton app for yoga. There’s a power yoga category with over 300 classes. Decent amount of choices for instructors. I dig it\n\nIs it individual videos or streaming?\n\nIt’s a catalog  of videos dating back to around 2020. There’s a monthly fee. I want to say around $40/month\n\nCool. The movie Glass Onion made me think it was streaming.\n\nThere’s an option to stream live classes I’ve just never done it before. They put them up on demand the next day\n\nThere is live classes as well. Personally I do a mix of both but as long as you don't own any of their equipment(I don't, I only use the app)the monthly fee is $20, not $40...it's only $40 if you have say, the bike or rower. Excellent classes!! Check out Dennis Morton's Power Flows to start!:) I think you'd like it &amp; the music selections are awesome.\n\n+1 for peloton. Members can offer a 60 day guest pass referral.\n\nAll of you can laugh but when I told my wife I was interested in yoga about ten years ago she got me this book. It was useful. I learned. And I'm still here. \n\nAnd the author has an in interesting story. Professional wrestler, back injuries. Back surgeries. Long term spinal pain and radicular symptoms. Yoga gave him his life back and he wanted other men to have that same experience. Especially men who might be too macho to understand what yoga is, and isn't. It's the equivalent of those 1960s pulp sci-fi books. A good book in a marketing shell. \n\nTldr: its actually a really good and useful book.\n\nDDP YOGA is also an app you can download. Maybe try that if you really enjoy his yoga specifically\n\nOh wow! I actually used to have this book. I haven't seen it in almost 20 years 😂\n\nNo one gonna comment on 🖐🏼🤚🏼shirt?\n\nI remember when this book came out years ago, I was just starting my exploration into Yoga and Hindu philosophy. I picked it up as I was a wrestling fan as well and knew of Diamond Dallas Page.\n\nHe stated that he started with Calisthenics and stretching to help him with injuries from the ring. Realizing the benefits of stretching, he delved into Yoga.\n\nThe book was written in 2005, and is no longer in print. He has now changed his brand of Yoga from YRG to DDP Yoga. He has streaming classes, DVDs and other stuff. If you look in the book, you see a young Dustin Rhodes, currently one of the biggest names in the business now.\n\nDallas has been known for being very positive, hence the tag Positively Page. A real down to earth guy who is very accessible to a lot of his students. Go to his YouTube channel to see the before and after results of some of his students, it's pretty mind-blowing.\n\nYou often see current and former wrestlers on his channel showing how he's helped them overcome injuries and bad lifestyle choices from years of neglect.\n\nSome people want the benefits of Yoga without the philosophy and religion, as all they want at the current time are the physical benefits. If it's an entry point into Yoga or even better lifestyle choices, I'm all for it.\n\nIt’s hilarious how self righteous this sub gets sometimes. This book is almost 20 years old so although it’s a bit cringe now, DDP transformed the mentality of what yoga could be for average dude in America …. Now it’s accepted by tons of places that it never would have …. High school football etc etc … seriously need to get a larger perspective of things in this sub sometimes … more “typical” American men were brought to yoga because of DDP and how is that anything but good …. Ffs..\n\nI'd like to think we are all flexible enough to be able to acknowledge what this book did for getting men into yoga while also side-eyeing what it took to get men into yoga. \n\nIt's pretty crazy that they basically had to say \"we aren't girls, we're MEN...we FUCK girls!!!\" While using women as props. Belittling us and dehumanizing us at the same time.  But hey, that's what attracts men then so be it. It's just a weird window into how dysfunctional we've encouraged men to be in America.\n\nBut that wasn’t the case was it? It was a pile on by ignorant people who had no context. It was tongue in cheek from 20 years ago and he’s brought yoga into the mainstream for men more than anyone else. People are just butthurt that Vegan Rob Zombie and DDP are part of this community of yoga and thats just hilarious … but Karen’s be Karen’s …\n\nTongue in cheek belittlement is still belittlement. Idk why youre bringing in veganism, is it supposed to make it better? Worse? Lol. and you *are* on the internet mad that people are pooping on shitty humor, with little introspection, which is also mildly humorous. \n\nSure, it got people into yoga who mightve not. It also fucks over people in the process. There's no denying the cringe. Idk what you want, for us to say it's all okay? Cuz its not. And criticism is part of the game. People are allowed to dislike this, and they are probably right to.\n\nBecause rob zombie is vegan and a healthy practitioner and beating someone up for something made twenty years ago for saying  “yoga babes” to discount the positive effects it has provided since then for the yoga community is weak and a bit bully…. For this community that preaches openness and acceptance it’s hilarious how close minded they are of other people’s journeys and timelines.\n\nPointing out the harm that that kind of sexist shit perpetuates doesn't discount the positive effects its achieved. Both can exist in the same dimension. \n\nIt is unfortunate that men seem gauge their masculinity off of how they can be better than, or sexualize, women. That's the real bullying here. I have no need to be open and accepting about my gender being portrayed like that. And nobody's ragging on op, they're ragging on the book. Sure, it's helped op, sure it's helped others, I'd probably laugh and get some good tidbits while reading thru it as well. But that doesn't change that the sexism sucks, and I'm glad that kind of \"humor\" is hopefully a thing of the past.\n\nJourney into power by Baron Baptiste.  He breaks down a lot of different postures and his own preferred sequence really well.\n\nAnother person suggested that book as well. It’ll be my next purchase.\n\nBaptiste Power Yoga is the real deal.  DDP is great and all - but it's not 'Power' yoga....\n\nNow that is a solid book! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nThe DDP yoga series was what actually got me started doing yoga. Thanks DDP. Bang!\n\nThis OLD first gen of his program and its grown into an amazing yoga program with an app..dvds and helpful products and meal guides. \nJust launched an actual Physical Therapy Recovery program too.\n\n\"Yoga Babes Included\"?  Yikes\n\nLooool not the male gaze yoga. I've seen everything now. I've read through the free sample and all I can say is that when we talk about colonisation of yoga and cultural appropriation of spiritual traditions that mean a lot to people, this is exactly what we mean. This isn't just sexist and misinformed, it's also incredibly disrespectful to the tradition.\n\nAlso, quotes like this from the book:\n\n\"I can't think of a better place to meet women who are in, or already on their way to being in, great shape with great, flexible bodies than in the yoga studio\"\n\nand\n\n\"Dallas understands the things men care about: improved strength and endurance, a better sex life, reduced stress levels, and (maybe most importantly) access to ridiculously hot yoga babes.\"\n\nare why we constantly get questions from guys who feel awkward about attending mixed yoga classes. It's sexist and harmful to women but it's also very harmful to men who genuinely just want to practice yoga.\n\nYou all can downvote me to oblivion for this…But It’s not that serious. Clearly this is from that FHM, Maxim era of dude stuff. It’s supposed to be silly and “sexist”.\n\nI mean, this is literally people's culture that he is taking the piss out of. Yoga is an ancient spiritual tradition that came to us from India, it's not just a form of exercise and is a gift to the West.\n\nWhat's the joke here, exactly? Explain please. It's not 'silly' if it's at the cost of people of that culture (many of whom care about their tradition deeply), women and men who are genuine practitioners. It's not that serious *to you* because from where you're sitting, you get to benefit from this simply side-splitting humour. \n\nSome men will use this 'it's a joke' manipulation tactic of plausible deniability when women call out sexism yet seem to completely understand the harm when it comes to harmful stereotypes about men, or their own culture and traditions.\n\nThat cover alone should show that it’s all in good fun. Maybe that book will open peoples eyes to the true nature of yoga and it’s other 7 limbs. I get that people are passionate about the “real” yoga. That guy in that book is not. 🤷🏾\n\nfind the Corepower Training manual if you have good google-fu skills. I have a paper copy, it literally provides everything in terms of what pose does what, this pose flows into or out of that other one, great biomechanic instruction (joint-stacking, mobility options/alternatives, etc.)\n\n  \nalso recommend \"How to Become a Supple Leopard\" which basically is a physical therapy manual with a hilarious name. it's a serious book that costs a couple hundred bucks fyi. I think it is taught from in some programs.\n\nI like that title and there’s a hard copy on Amazon for $45. Thank you for the lead.\n\nMy husband has the DVD series and while I think it is silly and it cracks me up (warrior becomes road warrior, tadasana is touchdown pose) the truth is, this is the only way he would’ve ever got in to yoga, the workouts are solid (though not *real* yoga) and it gave him enough confidence/ interest to do “real” yoga with me.\n\nMen are the only ones really gendering yoga. It’s just exercise and stretching, it’s wild that you’d need to have it catered to your genitals.\n\nHis market is clearly marketed towards guys though. And you saying that doesn’t make it less gendered it is extremely more common in woman. \n\nHe realises that the people who are going to get his product are normal guys who might look up to him or be swayed by the fact it isn’t all the mental side of yoga which they are skeptics about.\n\nTo be honest he has done amazing help to some very sick people with his yoga programs. So props to him, let him do his thing\n\nBasically. Clearly it’s silly marketing from 20 years ago.\n\nDid it or did not help those people?\n\nJust cause you don’t like it doesn’t mean it isn’t viable. That’s pretty much how marketing works.\n\nMost yoga studios are 90%+ women. As are most yoga instructors. Men aren’t making it up that most yoga is female-centric in the west.\n\nMen arent attending yoga classes because of their own perception of yoga as a gendered practice, not because they are not welcome. Yoga isn’t an evangelical practice where we need to change to reach out to fragile masculinity. My practice and my studio, practice yoga in a way that is true to yoga and not the gender of the majority. If men choose not to attend because they think it impacts their masculinity, that is not the problem of the practice. It’s the problem of men not wanting to practice something because they don’t want to. That’s fine, they’re allowed to not practice. No one thinks less of them for not practicing.\n\nI assume you feel the same about \"STEM for Women\" clubs and stuff like that?\n\nI think that appealing directly to underrepresented groups can be a noble pursuit.\n\nWell men aren’t losing opportunities or leaving yoga studios because of women harassing them or devaluing their contributions. So no, this is not the same as women in stem programs. Men aren’t being oppressed in studios, men aren’t refused opportunities to teach. Men arent doing yoga because they have placed a feminine value on it, and for some reason they cannot participate in feminine things. Men have the ability to acknowledge the reality that yoga is not a gendered practice, or they can choose to participate in feminine practices knowing that it does not impact them.  If you need some man to announce yoga is a workout and that there are yoga babes in yoga, then you’ve got your priorities fucked.\n\nAre you new here? There's like 10 posts per week from men who are interested in yoga but are intimidated or feel that they might be unwelcome. \n\nAnd there definitely are women who don't want men at their studio. To claim otherwise is just ignorance. \n\nReally don't see how this is such an issue for you..\n\nBeing intimidated by is not the same as being oppressed by. \n\nAnd yes I see those posts. Not one of them has a comment that says “you’re not allowed” unless the OP posts about trying to date in yoga classes. Just because a lot of women exist in the practice does not mean that men cannot practice.\n\nYeah. There are some women who want to practice with only women. But they are not the majority, nor are they typically the ones teaching.\n\nHow is this any different than the STEM for Women example from earlier? Like, I could literally rewrite your comment to be about computer programming and it would 100% check out.\n\nI’ve explained already. But I’ll add a few points. I think you’re falsely assuming that the reason women in STEM exists is because men exist in stem, and not because men make it hard for women to excel in STEM. Also, yoga is practice and not a career. So comparing the two is a false analogy.\n\nOk. What about these books?\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Gem-Women-NA/dp/9387997847/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Secret-Power-Yoga-Revised-Womans/dp/0593235568/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Womans-Book-Yoga-Health-Lifelong/dp/1570624704/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Womans-Book-Yoga-Embracing-Natural/dp/1583331379/\n\nWhat about them?\n\nLol nothing. You win.\n\nCheck out a free trial of Peloton and try Kirra’s power slow flow classes. Denis’s classes are also great.  If you’re in the US, feel free to dm me for a free 60 day trial. \n\nIs there a list of videos or are you streaming with an instructor?\n\nThere’s a huge catalog of videos. You can sort by time (10, 20, 30,45, 60 min) and my type (including power). For strength focused flows, I really like the instructors  Kirra Michel and Denis Morten, but there are 5 other instructors.  I really like Peloton yoga because I find the instructor quality to be very high and it’s very fast to use the filters to find a class that will fit my need.\n\nI've legit never heard of this before. I wonder if my library has this book.\n\nCheck out manflowyoga.com\n\nCheck out baptiste he has a lot on philosophy but also a progressive asana series.\n\nOh AND Sean Vigue. He has great books. He was actually the first yoga class I ever took by hitting play on YouTube. I still go back to him today because I love his energy!\n\nMy husband loves DDP Yoga.\n\nThis is completely irrelevant, but my ex taught at a summer camp and had a kid one year who, I shit you not, was named after this guy. Literally Diamond Dallas Paige (Lastname). Same kid blurted out how his mom drank through all of her pregnancies during an educational video. That’s a memory I can’t get rid of.\n\nq about the shirt - are the hands grabbing his *boobies*, or reaching out to grab ... well, probably still boobies?? :)\n\nIt’s his old wrestling symbol, The Diamond Cutter.\n\nI have done the ddp, feels goods\n\nLike it or not DDP and Joe Rogan did a lot to destigmatize men practicing yoga.\n\nI was not expecting to need to add a new yoga bin to my connection tonight but... looks like I do.\n\nThere’s one called power yoga we read for YTT. It’s 80s but good.\n\nHe's huge\n\nIf you have the Beachbody Fitness app, I highly recommend Yoga Fifty Two. It’s a really good and challenging set of yoga workouts (divided out by 3 levels). Definitely leaves you sweaty and sore and stronger overall. I do this on my off days from the hot yoga studio .\n\nI'm interested in this book!!!\n\nDespite the obvious sexism of this marketing, DDP's yoga program was a real ass-kicker. Not my style at all, but I can vouch for it being a good workout and knowing people who did it to get into shape. Even still, vinyasa is all the ass-kicking I need 😂\n\nDad bod? Come to yoga because hot chicks\n\nWow. I’m curious how much of this he actually wrote. If ghostwriters, I’d be open to peering in. In general, it looks like your typical 90s/00s workout self-help book with a former steroid-using self-proclaimed manly guru on the front page. \n\nAlso- the one other man here looks like someone who would buy this, rather than a participant (like the women).\n\nHe may not have written the literal words, but I guarantee he designed the program and whatever philosophy or advice in there is 100% his. DDP is no joke. He's an interesting dude. Became a professional wrestler in his mid thirties, which is an absurdly late move into wrestling. He's genuinely rehabbed and fully saved a couple wrestlers who were circling the drain, notably Jake the Snake Roberts, who wound up living with him to get himself clean. \n\nAnd as for steroid use, I'd like to see you do better in professional wrestling.  DDP wasn't a body guy per say, he never looked like he'd been inflated, but he was in his mid to late thirties starting out in a highly physical career. That's a hard thing to do in terms of recovery. \n\nAnd the other man probably is someone who bought it. DDP does a lot of promotion with his students. He likes showing \"real people\" using the programs. He demystifies yoga for people. It's genuinely helpful for a lot of people, mostly cis men, who would avoid yoga. Again, like Jake the Snake. The man is... I mean, he's alive, which was absolutely *not* likely to happen, thanks in large part to DDP.\n\nThanks for educating me! Clearly my bias was showing :)\n\nThis cover is the best thing I’ve ever seen 😂\n\nYoga babes are tops.\n\nI concur! 😎\n\nEdit….why is this book 49 dollar minimum plus shipping? Am I going to be blown away with transcendental yoga information so much it would break my brain? I can buy DMT for 10 bucks. Any books out there for guys who want to learn and practice yoga that won’t blow my monthly book budget?\n\nThe book is out of print, and I'm guessing whoever is asking $49 is just trying to gouge people."

    "body": "I literally broke down because I remember there was a time when I could not touch my toes. I was so self critical and ashamed of my body. I would bend down and couldn’t get my hands past my shins. I would’ve never even attempted any standing pose.\n\nToday in class I did a standing toe hold pose fully extended and didn’t budge. I cried. I cried for my past and the lies I believed about my body. I cried about how far I’ve come with my flexibility and the gift of yoga. They were tears of gratitude and self forgiveness. \n\nAfter doing yoga for year now I meditate and love and respect my body for its beauty. I can not only stand up straight and touch my toes I can put my nose to my knee while doing it!\n\nHas anyone ever had an emotional moment in yoga?",

    "all_comment_text": "Recently after savasana I rolled over on my side and for some reason just told myself \"I love you\" and kinda wrapped my arms around myself giving me a hug. I had just come out of a relationship where I was so wrapped up in the other person that I had begun to lose my identity. I discovered I had basically been doing this my entire life because I never learned how to truly love myself. I'm tearing up just thinking about it right now. It was a defining moment in changing my relationship with myself.\n\nHey, random yogi. I also love you! \n\nI love you too!\n\nI also got out of a bad relationship cycle before finding yoga. That was 9 years ago now, and looking back, I 100% have yoga to thank for helping me break that toxic cycle for good. \n\nKeep loving yourself, friend. There’s so much beauty on the other side of healing.\n\nI have cried in yoga.. so many .. times hahah :) for MANY reasons, release/grief/happiness/gratitude/forgiveness ... etc etc \n\n  \nI originally started yoga just to have that \"thing for myself with no distractions\" and stayed for those moments of realness\n\ni like to think that after some time you start to realize those moments of realness is that “thing for yourself with no distractions” that you were searching for. having an activity you can put all your focus into is important, but having an activity that forces you to put all your focus on yourself is the most important of all.\n\nbingooo! yesss!\n\nYes yes yes! This is why I love yoga so much, hip releases especially always make me sob like a baby. I'm so glad you worked through some emotions on the mat.\n\nomg this!! its so crazy how much emotion is built up in the hips right?\n\nBrother/ sister did yoga helped you in increasing your hip mobility?\n\nYes definitely, it helped strength too!\n\nOk brother\n\nOne time our instructor recognized that many of us probably come to an early class because it’s during a time when we’re not needed. Feeling seen in that moment made me tear up a bit. My house is still asleep when I go and it’s not work time yet. I love it, but it is hard to peel myself out of bed some mornings to go.\n\nThis thread is making me tear up. I’m a mess\n\nHell yeah. They're my favorite moments.\n\nI’ve had so many of those moments!!! It’s such a safe space when you get to feel your emotions and accept them ❣️\n\nDude so many  times for so many reasons, love it, it's my space for it, no better time to deal with sad thoughts than when you are showing to yourself how strong you can be\n\nHips are your body’s junk drawer.\n\nThis comment was supposed to go below in a hip sub-comment.  😮\n\nUnlike baseball, there is crying in yoga and its not a problem to be solved.  \n\nI am so happy for your breakthrough and joy in your practice.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dUiNrtj3zqo?si=k70DH5LerUdg3y2C\n\nThat's fantastic! Well done!\n\nAmazing story! I’ve just gotten back into a regular practice the last two months and can totally relate. I find myself way less competitive with others and feel genuinely grateful for my little wins as they come. I’ve also been far less critical of myself since getting back on the mat. There’s a genuine kindness toward myself and celebrating what my body is capable of on any given day.\n\nWe‘ve all been there\n\nI am usually holding back tears in a few classes 😢 Imagine if majority of the people in the class are trying not to cry. It’s probably more common than we think\n\nYour post REALLY resonated with me. I'm in my late thirties and didn't start doing yoga as a sustained and regular practice until Spring last year. \n\nWhen I was a kid, from about middleschool through high school, we had these standardized fitness tests in gym, maybe once a year, and one of the tests involved a seated forward bend where we had to put our feet against this wooden box that had this lip extending out over our legs with the measurement increments on it (hopefully I'm explaining that clearly). At no point when I had to do that test did I even hit the first mark; my hip and hamstring tightness was so bad that it didn't even meet the worst possible measurement they bothered to put on that box.\n\nI was never a heavy kid (looking back I realize that now), I grew up in the country, spent a decent amount of time outside; hiking and camping with the Boy Scouts, biking, regular kid stuff. But I was never flexible, never able to touch my toes straightlegged.\n\nThere was a day when I came home from yoga class, and I was just feeling good and warmed up from class and I was in my room and I kinda had that light bulb moment: I slowly reached down and held my breath and tapped the tips of my toes with my fingers.\n\nI realized at the time that at 38 I'd done something that I'd never been able to do before in my life. But it honestly didn't hit home until I read your post this morning. There are a lot of things that I don't remember all that well from my childhood, but I can tell you I remember how bad it felt every single time that box came out in gym class.\n\nI think that there are some things that we do for kids that are well intended, but can have a negative and long lasting effect on them. And it breaks my heart that sometimes these things make these kids hate their bodies or think that there's something wrong with them or that they're deficient in any way.\n\nI don't know how old you are or how long you'd been carrying those negative thoughts about yourself, but I'm so happy for you that you have been able to set them down and that yoga helped you get there and that you've seemingly replaced them with the love for yourself that we wish could have been there all along.\n\nThank you for your post and for letting me ramble and get in an unexpected but welcome cry myself this morning. Wishing you all the grace you need and deserve.\n\ni cant speak much about Yoga but in Meditation crying can be quite normal. somethimes it feels like letting go. even if you dont know what it is.\n\nthank you for making me almost tear up at work. i'm so happy for you. I understand the joy of appreciating your body just cause and even more when we feel its strength. overflowing love for sure. i hope to reach the flexibility you have achieved. namaste.\n\nYes I have. Mine was related to letting go / self forgiveness about my first marriage and subsequent divorce.\n\nFirst hubby and I used to go to yoga together.\n\nOne of the first classes I went to without him was .... an entirely new experience and I cried afterwards. I felt like I had found   myself in that classroom that day.\n\nBtw- your post brought tears to my eyes as I was reading. So happy for you on this journey.\n\nI had this feeling when I could finally do camel and bow poses! Also when I could touch my toes with my legs straight out in staff pose.\n\nCongratulations 🎉👏🎉 it's about the small wins  will get you to your goals. ❤️❤️❤️\n\nI cry in hip opening flows and yin.. and those are the 2 classes I avoid the most, yet they are the classes I need the most\n\nAll the time!  And it is grace for myself on the journey. Similar story, there’s been poses I have recently pulled off that bring me to tears.\n\nCried before, during, &amp; after more than I can count. It helps me move through it, in many ways. YOU GOT THIS!\n\nHey so did i! For different reasons but still, high five!\n\nI, M57, experienced this once in class after a hip opening exercise that felt like I was releasing serious tension/stress/energy.  I just cried for no apparent reason other than it felt good to feel that leave my body.\n\nYes. There’s something about stretching that brings up a lot of emotions. Congratulations on your amazing progress!!\n\nI have not but as an instructor, I have facilitated a few of those moments with students.\n\nI might sound corny but when I was in training it was the time I started to smile... Not just smile I did it whole heartedly! \n\nI have had anxiety and depression since I was a child and I rarely smiled or laughed in my teens years... Even my fellow ones were shocked to see this change!\n\nNow you can't catch me a single day without smiling 😌\n\nI have been dealing family issues the last couple of weeks and started doing yoga to cope better. All the stress went to my hips and there was moment in the middle of class that I wanted to cry. The daily stretching and movement has helped me get through this tough time and sleep better."

They're from primark! 😂\n\nlol you’re welcome and thanks as well!!\n\nNice :)\n\ncongrats!!! I love it hearing that omg at the end, been there when I finally pull off something new, and it feels so rewarding\n\nIt’s so inspiring, I might just have the courage to try it myself!!\n\nThis is so impressive!! Amazing work! I’m so happy for you 🥺🥺\n\nReally great work, going slowly with good control is one of our greatest allies in working difficult transitions\n\nThank u, I agree! Just like the sutra - Sthiram Sukham Asanam\n\nYesss girl that's awesome 👏🏽\n\nWow, your strength, control, and ease are impressive! I bet that landing felt incredible!\n\nHeck yeah congratulations!\n\nWhoa! Awesome control\n\nThis is amazing and inspiring, too! Congrats on the dropback! :)\n\nPerfection is overrated and with time it was become even more smoother but huge congratulations and milestone. That is amazing!!!\n\nIf you can straighten your legs, that would be perfect.\n\nThank you! Yes I will work that and on opening the chest and pushing up through the hips for hopefully (eventually) full wheel 😰\n\nYou need to move your chest forward and upward, opening up your chest. Doing this will make you happy every day.\n\nMust have felt good!\n\nI know the feeling when you get something done for the first time. Keep going. Namaste\n\nProud of you, will try to do the same way.\n\n🙏 Yes the little increments of changing the hands for stability helped my confidence! The last shift in center of gravity is scary a lil lol\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nYes!! The control!!\n\nThat is awesome, congratulations to you! I’m almost there, not quite, but you’ve given me an idea with the way you reached for your calves. That will help me gauge how far I am from the ground. My problem is trusting that I can safely let go and go down the rest of the way. So thank you!\n\nThank you! Yes I saw I break down online of hands to sacrum, back of thigh and then to calf for stability, you got this 🙏\n\nThe initial movement of bending backwards gave me anxiety, but you did it so gracefully. Congrats on this achievement!\n\nThis is so great, you have amazing control which is what it’s all about!\n\nBeautiful !\n\nlove this\n\nGood Job! I think what you need to really focus on is the legs, your legs need to be active, and your core ofc.\n I always lead the dropback with my head or chest (lead with your chest if you have neck pain) as if my head is part of my spine and focus on activating the legs + the whole front of the body, this will open up your upper body and will allow it to bend more easily! Hope this helps\n\nCongrats! It’s an awesome feeling, isn’t it? Your intermediate positions are interesting, I don’t know that I would have thought to take that approach, but it’s cool to see what worked for you. What helped me make the jump to a full drop back was coordinating my breathing (not holding my breath!), making sure my core was engaged, and lifting through my rib cage before dropping back (with my arms lifted). To some extent there was a big degree of just going for it and trusting I’d catch myself. I definitely worked on deepening my back bends during the rest of my practice (like during sun salutations) and strengthening my wheel as well. I did a bit of walking back down the wall before trying it too, but I’m honestly not sure that helped with anything except reassuring myself that I could bend that way. \n\nYay!!\n\nTo all Yogis, I'm overwhelmed! thank you for the well wishes and support 🫶 and for the recommendations I hope to post a progress update after I train and practice with all the points mentioned, what an uplifting community ✨\n\nYou are doing GREAT!!’\nKeep it up!!!"

Then I would start doing slow negatives (basically “reverse” the press by straddling your legs and lowering them as slowly as possible).

Really lean into it.\n\nI've been hesitant to ask, but at this point I gotta know... What on earth is a goblin ritual?\n\nMe too! OP pls tell\n\nMy wife and I both went to a class together as complete newbies. Afterwards the instructor told me I had a lot of potential (I think she was trying to be encouraging) but didn’t say a word to my wife. My wife took it personally and didnt try again for almost 10 years. lol\n\nlol my husband is ridiculously flexible, if we had started together this would have been my experience.

So glad he’s *that* husband😂 stay cute you two\n\nOkay but secretly the best part was on the way there I told him if he hated it he could leave and he was like “even if it’s not for me, I’m really excited to know more about this part of your life.” 🥹 he’s the absolute cutest.\n\nWithout a doubt, one of the most romantic things I have ever read on reddit. Goals.\n\n❤️\n\nGoals\n\nIt's a huge green flag 💚\n\nA family that Yogi's together stays together☺️\n\nI actually don’t mind that mine is not into yoga. \nI love going to the studio independently and having “my time”.\n\nYeah, I get that. I worry about his back, it’s the only reason I pushed a little.\n\nMine has back issues too and has gone to a few classes but it’s just not his thing. Which is fine. I don’t believe in pushing people to do things that aren’t for them.\n\nYeah, yoga isn’t going to resonate with everyone. If he wants to continue that’s great but I’m not going to force him.\n\nYeah I kind of see it like my friends who are into the CrossFit or other kinds of exercise programs. They’ve invited me but it’s really not my thing so I stick to yoga 😆.\n\nMy wife gets upset with me if I don’t go to a yoga class with her!\n\nAs a guy I really appreciate you trying to get another guy into yoga.  I hate when I'm the only male there.\n\nWhat is the goblin ritual? 👺👾🧘‍♀️\n\nOk, I saw the explanation above. I never knew about sprinkling water. Interesting.\n\nIf you like mat towels I highly recommend trying it. They are much grippier if you get them a little wet. It feels a lot more secure.\n\nDo you put the water on top of the towel once it's already laid down on mat? Or like in between the mat and towel once the grippy part of towel?\n\nI lay out the towel on my mat and then pour water into my hand and drip/sprinkle it, like I’m baptizing a baby, all very normal. Then use my hands to kinda smooth it out and spread it around. I just do the top and bottom and leave the middle dry. Basically where my hands and feet could potentially be during down dog. \n\nI used to mist it with a spray bottle, but who wants to bring a spray bottle to class?\n\nMy ritual:\n\nSet up my mat\n\nSet up my blocks, one on each side \n\n\nSet up my water bottle on the left side\n\n\nSet up my phone, pen and notebook on the right side \n\nMove the cat off my mat.\n\n\nNow I'm ready to do yoga!\n\nMove the cat off the mat - Repeat as needed 😸\n\nRemove my 4 dogs from the room!!!\n\nI love this\n\nI've been practicing yoga at home now for several years When my mother passed 9 years ago I weighed $276 lb \n\nI then started dieting and going to the gym more mostly working walking in the swimming pool 30 40 50 and eventually 60 laps and I dropped about 252 at that point \n\nThe next 20 laps I dropped them basically by doing yoga and doing them every single day extensively \n\nyoga has a lot of benefits to it \n\nIt literally brought my legs from the grave and my knees as well \n\nIf you have problem with constipation irregular bowel movements yoga straightened that out from me \n\nThe yoga can increase your health your breathing capabilities it's just it's just hundreds of benefits\n\n\"little goblin ritual\" this is so adorable. Thanks for sharing. I've been doing yoga at home now for a bit and I really wish my partner would feign a little interest but they don't.\n\n😅 man that is wholesome! Brightened may morning, thank you!\n\nPlease tell us your goblin ritual!\n\nAwww you two are cute 🥰\n\nThat is a super sweet reaction that he had.  Love it.\n\nGlad to hear he was open to it, more men need to be stretching, especially as we get older.\n\nLOL love a goblin ritual. Mine is roll out my mat, grab two blocks and place on either side. Consent card at the top right of my mat. Water bottle to the top left. Small towel placed right beside my water bottle.\n\nMy wife and I go to classes together.... We have a good time.  We usually hold hands or something during shavasana.  Our first handful of dates were yoga classes.\n\nWe've chatted with other yoga couples and become couple friends.  We go for a coffee as a foursome after class sometimes.\n\nIt's completely weird and super awesome at the same time.\n\nOh my god you hold hands during savasana??? I love it that is so cute.\n\nOk this is very cute.\n\nYour husband will soon have his own little goblin ritual.\n\nI love this, keep it up! I teach a lot of guys in my classes and I find that being a guy makes them more comfortable, so if there's a male instructor that you could go to maybe try that out. Otherwise just make sure that he's comfortable and hopefully this will become a habit you do as a couple!\n\nMy studio doesn’t actually have a male teacher currently, which is a bummer. But there are a couple other places we could try in the neighborhood if he wants to have a guy (my unlimited membership keeps me pretty loyal otherwise).\n\nThis is so cuteeeeeee\n\nI wasn’t allowed to take dance or gymnastics or anything when I was little, so yoga is as close as I’ll get, and I really like my little goblin ritual of setting everything up.\n\nI keep trying to get my partner to join me in my yoga class! I think it would be a great fit but they always pass. I am glad you made the connection and your person appreciated your goblin ritual!\n\nIf you have the ability to try a private class, I strongly encourage going that route. It is a lot less intimidating compared to diving straight into a class. But this presumes at least passing interest from your partner 😂\n\nYay!\n\nI always think bring your boyfriend to class day is the best day. While probably not the most yogic approach, I like seeing boyfriends come in cocky and leave appreciating their GFs practice a bit more. \n\nAlso, love the appreciation for the goblin ritual. I’ve often wondered if people notice mine. Haha. It’s cute to be noticed by your loved one.\n\nYoga is a great foundation for other exercise and martial arts\n\nIt’s also a really nice mindset to bring into other creative endeavors.  My piano playing is much better if I do 20 minute yoga warmup, and then keep focus on controlling breath, and non attachment.\n\nBreath control and awareness is what got me through COVID masks\n\n[deleted]\n\nOh no this kind of insecurity makes me sad. I hope he doesn’t instill this in you. Either way there’s some work to be done here.\n\nIt may not be the best idea for husband and wife in the same class.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMen and women are not the same and by forcing a man to take a class that’s mostly women may not have the best outcomes. Especially if the man is just starting out.\n\ncan you give an example of what you mean by \"may not have the best outcomes\". I'm very intrigued by your thoughts.\n\nRight...👀"

    "body": "I used to practice contortion many years ago. I love yoga and I love challenging classes. I’ve never had an issue with an instructor getting annoyed at me for trying a more challenging version of the pose after the instructor gives the option for more advanced students. Until yesterday.\n\nI tried this class for the first time, given, it was a beginner’s class. I don’t mind taking easier classes, there is always something to learn from the basics. But this instructor seemed to get really annoyed with the fact that I did take the advanced variation every single time. To the point that I was doing an extended side angle with one of my hands touching the floor and he said “when you are in my class, you don’t need to do that”. I went back and did the easy version. Please keep in mind that I only touched the floor after the mentioned that we could touch the floor if we are able to, he gave us that option. \n\nEven while I was in the final pose, just laying with my back on the floor, he physically adjusted my body. Did not ask for permission, I had my eyes closed and got startled by being touched. It felt really uncomfortable. He did not do that with any of the other students. \n\nIs this normal? ",

This is obvious but don't go back to that class\n\n...and probably tell the owner of the studio.\n\n\"ven while I was in the final pose, just laying with my back on the floor, he physically adjusted my body. Did not ask for permission, I had my eyes closed and got startled by being touched. It felt really uncomfortable. He did not do that with any of the other students. \"\n\n\nThis is absolutely worth making a formal complaint for. OP says he didn't do that to anyone else but how do they know that? Especially on other days?\n\nWorth complaining about. At my studio, you can get fired for adjusting someone without consent.\n\nAs a male teacher he should know better.  Yoga is a sacred space, you don't put your hands on someone else's temple unless they have invited you in, and lots of women have dealt with so much unwanted touch\n\nHe sounds awful.\n\nLeave a review for studio - \"if anyone is actually sincere about improving their yoga, don't go here, they will shame you for your progress\"\n\nWhen you said you were doing advanced variations every time, I wondered how extreme we were talking -- like if you were you doing press-up handstands as part of your sun salutations or peppering in creative arm balances. I do think that would be overkill in a basics or beginners class.\n\nBut as far as I'm aware touching one's hand to the floor during side angle isn't even advanced so much as a very normal progression. It's even odder that he corrected you when he himself offered the variation. That teacher is being weird and the unrequested assist is not okay.\n\nNo. I only took the variation after the instructor gave the option, and I did exactly what he proposed. Yes, I did not go into full bind or anything like that.\n\nThat’s extra weird, cause I do beginner classes all the time and sometimes I do normal/easy side angle, but others I like to do a full bind even if it isn’t specifically stated as an option, and I’ve never had anyone get upset by it.\n\nYeah, I just do what feels right on that day. I throw in extra challenges when I need them, and regress when my body is telling me to chill. It's your practice and you've paid to be there.\n\nThis! I do what i need for me in that moment!\n\nSame, I am hypermobile &amp; she kept reiterating that yoga is not about flexibility. Never mind that I’ve been practicing for years &amp; did not learn handstand, bird of paradise, etc overnight. Disregarding the fact that other factors like balance, strength and even consistency were also factors that you instilled in your practice. It’s so disheartening to have someone who’s supposed to guide you embarrass you &amp; disregard your hardwork just because they don’t like you or formed an impression about you that’s untrue to begin with.\n\nDid you go to a beginners class and do all those things?\n\nWhy does it matter.  I've never heard of a practice ceiling in a class.\n\nThis .. isn't yoga supposed to be about focusing on yourself, not comparing yourself to other people? And what happens when the \"beginners\" in that class start to improve? I guess they should just leave and never go back to that studio, lmao\n\nNot a beginners class\n\nEven if you did the full bind, why does it matter?!\n\nYeah the teacher was being a straight-up weirdo.\n\nEven if you did - instructors are a guide and a suggestion, you should always feel comfortable and welcome to take the variation that works for you and your body. No matter what the instructor guides.\n\nNah i go for basics class and it’s okay to do full bind anyway. Like just tell the class that some people may have more experience in yoga or may have “transferrable” experience eg in gymnastics or dance\n\nYa know what though. It doesn’t bother me when people do that even if it is a beginner class. I know that people have schedules and work and life and sometimes the beginner class is the only time that works for them but they really need some yoga. \n\nThere shouldn’t be judgement in yoga and if it’s coming from a teacher that’s an issue. I had something similar happen, I was in a regular class , not beginner, but I have a ligament condition that makes me super flexible. I wrapped all the way up for eagle pose and the instructor came over and tried to physically unwind me, I fell and got hurt because I was resisting the woman physically assaulting me during a yoga pose. She tried to say “see class that’s why we don’t do that” and I shot back by picking up my mat and saying “no, this is why you don’t forcibly touch people while they are in yoga poses. Let’s go talk to your manager.” Class was over but I bet she never did that again…\n\nWow that is bizarre. What an awful, controlling instructor you had to deal with! Good for you for saying something.\n\nIt was weird but people are weird! And honestly  don’t think she was awful lol, just didn’t have a lot of experience. Sounds kinda like yours ;)\n\nYeah you’re right. I wouldn’t be mad or anything. I would certainly be curious but it’s not that yogi’s job to sate my curiosity. I suppose it’s possible that that the hypothetical yogi is attending beginners classes to feel a god-like sense of their yoga powers but even if that were true like…whatever. I can’t imagine such things happen commonly anyway.\n\nSo infuriating about your teacher experience! Even when I was brand new to yoga I was able to do some advanced looking poses because of my innate, bizarre hip flexibility. But just because I could do a forward folded firelog pose, it didn’t make me a non-beginner. It just made me a beginner with a lot of flexibility. I still belonged in beginners classes!\n\nPerfect statement.\n\nalmost every class I've ever taken the teacher will say words to the effect, \"this is your practice\"  OP practice is advanced.  who cares?\n\nBut who cares if someone is doing handstands in sun sal or adding arm balances? I can't do those things but I think it's awesome when people can. It takes nothing from my practice.\n\nExactly. I would love to see someone more advanced practicing next to me because they would be demonstrating the progression in real time. I would just assume that they found the time slot or teacher to fit their needs or missed their usual more difficult class. I would think the same thing if I were advanced and a relative newbie was next to me doing the best they could. Sometimes you have to make it work and I would commend their courage as long as they were being cautious and not disruptive.\n\ntheres a guy at my studio that comes to an all levels flow that will hold his handstands for minutes while everyone else is following the flow of the instructor. it’s a little odd but i dont let it disrupt my practice. i’ll just think to myself “woah thats impressive” then i continue with the flow\n\nI agree with you. I won’t lie, I would wonder why they’re at a beginners class but maybe they’re there because it’s the time that fits their schedule or something. I doubt this happens so commonly in beginners classes that it’s a real issue.\n\nI think people just tend to notice and get bothered because it can be intimidating if you haven't learned to mind your own mat\n\nIm not yoga instructor but in dance we always say not to compare bcz ppl come from very different backgrounds. That’s the teacher/instructor/choreog job to emphasise that\n\nThat's a terrible reason imo to tell somebody to dial it back. It's a good lesson for the beginners that everybodies practice is different and also to what may be possible.\n\nYeah if you read the thread you will see that I agree with you. But go off\n\nI wasn't saying you thought that, I didn't take that away.  Was just replying to the concept.  I'm not sure I \"went off\" either\n\nAs long as what is being done is safe . Do what you want of course , but part of your yoga practice is to be somewhat considerate of the space you are in. If you feel doing a bunch of inversions while others are in a triangle pose may cause distraction and thus safety issues for others or completely hindering their practice , there’s a time and a place for everything . But putting your hand on the floor in a side angel and getting called out is ridiculous. Doing a lunge , do a triangle do a warrior one , I don’t care , just be safe .\n\nIf anything it’s a non-shaming motivation\n\nAs a hypermobile yogi myself, I wonder a bit if he was observing OP hyperextending in a way that made him nervous, but since it was a beginner class he didn’t feel able to address the issue more in depth. That’s the only reason I can think of that a teacher might say it was ok to touch the floor but then immediately walk it back when a student did so. Dealing with hypermobile yoga students can be a bit more complex, especially if you don’t know them well enough to trust that they know how to modify and deepen poses safely. Or even someone who isn’t hypermobile, but who has more flexibility than strength. And there are a lot of ways that a student can “deepen” a pose and lose the integrity of it— just thinking of something I’ve personally done “wrong” in extended side angle over the years, I’ve dumped into my groin, overextended my top hand so that it went past vertical, collapsed my spine so it wasn’t a strong line, dumped into the hand on the ground. In more advanced classes (and, honestly, probably all the way up into teacher training), the teacher has taken the time to work through all of the cues to correct my form to be stronger and more aligned, and to visualize how to move my body safely into and out of different poses. But in a beginners class, that might (or might not, depending on the teacher) be deeper than they want to go, so I could understand them trying to get students to back up into a less deep version of the pose rather than a deeper-but-misaligned version. Or it could be a stylistic thing— there are real differences between how contortionists and yogis are taught to move their bodies and what each thinks is safe. If he doesn’t know that OP is a practiced contortionist and sees them doing something that’s considered unsafe in the context of a yoga class, that could have the same impact.   \n\nOf course, that’s just a guess— it’s possible that OP was doing the pose perfectly, and he stopped her for one of the other reasons people mentioned above.\n\nETA: even if OP, a trained contortionist, could do a potentially nonstandard variation safely, the teacher might have worried that it would model something that would be unsafe for the beginners in the class to attempt. \n\nBut the unprompted adjustment during savasana sucks either way.\n\nThis.\n\nAs a hypermobile teacher (diagnosed hEDS) who has raked up injuries on their body over 20 years of yoga not knowing what was going on was as dangerous as it was, I see a lot of folks who come to yoga because they’re good at it, because they’re hypermobile. And my aging body and experience talking with other, older hypermobile yogis, sees the higher odds of CAM FAI, labral tears, CCI, and more. And these things can be both very painful and, frankly, dangerous. (The rate of hip replacement in “I've always been flexible” yoga teachers is high.)\n\nIt is hard to have that background knowledge and help students stay safe.\n\nThis sounds like it was done very poorly, without respecting you, OP, and I’m sorry you had to experience that. I did not deserve to have that experience, and the teacher should have checked himself far before it got to anything you would notice.\n\nAgree with both. I am also a hyper-mobile yoga instructor, and have had to learn to balance flexibility with strength (due to sprains, labral tear, etc). However when I see hyper mobile students I don’t tell them not to move deep into poses, but to engage muscles to protect their joints etc. Usually this means they end of going less deep, but the instruction isn’t phrased as policing - I avoid telling people no, but suggest how they can add things (like engagement) to make postures more safe… I also talk a lot about longevity and finding balance in the body/mind by recognizing imbalance and instituting ways to address it (encouraging more strength work for the flexible is part of this). Anyway! Sounds like this teacher might have had good intentions but had no idea how to phrase/express (and not versed in consent language either). I think way more attention needs to be placed on phrasing and consent in yoga trainings. \n\nThe consent issues are kinda beyond the pall, imo.  We should all know better by now.\n\nYes, I have been lucky to have teachers who did this, and when I was teaching I tried really hard to do it myself. It was transformative when my primary teacher started emphasizing engagement and activation cues instead of alignment cues. So good for hypermobile yogis!  It’s definitely the gold standard, and your students are lucky you do that for them. But I’m not sure every teacher has the experience/training to be able to do it off the cuff in a beginner class.\n\nFAI and hip labrum tear hypermoble yogi here. Your comment is enlightening. I likely got my initial labrum tear during an unrelated surgery but then dislocated my hip during a transition to bound extended side angle four months later. I just returned to classes and have been worried about reinjury - not surprised to hear that hip replacement occurrences are high. I am now in line for one eventually (like a decade or whatever) but will probably end up with arthroscopic surgery in 2-3 months. I wasn’t sure how careful to be but now instructor selection will definitely be part of my calculations on when and what to do during my recovery.\n\nWork with your PTs to specifically address how you’re going to modify your practice to include this.\n\nIt’s unfortunately fairly complicated - I have ortho PT and neuromuscular rehabilitation PT for my pelvic floor and often the poses that are great for one are terrible for the other (ex. Pigeon is great for relaxing the pelvic floor but rotates the femur into poor positioning for the location of my tear). Plus neither of my specialists are advanced in yoga. I did just find that one of my favorite instructors and studio managers has a labrum tear as well and I will likely hire them for some private sessions to help support a safe program. But yes thank you, that’s definitely on my radar.\n\nOkay, so- I’ve been practicing for years. Hypermobile, and I have a hip impingement and labrum tear. I have surgery upcoming to fix it. \n\nWhat would you recommend so I don’t injure myself further (or again, after the surgery)? Building strength through yoga? Or something else. I am dying to get back to yoga.\n\nI’m not sure about after the surgery. My ortho doesn’t like to do CAM surgery on hypermobile folks because compromising the hip capsule always increases instability and has led to poor outcomes for him.\n\nBut I’ve done a bunch of PT (and I keep doing it; it’s a forever thing). A combination of strengthening, but also improving strength near end range of motion, and increasing Proprioception in all parts of ROM, and learning how to make sure I’ve got the neuromuscular control where I need it, even after I’ve subluxed or aggravated something, is important.\n\nIn practice in my yoga classes, this means two primary things - I avoid almost entirely positions that compromise my joints based on bony anatomy. Sukhasana (and all other heavily externally rotated and flexed hip positions) are more or less out, excepting significant propping so gravity can’t pull me farther. Because my impingement is just going to hit my labrum, maybe causing more damage depending on the load (no more pigeon), and push my SI joint out of place enough to make my glute med spasm and keep my hip a bit subluxed.\n\nI don’t like that part, but I’ve learned (through pain from trial and error) that it’s necessary.\n\nAlso, I’ve learned to shift my yoga from being about finding a nice big stretch, to finding strength at end ROM. Possibly even adding load or perturbation to emphasize stability over depth of stretch.  Honestly, I find it fun!\n\nThank you so much for your valuable advice!! I really appreciate this so much. I’m going to talk to my PT about this!\n\nDo you know Ariele Foster? She’s a physical therapist who’s also a yoga teacher. And she’s also hypermobile. She does [movement analysis and in-person and virtual physical therapy](https://wellilo.com), and she’s one of the few people I’d trust to give this kind of advice for someone with an existing injury (especially online), because it’s her exact scope of practice. I did her Yoga Anatomy Academy right after YTT, and she’s great.\n\nNo, I didn’t know about her!!!! I cannot thank you enough I’m totally going to book a session with her when I save up!!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!! This is EXTREMELY HELPFUL!!\n\nTeacher here. I think the comment about other students copying OP are right on. In my experience most students, especially beginners, get the great majority their cues to form from watching others—whether it be the instructor or other students. Most people are simply better at translating visual rather than verbal information into what to do in their bodies. People also are often intrigued or challenged by what they see others doing. In beginner classes with advanced students it is VERY common to see beginners trying to mimic the more experienced students even if you don’t cue them to. Especially if the teacher is not themselves demonstrating. It leads to a major teaching challenge of trying to get students to disregard that visual input and focus solely on the teachers’ cues and their own body’s sensations. It can be hard to do that without seeming to criticize someone! The wording you use has to be very purposeful and it’s easy to get it wrong.\n\nI couldn’t have said this better!\n\n&gt;“when you are in my class, you don’t need to do that”.\n\nIf we're trying to give the benefit of the doubt, this might have been meant for others in the class who might feel pressured to try the advanced pose.\n\n&gt;Even while I was in the final pose, just laying with my back on the floor, he physically adjusted my body\n\nThat's not okay - it might still be the culture in his class and not directed at you. Some places have a consent card that you can put up by your station. For this particular case, you can provide feedback and let the instructor and/or the studio know in a nice way that you would like to be asked before being adjusted.\n\nAt the end of the day, if the instructor didn't work well for you, just change classes. This isn't something you paid for in advance so you're not bound here. It can be handled by either telling them directly or finding a new class.\n\nI’ve been in classes where they adjust you in savasana but (1) it was very clearly the culture of the class and it was flagged that it would be very hands on and (2) IT WASNT ONLY ONE PERSON GETTING ADJUSTED! I hate that for you :/  totally weird and inappropriate\n\nI also practiced contortion when I was younger and am hypermobile. I understand your POV very well, as the challenge for most people to deepen a pose is the mobility component, but for us noodle folk, it's really easy. The challenge for us is to work in strength and stability, which actually means doing less and working on the muscular holds (something I didn't understand until later in my practice).\n\nAnyway, an instructor that makes little jabs like that probably (wrongly) assumes you're trying to show off. The fact that it's a beginner class shouldn't matter. I would let the owner know that the instructor made you feel uncomfortable and would choose a different class next time. Might even be worth introducing yourself before class and mentioning your hypermobility. A great instructor knows how to \"challenge\" us - stretching deeper is harder for most people but not for us.\n\nThank you. I am going to try to do that.\n\nThe next time you do extended side angle, extend both arms over your head instead of touching the floor, that will help show you how add strength to the pose.\n\nThis happened to me in a stretching class! The instructor was weirdly suspicious after class was over. She had a million questions and she wasn’t asking anything with kindness. I never went back. I was a gymnast and still doing open gyms then.\n\nTouching me with my eyes closed in what is supposed to be a posture of deep rest is a giant fuck no from me. That's creepy and unacceptable.\n\nThe teacher sounds like he has control issues and was gate keeping his class a bit. I will say this for whatever it’s worth. I’ve practiced for over 30 years and have been a big proponent of going to beginners classes about 4 weeks out of the year to address fundamentals and correct bad habits.  So for me, when I go to a beginner class as an advanced student I go with a beginners mind and match the energy of the room. I also take a position in the back of the class in case I want to go off book to accommodate known Injuries or maybe go a little deeper in certain poses. This way I feel im being respectful and not distracting/confusing the beginners who may be distracted by me bc I’m in front of them. \n\nI’m not saying you did or didn’t do that, I’m just saying it can be a sensitive issue when advanced students come to a beginners class. Put that together with a controlling teacher and you may get a snarky comment like the one he made. \n\nUnder no circumstances, however, is it appropriate for any teacher to touch you without asking permission first. What he did was over the line and you should make that complaint to the owner of the studio. It’s valid and he needs to know that it’s not acceptable.\n\nI am not okay with being touched by a stranger without consent, and this experience alone would cause me to never visit this class again. I can’t speak for the other experience(s) you had with this instructor, but I’m sorry you’re going through this. That is very uncomfortable for sure.\n\nEspecially with eyes closed during shavasana. That would scare the crap out of me.\n\nYes, same! Makes me feel a bit anxious just thinking about it. Closing your eyes around strangers is intimate enough. To be intentionally touched/handled during this would be so unsettling.\n\nI always do the variations due to hypermobility and strong foundation, but sometimes I take beginners classes because my iron levels are low again and I can’t handle higher intensity flows. I feel nothing in the regular variations because I am so flexible. I’ve never once been told I wasn’t welcome in a class. This sounds like the teacher is jealous.\n\nA similar thing happened to me. After a few years of vinyasa I went with my wife to a calmer, more meditation oriented class. The instructor got angry that I went beyond her instructions, accusing me of being a showoff even after I explained my prior work and that her poses weren't doing anything for me. Funny thing is that it was just the three of us that day and my wife knew I was already more flexible than that.\n\nI never went back.\n\nIt’s crazy that yoga instructors are assuming students like you are showing off. They’re projecting their own ego\n\nExactly right.\n\n&gt; it was a beginner’s class\n\nIn a beginner's class you can challenge yourself by giving extra attention to alignment, increased engagement, and ujjayi breath. This will advance your practice in a different, maybe even deeper, way.\n\n&gt; \"when you are in my class, you don’t need to do that\"\n\nThis phrasing comes off really weird, but I wanted to offer a benefit of the doubt explanation. The variation you were doing is what they teach in Ashtanga. Some teachers dislike Ashtanga's alignments, and want to offer more accessible variations. The hand on the floor in extended side angle can unnecessarily compress the side body, and sometimes people lose engagement in their legs and their hips and thighs fall out of midline.\n\n&gt; he physically adjusted my body. Did not ask for permission\n\n🚩🙅\n\nSome people have good intentions and they still can offend. I’m a yoga teacher and the only thing I could think of is you might be too advanced for a beginner class and beginners watch other yogis for guidance. You might have been unintentionally influencing other beginners to go deeper than is recommended. I first learned by practicing with a 12 year expert and before I knew what was best for me I was pushing it improperly and potentially injuring myself. Yes they have free will but if I was a true first timer or practicing next to you I’d be struggling. For the record this isn’t your fault just get back to that mat!\n\nEw I don’t like this yoga teacher at all what a horrible energy to bring to class\n\nNot normal.\n\nWould also potentially consider discussing with studio owners.\n\nAssuming your background in contortion meant you were safely accessing the advanced variations and not forcing yourself into them in an unstable/haphazard way.\n\nYou mentioned extended side-angle and, in terms of the types of things that show up in classes, that's really not that \"advanced\" physically that it would be reasonable to the teacher to object. Something like a really deep full bridge, front split, handstand etc I might sympathise with them - or if you'd at least gone into a really deep bind or something - but this seems petty on his behalf.\n\nIt's not normal, but here's something to consider.\n\nDoing the advanced poses all the time, like ALL the time, isn't good for you. When practicing the advanced too much, we lose the fundamentals in the basics. In a beginner's class, you should be doing beginner's poses. It's not restricting yourself, it's a mental challenge for you to control your impulses, and is an opportunity to slow down.\n\nIf you're doing advanced poses in the basic class, then the basic class isn't right for you. I think your teacher is right, when you're in THIS class, you don't need to do that. I guess the \"my\" refers to the fact that his class currently is a beginner class.\n\n\n\nAs for the touching, I'm not sure.  \nDoes he do this normally? Is it... yk... what we're thinking, or did you really piss him off? Either way, it's uncalled for, but if it's the latter, I think my point above can explain why.\n\nAlso your phrasing is weird. \"He physically touched my body\". How? I know in my yoga class my teacher might brace us or push us down in the child pose to keep our back straight. Or there are some weirdos who knows what. I don't know if it's on purpose, but you have to understand what you're insinuating.\n\n**Though again, some people just don't like being touched or adjusted without warning, and that's ok.** So if you feel this way, probably just ask, or switch classes\n\nthe touching without permission is not normal and not ok! my instructors always start the class with asking for consent to touch….\n\nIf it’s bugging you, maybe check in with the teacher before class if you have them again. Like ‘hey, the other day during class you cautioned me against touching the ground during extended side angle, could you tell me what your concern is?’. They may be seeing something that you can’t, or they might be full of it, but at least you can put it to rest.\n\nWhile it doesn't sound like he was very nice, as someone who does beginner's classes because I'm easily intimidated by advanced moves I think I'd feel a little annoyed at someone coming to a beginners class and doing much more advanced versions of everything. I'd wonder why you didn't just do an advanced class.\n\nTouching your hand to the floor during side lunge is not an advanced move. It's like touching your hands to the floor in a forward fold -- justifiably difficult for some people, but well within the bounds of a fundamental, basic pose. I would agree with you if OP were doing handstands and arm balances willy-nilly but touching your hand to the floor during this pose isn't unusual.\n\nIt is normal to be intimidated by other students but my take is that as long as they're not going really far outside the scope of the class and freestyling totally different moves than anyone else, they're not doing anything wrong. They're not responsible for any insecurity I might feel.\n\nNo, but she said she did advanced variations of every pose. I'm guessing that was the final straw.\n\nBeginners class shouldn't offer zero options for further complexity in poses. Some students can easily touch the floor in forward fold because that's just how their hamstrings are. They're not showing off or doing something wrong just because another student might not be able to reach beyond their knees.\n\nA beginners teacher needs to provide multiple skill level options. The range for those skill options will of course be smaller than in all levels classes, with a lower ceiling for complexity. Touching the floor in a side lunge is well within the bounds of an advanced option for a beginners class.\n\nI would be very confused by a teacher who offered advanced options but had an unspoken limit to how many each student should take and got frustrated when students didn't somehow intuit that limit.\n\nI believe op said that she generally takes the advanced options  *that the instructors offer*.\n\nI find that most studios just consider \"advanced\" to mean \"faster\".  If I want longer holds, and yes, time to go into more advanced variations, I'm better served by the pace of a beginner class.\n\nOh, well that's not my experience, there are various styles of yoga available, at different paces. It's hard to find beginner's classes a lot of the time and a real luxury for those of us who otherwise spend half the class in child pose because we can't manage the poses.\n\n??? So you're complaining about people doing advanced poses when you're spending the whole class doing your own thing too?  See the hypocrisy?\n\nThat really sucks, and in my opinion, all intermediate classes should be taught as “bus stop” classes— start with a very accessible variation of a pose, and then show different ways to work within it to explore different facets. Sometimes this could get collapsed down into “easy” vs “advanced” variations, but that’s rarely accurate. So for example, for extended side angle, the class could explore what it feels like to move the back foot further back to make the front thigh more parallel to the ground and work on strength, or press the back knife edge of the foot down and their top arm to the corner of the ceiling/wall to work on extension, or have people check their alignment against their intuition— are they as straight as it “feels”? They could press their bottom elbow against the side of their knee and feel the rotation, and see if they can rotate so their top shoulder is opened but not over-rotated. They could try reaching their bottom hand towards the ground and see how far they go until their spine starts to collapse, and begin to build the body awareness of what a “straight” spine feels like. All of these are really interesting and valuable variations that somebody at any level of yoga could play with and gain skill and body awareness from, as long as you remove “fullest extent of the pose” as a goal. I really enjoy classes like that, and I hope that sometime you have the opportunity to take some as well, to remove some of the frustration of inaccessible poses from a class. \n\nWhen I was in teacher training, we were taught to start from very, very accessible versions of poses, or rather, “siblings” of poses, and step people up all the way from, say, cat/cow to camel to king pigeon. This way, the student stops at the “right” place for them, and explores into that variation, and others can explore different stops along the way.\n\nThank for your lovely explanation. I have indeed had some wonderful teachers who were good at this. But it's still nice to go to a class where everyone is kind of around your level. Because even if you gradually make poses more difficult, for the person stopping at the first variation that's still a lot of time not quite following the class. I also sometimes can't keep the pose for the whole time the rest of the group is moving on and then have to stop and rest. And some teachers don't explain modifications well at all. I have done yoga before I'm just very out of shape, so I can normally work out what to do but if I had no experience I'd probably end up just stopping when I can't do something.\n\nOh, yeah, absolutely, I've never seen someone try to get a class from cat/cow to king pigeon in a beginner class 😉. But in a beginner class, I do think it would probably be appropriate for a teacher to talk about different ways of approaching something like side angle. One thing I like about that way of teaching a class is that a teacher can say \"if you're working on strength today, try moving your back foot back a few inches to see how it feels when your thigh is more parallel to the ground. If you're working on flexibility, try lifting up and then over with your top arm and feel the length from your fingertips to the back edge of your foot. If you're working on stability, play around with closing your eyes for a few seconds and see how your balance gets challenged when you can't see.\" I'm often less strong than others in a class, and I appreciate the opportunity to lean into my strength (or, um, flexibility as the case may be) or to challenge my weakness (always balance) while being in almost exactly the same pose as everyone else.\n\nI'm also torn on this. I'm currently taking a baby-beginner class in an artform (not yoga) that I am both a decades-experienced teacher and performer in. The teacher is lovely, teaches exactly the way I believe it should be taught, and they're close by. She doesn't have full advanced classes yet.   \nThe teacher knows my backstory, to respect HER and her class, not pluck my ego. She also knows I'm happy to play in the \"baby pool\" at \"baby\" level right now, I'm getting back on my feet as a dancer after a long gap and \"baby\" is exactly what I need to build through again. It is, still, obvious I have more experience, but I'm very diligently keeping mouth closed and doing ONLY what we're doing in class the way we're asked to do it. No unsolicited opinions, no big talk, no busting fancy stuff and varients. It's not the time or place. \\*I\\* would be the disrespectful one doing otherwise. I am (hopefully humbly) asking beginners for a place in their circle I don't fit, but need. Not showing off what I can do to make others feel small. That's important, when you step out of \"level\" like this.  \nThat said, doesn't sound like OP was \"busting fancy stuff\", so in this case, it's probably just a sh!tty teacher feeling threatened themselves. But in general, if you take your advanced a$$ to the beginner class, you put on your beginner hat and match the space, or you leave it be. It takes a lot for folks to start new things, and they don't need even an accidental ego prick from someone who, truly, is where they themselves will be in a bit if they find the courage to keep on.\n\nThank you for your perspective and sensitivity. I also think it's important for people to understand that while in theory yoga shouldn't be about competition or being better or insecurities, most people at a beginner's class probably aren't at the stage of really understanding that. It may be their first experience with yoga so they go to what they think will be a class full of others like them.  \n\n\nAlso, the times I've seen beginner classes they were not the same as slow or gentle yoga, the studios also offered yin yoga or relaxing yoga or whatever. Because you can go slow but doing more advanced poses.\n\nExactly. Thank you for your perspective. I wasn’t trying to be obnoxious, show off or anything like that. I do have a past in other activities too, so my body responds way differently than most people due to my background. I can’t change that. This is why in a beginner class I do everything exactly as it was cued. I am not a yoga pro, but I tend to be able to execute certain poses with less difficulty than most. If they offered the option to make it more intense, yes I would take that option. I felt extremely self conscious by the manner in which the instructor seemed to take issue with this. Like I was disrupting the class for trying the more difficult variation that he proposed. It made me want to walk out of class.\n\nYeah, I think most good teachers would have handled this quite differently if it was a genuine case of \"Bro/Sis/Person, tone it down a bit, yeah? You're frightening the herd\". I suspect the root of this may be an insecure instructor. And the un-asked touching is a No No no matter who it is doing it. Again speaks maybe to someone who needs to \"be teacher\" no matter what, not simply guide.\n\nBrains ...well, brain. But I'd let this one roll off you as much as you can. But the touching might be worth mentioning to the  studio owners, honestly. That's going to lose tons more newbies than even the most show-offy show-off ever could.\n\nOne thing that comes to mind reading this response, OP, Is that the teacher may not have been speaking to you, but rather to other students following your lead who should not have been. I have had to use similar words in class (though I hope I was on point with none of that tone, because I didn’t feel it) when I have had new folks, or folks working with certain injuries, who just mirror what the person next to them, or across the room, does rather than listening to the instructions.\n\nThis can put the other people in an unsafe physician, even though you are being perfectly safe in your own body. It doesn’t mean you should change anything, as it’s up to the other student to be keeping themselves safe, but sometimes people straight up just don’t listen to what the teachers actually saying. \n\nGiven that this teacher also adjusted you and Shaunna with no warning, I’m not sure they deserve this benefit of the doubt, but that’s a thing that can happen.\n\nThis is a double edge sword. \n\nI teach dance and I find it frustrating when advanced students join beginner classes. At best, it can be distracting, and at worst, discouraging for the beginners. However, I firmly believe everyone can benefit from revisiting the basics.\n\nI don’t think OP did anything wrong by attending a beginner class and following the instructor’s progressions. But if they were creating their own sequences, I’d give some side eye.\n\nWhen this happens, I try to turn it into a teaching moment by acknowledging the advanced student, saying, “Hey, they’ve been training for [x] years and started in the exact same place as you all” This helps the beginners recognize the advanced student’s experience and shifts their focus toward setting goals rather than comparing themselves. \n\nThere’s also a safety concern. Beginners are at a higher risk of injury, and as an instructor, my priority is to focus on them since it’s a beginner class. If OP attempted moves they weren’t ready for and got injured, the responsibility could fall on the instructor. I’m not sure how it works in yoga, but that’s how it works in my dance classes.\n\nbut advanced practitioners like to go to beginner classes to have a slower paced class on foundations from time to time tho. it’s not the point to pay attention to what anyone else is doing. advanced yogis need a chill class from time to time too.\n\nWhy are you paying attention to anyone's practice but your own?\n\nBecause I'm human? If it's a beginner's class, we haven't all mastered the art of being perfect yogis with no insecurities. And honestly, having read some of the comments in this discussion by people who clearly feel superior to others I'm kind of put off yoga. Suggestions that teachers are threatened and jealous by students who are so amazing at yoga and that anyone feeling intimidated only has themselves to blame for being insecure. I don't know, I'm not feeling much kindness or understanding.\n\nI think that focusing on your own practice is a skill that can be developed by yogis at all stages of practice. Yoga is really about connecting with your own body and breath. People aren't advanced just because of the difficulty level of the asanas they move through, that's not a measure of skill at all really. Inhabiting a yogic mental state is really indicative of your progress in the practice. It will also help with your feelings of frustration when you realize that your practice is the only thing that matters for you.\n\nYes, but it has to be developed. In a beginner's class people won't have had the chance to develop that. If you don't know what downward dog is you have to look around and can't just flow and breathe. So if someone is doing something very different it is distracting. \n\nI feel like you're making a lot of excuses to justify your annoyance at someone who is just doing their own thing.\n\nNo and F that guy. I had someone that used to go to the same class as me that was much like you. I was always so impressed by her ability and found it inspiring.\n\nI feel the same way. There are always going to be people who are better than you. I don’t compare myself and focus on doing my own thing as best as I can. If I glance at someone doing a more advanced variation, I think to myself “I might get there someday”.\n\nI’m a male doing my 200hr YTT right now I have to say this creeps me out and I’m really nervous to even implement physical adjustments when I start teaching. If I were you I wouldn’t go back. That is Not ok. Self preservation.\n\nYoga teachers need to work on their own ego too ... Why would he give everyone the option if he doesnt want you to do it?\n\nThe key is to work to your own level and to where your body is on a given day. The poses themselves or level of advancement doesn't matter so much - rather the experience of moving from one to another and noticing yourself throughout.\n\nSo basically, no I don't think it's normal!\n\nHi. Your instructor was out of order. He's an instructor and not a commander. However unless you told him he has no way of knowing you have a high level of flexibility through previous practice. So faras he is concerned you area newbie in a beginners class. He did not observe good practice and courtesy to ask y'all if you had done any yoga before.\n\nTouching without consent especially when are unable to see the approach is unaccepable. In that situation I would speak with him in private and tell him he frightened the living day lights out of you with that correction. He did not have your permission for personal contact. Please be sure to ask next time.\n\nNamaste\n\nI'd like to share my perspective as a newer male teacher. \n\nFirst, adjusting without consent, no matter the gender of the teacher or student is not a great idea, and as others have said, you should mention that to someone in the studio leadership.\n\nAs far as the advanced variations, if I were leading a beginners class, I would be concerned about that students safety thinking maybe they are hypermobile and that they're putting themselves at risk without the proper strength and practice history.  Especially if I've never had the student in class before, or had time to chat with them and learn about their background.\n\nDepending on the tone of \"when you're in my class you don't need to do that\", that could be from a place of concern rather than annoyance or trying to shame you.  \n\nJust my $0.02\n\nidk about normal but it does seem a bit odd...as a teacher, i enjoy when advanced yogis are in my easier classes so other people can see where the pose is going or what the full expression might like look like\n\ngiven it was your first time in their class, maybe they were trying to help you manage your energy and keep it at an easier level or doing something to help manage the energy in the room? seems like the kind of comment to make after class with maybe a \"hi, it's the first time i've seen you in my class\" convo tho\n\nSpeaking as an absolute beginnger, at a purely emotional level, I would feel (and have felt) devastated if the person next to me seemed to immediately and effortlessly pull off the move I was unable to make even halfway. I absolutely recognise and acknowledge that this is nobody's problem but my own, and I have never ever showed any kind of annoyance about this at anyone other than myself, but I can see how an instructor in a beginner class might feel awkward having an advanced individual in the midst of beginner students, lest the beginners feel lesser.\n\n\n\n\nHOWEVER. The fact that you waited until the instructor stated that one could take the move further if one was able and willing to do so to take the move further AND THEN took the move further makes you the one who is right in this situation. Also, when my own instructor adjusts my body, she first alerts me to her presence, and then quickly says what she is going to adjust. She has never touched anyone in the class without first giving this \"heads-up\".\n\n\n\n\nNow, as for your level being more advanced than the class you were in, I caught a conversation between my instructor and another student who had just arrived for the next class as I was leaving my own class. This is basically what was said.\n\n\n\n\nInstructor (with playful tone): \"What are you doing here? This class is too easy for you now. You need to trust in your body, so you can stay for today, but next week, I want you to come in the advanced class. You can still come to this one if you find you need to take it easier or want a more relaxed pace, but I think the advanced classes would be a better fit for you now\"\n\n\n\n\nAs such, I find the conduct of your instructor purely unacceptable. If I were you, I'd try to find another instructor.\n\nNot normal. Your practice is your practice. As long as it doesn’t interfere with the practices of others, you are fine. Don’t go back to that class.\n\nI hate these type of low self esteem, egotistical instructors. I had one that called me out in front of the whole class for modifying a move. Shamed me. Can you believe that. I’m sorry I didn’t know I couldn’t modify because my knees ache trying to do that and that your self esteem would feel threatened because I look like I can do it so much better than you. Last time I ever step foot in her class…\n\nSome instructors have fragile egos. I would call her out on it like I did that instructor. Sent her a FB message. She totally gaslighted me and never apologized. She knows I’m an instructor too. I didn’t know that she expected me to dumb down all my moves for the sake of her self esteem.\n\nSomething that took time for me to learn. The only person who has the power to shame you is you. Don’t give this power to anyone. It is possible to take people’s words as critical without feeling bad or caring about what they say.\n\n\"Shamed\" seems strong, if all he said was \"when you are in my class, you don't need to do that'.  \n\nHow did he adjust you in final pose?  There's an ocean of difference between grabbing your thigh and pressing down on your shoulders.\n\nHe went on top of me with his feet on each side of my yoga mat (while I was laying flat in between his legs), grabbed my wrists and spread my arms apart. It freaked me out.\n\nOh, ABsolutely not. Please speak to the studio owner. This is a lot of red flags.\n\nHmmm, that seems a bit odd.  My understanding is that, in final rest, your arms can be in whatever position is comfortable for you.  I've never had an instructor adjust my arms in shavasana.\n\nOmg WHAT, no that is not ok or normal at all. Please complain to the studio owner.\n\nThat is really frustrating and I'm sorry it happened to you. If they give an option, you should be able to take it without any commentary (unless it's \"wow, nice options\" or something fairly neutral). \n\nTouching without consent is a no-no. \n\nPersonally, I have really long arms so I can touch the floor or \"reach\" when many around me can't but it's just my anatomy. \n\nThere are often classes that are more open to more advanced options that can be pretty intimidating (I don't usually go to these) but this whole thing feels weird and I'd probably avoid.\n\nAs a yoga teacher, I feel that he violated some of the principles of yoga. Hand to the ground isn’t even “advanced”. I (like others) assumed you must’ve been doing handstands or something. \n\nI will say, I find it interesting that many replies from beginners say they find it disruptive when more “advanced” yogis come to beginner classes. I don’t like the term beginner classes, but, one of the principles of yoga is to let go of comparison and competition. They’re insecurities of not being good enough because they’re watching your practice is an indicator that they need to relinquish the hold their ego has over them. \n\nYou likely get more out of the pose by bringing your hand to the ground. You do not need to sacrifice your practice to appease the other students or the teacher. Nothing you did was disruptive! Sorry you dealt with this. People new to yoga must learn that yoga is not a competition of gymnastics. They will benefit much more when they focus on their own bodies.\n\nNope, I don’t think I am physically capable of doing handstands at this point. But anything that involves grabbing a foot, back bending or splits I can do with ease due to hyper mobility. \n\nI practiced contortion for 7 years and then stopped for 4. Lost a lot of my tone and flexibility even. Yoga has been helping to get some of my strength back, but I am no expert in it. That is why I try to do what the instructor tells me to do, I don’t think I am in a position to guide myself into a pose that was not cued. But if they add an element to make it more difficult, I will for sure challenge myself to do it.\n\nCan we get another example, maybe the most extreme example of one of your variations to progress a pose? The one you gave is very mild. So if that’s it, then this is all very odd\n\nWe were working on sphinx pose, he suggested taking the hands off the floor, then the feet and going into bow pose, which I did exactly as he cued. I think that was the most advanced one we did during that class.\n\nHe seemed annoyed by that.\n\nDon’t go back to that class, and if he is not the owner I would say something to the owner , and if he is then say something to him. I have been teaching for ten years and tell my students to do as they will with tons  of verbal cueing . The only thing that bothers me is when a student is blatantly doing an entirely different class then the one I’m teaching as it can be distracting or even unsafe (ie doing a bunch of inversions when I’m cueing floor poses, it’s happened) but other then that you come with the ability you yourself have and you should never ever feel shame for doing what you can and want to do.\n\nI'm an extremely advanced yoga student and I quite often adjust the poses according to my limitations or that I can move further into the poses. Never once in 40 years if I had a teacher object to me going down into child's pose when I needed to or to do the advanced poses because I can. The teachers out of line and should not be doing that.\n\nI recently went to Pilates and I am hypermobile, the instructor told me I needed to be careful as because I’m hypermobile my body will actually be able to go too far and I need to be more aware and control it. She occasionally did touch my lower back or pelvis to get me to do the right posture or alignment but I felt it was fine and actually helpful as I am super bendy but it can be dangerous especially with hypermobility\n\nYoga is literally about balance- too much either way is not the objective of asana. Stira suka asana- there is an energetic posture that has to relax- but w strength that is optimal. I wouldn’t hate on the instructor for trying to support you in achieving optimal posture\n\nSorry you had this experience. \nAs a teacher I sometimes see students always do the “most advanced” variation (in quotes bc different bodies can access different shapes regardless of flexibility), and it does make me wonder if there may be some ego involved. I’m not suggesting this is the case for you and a teacher can never really know and certainly shouldn’t judge; but as the space holder in a yoga class, I want to provide an environment and instruction that supports being in our bodies and out of our egos. so if I notice a pattern in one student, I may suggest **TO THE WHOLE CLASS** that “they may choose to” try out all the variations (or try one they don’t usually practice, even if it’s a “milder” variation) and see what new depth they may be able to access in that shape. In the example you gave - extended side angle - keeping the hand/elbow higher, a yogi can focus on an open energy channel from the back foot to the upper fingertips; or you can bring more engagement to the core/, maybe reaching the bottom arm toward the front of the room along with the upper arm (which may require less flexibility but more core strength). \nSo, I can maybe understand where this teacher is coming from, but singling you out and adjusting without consent are both out of line. It sounds like he has some ego issues around being an “advanced” yogi.\nEdit: Also agree with others about letting the owner know. Hopefully he’s not the owner!\n\nSounds like he’s just jealous of your flexibility\n\nYup. That’s what I was thinking. He can’t handle how flexible you are and it’s apparently way more flexible than him. Seems like a real jerk. I wouldn’t go back to him. And that sounds like bad energy too. Forget that!\n\nI wouldn't go back.\n\nI was shamed for my flexibility before as well. I don't attend that person's classes anymore. I'm sorry that happened to you. I know it sucks. I respect everyone's different abilities and don't see my flexibility as a flex, but just how others may need to modify I often need a deeper stretch. And both ways are ok.\n\nEta: I just read someone else's response that mentioned hypermobiliy. The time I felt shamed the teacher, a sub that day actually, repeatedly called me out as hypermobile in a way that felt accusatory, wincing as I bent in poses I had done for years. I have health anxiety and immediately googled hypermobility after class and got super worried. The next class I asked my regular teacher about it and was assured I'm fine but she did offer a suggestion on not turning my elbow creases forward in down dog, something that still confuses me because I got that from a Yoga with Adrienne video, and I've since done that same video and heard it again and still don't understand if I'm supposed to do it or not. I would appreciate someone telling me gently if I was doing something unsafe because I wouldnt want my flexibility to cause injury, but the call outs and overreactionary attitude from that one person in front of my class was inappropriate imo.\n\nI'm far more flexible now than I was when I taught full time and I always appreciated someone doing a great example of the advanced versions of poses I could not get into myself.  I teach at hotels we are not allowed to touch students.\n\nThe instructor likely can't do the poses as well as you.  When I do yoga I love to see people go further in the poses because it gives me something to aspire to\n\nAs the instructors at my studio say all the time, this is your practice, they are merely there to make suggestions. If a particular pose is not in your practice, feel free to do another pose. If you feel that you need to do something different, it's your practice, do what is best for you.\n\nContext is important here. Having a really flexible person come in and place their mat front and center, and then doing advanced poses could be intimidating and uncomfortable for a beginner.\n\nIf the teacher gave the option (which is the case with you) for advanced variations and then criticized you, that’s not ok. I do wonder if there is more to the story than you are letting on, or are aware. \n\nI also think consent cards are really valuable tools. Some people love physical assistance, but for some it can be very triggering. Consent cards allow everyone to have the experience they want.  I am a reformed Ashtanga practitioner, who became disillusioned with Pattabhi Jois, and the assistance by default is a no go.\n\nAn important part of yoga is to let go of comparison and competition. I don’t think it’s necessary for hyper mobile students to avoid poses for the sake of other students, so long as OP wasn’t disrupting the class.\n\nI had this happen to me during covid with an online class. We were doing a simple move and decades of dance and gymnastics means that I don't even feel a stretch unless I go past what most people should do. The instructor tried to correct me and told me that I was going to stretch my ligaments and tendons out, and I let him know that my body was already that flexible. He continued for a solid 2 minutes telling me I shouldn't do that to my body, when it was a necessity to be a professional dancer. It was incredibly embarrassing. Even though I fought back. It is not normal, it is not okay, and I'm so sorry that happened to you. I ended up logging off and crying for 20 minutes. He shamed me for being too flexible and it was horrible.\n\nThat is awful and absolutely unacceptable, I am so sorry that this happened to you!!\n\nI'm so sorry it happened to you! Knowing that somebody else went through it, hopefully lets you know that it's not about your body, there are other people out there who are flexible. It was about that asshole. It took me a while to try again but I hope you go back sooner than I did. Screw the people that make us feel bad about our bodies!\n\nThe only reason I can think of that I would be annoyed as a teacher was if you were doing variations I wasn't teaching at that time. But if they were offering those poses... idk, I'd ask why they're saying that cuz it's so WEIRD.\n\nEww\n\nmy classes always announce whether they're gonna do any hands on adjustments and ask for hands if anyone doesn't want it.\n\nTotally uncalled for, calling you out and touching you without permission.  Sounds like a control freak.\n\nNo that is not normal and I hope there's a studio owner you can report it to.\n\nNot normal. Report that instructor for touching you without your consent.\n\nGross. Report him to the studio.\n\nNever realized how many power obsessed, insecure teachers there were until joining this sub!\n\nThat being said, sometimes it is distracting if an advanced student shows off in the middle of a bunch of beginners. That's the difference between an all levels and beginners class. But since he gave the advanced option... that doesn't sound right. Best assumption is that he thought you were trying too hard like straining, and you needed to be given permission to back off bc of your own over-achieving tendency. Honestly he probably just thought you were hot, and men in this profession need a thousand times more guidance/better training to not be creepy. That's just biology and testosterone. Overall I'm sorry he tried make you feel that way, I would've laughed and left, probably.\n\nHe sounds like an a-hole. I'd think it would be cool to see people pulling off advanced poses, isn't building flexibility one of the benefits of yoga? He sounds jealous of your ability and/or threatened by it. Nothing to do with you, it's his insecurity!\n\nSome people want to feel like the only advanced person in the room. You stole his shine. \n\nFrom your description, you did with little effort all the advanced poses he cued; yet, he's mad. That sounds like nothing but ego and sour grapes.\n\nHe has emotional work to do. I would not return to this class. He sounds threatened by you. To adjust your savasana seems to try to get the upper hand as some call it the most difficult pose. I have been doing yoga for 15 yrs with probably 30 teachers and have never experienced anything like this\n\nSome teachers seem to really dislike it if you do a beginner class and aren't a complete beginner. I've had a similar experience being told to take the intermediate class instead of the beginner class even though there were only beginner classes available that quarter.\n\nA lot of times people take a class based on schedule rather than one that exactly aligns with their ability.  This teacher is terribel.\n\nNo that guy sucks and you’re awesome\n\nI got shamed too because I was a beginner yogi and it was my first yoga class but, I’d done yoga positions for stretching and mobility in other sporting and workout programs, so I knew some of them. I didn’t hide this fact, when asked if there was anyone new to yoga I said I was new to it but I work out and have done some related stuff. Later the instructor called me out specifically in front of the other students, saying something to the effect of, “some people just come to beginner yoga classes to be a show off”. She didn’t say it as a joke and no one laughed. It was super uncomfortable. I didn’t go back.\n\nNOT normal.  Maybe a new teacher?  I wasn't there but i might write this off as a mistake the first 2 or 3 times, but if it continued maybe find another class.\n\nI would definitely recommend communicating a boundary or practicing elsewhere if you don't feel comfortable &lt;3\n\nIf you are in a very beginner class it *can* be inappropriate to do advanced moves becaude beginners don't always know their limitations and may try to copy what you are doing and injure themselves. I have taken fitness classes before where instructors have asked me to not do X,Y or Z moves because of this reason and although I don't necessarily agree with it I have respected that. That being said, I would not consider extended side angle with hand touching the ground an advanced move and it seems to me this was not handled professionally at all by the instructor. In the yoga classes I've been to if someone is doing an advanced variation then the instructor will cue it as an option even if they were not planning on it. I have also never had an instructor make adjustments without verbally saying they will do so first and giving an opportunity to decline.\n\nI always wondered if some yoga instructors get off on being more advanced/ being able to show off to people following their class. This dude proved he was insecure about your ability in my opinion\n\nno, a good teacher asks in the start of class f anyone doesnt want to be touched.\n\nYo what... it's YOUR practice you can do whatever the hell you want to.. also tapping you during shavasana? Chaotic!! I would complain about this guy to the studio owner he's clearly out of touch with the purpose of yoga.....\n\nI think you went to beginners class only to show yourself, how advanced you are. I completely understand your instructor. All other peeps are trying to do basic things the best they can and there we have one cocky guy with always advanced poses.\n\nNot normal. I would avoid this instructor.\n\nMost of the time the only challenge my instructor gave was to make sure im not “cheating” the strength out of the pose. so for e.g. like you, when i do extended side angle she will ask me to high five her w my hand that’s on the floor. She just makes sure I’m not dumping my weight on one side. That’s the kind of instructor you want to learn from\n\nDid you report the teacher to the studio owner? Not normal. Wish we had a way of knowing which teacher at which studio bc that way these freaks could be avoided (for folks who live near you).\n\n\nFirst - no instructor should touch you without permission. We are taught that in yoga training. \nSecond- most instructors wouldn’t care if you were doing an advanced version of a pose. \nThe only thing I can think of here is that he was teaching a beginner class and was worried about you getting hurt or pushing yourself too hard. Most instructors would ask you quietly. \nMaybe he was just jealous of your ability to do all the advanced poses. ?? 🙃🙂\n\nWhen a yoga instructor gives direction, it is but a suggestion. I would talk to him, and if he doesn’t budge, report him to the owners. You were following the flow, and taking it to where your body needed it, at the same time, should any of the students let their eyes stray, they would have seen where they can go when the move on from beginner."

Share with us 🤗\n\nOp, any advice on straightening the leg? I also have trouble with that part.\n\nOh yes actually there is! Someone here even told me this years ago 🙏🏻 \nIt's all about counterbalance. That is, first find the balance after taking the foot off the ground, then aim to move your body a little further (gaze always ahead) when you start to extend the leg back. If you look carefully, you can see that tiny adjustment in the video. Hope that helps 🍀\n\nThank u!!! I will try and report back :))\n\n👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 goals\n\nNice!\n\nWow! So awesome !\n\nVery nice.

You should turn pro ;-)\n\nThat looks incredible.\n\nInspiring! Thanks for sharing\n\nthat transition to crow mesmerized me\n\nSo nice and strong!\n\nThat is a tough pose.

    "title": "The Cultural Sensitivity of Yoga - Sad experiences: the disrespect and utter ignorance in Yoga",
    "body": "Yoga, an ancient practice rooted in Indian tradition, has garnered immense popularity in the West. While it is heartening to see the global curiosity and enthusiasm towards Yoga, it also raises some thought-provoking questions about the true motives behind its adoption in Western cultures. Are these crash courses, such as 200-hour or 300-hour certifications and two-month retreats, driven solely by commercial interests? This contemplation has been on my mind, especially since I recently started attending Yoga studios in Germany.\n\nIn the past few weeks, my experiences in these studios have been mixed, to say the least. Many studios display pictures and statues of Hindu gods like Lord Ganesha, Shiva, Goddess Kali, and Lord Hanuman. Initially, this seemed like a beautiful gesture of appreciation. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed these sacred images were often placed on low tables or even on the floor where while practicing one might constantly come in contact with these revered Gods. This placement is culturally insensitive and shows a lack of understanding of the reverence these deities hold in Hinduism.\n\nThe most disheartening moment came when I was shopping for Yoga mats. I discovered mats depicting with images of Lord Ganesha, Lord Hanuman, and Maa Kali. Seeing these sacred figures on items meant to be stepped on was deeply painful. It felt like a blatant disregard for the sanctity and respect these deities deserve. Even more shocking was that one of these mats was sold out. This insensitivity is troubling.\n\nHindu gods are not mere artistic symbols; they are sacred and deeply revered beings, worshipped by millions worldwide. Placing their images on Yoga mats, where they are likely to be stepped on, is profoundly disrespectful and hurtful to those who hold these deities in high regard. In Hindu tradition, devotees take great care to show respect and reverence towards their gods. Rituals, prayers, and maintaining cleanliness, such as taking a shower before entering a temple, are integral practices to honor these deities.\n\nThe commercialization of Yoga in the West often overlooks these cultural and spiritual nuances. While Yoga can be a wonderful bridge between cultures, fostering mutual respect and understanding is crucial. When adopting practices from other cultures, it is essential to do so with sensitivity and respect for their origins and significance.\n\nTo truly honor Yoga's essence, it is important to move beyond commercial motives and embrace its deeper spiritual and cultural dimensions. This means educating oneself about the traditions and beliefs that underpin Yoga and practicing it in a manner that respects its origins. Only then can we appreciate Yoga in its entirety and contribute to a more respectful and inclusive global community. Namaste!",

A person can read it, or misread it, or not read, the book doesn't care.\n\nbeautifully said.\n\nagreed\n\nWell that's poetic, but unhelpful to the post nevertheless. OP mentions about insensitivity and complete commercialization of Yoga in the West by using Deities inappropriately in a way which is disrespectful to the people of that Culture.\n\nHere's more good poetry for you, lol.\n\nYoga is like the sun. You could set 2 people in the sun, we could think of them as one good person and one bad person. But the sun doesn't care. It shines on both equally without discrimination.\n\nHow poetic, totally missing the point, but delusionally poetic nevertheless. Enjoy\n\nCongratulations you just demonstrated the perfect example of spiritual bypassing. Showcasing everything that’s wrong with westernized yoga.\n\nWell, I was coming here to kvetch that this sub is just \"Yoga gatekeeper negatively reviews studio no one else will ever see\" instead of an actual yoga sub and its getting tiresome.\n\nBut yours is kinder and better and even more true, so have an upvote instead!\n\nMisreading is fine, but not considering something that's offensive to others isn't\n\nUnless the offense is done knowingly, then it's not intentional.\n\nYou can't live a life without ever offending some. Speaking your voice is always a possibility to hurt someone's feelings.\n\nThen we talk and learn, together.\n\nAre you going to say the same about our gods?\n\nWell written, but it's good that the OP is aware of the cultural sensitivities.\n\nThink about it like this:\n\n1) If you are an atheist and you are called dumb by religious people, you wouldn't necessary like that.\n\n2) If you are religious, you wouldn't like people trampling over your gods when other amazing options are available.\n\nTolerance should be expected both ways. Only way to live in peace is atleast to be aware of other peoples beliefs. If you can't understand and follow the nuances, well try to be aware of them. World will be a better place already. Namaste!\n\nAs someone who has found peace and spirituality through yoga replacing an oppressive Christian upbringing, this nails it. \n\nEveryone can tailor yoga or any exercise to fit their needs or fill their void. \n\nI couldn't give two shits about the historical or traditional hinduism or specific deities, as the general principles and themes of most religions hold true regardless of context. \n\nThat's why I specifically go to more secular studios, the pseudo temples to me are whack and precisely what I'm avoiding and replacing with yoga.\n\nThat’s not an excuse for you to mistreat our deities. We don’t care that you don’t care. We care when you appropriate and disrespect our religion.\n\nDude, there isn't one single religion, including Christianity, that hasn't seen some pop-cult commercialization of its figures and icons. You can find kitsch religious knock-offs of any deity you please. Buddha outfits. Buddha undies (FFS), sexy nun costumes, Jesus velvet paintings and glow in the dark Marys, \"rosaries\" and other paraphernalia co-opted for aesthetics. Endless pagan gods recycled for decor. Faux-Islamic icons and quasi-spiritual decor. Amusing themes for tarot cards. Shinto for weebs.\n\nLike, seriously. They aren't coming just for you, and this is not unique to one religion. Is it a problem for the seriously devout of any religion? I imagine so. But posting these virtue-signalling rants to people who weren't there, about people who will never hear or care about your criticism, so everyone feels all glowy about how much BETTER you are in a safe echo chamber instead of, you know, trying some grass-roots activism if you feel so strongly, is just lame personified.\n\nBut yoga is from Hinduism. How can do yoga and then disrespect the religion it comes from? You don’t have to convert to Hinduism but at least not disrespect it?\n\nI agree. Entirely. In fact, as someone whose degrees were in museum stuff and history, I'll happily go further and sat \"this is the Orientalism movement still doing its gross thing in newly rebranded packaging\".\n\nBut c'mon with the vitriol NOT aimed at the people actually bothering you. It's doing nothing to impact or address the issue, All this railing and ranting and utterly pious \"true practitioner\" stuff this sub loves to share between each other so everyone feels like the better, \"right\" yoga practitioner unlike those Fake Posers is getting hella old. \n\nI'm minded of an old college mate who was very Muslim, very into how everyone disrespects/misunderstands his religion, yet also saw nothing disrespectful to it in chowing down a bacon burger with several beers.\n\nWell I don't do that, nor do I give a shit about anyone that does. Nobody is trying to oppress anyone and zero harm is caused. Just laugh at their ignorance, taking it personally is ridiculous. \n\nI love yoga for its ability to unify a community and don't need any overly sensitive religious people whining about it and trying to educate everyone. \n\nGo do yoga at your studio, church or home instead of being a buzzkill and forcing your culture rules and regulations on every workout studio trying their best to spread a universally great practice that we need as many people as possible doing consistently.\n\nIt seems obvious, but this: \n\n&gt; I love yoga for its ability to unify a community\n\nis not possible when this: \n\n&gt; nor do I give a shit about anyone that does. Nobody is trying to oppress anyone and zero harm is caused.\n\nis also part of the conversation in the same space. Treating people and their beliefs with disrespect is indeed causing harm.\n\n\neta - it's also quite obvious that this: \n\n&gt; don't need any overly sensitive religious people whining about it and trying to educate everyone. \n\nDoes anything but promote unity.\n\nThis is why my studio has NO depictions of deities, nor are they mentioned in practice frequently, if ever. A separation of church and mat, so to speak.\n\nA separation of church and mat. This is great\n\nThere is a yoga influencer who has adopted the slogan \"Namaslay\" and to this day it's one of the most odious things I've ever witnessed. \n\nI thought you meant they used it as a joke to poke fun at the cultural “white-washing” of yoga. When I re-read it and realized you meant they were serious…\n\nIf you’re interested in this, Yoga is Dead is an interesting podcast from two Indian-American hosts!\n\nUgh I wish I hadn’t learned that\n\nI guess this is the same one who has a book out by that title? UGH. For the life of me, I don't understand the gushing reviews. What a stupid, culturally offensive \"term\" her made-up catch phrase is.\n\nNamaslay all day, apparently.\n\nNamastay home and smoke\n\nI smoke b fore class.\n\nI feel for your sensitivities but capitalism has done this to every single faith on earth. You can find thongs printed with the  Virgin of Guadalupe and mugs with Buddha readily available. When I was in Mumbai I found bags, shirts and key chains with Laxmi, Krishna and Ganapati. If you have personal convictions about certain aspects of the practice then follow them, but it's impossible to expect the world to follow your standards. The foundations of yoga are from India but modern yoga is derived from colonialism and because of this there will always be a slightly exploitive aspect to it\n\nyou would think the practice of yoga or it's practioners aren't just regular consumers and have a sense of respect for what they're doing if not the ability for reflection and introspection or inner/spiritual inclinement\n\nits been my experience that most practitioners are very conscientious of these things....and then there are people that just want the athletic experience...and then we go all the way to other extreme and theres folks that adopt vedic traditions as their entire identity and begin to gatekeep and scold others as to whether theyre \"doing it right\". i dont think there is one right way to do yoga other than just focusing on your personal experience and respecting others that are just doing their own thing. \n\nBags, shirts, and keychains are not meant to be stepped on..\n\nIt's incredibly culturally insensitive to suggest it's OK to step all over images of deities. It's common in Hindu culture to show apologies to -any object- you accidentally touch with your foot. Using an image of a deity as a yoga mat or floor decor is wrong without a doubt.\n\nIm not suggesting that it isnt, there's just an overall numbness to consuming spiritual icons/images as products that goes beyong yoga world. I would never support a studio or teacher that repeatedly violated my beliefs like that. \n\nI believe that's what OP is addressing. \n\nYou're right, there's a numbness to spiritual icons, especially if it's not one we are connected to personally or culturally. But this is about the yoga specifically.\n\nPoint is, yoga is intertwined with Hindu culture. People doing yoga should be able to respect what they are participating and benefiting from and not be angry when presented with new information.\n\n It's inappropriate and one of the worst violations to step on deities in this culture, thus a yoga mat using Ganesha ji as a pseudo-spiritual marketing point and people buying into that needs to be addressed.\n\nAddressed by who? Do we speak to the manager of yoga? My father's family is from northern Calcutta, Im well aware of \"Hindu culture\" but there will always be disrespectful opportunists, and you address that by not supporting them.  Like in any religion, there are people who would be extremely offended and there are people that would not, and yoga doesnt get some kind of extra sacred points that we need to tiptoe around, everyone should just be respectful of each other's beliefs, period. I love how no one gave a damn about my Catholic examples lol.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhy should it be responsibility of any council!!  If one is adopting or practicing another culture,then better learn about the proper ways and be open ,curious about learning more. It's Swadhyaya and a  Yogi follows that as it's part of the 8 limbs, rest is just justifying ignorance.\n\nthis is not on local Hindu councils. people who practice yoga who don't care for yoga, could not be bothered less with Hindu councils.\n\nit's on people who teach and practice yoga to do so with basic respect and understanding\n\nYoga as it is practiced today is a syncretic practice that combines elements of more than one culture. The asanas described in ancient texts (e.g. Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras) are just comfortable seated poses for meditation. A lot of the modern poses we practice were borrowed from British and Scandinavian gymnastics in the 19th and 20th centuries. The appropriation of Hindu religious symbols is culturally insensitive, but the practice of yoga is a hybrid. Leaving out the spiritual aspects is an authentic modern yoga practice. You don’t get to gatekeep that. And don’t pretend that there aren’t shamelessly commercial yoga studios in India, because there are plenty.\n\nI have also heard it once said “Everyone is a Hindu” in that if you are spiritual and celebrate a deity then you are Hindu (one of my professors had an entire lecture on this and I found it really interesting and beautiful btw). So I don’t know if appropriation is technically possible, disrespect is absolutely possible though and we all know that’s not relegated to one culture.\n\nOP never mentioned any of this though. While you’re right about everything you say, it’s also true that people are disrespecting the original culture. And whether or not asana developed in Europe or not doesn’t really matter because at the end of the day it’s all been folded into a practice that is very much still Indian. If it weren’t, it would just still be called gymnastics. \n\nUnapologetic imperialism to justify raiding another group’s culture is the basis of western culture. It’s why people say the west, but especially America, doesn’t have a culture. Too busy picking the bones of others to create their/our own\n\nWe have a culture and a national pastime, 2 actually, shopping and war.\n\nPrecisely\n\nAmerica is a melting pot, why wouldn’t you have pieces of all cultures?  🙄\n\nIt’s a double edged sword as it can erase cultural identity and meaning. If you can’t see why someone from the culture that’s being erased would be upset then you’ve obviously finished your koolaid and I can’t help you anymore\n\nVery well put 👏👏\n\nBecause culture is something which can be, but not necessarily, commercialized. It appears, at least to someone outside the US, that nothing is safe from being commercialized for a few $$ anymore.\n\nYou're right, that it is a melting pot. But the real culture of the US is capitalism, which overrides everything else.\n\nwho's gatekeeping by pointing out these issues? and how do you get to dismiss what happens in the west or speak to what happens in south asia?\n\nBingo! It’s fine to get into the spiritual side of yoga, but a lot of people just aren’t interested in that. Some are just trying to get some exercise in. Like you said, modern yoga in the west is a mix of two or more cultures and you can’t expect everyone to spend their days studying the Vedic texts. The commercialization takes advantage of aesthetically minded people. That is just as true of religions originating in Europe and elsewhere as it is for Hinduism.\n\nWell said!\n\nFor 99% of people \"Yoga\" is just exercise, and imo that's fine. If it's more than that to you though, you probably have to sift through a lot of dirt to find what you're looking for.\n\nYes it is fine to me as well as long as it is not disrespectful. What better sight than to see happy and healthy humans! :)\n\nThank you for making this post. I never thought to be on the lookout for cultural insensitivity toward Hinduism in yoga studios. Thanks to you it is now on my radar.\n\n\nAbout the certifications...I get where you are coming from, but want to offer another perspective. Many people do yoga for their health, it's important both for liability and for the client's best interest for yoga instructors to have basic credentials in anatomy, fitness, the biological and psychological connections with yoga. Also, many people who love yoga aren't rich; becoming an instructor is the best way to follow your passion while keeping the bills paid. And if we're going to criticize the capitalist grind, that goes WAY beyond yoga! This is the last place I'd start for that conversation!\n\nThank you for understanding. You are right for many it is a means of livelihood now. Apologies for ignoring this side of Yoga. I only wanted people to be respectful. I would be glad if this message even reached even one person :)\n\nReading the Gita is a bit like panning for gold.\n\nI want a Ganesh bobble head for my car.\n\nI have a cutest Ganesha too :)\n\nWell. We have 3 million Hindus in the US.  When Urban Outfitters put Shiva on their socks and underwear, a Hindu organization complained and got the merchandise removed. They complained when a company put another deity on a yoga mat, and the company apologized and removed the product. \n\nSo I would say that because yoga does not have to be religious, people just don’t know. Find an organization to help you, and call it out.  I like to believe that people have good intentions.\n\nThere is a wonderful new app called Yoke Yoga which is all about respecting and honoring the roots of yoga and getting away from the over commercialization of the practice. The teachers creating content for the app are awesome!! I’m excited to see the library grow and encourage anyone who is thinking about these aspects to check it out 😊\n\nI attended an event a few years ago, Decolonizing Yoga, hosted by Zarna Joshi. It was eye opening and unsettling. I still struggle with balancing a practice that I am grateful for and also doing it in a in a culturally sensitive way\n\nI think shrines are inappropriate in yoga studios. In the west, the primary focus of yoga is the 8 limbs, and especially the asanas and pranayama, which do not include deity worship. Separation of church and state.\n\nI think western focus is primarily on only one of those 8 limbs, asana. \n\nDevotion to a higher power/surrendering to the divine is part of the 2nd limb, one of the Niyamas, called Ishvara Pranidhana. It does not have to be a Hindu deity, but it's still a key part of the 8 limb path.\n\nA bad mix of psychopaths and capitalism doesn't care about other people's culture or religion.  I don't enjoy going to yoga studios and I glad you brought this up so maybe some studios will learn the error in their ways, and nobody buys those sorts of yoga mats.\n\nI once almost stepped on a prayer book in a temple and a Monk was horrified.  I learned my lesson; I was distraught at the hurt I caused.\n\nHow do you accidentally almost step on a prayer book?\n\nMany meditation cushions were set up in a temple with the prayer books on top or the side.  Was leaving Satsang one was off of the cushion I was stepping over and I just missed it.\n\n&gt; the true motives behind its adoption in Western cultures\n\nPeople feel good when they do yoga. That's the main motive. People need to move their body and relax their mind. Yoga allows them to do both at the same time, it's great!\n\n\n&gt; The most disheartening moment\n&gt; was deeply painful\n&gt; profoundly disrespectful and hurtful\n\nYou really need to live and let live. These actions shouldn't affect you this much even if you think they're wrong (I mostly agree with you that they're wrong). There will always be people that will do things differently than you, it's important to let it go.\n\nDoing things differently and being insensitive and outright disrespectful are two different things sir/mam. In this world where information is so easily available, getting acquainted with basic cultural nuances isn't too much to ask for. If Yoga, for people, is only about 'moving the body' or 'exercise', why then use images and symbols that are religious? It's totally cool for people to approach Yoga as they wish but if their approach has nothing to do with Yoga as a religious practice, better to stay away for blatant misappropriation of Hindu deities.\n\n&gt; why then use images and symbols that are religious\n\nIgnorance or marketing are probably the two main reasons.\n\nCertainly. I feel some things should remain outside the scope of mindless commercialization. No doubt yoga became popular in last decade or so but its true essence has been degraded and exploited so very much.\n\nIt's not a lot to ask to respect yoga and the culture it comes from. you may not be bothered with the minimum respect or understanding, but it's strange that you go out of your way to shut down people for even addressing this\n\nI'm not shutting down anyone, but if it's affecting OP to that point, they need to take a step back because it's a fight they'll never win and they're setting themselve up to he miserable.\n\n&gt; During the Teng Dynasty, Dharma Master Dan Xia (literally, Red Twilight) used to be a candidate for the civil service examination. But he got a \"calling\" and later became a Buddhist Monk instead.\nOn a cold winter night, a big snow storm hit the city and the temple where Dan Xia served as a Monk got snowed in. Cut off from outside traffic, the coal delivery man could not get to the Zen Monastery. Soon it ran out of heating fuel after a few days and everybody was shivering in the cold. The monks could not even cook their meals.\nDan Xia began to remove the wooden Buddha Statues from the display and put them into the fireplace.\n\"What are you doing?\" the monks were shocked to see that the holy Buddha Statues were being burnt inside the fire place. \"You are burning our holy religious artifacts! You are insulting the Buddha!\"\n\"Are these statues alive and do they have any Buddha nature?\" asked Master Dan Xia.\n\"Of course not,\" replied the monks. \"They are made of wood. They cannot have Buddha Nature.\"\n\"OK. Then they are just pieces of firewood and therefore can be used as heating fuel,\" said Master Dan Xia. \"Can you pass me another piece of firewood please? I need some warmth.\"\nThe next day, the snow storm had gone and Dan Xia went into town and brought back some replacement Buddha Statues. After putting them on the displays, he began to kneel down and burn incense sticks to them.\n\"Are you worshiping firewood?\" ask the monks who are confused for what he was doing.\n\"No. I am treating these statues as holy artifacts and am honouring the Buddha.\" replied Dan Xia\n\n100% agree. Unfortunately this notion cannot be limited to just yoga alone.. but just about any spiritual tradition. Once a practice is seperated from it’s tradition it is up to interpretation by just about anybody. For good or bad. We humans always balance between the sacred and the profane.. and we do what we can to retain the proper boundaries even though not always successful. To be respectful is the most important thing\n\nI am a practitioner of the eight limbs of yoga, but I am also an atheist. Gods are wall decorations to me. If I am in someone else’s place of worship, I will pay my respects and honor their ways. But I am unlikely to give credence to their god forms outside of those spiritual places.\n\nThat’s the way to do it man. When someone comes to your house and visit or whatever.. they naturally submit to your customs and whatnot. They might not ’agree’ with your practices or whatever you are doing, but it has to be honored. They submit. It’s your house. Otherwise.. do not go there at all. Outside of that context I can do what the hell I want. That’s life. Problem happens when things are the other way around\n\nBeing an atheist and being disrespectful are two different things. Having them as decoration to me is not good but hey that isn't being disrespectful. When you start using them on Yoga mats is. Consider if someone placed images of our own parents on yoga mats and stepped on them – it would undoubtedly be distressing and offensive to me. As a practitioner who was brought up in a spiritual environment, God to me is everything. My boyfriend is an atheist but he has immense respect for what I believe in.\n\nI grew up with hippie parents, they wouldn’t mind. They might even like the fact that you have chosen to exercise with them and that they have not been forgotten. Who knows, maybe yesterday’s temples are today’s t-shirts. \nAre these your gods? Is this why you find it insulting? Not meant to be an insulting question, more of curiosity.\n\nThis is a very clear example of a cultural difference. In the east, especially in India, putting your feet on someone/something is a sign of disrespect.   \n  \nFor example, Hindus don't touch paper with their feet at all because it symbolizes education. Even if they did by mistake, they ask for forgiveness.   \n  \nHence, OP is worried that if his gods, who he cares, is being used in ways which are insulting (as per his cultural beliefs, which is also where yoga originated from tbf), it is a fair ask to not disrespect the source, or the origins. I think people in the west are missing this cultural context.\n\nI would like to point out that westerners have had a love affair with all things East, long before yoga came to our shores or the European shores, and as such has westernized these things for better or worse. Opium for worse, silk for better. Too many examples to list. \nIf I ever make it to the land of yoga, or find myself in an ashram or a studio that venerates these deities and these ways of life I will be happy to follow their customs. I can be a good guest. \nBut as I myself am not a follower, I am unlikely to follow these customs in my day to day life, unless I find they make more sense to me than the way I am living now. There are many Abrahamic religious figures whom I would be happy to put my feet on, as well as many US presidents.\n\nDon't go to those studios, and don't buy those mats if that's the way you feel. The spiritual stuff is nice, but that's not the reason many of us go.\n\nWell separating Yoga from its spirtituality to please a certain group is beyond my understanding. It was just painful for me to see it. And I only posted this to whoever practicing may feel that it is good to be respectful instead of using it for commercial purpose. It would be more appropriate and respectful to explore other ways to celebrate the cultural and spiritual aspects of yoga without misappropriating religious symbols. Example learning about it or not calling it Yoga if you are running a health camp there are all kinds of gyms and pilates and dance forms.\n\nI appreciate the history, cultural tradition, and spirituality of yoga. That said, I'm not religious and I'm not even close to being Hindu. I like the physical practice of yoga. I think my attitude is pretty common among Western practicioners.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't force people to experience things on your terms. I'm in agreement with you on the misuse of religious imagery, and I find it cringey when white instructors appropriate Hindu messaging in class, but you simply can't expect people to only do an orthodox version of yoga. \n\nThis is how culture works in the modern world. Things are borrowed and changed and mixed. You need to make peace with it!\n\n&gt; Well separating Yoga from its spirtituality to please a certain group is beyond my understanding.\n\nHere’s the simplification of it; if you don’t please enough people then your bills aren’t paid and your studio shuts down.\n\nBy lying? By whitewashing the truth? While a yoga studio for you may be a place for physical exercise and to make money out of it, it still carries the legacy and spirit of its origins. I see it now Money is the supreme deity!\n\nyour truth is not everyone’s truth\n\n[removed]\n\nIt's depressing you're being down voted but you are 100% correct. \n\nIt is so sad what yoga has become in the west, people are proud to leave out the spiritual aspects. While I know many a guru has said that even practicing asana is good and can lead to greater, it's still very disheartening to see so many disregard yoga and it's immense spirituality.\n\nWe don't all wanna drink your religious nonsense Kool aid, some of us just wanna sweat and stretch.\n\nit's gross to dismiss what OP said about respecting the practice\n\nGo to planet fitness then\n\nSweating and stretching is fine, but it's not yoga.  OP's point is getting lost in everyone's defensiveness.  \n\nYoga is and always has been a spiritual practice.\n\nOnly westerns with zero character would downvote this\n\nI want to say not all Western culture depicts as you have described. I am sorry that you view Western culture as you do. I have only practiced in the US. I think here you would find many places you would enjoy. Yoga has only been here for a few years, 1893. Its evolving. I agree some studios are commercial it has been on that trajectory for many years. I noticed the trend 15 years or so ago. I’ve only practiced in the US but have had experience with Eastern teachers in the beginning. I was exposed to Yoga in the 70’s.\n\nPlease be patient with the people who are just learning or are ignorant. They don’t know. It’s as simple as that. I will now be more observant now that I have more knowledge or new information of how people from the east feel. \nI wonder if you’ve gotten a chance to spend enough time with western people and feel comfortable enough to let them know your thoughts? \n\nBe the teacher. Lamenting about the US and how it’s different from other places is futile. Melting pot or country of immigrants. Capitalism is driving a lot of this also but so is ignorance. Don’t be offended.\n\nHey No. Ofcourse not all... I was only trying to convey a message here about respect. I thought this might make a slight difference in what people thought. I was not attacking people or asking them to be religious or spiritual; that was never my intent.\n\nI am sure people do not have ill intentions. I did mail the yoga company and explained them politely. They said \"they'll stop making these mats; however they need to get rid of the stock and will only sell whats left.\" \n\nThis post was part of my slow patience journey. I chose to write it in a yoga community for it to reach a bigger audience. Nor do I have disrespect for the teachers. Teachers are the Gurus and hold the highest place. \n\nThere have been positive responses too and I am so glad about it.\n\nI am not happy with the West and the capitalism. It’s definitely not balanced. It does seem wrong.\nI appreciate Yoga because some times that’s all I’ve had. It helped me so much. I found strength, confidence and balance. I never felt I was “doing it wrong” was never something I felt. Until someone brought me awareness. I didn’t feel attacked. I just have some thoughts about your thoughts. \nI think Yoga a super broad topic!\n\nThere are a lot of \"out of touch\" people trying to sell things, who don't seem to care about its meaning, and even more people who will buy it. It is sad. As a Western yoga teacher, I do contemplate the commercialization involved in the world of yoga a fair amount. I am turned off by the \"sales\" aspect, whether that's selling teacher trainings or retreats. It reminds me of an MLM, and I know for a fact that some studios actually have the instructors \"befriend\" their students so they will sign up for teacher trainings. That is just icky. The more awareness we can all have about what we're doing/practicing, the better. Yoga is, after all, so beneficial!\n\nI agree 100% and think it is worse than you even describe. In the west, yoga has been removed from its spiritual essence and turned into exercise classes with Indian styling, as if wearing a logo representing the sign for Namaste somehow makes a person more spiritual. In the West, it is often performance-based, hence the abnormal focus on \"achieving\" postures, rather than on the physical, mental and emotional experiences of working toward the poses.\n\nI also agree that it is about educating ourselves about the history, tradition and beliefs that underpin yoga. That is hard to do when so much of yoga in the west has been corpratized, comoditized and is often sold in deceptive ways (cough \"Bikram\" cough \"Hot Yoga\").\n\nIn my experience, the overwhelming majority of YTT graduates never teach a single class, those that do are ill-prepared to do so and, therefore, the bulk of students just think yoga is about sweating, sculpting or, fill in some other vanity-based substitute.\n\nCompletely agree with your assessment of the quality of teachers YTT manufactures.\n\nThis is so valid. This past week i had classes in numerous studios. Most had a shallow understanding of yoga. I myself am a beginner but I have deep respect for the tradition. I didn't come for the \"workout\", I camw to deepen my meditation. I only found one teacher serious with understanding what yoga entails in it's completeness, not just the body sculpting poses. The last sentence of your first paragraph is scary accurate.\n\nYou are right; Yoga is much more than the physical flexibility or doing a pose right. In one of my classes, a teacher even said \"Om\" is not part of Hinduism to please God knows who. OM is found in the Vedas and Upanishads and is explained in the Mandukya Upanishad. It is beyond my understanding the need to separate Yoga and OM from Hinduism. It only shows ignorance.\n\nNo way that's just... I hate how religion has to be removed because westerns get uncomfortable with anything non-catholic or protestant🙄. OM is ridiculously integral.\n\nThe same happened to Buddhism. Nothing of that nature survives contact with the West unscathed.\n\nI completely understand why certain practioners completely refuse to teach anyone from the west. Harsh but when you look at the replies in this thread, can you really blame them? It ranges from prideful ignorance to cultural entitement🤢\n\nCatholicism and Protestantism make me just as uncomfortable. As do all religions.\n\nPersonally I don't think it's relevant how uncomfortable YOU feel with religion. It doesn't give you the right to strip it from a practice rooted in it. Heck, the religious part takes you beyond the surface level. At the very least it comes off ignorant.\n\nI mean some of us are just atheist and don’t believe in any of it…\n\nI can understand your POV as an agnostic, but your atheism, as is my agnosticism, is completely irrelevant. Yoga is tied deeply to its roots and if you don't wanna practice it on a surface level way you can choose to engage with that aspect or be willfully ignorant at best (white washing at worst).\n\nPeople will do this with everything to them its an aesthetic. They do it with every religion. Its unfortunately the reality of the world, we all have different beliefs and all we can do is try to find like-minded people.\n\nI personally think that the only real issue is with people appropriating eastern religion and culture for the appearance of looking authentic. Modern yoga doesn’t need to be spiritual or religious, but it shouldn’t trample on the culture either. At the end of the day it was Indians who westernized, and turned yoga into a marketable export exercise. \n\nNot really - Eugenie Peterson brought yoga to Hollywood in the 40s where it became popular with movie stars of the day. Her goal was to bring yoga to the west.\n\nOk well she wasn’t the only or the first person with that goal, and she didn’t make it more palatable to westerners to begin with. \n\nI agree with you OP. I may get downvoted for saying that but I need to get it off my chest. I was in shock when I did my yoga teacher training, I realise now how much of a scam it was. I was used to go to temples and practice at home, and then those teachers were pretending to teach us while showing inappropriate behiavior. How can one learn this timeless tradition in 200-300h is beyong me, even less master it. Yoga means union with God, asanas are just a tiny part of it. I think it's great that many people are embracing yoga, it's not a criticism about ethnic origins or anything. It's just, the lack of authenticity and respect to the origins and traditions sometimes is disheartening.\n\nWhen you do something, do it right, no need to innovate in this field, it has been explored and laid down by people way beyond us in this exploration. No need to master 1000 postures just get the basics rights. (i'd go so far as to say that for me, a \"yoga teacher\" label doesn't mean much after seeing all this. It's also sort of an ego trap, we aren't gurus. If I want to further my practice I'll ask my guru in the tradition I have chosen. I have no right to think that I can teach no matter my experience.) And I totally side with you regarding deities, yantras, malas etc. The use of those should come with basic respect, some rules and understanding of what it means. And don't get me started on beer yoga, goat yoga etc. I know it's been a debate already but yeah. It's just not yoga.\n\nIf it wasn't for the \"commercialization\" of yoga in the West, I never would have recovered from anorexia. It helped me to understand and love my body.  What a gift it is and all the amazing things it can do.  I understand what you are saying, but I love it so much that I use yoga as it was traditionally meant to be practiced---meditatively. Take was serves you and leave the rest. Namaste\n\nThank you for saying this!!!I think about this all the time\n\nYes there is a lot of appropriation in the west for sure, with money being the main desire for many.  Add beer and wine yoga, which is plenty around me and its a total bastardization. Its fine if people dont want any spiritual aspects of yoga and just want the physical, nothing wrong with that. But appropriation/bastardization of yoga just for aesthetics is wrong.\n\nAre you from India? I have a big Ganesha statue made from stone at home I bought as we moved it. It stands on the ground next to the entrance door - is that appropriate or insultive?\n\nAs long as you respect it; it is appropriate. You will find many Ganesha statues outside the main temple or garbagriha(sanctum sanctorum) too at the entrance because Lord Ganesha, also known as Vighnaharta (remover of obstacles), is traditionally worshipped first before any rituals or ceremonies are performed. :)\n\nWe’ll said. Thanks.\n\nI just do yoga for the physical aspect since I find it challenging and beneficial; I originally started it because I wanted to improve my mobility and flexibility for kendo.\n\nMy mats are bare of any designs so I don’t have a horse in that race, but you seriously need to get over the fact that some people just don’t care for the spiritual aspect. I don’t care about honoring yoga’s essence, I just wanted the physical perks that comes with yoga.\n\nI am not asking anyone to follow the spiritual aspect of it. I am only asking people to be respectful because it does carry the legacy and spirit of its origins. \n\nUsing these sacred symbols in a commercial context can be seen as disrespectful and as misappropriation of someone's culture. \n\nIt makes me happy when someone says \"Yoga changed their life or it made them flexible\". I am all for happiness and health.\n\nYour reply is sane, but people on this thread refuse to acknowledge how much cultural entitlement these type of answers (comment you replied to) carry.\n\nWesterners in this thread are so absorbed in their defensiveness that they are unable to understand what you're talking about in the post. This so sad and ignorant on their part. So many mentions of 'Yoga for me' , 'My kind of Yoga' , well it's evident that it's their kind of Yoga that they practice looking at the lack of Understanding of the post or Acknowledgement in the comments.\n\nwhy do something you have no respect for. you need to get over yourself instead of telling OP to.\n\nYou cannot force anyone to see as you see, but you can choose to reframe from love. I like to imagine each of these gods, goddesses and the like would be ecstatic at the chance to support (as a yoga mat) the feet of one who has committed their time to practice, whether it be in pursuit of physical strength, self reflection, or something else.\n\nThe reason they were chosen to adorn the mat or the floor doesn't matter - show your respect in whatever way you desire, but refrain from casting those involved out of your heart. To me, this is yoga.\n\nYoga is not affiliated with any religion. Hinduism came after the first texts on yoga. The only mention of any deity in yoga is in the yoga sutras (isvara) and Bhagavad Gita. Siddhartha Gautama The Buddha was a yogi and sannyasi. He taught people yoga philosophy. Now there is a whole religion based on his teachings. People have Buddha statues in their homes. I think we have to remember that we display the statues and art because the deities imbue us with their qualities and give us something to focus on when meditating. We first visualize the gross qualities of the deity, and slowly over time, the subtle qualities of the deity become apparent and we are infused. One of the most important tools of yoga is chanting mantra. I was taught Vedic chanting. When students first learn to chant mantra, we are not taught the meaning of the Sanskrit words. The meaning is already within us, and the more we chant, the more it reveals itself to us. Then later on when you have displayed some mastery of the mantra, the teacher will tell you the meaning. It penetrates on a much deeper level. All of my teachers from India, including TKV Desikachar, the son of Krishnamacharya, taught us this way. We had a great statue of Patanjali in the garden at our school, and each day before class we would touch the statue at the feet or heart. When we study the Bhagavad Gita, we begin with a prayer to the great teacher, Krishna. These are all practices taught by our teachers who were taught by theirs for hundreds of years. If we incorporate aspects of Hinduism into our practice with reverence, it is not to disrespect anyone’s religion. We were taught to revere the beliefs of others. I hope you can see after this long post that not all yoga students and teachers are the same. We are all just trying to move from the external to the internal.\n\nAnd way before Siddhartha Gautama The Buddha; Lord Shiva is the ultimate Yogi. Bhagavad Gitacirca (500-200 BCE) has a detailed exposition of yoga, including various forms such as Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Jnana Yoga. Buddhism was founded in the 6th century BCE. Rigveda(circa 1500-1200 BCE) and Madukya Upanishad(circa 800-500 BCE) talks about Yoga. Then we have Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (circa 200 BCE-400 CE) which have detailed descriptions of classical Yoga philosophy. In fact, many Hindu gods and goddesses are symbolically represented in various postures (asanas) dating back to the earliest civilizations. So please read a little before making such ignorant statements. Yoga is and will always be a part of Hinduism.\n\n&gt;Yoga is not affiliated with any religion. Hinduism came after the first texts on yoga. \n\nThis must be the dumbest statement on Yog made yet. Yog accepts every thought but it is and will be a Hindu practice.\n\nWhat texts are you talking about? AFAIK, yoga was first mentioned in the Rig Veda, which is a sacred Hindu text. Yoga is one of several branches of Hindu philosophy, it didn’t exist outside of religion historically.\n\nProbably unpopular opinion - these dieties more than likely don't care at all. It's rather a bunch of people who more than likely have never contacted these dieties themselves that care. \n\nTo my understanding, the whole point of yoga is to unite with the God force within yourself. And when doing so, realizing that we're all God, it's illogical really to put one thing against another, as we exist in an inclusive universe. \n\nIf there was one thing I don't like about the yoga community,  and I generally find much pleasure in this community, it's that there are a select few that are very tied to the idea of tradition. As if to say something is important because we've been doing it one way for so many years. Meanwhile we're here, we're now, God and dieties included. \n\nAny dieity worth their salt is more than likely smiling at you everytime you see them on your yoga mat, happy that you're connecting with your true being,  being who you are, and happy to guide you to a place of love in a way that suits you so long as your intention supports it. \n\nAnd it's about high time we stop this idea that any one group of people OWNS anything. In case no one has noticed it's pretty much only caused conflict for thousands of years. Sure India may have picked up on the idea of yoga but to then hold it against a group of people for how they choose to use the idea is a bit absurd. But its only of recent that I was introduced to the idea that our thoughts are not our OWN , but rather a representation of the frequency on which we are. So in that sense no human is creating anything per se. Rather tapping into infinite potential of things that already exist.\n\nSo ultimately at the end of the day it's your problem if you don't like the way other people treat what you consider to be your religion, culture , God's. Etc. In the same way it's our responsibility to care about other people's opinions of ourselves. If your religion is so great why does it demand people bow to it? That's not free will. Be weary of any god that demands from you - but appreciate it all nonetheless \n\nEdit- it's our responsibility to decide if we care what others think of us. To demand feel a certain way about our own being is unwise. To come to a place of knowing your own worth and validating yourself will bring to you people who will value and hold you worthy in your life. And those who do not will not appear in your experience. And that's totally okay !\n\nAnd I suppose if any one diety would like a discussion with me about this subject I'm all ears.\n\nAt no point I talked about owning anything. It was all about misappropriation and disrespect. I am sorry I cannot change facts or the truth that it did originate in India and is part of Hinduism. \n\nYes Yoga did evolve over time and it is great that it is helping people with so many things - be it mindfulness, flexibility or strength. \n\nMy religion does not demand anyone to bow. There is not a single chapter in Hindu holy books that talks of evangelism, conversion, or the wraths if you do not bow. You can be an atheist and still be a Hindu. You can never visit a temple and still be a Hindu. It is so much more than that. It never talks of harming an animal either. You are misinterpreting my words.\n\nIf it's not your religion then it's YOU demanding they bow and respect. \n\nYoga is not a part of Hinduism id say it's almost more logical to say Hinduism is a part of yoga for it is the uniting of mind, body ,and spirit which is all their is. Though yoga is just one of the practices to get you there. \n\nAlternatively it's your belief that things or actions are disrespectful when they, in themselves, are not disrespectful. If I get a yoga mat with the sun printed on it is it me disrespecting the sun? Of course not. Or rather, it only is if I'm doing it as an act of disrespect.\n\nIDK man, you are reaching. No one is meaning to purposely disrespect anything by putting Buddah or Ganesh on a mat. \n\nI don't really care to look to be upset.\n\nIt’s not reaching to be upset at someone monetising your culture while disrespecting it in big and obvious ways.\n\nHmmm\n\nI think people would get worked up about the face of Jesus on a mat. Or like, a crucifixion scene.\n\nSo I get it. \n\nThat said, I have never come across any deities or religious iconography on a yoga mat. I might feel a little 'ew' if I did but I'm surrounded by offensive/mindless shit on a routine basis and I can only shake my fist at the sky about so many things.\n\nIf I saw the face of Jesus on a yoga mat I would laugh, but I'm sort of an asshole.\n\nI'm going to release a line of mats with JC or Mohammed on them, and let's test how far OP is \"reaching\"?\n\nMy mom, a devout Christian, would love to have a Jesus themed yoga mat if she did yoga\n\nTurin shroud as early yoga mat!\n\nGood on your mum. But a lot of fundos aren't so chill.\n\nI agree with everything you said. The only thing I want to note is your mention of Yoga being rooted in Indian tradition, Yoga is rooted in South Asian tradition (including modern day India of course!) and traces its history all over South Asia, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and more. As a fellow south Asian practitioner I often times feel excluded when it’s referred to as purely Indian when actually there’s a rich yogic tradition and history from all over South Asia.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe modern day country of India does not have the same borders as ancient India - especially not the same borders as ancient India circa 500 BCE-500 C …. So yeah you don’t get to claim that.\n\nThere is exactly zero to be done about the lack of nuance, knowledge, or sensitivity that surrounds us.\n\nWe carry it too; we all lack nuance in ways we don't see, can't imagine knowledge that we don't already possess, and step on other people's toes and sensitivities on a regular basis. \n\nAll we can do is our best and hope for grace and understanding, and hope for that for others too.\n\nMy mother has a little sculpture in her garden that is Mickey Mouse with an American flag. People defile the American flag on a regular basis these days (when I was growing up, we were taught how the flag should be displayed and retired and etc. etc. I couldn't give a shit, but we were actually taught how to respectfully treat the flag). But now you can stick it in Mickey's hand and slap any damn color you want on it and declare that the US flag exists to...support...cops? I guess? \n\nWe're two steps away from a Flamin' Ranch Doritos American flag. Seriously, replace those stars with Cheetos and we're set.\n\nWhat I am saying is, I guess, that we decide what's sacred as individuals and how we act, ourselves, as individuals, not getting ourselves worked up over other people's sensibilities because they are infinitely inscrutable and almost never to our tastes or values.\n\nAnd that is really, really difficult. \n\nLet it go.\n\nYou don’t have Americans in large numbers crying and being concerned that the bad energy has been brought when the flag I displayed wrong. That’s not the case with deities. Just don’t do it. Know everyone here knows so stop.\n\nAre you mad at ignorance? The fact that yoga is here in the west at all is positive - statues don’t need to be placed anywhere special to be revered - getting upset that a statue/image is on the floor is similar to buying into upper/lower class/caste - practicing yoga in the front row middle part of the room is just as good as off to the sides and the back.  These things don’t matter unless you make them matter.  Don’t oppress yourself.\n\nhow does that buy into lower/upper caste, do you know what you're talking about? these things do matter and if they don't to you, why are you engaging with yoga qt all?\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes well I take a shower before practice for the same reason. I don’t have a matt with any of the gods on it. But if I did I would not feel a yoga practice on it is disrespectful to them if done right. If we did these things in a real Hindu temple they would be disrespectful sure. I think the gods would jsut be delighted someone is showing them attention is this horribly commercialized world. Or at least using them as a navigation aid in seeking growth. \n\nUnfortunately we live in capitalism and everything is being appropriated and commodified. I suggest find what works for you. I am certain there are people in India who also disrespect the tradition. Like there are other cultures we are uneducated about (there are many examples all over the world, first thing that comes to mind are Kimonos that are worn as part of tradition in Japan for weddings, tea ceremonies etc, but you can see half naked people on the beach wearing them). \nJust relax and accept what it is, search for your tribe and vibe and life gets much easier.\n\nOkay...\n\nOk…Think about something you care about and wouldn’t want to be stepped on and commercialized. The way you feel is the same as OP. It’s called empathy.\n\nMy okay was pondering all OP said, but go ahead and interpret how you want.  \nMake sure you stretch next time, you might pull a muscle next time you reach that hard into thinking \"okay\" is conveying non empathy.\n\nThe Virgin Mary, the Swastika, Native American Dream Catchers,  Voodoo dolls, The Chinese Dragon etc. \n\nWhen cultures merge stuff gets used in non traditional ways. No culture is ‘safe’.  Whining about the inevitable is a choice.\n\nInstead of writing an essay about your disappointment while simultaneously giving money to the system you’re complaining about (under the original concept you’d be practicing for free on a dirt floor somewhere in India and probably not posting about the experience on Reddit. Way to pick and choose what’s acceptable) maybe you could reflect on how the expansion of these cultural icons could empower folks to learn more about their origins. At least people are moving thier bodies and attending to their needs in a healthy way. \n\nGatekeeping ancient deities after a few classes is a wierd flex.\n\nIndians would laugh at your interpretation.\n\n&gt; Indians would laugh at your interpretation.\n\nConsidering that a large percentage of the posts in this sub of this nature are from Indian practitioners, this isn't an accurate blanket statement. And in a lot of ways, that's the rub; those who do care pose their opinion as a representation of the whole, and quite often those who don't do, too. It makes it nearly impossible for those who *are* trying to be respectful to get it 'right', if there is such a thing.\n\nI do it to 1.) Stay in shape.  2.) Try and stay flexible.  3.) Have a small degree of medication and personal reflection.  \n\nThat’s it.  It’s not more complicated than that for me.\n\nIt’s symbolism, it is your thoughts of division that creates violence.\n\nWell said.\n\nI fundamentally agree about being respectful with cultural goods. But I also simultaneously find it sad that we take religion so serious in this world. Wish we'd be more chill with it and using its motifs.\n\nOne day, there won't be any high and mighty posts about the evils of western yoga in this sub...join me in manifesting it\n\nHi all, yoga is by definition the exploration and betterment of self through purposeful mindfull concious appreciation of yourself, how you function, coordinate function, develop the energy that feed us. To become one with yourself body mind and soul and the universal concience.  Anything less is but a step on the journey. For some that is enough for many more it is the start of a lifelong journey of development and concious exploration.\n\nWe are all different and have different paths to follow. Different needs and different expectations but there is only one goal to become one with yourself. It behoves us all to respect the needs of others and their individual paths with concious empathy and consideration, living in harmony.\n\nNamaste\n\nThe yoga studios I’ve attended do not have the deities in or out of the studio. If anything, they’re more hippie/eclectic. I don’t care either way, i just want to practice and move on with my day.\n\nIt's just exercise of the body and mind\n\nYes. I’m gonna go there. Get off your yoga high horse and stop judging people that use yoga as exercise. There’s nothing wrong with people using yoga as exercise. You take out of it what you want and expecting all that practice to adhere to the spirituality is absurd. You seriously can not expect people that honor a religion they participate in to give that up for yoga.\n\n[removed]\n\nHave you tried not worrying about it? Go practice some yoga and you’ll forget all about it.\n\nWell, to be honest i wouldn't call most of yoga studios to do yoga, so, althought they do apply some of the phylosophy, most of them only do the asanas which is also fantastic and healthy for body and mind but i feel that the potential and benefits of  the yoga itself  are being lost and ridiculized in the west, where yoga is being treated as other activities to earn money and have a lot marketing. Thats its what i would say that disrespect yoga... \n\nOff the topic, yoga appeared before hinduism but greatly influenced this one, same as budism.so its not a religión like we all know nor part of It, its a system wich main goal is to \"unify yur soul with the supreme concience\" -micro with the macro- is that being said. Thats being said i think that the spiritual practices of hinduism are the closest one to yoga by far. althought there are the cath and islam mysticisms that have some similarities that whe should have in consideration\n\nExcuse my english\n\nWow, either you have never read facts or any of these books or you don't care and that's alright but please read them before saying imaginary things.\n\nYoga is and always will be an integral part of Hinduism; it is Hinduism that gave the world the concept of Yoga. Hinduism(1500 BC) is so vast and extensive. There is Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana. There are 4 Vedas out of which one talks about Yoga. There are 108 Upanishads out of which two talk about Yoga. Then there are Smrities, 3 Puranas, Tantras, Agamas, Nigamas, 9 darshanas.\n\nI have already replied somewhere but I will reiterate the facts here : Bhagavad Gita (circa 500-200 BCE) has a detailed exposition of yoga, including various forms such as Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Jnana Yoga. Rigveda(circa 1500-1200 BCE) and Madukya Upanishad(circa 800-500 BCE) talks about Yoga. Then we have Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (circa 200 BCE-400 CE) which have detailed descriptions of classical Yoga philosophy.\n\nIslam(7th century CE) and Budhism (5th century BCE) however aren't even that old. and I have read these and I know they have no similarities to Yoga or the teachings of Yoga. The word Yog itself is mentioned only in Hindu scriptures.\n\nI think it’s important to separate the religious practice from the fitness/exercise practice. I do “yoga”several times a week as part of my fitness routine. But I’m an atheist who thinks organized religions are bullshit. Yoga as word has lost meaning or rather, accumulated many meanings. In the end your religious practice is a personal matter and what others do should be of no concern.\n\nWhat does yoga teach us about judgement of others? What does it teach us about allowing things to get us annoyed? Are you watching your thoughts and your reactions? What's behind these? What's your agenda? It's very normal for us humans to look for ways in which we are superior to others - even though this is always an illusion. Maybe this is what is going on here?\n\nDo you think Shiva cares if a yoga mat has their face on it? Isn't Shiva themselves the mat, the studio and everything around you?

Specially after a long week doing lots of computer work, I always get the most satisfying little upperback crack :)\n\nHow did you train to get to this point? Would love to practice!!\n\nThis has taken me years and I’ve constantly changed my practice and adjusted so it’s hard to say specifically, but in general you need:\n\n- solid foundations in general, before exploring deep stuff you should be comfortable on your mat.\n\n- a strong, fluid and flexible back that bends in all directions (passive and active cobras, locust, wheel, spinal waves, folds, twists, etc)\n\n- solid core (plank, boat, etc)\n\n- strong and flexible hip flexors and quads (active and passive lunges, splits, camel)\n\n- consistently working on shoulder mobility (shoulder flossing, puppy pose, etc)\n\n- taking the time to learn the mechanics of backbends and how to breathe\n\n- lots of patience and knowing you can absolutely do it but it will take time :)\n\nI think I’d have to flex my upper back that much just to stand up straight!\n\nFair play it’s so impressive\n\nThank you :)\n\nSo incredible!! I dream to have back and shoulder mobility like this one day\n\nThank you! Just put in the work, and little by little, time and practice brings depth :)\n\nThank you!! So inspiring 💗\n\nAmazing. Well done 🙌\n\nThanks 🙏🏽✨\n\nBeautiful back bend. Great job.\n\nThank you :)\n\nWHOA. I dream to one day be able to just *approach* what you're doing here. I'm currently working on what I would consider to be mild spinal extension. I feel very strong/uncomfortable compression when laying on the ground with a rectangular bolster going across my lumbar area.\n\nOuch\n\n[deleted]\n\nThanks for your concern 🙏🏽 It doesn’t feel extreme when you work your way up to it slowly and consciously. I’m working towards full wheel pose :)"

I would much rather sacrifice a little sleep and see how that helps. Thank you for the inspiration, I really needed it.\n\nUpdate: I did 3 rounds of sun salutations, some triangle, some boat, and hung out in down dog for awhile this morning after getting the kids on their buses and before having to leave for work. It’s certainly a start. Thank you again.\n\nHow did you get the motivation?  I really have a hard time with a solo practice.   Paying for it forces me to go to class\n\nSet it all up for yourself in advance. If you're shooting for morning - set the space up the day before, pick out the sequence/video you're doing, and set out what you're wearing if you're not wearing your PJs. That way you're rolling out of bed and immediately going to practice, you're not spending time dealing with setting up to practice.\n\nI also find it's really helpful for me to set my alarm early in the day the day before. If I wait until I'm going to bed, I'm thinking about how I'm tired and I just want to sleep in. If I set it early in the day, when I'm thinking, \"I'd like to get up and exercise tomorrow morning\" -- it's set and done and I don't look at it before bed.\n\nKnow that it's discipline more than motivation at first. There are going to be mornings where you just don't really feel like it. You just need to make yourself. Some practices will be better than others, that's okay. Just practice.\n\nWrite Down exact time and place when and where you are going to practice it. \n\ninitially you can start by searching a guided meditation for 15 minutes. it's long enough to give you an idea what to do.\n\nour brains don't take anything uncertain seriously.\n\nMake an Appointment with yourself.\n\nYoga with Adrienne on YouTube is fantastic\n\nThis! I struggle so much with this. Having a session I have to go to really holds me accountable.\n\nDaily yoga (started during Covid) is literally life-changing.  I do the 30-day challenges so I don't have to think about which video tp start, and they are usually 20-30 mins. I love Yoga with Adrienne, but there are tons of options. \n\nReally gets my head on straight for the day :&gt;)\n\nI have ADHD and yoga has done wonders for me. Just the fact that I go to class and can’t bring my phone into the studio so I’m without the distraction brick for an hour is huge.\n\nDamn, inspiring!\n\nI started home Yoga 1 year ago. Life changing. I  like Sara Beth Yoga and Yoga with Adrienne.\n\nWoke up at 3:45 this morning and it’s now almost 5 and can’t sleep. Usually go do cardio near this time but this has motivated me to do some yoga\n\n💙\n\nUpdate: I did a short yoga video and it felt good to stretch and relax into postures in the morning. I love cardio, but it was nice starting my day slower and more peacefully. I am now at work and feel that calmness carry over 😊\n\nThat's awesome. I hope it carries over for you as long as possible.\n\nYoga has been one of the most positive things in my life recently, after being diagnoses with ADHD 4 months ago. I'm glad others are finding it helps them too!\n\nWoah! I’ve been doing yoga so long sometimes I forgot how powerful it’s effect can be and are. So beautiful, thanks for sharing\n\nDo you have a certain video/class you like to do? I was loving doing morning yoga, but started to struggle with repetition/boredom.\n\nAdriene all day. The simplicity and accessibility of her videos are perfect for me.  I am by no means an expert so the way she does things works perfect for my skill level.\n\nAwesome! I did her 30 day yoga challenge for January, but then fell out of the routine. I loved that all of the videos were right around 20 minutes\n\nTana Yoga on YouTube is great too. With my ADHD sometimes I have to switch up online instructors to stay interested\n\nYes! \n\nOne week into resuming a morning practice (via Tim Senesi online - plenty on YouTube but finally subscribed and am doing a 30 day detox series), including moments of reading Rolf Gates’ “Meditations from the Mat” and a brief prayer after. \n\nGrounding to last the entire day!\n\nADHD medication and daily yoga is the most mentally healthy i have ever been in my life, together they are such a combination 🙏\n\nThis is what I needed to see this morning…..my ADHD has been so bad lately and I haven’t been keeping up. Thanks :)\n\nI really needed to hear this today. Thank you. I’ll be taking time for myself.\n\nThanks for this great reminder 💛\n\nI often do alternate nostril breathing on the way to work to quiet my mind as well\n\nThank you for this reminder. I really need to get back into morning practices again!\n\nI also cannot recommend night practices enough. Best sleep of my life, always\n\nWhat kinda practice do you focus on? Do you have a routine?\n\nI follow Adriene's videos and tailor them to whatever I want to work on or whatever's sore or needs attention - hips, back, neck and core are the most common ones for me.\n\n👏🏼"

    "all_comment_text": "This happens to me ALL the time. Thought I was the only one\n\nYes, same! I’ve had multiple instructors offer an assist, watching me struggle to get my toes into the crook of my elbow in mermaid. But inevitably if I go all the way my hamstring seizes up. It’s a relief to know I’m not alone.\n\nMe too! But only on the left side, never on the right.\n\nMe three!  There were a few times I wanted to yelp in pain but held it in.\n\nYeah that’s the crip side\n\nMe too, but it would be good to know what to do about it. So what is the solution?\n\nMe too! I’m pretty flexible in other poses but I just can’t do this one without an insane cramp.\n\nSame here! We need a club.\n\nI did that exact practice yesterday and had exactly the same experience, more so with my left hamstring\n\nSweet Benji.\n\nBenji is my favorite.\n\nI was really hoping this was the top comment. I really think I just watch Adrienne’s videos for Benji at this point\n\nI would die for that dog\n\nI got a heeler because of Benji. My heeler is not like Benji😆\n\nMy blue heeler ate my yoga mat. She should aspire to be more like Benji \n\nhamstring is likely a little underdeveloped, doing some warm-ups like heel raises to the glutes can help get blood into the hamstring before the stretch. Also being hydrate with enough electrolytes can help reduce cramping/Charlie horse\n\nOk good tips!  Thanks!\n\nThis is not necessarily true. When stretching the quads (agonist), the hamstrings (antagonist) naturally have to contract a little to make room. This can cause spasm or cramp. It doesn’t mean the hamstrings are weak.\n\nI’m glad to read this because my legs are strong from lots of dancing etc and I get cramps when I do this too\n\nI’m a body worker and anatomy nerd lol.. I promise your cramping muscles don’t indicate weakness :)\nedit: silly grammar\n\nI was going to say--my hamstrings are not weak\n\nThis! I used to have this same issue EVERY TIME I did yoga and that type of pose. Now I work out my lower body and it never happens.\n\nMaybe because you have to contract your hamstrings to bring your heel towards your seat? Happens to me as well sometimes.\n\nPointed foot always makes me cramp in these positions if not properly warmed up. Flexed foot and holding the ankle is gentler on the hamstring, so I will just do that if it’s mid flow and won’t stop cramping.\n\nYoga does a ton of hamstring stretching and not a lot of hamstring strengthening.\n\nHamstring strengthening poses:\n- warrior A, B\n- extended side angle\n- rotated side angle \n- chair \n- wheel\n- bridge \n- camel\n\nWhile these poses do strengthen hamstrings, they're not often done under reps or lengthy amounts of time in yoga classes so the effects are minimal. It's better to cross train the hamstrings outside of yoga. Especially for things like wheel, most yoga classes don't prep the average student to safely or correctly do this pose.\n\n1000000x. Adding in tabletop glute/hamstring strengthening will be a game changer.\n\nThink simple, effective movements - leg lifts, hamstring curls, fire hydrants. 60-90 seconds each.\n\nDamn, something just clicked for me .. i get calf cramps in tabletop.. i think it’s because my hammies and glutes are so weak that im compensating in other places. I really want to start cross-training and these exercises are helpful, thank you. Trying to avoid “yoga butt”\n\nMakes sense! I had yoga butt two years ago and it was fucking awful. lol my butt / hammies were so weak bc of chronic illness that they became atrophied! I love myself a good forward fold but ohhh my god it was awful! Hated them that summer.\n\n\nTuck your toes in TT and shift weight back and forth, it will help. You can also point and flex through your foot/circle your ankle around to send a little more red blood cells /oxygen to the area (thus alleviating the cramp).\n\nI also like to use my opposite shin/knee as a foam roller/massage ball into the back of the calf that’s on the floor. HURTS SOOOO GOOD.\n\nETA if 713 is your bday…just saying great week to have a birthday! Happy early one.\n\nHey that’s what my teacher just told me the other day! To start tucking my toes in TT. She said i could also experiment with putting my hands on blocks (i have long legs and less so arms lol). \n\nBy shifting back and forth, do you mean from right to left, like “wagging my tail”? Or do you mean forward and back like so i stretch the sole of my foot and the tendons there? I guess i should do both. Thank you.\n\nVery cool to hear you found relief. My practice has brought me a lot of relief from neck &amp; back pain.. now i am focusing on the work to make it sustainable for my body in the long-run😊. \n\nBtw i had never heard of Katonah, that looks right up my alley! And im right by NY!!\n\nThe username is kind of embarrassing.. in harry potter the sorcerer’s stone was stored in gringotts vault 713 🤣🤣🤣 i made this account a long time ago .. but i think it could be an auspicious number in terms of numerology? 7+1+3=11 and that sounds like it could be something special LOL i digress but anyway thank you:)\n\nI need to do these and shoulder strengthened for a winged scapula so badly but I cannot yet bring myself to 😭\n\nI dunno I do plenty of other stuff that strengthens hamstrings and I inevitably have the same thing with my right hamstring in this pose.\n\nGotta strengthen those hammies\n\nNot going to post a litany of lift totals to r/yoga but I promise you that weak hamstrings are not the issue here\n\nHamstrings and quads are antagonists of each other - they have reciprocal relationships. \nIf the hamstrings are cramping with hip flexor stretching, try to lightly contract the antagonist (hip flexors/quads). This means isometrically (without movement) contracting the foot into the hand (resisting knee extension).\n\nInteresting, will try this\n\nIt works very well! I use it on my clients at work if they are experiencing spasm/cramping. Generally if a muscle cramps… contract the opposite muscle! So, another example, if the calf is cramping, resist the foot moving upwards to contract Tib Ant! (Toes moving towards nose).\n\nThx!\n\nHad to google a Charley horse! (I’m British)\n\nDo you have a different name for it, or do you just call it a cramp?\n\nI would just say cramp, yeah\n\nMe too 😆\n\nI would work on this without the foot grab first. Root the big toe mound of your left foot into the mat and avoid dumping into the out edge. Lift from the pelvic floor. Raise the heart and straighten the back. Engagement will help you avoid too much pressure on the hamstrings.\n\nI teach this pose all the time and always preface it with, if you get a hamstring cramp, do this: split stance stretch (basically pyramid pose, release the foot and straighten legs to stretch hamstrings).\n\nIt's super common to get a hamstring cramp if you have tight hamstrings / quads (which is the case for most ppl) bc your hamstring is activating/flexing/engaging to lift the back foot. As soon as you get your foot in your hand, try to relax your hamstring and let the arm do the work.\n\nCould help to stretch hamstring beforehand. Also using a block under the front palm to give you a boost.\n\nIt's a great pose for targeting several problem areas, and it's an intense stretch! Be patient with yourself, and on days it doesn't work out, choose a different quad stretch like standing up with one hand on a wall and the other hand reaching back for your foot. Good luck!\n\nYUP. It honestly didn’t get better until I started strengthening my legs more.\n\nNot related but I LOVE her videos !!\n\nI typically have to release my hamstrings first before doings this pose. This pose uses the whole body, and a lot of the body is supported or connected by to hamstrings, which are large muscles. So if they're tight, this position is difficult for me, personally. It also could be due to tight hip flexors, which most of us have every day from normal activity. One way to release tight hip flexors is by getting on a foam roller and simply holding on it for 15-30 secs in each hip flexor. Then try this pose. Also, a modification is to do this pose where you can put your foot on a couch, yoga ball, or couch. :)\n\nI relate and i also love Adrienne and Benji 💖 idk if id call it a charlie horse but i get a weird shocky static type feeling right above my knee on the lunging leg (not the leg im grabbing) and idk why cause it only happens on the left leg when its the lunging leg 🤷‍♀️ \n\ni just figured despite having lost 60lbs since im still kind of heavyset (working on loosing more fat cause im 199lbs and a size 16 also i have short limbs and im 5'4\") and i think maybe having some extra...tissue...lol around the leg and hip area is causing a pinched nerve when im doing this pose\n\nAlso  i wonder if my extra tissue is what gets in the way of me being able to put my feet on the ground in plow pose or if its a flexability issue\n\nOmg I get that too! I get the staticy shock thing in warrior poses too. I think it’s a nerve thing from the nerve being pinched in the hip. I haven’t found a solution though 😞\n\nMe too, and I lift all the time, so it’s likely not because my hamstrings are underdeveloped (my quads are dominant to my hamstrings, and my upper body develops faster than my lower body generally, but it’s not like I’m sedentary or high body fat). I’ve been working on active flexibility drills to reduce the shock on the muscle (bringing heel towards butt in a lunge and then lowering slowly) but sometimes it still happens.\n\nI struggled with this as well… and I either became for flexible or I learned how to get there in a better way. How you move to get there … matters.\n\nGirl me too. I have nerve damage in my leg and cannot even attempt the pose without immediately going into full Charlie horse mode. I don't even try anymore\n\nSAME!\n\nEVERY\n\nFUCKING\n\nTIME\n\nAre you warmed up?\n\nYes I think so. I just follow the yoga lesson/video prepared by the pro\n\nTry foam rolling the hip flexors before going into the pose!\n\nFor me, the reason is bc my hamstrings are tight as heck. Back off the pulling, you need to stretch and work on hamstring flexibility.\n\nIt can’t be hamstring flexib. The move is contracting the hamstring\n\nCute heeler!!!\n\nThis happens to me sometimes too! Does anyone else also get foot cramps/spasms during yoga?\n\nDehydration\n\nThis one hurts my knee a bit for some reason. Hamstring is usually okay.\n\nIt's best not to do a pose which creates pain after you release it. There are lots of excellent ways to open the front body to get you ready for this advanced pose. Working on the hip area in general will help but I'll focus on the hip flexors.\n\nYou can do a lunge with your back foot flat on the mat to loosen the hip flexors. Your front foot position is good where it is in your picture. Moving it forward can trigger a protective tightening of the front hamstring, which may also give you a charley horse. Work to stack your torso directly above your hips in the lunge. This can take some practice, but it's worth giving yourself the time to fully realize a pose before moving on to a more challenging one. \n\nCamel variations also open the front body as a whole and relax the hamstrings. Start with your hands on your lower back and apply light pressure to move your hips forward. That helps to avoid dumping the back bend  into your lumbar region. As you become more comfortable with back bends in camel the bend should be in the area at the bottom of your ribcage. With any front body stretch small increments can lead to a lot of sensation so it's most productive to stay at a point which is challenging but where you can hold onto your breath. Consistency is more productive than intensity.\n\nPsoas stretches can also help the front body to release. My favorite for this is to lay on my belly, put one leg out 90 degrees and feel the deep stretch on the inside of the opposite pelvis. This can go all the way into your lower back. If this is comfortable you can very gently push your chest off the floor, tuck your toes, or bend the outstretched knee to lightly engage the hamstring. No need to push it as psoas stretches can be very intense and a little goes a long way.\n\nEnjoy your time doing yoga regardless of how much you look like the super bendy practitioners you may see. Yoga is great for the mind and acceptance of where you are while maintaining breath is a big part of that.\n\nWeak muscles at peak contraction\n\nI would probably put on some muscle relaxer cream on that  spot before I worked that spot. Your also mentally bracing your self for the Charlie horses.   So your body is already in a fight or flight  mode.  So a drop of med, will make it easier to relax into the position.. just an idea...\n\nyou can not do this pose without charlie horse\n\nYou need to stretch 'the opposite' - my guess is you need to stretch your quads with a nice seated forward bend. I hope that helps!\n\nDehydrated, no salt, lack of regular stretching g. Been there done that it hurts !\n\nHad to google charley horse .. great expression .\n\nTry grabbing from the ankle so the foot still has freedom to move and flex. Helps me. \n\nLoL! I'll try!  I usually get nowhere near my ankle before my hamstring is all cramped up\n\nUse a strap and keep your foot flexed or loosely free and able to move before you start going into it. \n\nSometimes when I cramp up I quickly escape into a skandasana, and then pop back into the pose you posted. Doing that twice is usually the trick for me and the it all relaxes. \n\nOn the other hand, if this movement just doesn’t work for you than that’s just an opportunity to find peace with that. Luckily there are very few situations in life that require us to grab one foot while in a deep lunge lol. \n\nThank you. I appreciate you.\n\nBecause you're going too far maybe\n\nCramping in the muscle when you are using it is uncomfortable or even painful but not bad.  It means the muscles are trying to work but doesn’t really know how to fire. Strengthening your hamstrings will help.\n\nI don't think strengthening in general makes much a of a difference. When I started yoga I could go very heavy on RDL's and deadlift 2x bodyweight but any hip flexor stretch like this would send my legs into full on spasm.\n\n\nFor me it got better by just easing into it over a period of time, pushing through the uncomfortableness on some days and backing off on other days. Also finding ways to really gently ease into it such as raising the knee or finding an easier variation.\n\nYup, same here\n\nLooks like you’re pronating your foot, probably just enough to get that Charlie horse in the left hamstring? Or are you experiencing pain in the right one?\n\nTry to keep the foot flat on the ground, and before you move in to this stretch do a couple half splits. If the problem persists, as you exit this pose going into a full half splits with a forward fold, breathe into and let the hamstring lengthen.\n\nA strap will help reduce the over stretching, causing your charlie horses. Also drink more water.\n\nUh you see the the top left flipper grabbing the bottom right big flipper? Ya that’s why. Not gonna lie I might do this during a yin class. I’m gonna hard swerve during a yang flow. Them Charlie’s suck. I’m 20 years in just still not flexie with hammies. \n\nIt’s not about lacking muscle. I work pretty serious squats every week…still get this. Always wondered why\n\n  \nOnce I release the pose for a second and go back, it’s gone. Very odd\n\nYou need more potassium in your diet.\n\nI eat a banana or two every day amongst other fruit and vegetables. Do I really need more potassium? I'm surprised by that\n\nI’d have your bloodwork checked. Sometimes people have deficiencies for other reasons like a malfunctioning thyroid or other health concern. \n\nAvocados are actually better sources of potassium than bananas. :)\n\nI had it checked about half a year ago and all was well. My energy is great and I have no pain except when I do this pose and my hamstring cramps up. I suppose I could get it checked again but that seems a bit extra for my circumstances."

    "body": "I’ve been a lifelong weightlifter who transitioned to yoga about a year and a half ago. \n\nIf you looked at me you’d say he’s strong but I’ve never felt so weak as when I started yoga, but now I feel stronger than ever (except when attempting a handstand lol). Yoga is a different type of strength that I never experienced before and I love it. I’m more flexible and feel so much more solid. It’s hard to explain, but I can imagine all of you out there know what I mean. \n\nI feel so much stronger and my body feels balanced like never before. I can see how unbalanced my body had become from years of weightlifting. My arms and shoulders don’t rotate as much as they should and my hips are incredibly stiff and inflexible from years of deadlifts and squats. \n\nWhat’s most humbling is trying to do handstands of any form. I try to do the tripod version and god I feel so weak! My shoulders look cut and strong but nope, they can’t even hold me up when I try to handstand! They tire out immediately along with my forearms. They feel so useless and the opposite of strong :( I’m not rushing it and chipping away at it little by little. I have all the videos showing the technique just need to practice more and get yoga strong. \n\nThe plus side is I’ve lost so much weight. When I was weightlifting I was always as hungry as a bear and was always eating. Now I eat but much less and I look healthier than ever. My doctor was also so surprised by how trim I look. \n\nIt’s teaching me to have a mind and body connection and patience. For the first time in my life I’m conscious of my mind, body, spirit, and breathing. It’s amazing. \n\nCheers to yoga!",

    "all_comment_text": "thanks for articulating that. I M58, feel the same way.  the strength I get from yoga is core strength.  and yes, yoga really brings it all together.\n\nThat’s awesome! Yoga really brings a unique sense of strength and balance. It’s great that you’re embracing the journey, even through the challenges like handstands. The mind-body connection and patience yoga teaches are truly transformative—keep up the amazing work!\n\nWell balanced practice touches all physical psychological emotional aspects. Yoga is the shit\n\nYes it makes me feel strong &amp; really improved my posture. I subscribe to the notion that people who practice yoga or pilates or the likes are a lot stronger than those who limit themselves to just weightlifting.  it’s a full body workout, breath work &amp; meditation all rolled into one and as  cliche, overused &amp; corny as it sounds it has been life changing.\n\nBreathwork is underrated in other activities. It has the importance of getting the job done of course. But the way the mind and body and breath comes together in yoga elevates any activity. I thank yoga for helping me deliver my baby quickly even though I had an epidural and couldn’t feel anything, I used my breath to connect to my body and only pushed for 45 minutes. \n\nSounds awesome! Agree on breathing being underrated on and off the mat. I wish I knew about yoga when I had my daughter almost 20 years ago but alas I’ve only been practicing since 2015 / 2016.\n\nIt's different kinds of strength. People who weightlift are gonna be better at weightlifting than others. People who do yoga and meditate will be better at that. I  don't think either are necessarily \"stronger\" than the other\n\nI don’t intend to brag, but I’m 71 years old, been doing yoga 31 years. i’m still working towards getting my hand stand off the wall, but I can do virtually any other inversion. Chaturanga, lolassana, boat, wheel, half moon, king of the dance, lotus, etc. Do some of these need work? You bet! But I’m still improving, feeling stronger, looking better, than I ever have.  I love my life! \nI don’t say all this to enjoy the ego, but instead as advice from the other side of age. Start yoga, don’t stop. Do it anywhere, any way, any time you can. When you’re my age you’ll thank your younger self every day. Enjoy.\n\nI remember, long ago, when my hips and pelvis just opened up from doing ashtanga.  It just clicked one day and it felt like my bones were floating in there.  If you know, you know. \n\nYou will not get big, but you will have strength in ways you never imagined if you keep at it.\n\nI know that feeling. It's amazing!! ❤️ Ashtanga!\n\nNice! I’ve been doing a 1 hr (or more) yoga class everyday for the past 2-months. This has also meant neglecting my weightlifting a bit more than I’d like. I got back to the bench press this morning after a two-week break. I thought my lifts would suffer but I did the same weight I had been doing for more reps, more easily this morning thanks to all the yoga! I was so surprised!\n\nThere is wild strength stuff in the yoga tradition... BKS Iyengar could do this plank/pushup thing where he sprang off the ground, hopping with his fingers or something.   Maybe not the best example.  In his main book he looks like a middle-aged guy with a paunch but when you see the pictures what he could do is mind blowing.\n\nYoga will take a strong person and make them ridiculous. Not only in wind but long and strong functional muscles.  The difference between trained and untrained is staggering.\n\nNever lifted weights or did any upper body work but after several years of ashtanga, I had a lot of upper body definition.\n\nNice! How long does your yoga session last a day or it varies but you're just consistent? 🤔\n\nIt’s been a while, but I went to mysore class 3x a week and practiced at home the other days.  Usually spent 1.5 to 2 hours per session.  Did this for five years or so.  Unfortunately developed spine issues in my neck and hips and had to stop.\n\nThank you for sharing your practice! I appreciate it.\n\nDo both.\n\nNothing humbles me more than yoga, but, nothing makes me feel stronger than picking 150kg off the floor \n\n¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nYoga compliments barbell lifts incredibly well.  It definitely gave me the mobility to do Zercher deadlifts and deep barbell squats.  Not to mention a high enough overhead press will definitely give you the confidence to do handstands even if you're a larger person.\n\nI wouldn't be where I am without Yoga. It's the first physical exercise I ever *enjoyed* and *wanted* to do. I still can't live without it. \n\nBut nothing has changed my health (physical and mental), my body, and my confidence more than a stable gym routine. \n\nGym is my primary focus, Yoga is my off day.\n\nI've also found that resilience has also carried over my immune system as I don't get nearly as sick as often as I did before I started practicing yoga consistently. Even when I come down with a cold/flu the symptoms and latency are reduced through a regular practice.\n\nI have heard this before. Supposedly from the twists moving your organs\n\nYes, I saw a few professional athletes on the mat on their back after 15 minutes in front of the 65 year old grandmother looking down on them with a certain pity. And BTW you do not need to do handstands. Or any other poses that you deem not your thing. I do not do crow for instance or headstand.\n\n28F I found yoga from a bodybuilding, powerlifting + CrossFit background - completely relate!!! SUCH a different kind of strength!\n\nSame here…not to mention it helps with the old injuries and arthritis\n\nThis is the post I needed to see tonight! Historically a weightlifter (although female) and then added running, until I had a moderately difficult pregnancy and shitty postpartum period. I stopped exercising altogether except for a daily walk. I started hot yoga 3 months ago. (Yoga, Barre, pilates etc depending on the class at a yoga studio). Tonight at vinyasa (Baptiste), I finally was able to do a wheel instead of a bridge! I came home to my husband and toddler with so much energy and excitement over my accomplishment even though it's such a small thing.\n\nThat's a big thing. Nice job! 👏🏼\n\nResonates with me! Not really a weightlifter but do and did some. The improved strength and balance from yoga is also very helpfull for high spinning background kicks and the like :-)\n\nYes, I've been doing yoga for 8 months and feel the same way. 6 years ago I was getting strong in the gym, but stopped since Covid and gained all my weight back. Now I feel stronger than I felt when I was in the gym, and noticeably slimmer, too. I'm also aiming for a handstand, but I think it's going to take a lot longer than I ever thought. I can do so much on my hands and one foot, but I still need that one foot for balance. Here's to years of fun :)\n\nWe love to have you in the yoga space. Yoga is definitely something that helps me to keep balance.\n\nI just started yoga. It's so frikin hard but in a different way. It frustrates me because I can't dothe basics. It feels weird because it doesn't look that hard. I'll keep doing it as a assistance to my mobility. I use down dog app on my phone.\n\nI felt YouTube was better for me as a beginner. I like to cast it to the TV so I’m not looking down at the phone or have to change my flow to look at what’s going on. \n\nYou get a lot mentally stronger too with Yoga 🧘🏻‍♀️ \nGood going ✨\n\nSame experience, the handstand will just happen one day, just like everything in yoga.\n\nYoga.....the revealer of muscles you didnt know you had. 😁\n\n\"flexibility is the foundation of strength\" is a meme which floated through my mind one day after reflecting how yoga impacted my life.  \n\nand as a fellow yogi once so succinctly pointed out, the moment the mind wanders, balance is lost.  once single pointedness of mind is regained, you can balance forever.\n\nYes regarding the balance comment! Experienced that today during a pose. Your comment reinforced this: \"once single pointedness of mind is regained, you can balance forever\".\n\nLove this :') cheers to yoga\n\nI believe in both weightlifting and yoga as a ying and yang that are great together."

Then i smoke two more.”\n\nTry smoking weed before smoking some weed, it's awesome as well /s\n\nSmoke 2 joint before I smoke 2 joints, and then I smoke 2 more\n\nWhat about during and after?\n\nUsername checks out\n\n💀\n\nI smoke two joints before I smoke 2 joints....\n\nIt really helps my weight training, particularly the mind/muscle connection.\n\nBut never at dusk.\n\nI love yoga but I *love* high yoga! It really allows me to be present and focus, dropping far deeper into my practice. I love the sensation of my breath creating space in my body, and I find I appreciate way more when I smoke beforehand, probably because I can notice it better by getting out of my head\n\nI also really dug it with the 80s hip-hop, I just need better speakers lol\n\nYou just like being high\n\nAnd who are you to judge my experience without being the one in my body to experience it?\n\nTwo things can be true simultaneously. Enjoyment of inebriation and appreciation of the lens it can color your experience with are not mutually exclusive.\n\nETA: For clarity, I take exception to your use of the word “just.” One can enjoy getting high and enjoy the perspective it gives them on an experience. Enjoyment of one does not negate the other.\n\n Beautifully put, and a great username 🤝🏻\n\nD’awww, thanks! Cats are pretty cool, too, especially if you prefer aloof independence over incessant neediness.\n\nSo does everybody. If you stay down on the ground your whole life, you'll never see what it's all about. Weed can get you high by itself, and Yoga can get you high by itself. \n\n\nWhy not combine and see where it can take you?\n\nYeah I used to do that. Not anymore, it became a crutch, I needed weed to want to do yoga. I love that I quit and love yoga again without needing a substance. \n\nNow yoga and breathwork and meditation get me \"high\" and that is awesome because it's free and it's legal and it's a healthy dependency.\n\nAs a lifelong pothead, I do not smoke weed and do yoga. I find that yoga gives me that relaxation but in a way that weed cannot. I love being clear headed but super relaxed.\n\nI literally just made this swap a few weeks ago. The question “do I need thc to do yoga?” popped into my head and I decided to figure that out. Turns out the answer is no and I enjoy it just the same! I’m still going to do yoga high sometimes but probably reserve it for the stretchy/yin type sessions. \n\nYears ago I asked myself the same question about eating and being high. Found myself unable to eat a meal unless I was high which is a huge issue. Took some effort, but I eat almost all of my meals sober now to never go back to that situation. \n\nI’m now asking myself the same questions about caffeine. Do I really need it or so I just think I do?\n\nsmoking weed to practice is not a bad thing - you’re not enlightened yet, so why expect your actions to be flawless? and even when you’re enlightened it doesn’t mean you won’t smoke anymore - just that you won’t NEED it\n\nI find that the connections I make when high and doing yoga come right back when I’m not high and doing yoga.  I don’t need it every time - yoga itself gets me ‘high’\n\nI do yoga on weed a lot of the time, but I am also addicted to weed in general, so I don’t feel comfortable recommending it to anyone lol\n\nIt is nice though…\n\nuntil it isn't\n\nThe right flower can make you hyper focused and aware.   To me, this goes hand and hand with yoga, since the intention is a quiet mind, and focus on the present.  In Indian mythology, both Yoga, and Cannabis were a gift from Shiva.   Even today, ganja is a holy sacrament for many of the dedicated shaivite sadhus.\n\nThis first sentence is key— the right weed! Ask a budtender at a dispensary theyll help you out!\n\nAmen, if you smoke the wrong strain, it can just as easily have you giggling uncontrollably on your mat, or wandering off to your fridge to get munchies, completely forgetting your yoga altogether 😺\n\nWeed is a hell of a drug\n\nThis is the answer. Weed makes me feel good doing anything -\n\nI love love LOVE weed before kundalini yoga and meditation . I find it really amplifies the ability to drop in and go super deep in your practice. Especially if you do a Jack herer for focus or Tropicana cookies for tapping into the creativity, it is GO TIME SHOWTIME. I also love weed before a run or bike ride.\n\nEditing to say - I’ll come back to you with a scientific reason 😂\n\nJack Herer before a yoga session…chef’s kiss!\n\nAs long as we're talking entheogens and sequencing, I experimented A LOT when I was younger and found this one effective for growth and personal transformation,  though it takes your whole day:\n\n1.Hatha Yoga/asana (30-45 min to get the body open and clear.)\n\n2. Kundalini/Tantra/Kriya (30-45 min to further shift and begin opening psychic centers, and it makes transitioning into #3 smoother)\n\n3. LSD or mushrooms and meditate until the sacrament moves you to next step (for further ego dissolution and psychic opening)\n\n4. Ritual Magick (invocation/evocation, spirit work, manifestation, sex magick, or vision quest)\n\n5. Yoga Nidra (for landing) \n\n6. Hot bath (saucha/purification, not just energetically but because you will smell like ass after all that!  😆)\n\nWeed and yoga are the very perfect combination for me. I'm a chronic over thinker and have ADHD so stealing my mind is one of my biggest challenges. I discovered 40 years ago when I started doing yoga that a tiny bit of weed before class or practice was absolutely perfect.\n\nI love to smoke before class, but I only took edibles once, and it crushed me. It was a cookie, so not as stable a dose, maybe I had too much too fast. I rode out class in the fetal position, it was bad. Nausea, anxiety, good times no.\n\nWeed just makes me a slug so I can't do much of anything high, let alone yoga\n\nStay away from indicas.  Sativas should give you an energetic high.\n\nI only ever smoked sativas and tbh it made very little difference to me. It's just not for me\n\nWhy the downvotes?  This is absolutely a thing.  It can affect different people in different ways, of course, but different strains cause different effects.\n\nProbably because the person said weed wasn’t for them and the reply was to just try another strain of weed.  \n\nExactly.  Not to mention that Sativa gives some people (me) heart racing anxiety, or paranoia. Not an energetic high. Taking that while doing yoga would make me pass out!\n\nRight, couch lock is not going to work.\n\nPreparing myself for downvotes, I mean no shade. I came to yoga during my sobriety journey. It was the only thing that came close to quieting my mind the way marijuana once did. Now 100+ days into sobriety and I've seen this question come up numerous times. Is there a sober yoga community out there? While I understand these discussions and love the experience for others, it's difficult to see repeatedly brought up.\n\nI also mean this in a kind way, but perhaps making your own post to talk about it would connect you with like minded people. \n\nI gave up smoking cigarettes a very long time ago and I know if I ever started again, I will never stop. I keep away from them because I must. I think it's so important to find a community when you're giving something up, or looking to gain strength. I hope you're able to meet people who share your journey, or who can at least, aid you on it. Good work on your sobriety, it's a challenge and I give you sincere props on it.\n\nyou are correct and I made my comment just to poster above .  carry on\n\nIm not sure where you are or all these \"high\" yogis are, but believe it or not, there are plenty of long time yogis who actually don't come high or medicated to yoga.  They have reached the place so many strive for, without something ingested.  There is also a moment of bliss associated with breathing into the 3rd eye and the space between breaths.  (Please dont downvote -- to each his own)\n\nHalf a 5mg sativa gummy takes me deeply into poses and breath work! Love it…and savasana breathing afterwards is sooo satisfying!\n\nWeed narrows your focus onto one thing, which is why it can make you anxious. On the flipside, it can really help me break through mental barriers and focus *into my breathing.* I am still relatively new to yoga, but find myself being one of the only people in class actually breathing. I think people get anxious about it and I was actually going to make a reddit post asking about people's experiences being the only one making an audible breathing noise even though it is suggested as the main tool of a yoga practice. I try to do completely sober yoga in the mornings because of discipline reasons and delaying my gratification, but I won't lie about the fact that *FOR ME* it can mostly help me really be present in my practice. For people who have no tolerance or experience with marijuana it can be a completely different experience and I understand that. I think if you have that experience and understand how it affects you then go for it as long as you don't get injured and you aren't being a pain in the ass to other people by smelling like weed (I vape/edibles only).\n\nI actually can't stand the smell of weed so it's edibles all the way down. I loved the deep breathing in down dog.\n\nAnd edibles hit on an even deeper level\n\nNot for everyone. In years of trying, I was never able to find an edible that actually metabolized in my system and did…anything. It was so depressing at the time but at least now I know to not waste any more money or energy on edibles. Even though my lungs wish they worked.\n\nOhhh okay interesting. Well for those who are able to metabolize them, it feels like a deeper more visceral high is what I mean I guess\n\nGotcha. Wish I had a frame of reference for my own personal comparison 😫😜\n\nI don’t use cannabis anymore but the one thing I miss the most about it is pairing it with yoga. It’s truly a religious experience.\n\nSame!\n\nIt's called ganja &amp; is a sacrement to Shiva, the original yogi. Blaze one up and look into it's ritualistic use in Hinduism\n\nFinally. I've found my people.\n\nI also recommend blue lotus. I use capsules or tea, but it really brings me into a much deeper inner focus. Blue lotus+yin is hard to describe!\n\nWeed makes everything wonderful\n\ndoesn't weed act on your dopamine receptors? that's why\n\nIllusion? \nThink if you could get to that point in your practice without it.\n\nIt’s terrifying to see so many addicts here\n\nYoga is great. Yoga with some cannabis is better. I don’t usually do it because I need to drive, but if I can take my bike, then I’ll do it\n\nAn edible or deep vape hit, a hot bath followed by a yin session makes me feel like I just had a full body massage. Nothing like it. 😮‍💨\n\nI don't know but for me I find it accentuates things.  If you are good at yoga and comfortable with it I could see it feeling great.  I get something similar when I mix weed with downhill skiing (which admittedly is kind of dumb and dangerous).\n\nI've smoked weed and it makes me hyper focused like, on details, the sights and sounds, that I wouldn't have noticed without it. (One time I was just feeling and adoring the fabric of my friend's sofa for God knows how long--just fully mesmerized by the tiny details.)\n\nSo I can totally imagine your hyper awareness doing yoga poses and now I really wanna try it too 😅\n\nI think weed makes it better but it’s not always better\n\nI adore getting slightly high and going to a really chill class. There’s only one class a week that I feel comfy getting high before, as it’s at night and my partner drops me off. I look forward to it all week and have the BEST sleep afterwards. I know it’s not for everyone, but it’s been good for me\n\nWeed just makes me so lazy I can’t imagine doing yoga on it\n\nIt has ānandamide. Satchidānanda.\n\nTry Ashtavakra Geeta with it\n\nI like to smoke a bowl before my Bikram classes. It’s puts me sooooo in the zone\n\nMan I am so jealous of this. Anytime I get the least bit high, all I want to do is curl up on the couch and chill. The idea of doing yoga while high seems an impossible dream.\n\nIsn't that the whole point of Savasana? I do it with a vape pen in my mouth when doing it at home.\n\nI love taking an edible and doing yoga! I get really relaxed and get out of my head, I don’t worry about looking ridiculous. I just started a couple of months ago, and I’m having an absolute blast! I get done and just dick around on the stair master and stuff for an hour or so after and I feel AMAZING!\n\nDid this for the first time last night and found it less enjoyable than I do sober. \n\nI found my poses hard to maintain, and I went deeper into some poses than I should have and now my shoulder hurts.\n\nThere is a get high yoga class here in CLT\n\nYoga and weed go hand in hand. In India the yogis and sadhus are always smoking. It is part of the culture. Shiva (lord of Yoga) is known to partake. For me personally it is a spiritual thing. It opens up my third eye. It makes me more sensitive. There is a connection no doubt.\n\nI do this all the time. It’s my favorite way to do yoga 🧘🏻‍♀️ everything is so much more relaxing in my opinion haha\n\nMany experienced teachers don't think it's a good idea but it's pretty widely accepted in my area (California) that many practitioners choose to smoke.  Drinking is far more widely frowned upon.\n\nI play guitar and weed makes me play worse, affects my coordination.   Some people can do it, I can't.   I have practice yoga stoned and not stoned and I think I prefer not stoned.\n\nLOL welcome to my nightly routine.\n\nHot yoga days always involve a wake and bake and then another joint right before I go in to the studio. It’s the best.\n\nI would say it centred you, and you were more aware of it all. Perhaps?\n\nI always feel jealous of people who can do this. I've tried Indica and Sativa, and it all left me plastered to my comfy couch... sometimes tripping balls...\n\nWorking out on edibles is amazing.\n\nI never realized how common it is to combine practice with cannabis - I feel much less guilty now haha\n\nI have been to a few studios that do hotbox sessions and they’re amazing\n\nYes!!!  My company is called CannaFit and I love to incorporate all types of weed with all types of fitness but my favorite is THC + Stretching it is the ultimate way to feel good!!! So glad you loved it too!  Highly recommend!\n\n Been so long since I’ve done this. Ah how I miss it now haha\n\nYeah. You might say the same for any drug. Now you’ll believe doing yoga high is better.\n\nThe best way to do yoga is high imo\n\nThe only way to do Yoga is to do drugs."

    "all_comment_text": "Nice! I love crow but crane has forever eluded me.. it takes a lot of strength and your form looks great! Any tips?\n\nOne detail that was an a-ha moment for me was where the back of the elbow should be facing. The back of the elbow in crow and crane are different. I've always thought they were the same with the difference being straight or bent arms.\n\nIn crow, they face backwards directly because you have to bend your arms, whereas in crane, they face slightly diagonally (see pic). This would be the same when you try to do handstands! \n\nSecondly, you could try lifting one foot at a time (but I totally skipped this and went straight to lifting up the other foot) and when I did, everything was totally engaged. My arms were pressing down strongly on the ground, and I did an intense uddiyana and mula bandha to be able to able to hold both feet up and maintain it there. (I held it about 2 seconds)\n\nThe wrists are definitely going to be something so I would recommend doing a few slow rocking straight arm planches with feet on the ground to get a feel for it.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nThank you, that’s great. My straight arms strength is definitely not quite there, but you’ve inspired me to practice again. :)\n\nOh my god!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!why was I never told this???????\n\nFirst of all, this is awesome!! Congrats!! Second, I am trying to understand the elbow thing. Did you go from crow into crane? Or straight into it with the different elbow already in position? I've had so many teachers say while I'm in crow, \"option to straighten your arms for crane\".\n\nNope, I think holding this for a few seconds was already pretty challenging for me and we were trying to see if we could even get into the pose so our set up was already with straight arms leaning forward. Feet were on top of blocks to give that lift so that knees can be further up the tricep and not near the elbow joint. \n\nI think once you've mastered crane, you can then attempt to do crow to crane and feel how the small rotation of the arm plays a difference (especially in the pressure of the wrist).\n\nGreat advice- thanks!\n\nLooks awesome!  I’ve only tried crow to crane, I will have to try getting straight into crane.   I always get a “Charley horse” sensation in my upper abdomen though in crane. \n\nLooks awesome!  I’ve only tried crow to crane, I will have to try getting straight into crane.   I always get a “Charley horse” sensation in my upper abdomen though in crane. \n\nYou’re not just kind of sort of doing it. You’re nailing it super strong.\n\nThank you for the kind words ❤️ ☺️\n\nYeah that’s a really good crane form!\n\nI didn’t know the difference! So now I figured out I am not doing crow but crane. It’s much easier for me to do crane because my arms and legs are long but my torso is short. So getting to my arm pits and locking in is much easier for me than knees around elbows.\n\nCrane is so difficult! Great job! You're killing it!\n\nCongratulations! Super pose!\n\nCongratulations 🎉🎉🎉\n\nBeautiful work! Cant wait to see what’s next.\n\nWhat a small world! I know exactly where this is and who the instructor in the background is. Congrats on the new asana.\n\nImpressive! I’m not sure I’ll ever get there, but I’m ok with that. Maybe if I’d started trying when I was younger. Yay for you though!\n\nIts a good feeling. Well done!\n\nThat’s voodoo I swear it is!   Seriously, nice work!  Nice form!  I’m jealous\n\nWowza! Awesome. #goals\n\nWow 🤩\n\nWow great job! I also love your green cushion thing, could you share what it’s called and where you got it? I think that would be really helpful for my wrists in some poses. Also, despite heavy use and salting, my hands still slip sometimes on my manduka pro\n\nKeep it up.  Post part 2 when you get there. Which you will."

    "title": "Vent: teachers should refrain from commenting on physical appearance",
    "body": "It's the second time it happens to me on a retreat. \n\nI am just back from a 9-days retreat. I had a meeting scheduled with the resident teacher. In private he made a comment on how I should try to eat three meals a day and not snack in between. I am currently on an vegetarian OMAD diet and can't cut more food from it. Others weird comments were made regarding my private life, but this one awakened traumatic memories.\n\n9 years prior, at my YTT, a teacher had told me, I should stop eating at McDonalds - even though I never eat fast food. This teacher also had made fun of my spoken English, because, hey it's not my first language. \n\nIn the past, I also received comments from other students like \"oh it's nice to see that you can do yoga\" as if I couldn't. At this retreat, there were some people actively avoiding me and I felt their distrust when they spoke to me.\n\nI know I am a curvy girl, but it's coming from a place of enduring long cycles of very stressful events in my life and not from the food I eat. I am also in good health otherwise and all my recent blood tests came back A-1. I have been bullied throughout my childhood and teenage years because of my shape and comments like that hit hard in the feels. As if as a curvy woman I don't see how I look like everyday in the mirror. I am already much aware of it. \n\nIf you don't know what happens in someone life, please don't comment on student bodies, unless it's something that directly affects others (ex. bodily odor). You don't know how someone could react to it. I felt those comments were hurtful and misplaced. That's the main reason I avoid yoga spaces as much as possible. It's sad because I want to keep learning and I want to share with others. I thought it would be a less judgmental place for me to grow as a person, but I guess humans gonna humans. \n\nSorry, rant over!",

There are signs at the door to the studio and the room itself reminding people that at this studio, we do not engage in negative body talk, all bodies are good bodies, racism, sexism, ableism, and trans/homophobia have no place here. I felt so comfortable there. The teachers were really knowledgeable and had good ideas for modifications for my various injuries. I was struggling a lot with my hypermobility at the time and my health was going downhill fast. Being in such an affirming and kind space was wonderful. And, I only got misgendered by a teacher once that I can remember, and she took the correction really graciously.\n\nYou described my feelings perfectly. Thank you.\n\nThis is a hard boundary for me when I’m trying out a new studio. I went to a vinyasa class and the teacher told students to push themselves, that we are stronger than we think, so don’t listen to your body when it tells you to quit. Uhh what? Hell no. Never went back.\n\nYeahhhhh, red flag.\n\nYikes. I think I understand the intention (i prefer “the mind quits before the body) but no yoga class should ever involve instructing people to ignore their bodies. Massive red flag and huge philosophical conflict.\n\nOh that definitely isn't right. Best way to injure yourself. Glad you stopped going there\n\nYikes. I think I understand the intention (i prefer “the mind quits before the body) but no yoga class should ever involve instructing people to ignore their bodies. Massive red flag and huge philosophical conflict.\n\nYes people are projecting their insecurities on you\n\nYes I thought it would be less judgement but it feels like there are\nMore narcissistic people at yoga studios who are addicted to yoga a pleasure distraction\n\n“There is no should or could.  Only being with what is, as it is, without judgement.”\n\nParaphrasing Krishnamurti\n\nWow, I am so sorry. As a bigger guy who’s getting back into yoga, it was really intimidating to go to in-person classes. Some people have been surprised when I told them I had been going to Ashtanga classes, but fortunately my teacher has had none of that and is incredibly supportive. \n\nYoga is for everyone. Some poses are more difficult with extra body fat, but everyone has poses that are more difficult. \n\nYou mentioned doing YTT—if you teach (or even if you don’t and are just going to classes), I want you to know that it matters to others to see you in that space. It’s empowering. I’m sorry that other people are shitty, but I appreciate you being in the world of yoga.\n\nI went to a yoga class last year during an IBS flareup (I get intense stomach pain and was really bloated). In front of a class of all thin people, and without introducing herself, the instructor just looked at me and said “Oh! You’re pregnant!” I said “excuse me?” And then she tried to backtrack and said it was because of how I was holding my mat and that I came in waddling. I said “I was waddling?”. She said well here is your spot, and I slowly without saying anything else headed for the door. I was mortified. In tears, I asked a woman my age if I looked pregnant in the hallway and she said no. The instructor followed me out and said if I had a problem with what she said to me I can say it to her.\n\n  \nI am normally a very quiet person, but I said back “This is ridiculous. What you said was incredibly inappropriate and not how any group fitness instructor goes about that at all. I know, because I was a group fitness instructor for years. I have no desire to go to your class ever again.“\n\nAwesomely enough, the instructor left/they got rid of her a year later. Her replacement is amazing! She is funny, humble, informative, and I like that the instructor has a more average build/body type.\n\nI'm sad that it took them a year to replace that person.\n\nWow. Her following you out, after surely realising she had upset you, and being extra bitchy on top of it, is just next-level awful. Kudos to you for being able to stand up for yourself and articulate the problem there, because if it were me I would no doubt have just burst into tears on the spot or run away or something. \n\nI'm sure a lot of people think I'm pregnant because I have a lot of bloating as well as fat on my belly and I can tell you (having been pregnant) that my belly is the same size now as it was then, and I live in fear of someone asking me when I'm due or whatever. People who have known me for longer than 9 months steal glances at my belly all tbe time and I just know they are thinking \"when is this baby gonna come out?\" 🤣\n\nEven if you *had* looked pregnant, even 10-months-about-to-drop level pregnant, nobody should ever assume that, not out loud anyway! Just way too risky. Even if you *were* pregnant, who's to say you were happy about it or wanted the whole class to know? So unprofessional. \n\nCan't get over how she doubled down and followed you out like that!! Madness. So sorry this happened to you.\n\nShe followed you out to continue assaulting you? Oh. My. Goodness. It took a year?\n\nNo I don't teach, in fact I don't feel there's a place for me in this world I prefer to do my practice alone. But sometimes I think it would be great to do it and it would also be good for me to improve myself. Thanks to give me some inspiration and we also need people like you :)\n\nHey - I also am in a bigger body, also because of lots of stress and life changes at crucial times in my life.  \n\nThat said, have you heard of Jessamyn Stanley? She's on youtube and talks a lot about body positivity, sex positivity, and she also has some yoga videos including modifications for bigger bodies.  Finding her was a game changer for me - no one had ever told me it was okay to literally move my stomach fat out of the way and that would make some poses easier.  She doesn't have tons and tons of youtube content but adding her into my home practice rotation has been really lovely and affirming.\n\nI love when people are frank and real about bodies like that. Fat rolls/big boobs in the way? That's just as much your body as the rest, make space for it and let it exist! Fat isn't a dirty word, don't be ashamed to acknowledge it! You're thin and find some poses hurt your bony areas because of a lack of padding? There are props to help with that, make your body comfortable! You have a wonky back and find floor work challenging, no matter how much people like to insist it's great for back pain (personal gripe here lol)? Well, let's modify it so you can do it sitting in a chair, yoga should adapt to work for you, you shouldn't have to adapt to force yourself into a particular idea of yoga!\n\nAnd everyone farts in yoga sometimes. We all know it.\n\nI’m sorry you don’t feel welcomed in so many yoga spaces. You would always be embraced in my studio!!\n\nYou could try looking for classes that market to people with disabilities or health problems, or that are run out of clinics/hospitals for such things? I've found they tend to have a diverse bunch and the instructors are generally quite aware of trauma and sensitivity and very good at encouraging/suggesting modification as needed for your own personal needs. They do often tend to be easier/lighter classes though so if you're an advanced practitioner you may find them a bit below your ideal class level. The instructors at such places often teach in multiple areas though, so they might be able to point you towards a diverse class that fits your needs. Or you could try posting on a local subreddit asking if anyone has recommendations for an accepting class?\n\nWow that's so rude and inappropriate, I'm sorry they did that. Yoga is the only thing that really helps me feel neutral or good towards my body in a healthy way. I would be really uncomfortable if anyone drew attention to how I looked while I was doing it :(\n\nCompletely inappropriate. First rule of yoga teaching should be do no harm. Even complimenting someone’s appearance may have a terrible effect on someone or reinforce an unhealthy behavior. We don’t know others traumas and triggers. Really unfortunate and immature.\n\nGiving compliments about people’s bodies in front of other students can be odd too. ai saw a yoga instructor compliment a very fit man on being so in tune with his practice, when I right next to him was really in tune with my breadth and adjusting needed for my injuries. I was just as “in tune” as him, he just looked better doing it I guess!\n\nYeah, I expected this to be a positive comment with the title. As someone who’s gone through a lot of body change throughout my life, I can say that I remember some of the compliments more painfully than the digs. (To be fair I have gotten some nice and affirming compliments, that didn’t feel like double-edged swords, from people who know me well.)\n\n&gt;Even complimenting someone’s appearance may have a terrible effect on someone or reinforce an unhealthy behavior.\n\nI'd be curious to know more about your (and other people's) thoughts on this, not limited to yoga spaces, just in general. Obviously commenting on someone's body, especially weight, is wrong unless they're a close friend you know would welcome it. \n\nBut what about complimenting aspects of appearance based on people's choices rather than things they can't control? (For context, I'm a woman). I tend to be a complimentary person (to strangers and friends) and generally have a very positive response. However, I stick to complimenting things people obviously take pride in or want to be noticed, or things related to hobbies/interests. For example, \"I love your hair colour!\" to someone with blue or pink dyed hair - they obviously don't mind standing out with it! Or, \"Ooh, awesome nails\" to a woman with a glittery manicure when she handed me my coffee. I've complimented specific items of clothing or whole outfits, manicured nails, hair styles, makeup, jewelry and accessories, perfumes - personal expression type things. I've also commented positively on people wearing shirts with funny sayings or featuring characters from games I like. \n\nThere's only been one person among dozens (possibly hundreds) of times I've complimented a stranger who didn't seem pleased, she just looked at me like I was super weird (fair lol) and walked off. People generally give a big smile and \"oh, thank you!\" and often give a little anecdote about the thing I complimented. I've had lots of good conversations start this way, but never *expect* anyone to keep talking with me just because I thought their dress was lovely, it's often just a casual little interaction.\n\nIn one other thread when I asked someone who hated any sort of compliment about this practice, they said they'd probably take what I said as being sarcastic or assume I had an ulterior motive because complimenting strangers was so unusual. I do try to read body language and situations - if someone looks deep in thought or in a hurry or absorbed by something else I'm not going to interrupt. It's often during times like waiting to cross at a traffic light together, or on/waiting for a tram, or during an interaction for other reasons (like with a barista or cashier). I'm also a very genuine and open person who wears my heart on my sleeve, so I think I come across as being authentic.\n\nI don't want to make people uncomfortable or cause any harm though, so if there are likely triggers in this kind of complimenting I'd be keen to be made aware of them! For example, I wouldn't compliment the fit of a stranger's clothes because that could come across as creepy or be a trigger for people with body insecurities or sexual harassment triggers. But I can't really see the harm in \"That's a really pretty top, what a lovely green\" if someone wears an embroidered designer blouse, since they obviously then take pride in their clothes? I also might avoid complimenting someone on their clothes like that if a person next to them had shabby clothes, since that could make the second person feel bad if they couldn't afford such things or weren't confident/comfortable enough to wear clothes that stood out.\n\nI think the compliments are really hard as someone with a really disordered eating history. Someone saying you look healthy is triggering because it suggests you were unhealthy in the past. It can be really disorienting wether you’re gained or lost weight. \n\nAnd then there’s backhanded compliments like you’re really good at —— for a —— person. \n\nOne compliment I do appreciate is if people notice my strength. I had a girl once say she was impressed by how strong I was and she pushed herself to try to keep up. That almost brought a tear to my eye because I’ve been trying so hard and I have such a bad self image it really meant a lot. \n\nBut as someone who’s weight has fluctuated due to meds, depression, bulimia, and other bs, I prefer if people don’t mention my body at all\n\nThink someone’s commenting similar but as someone who has and eating disorder past I don’t like people commenting on my appearance really. For example I have IBS-D and atm Im having a flare up so food is going through me and I’m aware I’ve lost a lot of weight - people tell me atm that I look great so for me that’s a trigger because how I look now isn’t my natural body and makes me think oh ok well it appears people like me smaller. \nAs for other features I still find it tricky because I think so much of an ED can make you very aware of your appearance and it can just trigger anything for me personally \n\nI guess you never really know what’s going on behind the scenes. I’d say appearance wise things like you look beautiful or like your hair looks lovely is ok with me but I guess everyone’s different! I like your idea of complimenting a top saying it’s a lovely green! I typically comment things like ‘you’re glowing’ or compliments about personality when I’m complimenting others 🥰\n\nI feel this. I had a teacher tell me “stop losing weight there will be nothing left!” Meanwhile I’m depressed and going through a divorce and working with a therapist and doctor. My yoga teacher is neither a doctor nor a therapist…so she should have kept those comments to herself.\n\nI share your concerns too, teachers have no idea what's going on in our lives and they're not (most often) doctors nor therapists.\n\nI have been bullied a lot because of my weight. However I work hard. I work full time raise a kid and deal with my husband who has a lot of drama. I have a shitty coworker who lost weight and wants to throw it in my\nFace even tho I told her I am happy for her. She keeps bringing in bags of her old fat clothes to work and insisting I take it home. It is so rude and we aren’t close like that. I keep saying no and the next week she brings in another bag of clothes. I continue to say no thanks because she is a lot shorter than me and different body shape so I have no interest in her old clothes. Karma is a bitch. If she wants to do her passive aggressive fake kindness then it is gonna catch up w her. I just politely say no thanks. I find it annoying people who wanna keep giving me their hand me\nDowns.\n\nThat's super frustrating. Plus, we know that most weight loss is temporary, so she'll probably need those clothes again anyway. No need to use them to be rude, ugh\n\n[removed]\n\nI dont like this comment. Fat people are laregly kind and generous, with the occasional annoying person. Just like any group of humans.\n\nThank you for articulating your experience with such self awareness and clarity.\n\nEverything you said is so valuable and I’m incredibly sorry you’re having to navigate this.\n\nI have never lived in a larger body but I do live in a black body and I’ve had a fair amount of experience with fellow yogis making comments about ‘natural athletism’, my skin tone, hair, etc. it took me a long time but I’ve realized that I don’t have to quietly accept when people comment on my body even if it benevolent/well meaning. \n\nMy fellow human are you aware that you are within your rights to look them directly in the eyes and state calmly and respectfully that you are in no way interested or welcoming of thier opinions on your body, private matters etc?\n\nThanks for your comment I appreciate your thoughts and well wishes. I am a very quiet person normally and it takes a lot for me to say how I feel specially when I'm feeling vulnerable.\n\nWhew, that’s a word. Taking up space while feeling vulnerable is no joke, it’s big scary stuff.\nWherever you decide to lay your boundaries is your business. \n\nBut.. if you ever want to ‘shake the table’ in that particular area, I hope you rest in the knowledge that those expansions of demand have the potential to not only keep us safe in the moment but shift the ideas around acceptable behavior and in effect save the next individual from having to be harmed.\n\nYour only responsible for yourself and I don’t mean to burden you with the idea of broader impact but sometimes when I don’t have the energy or skills to fight for myself if I recognize that I’m also standing for the folks behind and in front of me, I get my bite back. \n\nI hope you feel seen and I hope you love on your body.🙏🏽\n\nI quit working at a studio as a teacher because the owners couldn’t stop making comments like this!\n\nIn required quarterly meetings they’d be like “wow your abs are looking tight” to EMPLOYEES. \n\nIt was obviously based on their own issues… like “now that I’m 44 I have to worry about bingo wings!” in a self-deprecating way and I just… found myself dealing with disordered thoughts again.\n\nUgh!\n\nI agree in this space it’s better to not comment about physical appearance at all, whether negative, perceived positive, whatever.\n\nYes I often get the “good job” talk reserved for overweight people as if it’s so amazing and surprising we can do things. I’ve been practicing yoga for 20 years on and off but I still get this from teachers who haven’t met me before. Very annoying.\n\nBut really all you can do is work on your reaction. We will never change everyone around us or the world (not in our lifetimes anyway) so those things will keep happening. Don’t let it stop you, you’re only punishing yourself. They don’t care if you show up or not. You have to learn to be confident enough in yourself and your own history that the words of judgement and ignorance pass over you and you don’t internalize them.\n\nI know that's the best way to react, however my way to react is simply to cut myself off from others because I don't feel like I want to be on the receiving end again. It's a trauma response but the one I feel most comfortable with over time. I tried my best to not think about it but the constant judging had a toll on me.\n\nI’m sorry about the comments, I’m curvy when I’m eating healthy and kinda thin when I’m restricting and when I am over exercising (doing ballet and dif types of yoga). \nPeople have commented on my body since I was about 10 - mostly good comments, but almost every single comment leaves me obsessing. I remember each comment and the context and who said it, etc. \nI’m 50 now, and finally realizing that people are so conditioned to hate their bodies that they project. And some people are mean and insecure. Some people are jealous. Some people are awkward. \nYoga is about being with yourself (I know it’s union, to yoke etc) but when you are practicing you’re on your mat and you hear all your inner chatter and becoming aware of it leads to transformations. \nKeep practicing, don’t let peoples comments (projections) get in the way of your practice. \nYoga helps you to be kind in the world (and to yourself), its a process that is sometimes very uncomfortable.\nNamaste.\n\nTrue. Kindness is the answer. 🙏\n\nI once had my ballet teacher point out to the entire class how my legs are bowl legged and the moves look different on me. I never had even noticed they were bowl legged and I’ve been insecure about it ever since. This was probably 20 years ago… still makes me self conscious. I like when the yoga instructors just encourage doing what’s right for your body… without making direct comments on people’s body types.\n\nI've never met a woman who did ballet and didn't find the experience completely traumatizing for the rest of her life.  Sorry you experienced that!\n\nI understand how this comment may have stayed with you all this time. I'm sorry it happened to you...\n\nI am very bow legged and flat footed.  My wrestling coach once yelled at me, in front of the team, “how do you even run on those”?30+ years ago and I remember his exact words. Lol he did not object or laugh when those legs walked me up to the gold podium at 2 consecutive high school state championships  though.\n\nI'm a \"curvy\" teacher; I've been teaching 10+ years and practicing almost 20 years.  I can honestly say that no teacher has ever once commented on my appearance.  That sounds miserable and I absolutely wouldn't take a single class from that teacher again.\n\nThank you for teaching in your curvy body!! It really does go a long way to help others feel welcome and empowered just to see people like them living and thriving in the world of yoga.\n\nThis comment is perfectly instructive of the following proposition: Becoming a yoga instructor does not automatically lead to becoming an enlightened person.\n\nyeah that’s rude and unhelpful\n\nThis is disgusting. I’m so sorry. I’m finally in a place where I’m relatively comfortable with my body and can ground in gratitude for what it does. My body allows me my unique (and wonderful) practice—why would I view it as a hindrance or something to fight with? I feel really lucky that the yoga spaces I’m in have allowed me to foster this presence and gratitude with a depth no other movement or fitness routine has. \n\nThe one evident micro-aggression I did get was when I was telling an instructor/manager goodbye (moving/program changes) how grateful I was for the program she’d built because I was nervous about coming back to yoga/being in studio but found a lot of space and confidence there. She essentially responded saying that the yoga community is growing in terms of being accepting towards more body types… even though I hadn’t named that as the source of my anxiety at all (and while it was a bit, my concern was more with not being up on the poses and looking dumb/doing things wrong… which, sure, does feel more fraught or more likely to be judged as a fat person). I know that was well-meaning, but it still made me feel a bit misunderstood and typecast.\n\nIn any case: I still get nervous when practicing in new spaces, but care less and less what people think about my body (or even how my poses look) because I know my practice is awesome! (It also helps a lot that I’m now familiar enough with asanas and comfortable enough with how I take them that with clear instruction, I rarely look at anyone else. Though I’m also finally at a point where I can see someone doing something cool and be like wow, that’s awesome, good for them instead of wondering why I’m not doing it.)\n\nWeird contrast to this, but a couple months back, I arrived to class, was greeted by the teacher who followed up with \"hey, week after week I'm seeing you and you're looking better and better every time. Are you working at it?\" Well, yes, I had been doing yoga daily for a few months and lifting weights and some mild cardio 3-4 times a week for as long. But... My body wasn't changing. I know this because my clothes were fitting the same way.\n\nWhat had changed? I was coming out of a depression for a few weeks after leaving a job that had put me on sick leave for 2 months. What was she seeing? I was happier. That's the only thing I can pinpoint as having changed about me.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm sharing this except to say I felt some affirmation that happiness can make us look good as much as any weight-loss or weight-gain, depending on what unattainable goal we're aspiring to.\n\nHappiness and confidence can make huge differences in how someone comes across. Just small, unconscious changes in posture, body language and facial expression can give a completely different vibe. I have mental health issues I struggle with and so do a lot of my friends. I can often see how well my friends are doing almost as soon as I lay eyes on them. People often just look brighter and happier when they're feeling that way. People who know me have said similar things about how I look better when I'm in a good space.   I also tend to wear nicer clothes, take a little more time to actually style my hair instead of just letting it dry how it wants, sleep better etc when I'm doing well mentally so every bit adds up!\n\nI hope you're continuing to do well and have a much better job that suits you!\n\nHeard. You are obviously 100% correct. I can relate a bit. I started practicing yoga over 30 years ago at 16 years of age. I bought an Iyengar book and practiced from that for a year before buying a Power Yoga VHS set. I bought Light on Yoga and created my own routines and self-practiced for 8 years before ever going to a class. I never joined a studio but was a nomad. Practicing in the 90s and early 00´s in LA, I was always the only POC in the room and although I wasn’t overweight, I certainly wasn’t the typical “yoga body” in those spaces.  I often felt a vibe at the beginning of class… I never felt welcome… but once class started, my home was and always has been within the practice itself. \n\nHaving started so early in life I have a solid understanding of yoga and what it’s really about. Since I was 26, I could usually be confident that I had been practicing longer than the teacher and certainly longer than most students who excluded me.  That helped me feel like I had as much right to be there as anyone else. \n\nAlso, anyone who makes comments like you’ve described doesn’t actually get it. You can’t understand yoga and discriminate, so they are revealing themselves to you. Don’t let anyone make you feel like you don’t belong. Yoga is for every Body.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience with me! I wanted to take time to answer because I can relate to it, my story is pretty similar to yours! When I was young there were no yoga teachers or studios around. I worked in book distribution at that time, and at work I had found a book written by Iyengar's daughter about yoga for women. I started my practice alone and it went on and off for maybe a decade before I chose to deepen my practice with a YTT. It's how I understood how not ready, and disconnected I was with the modern yoga reality. I never practice in studios only at home, and from time to time I go to retreats. This last one was an advanced retreat and at this point I knew what I was getting into. \n\nI hope that you have found some inclusive spaces for you. It's great I can relate to someone's experience. I haven't found an inclusive space for me yet, but I'll stay a nomad and hang out with the right people. Yes yoga is for everyone regardless of their age, gender, body type, origins, skin color or whatever else! Even Bhagavad Gita says we are not our body. I believe it truly.\n\nThis makes me so angry to hear! I avoided practicing yoga with others for reasons like this. Now, as a plus size yoga teacher, I very intentionally chose to do my YT200 in the hopes that I could create a safe, affirming space for people who didn’t think yoga was for them — be they plus size, neurodivergent, LGBTQIA, mature, or “not flexible”. Yoga shouldn’t be a Barbie body cult — it should be for every one and every body!\n\nThank you for sharing and doing what you do 🙏\n\nInfuriating! So toxic. I'm sorry this happened to you. You don't have to explain, justify, or defend the size and shape of your body to anyone. The same with what you choose to eat. Neither should invite comments from so-called yogis or yoga professionals. I'm happy all the comments on this thread are supportive. I know there are people out there reading all of our body neutral and trauma informed contributions just itching to type something ignorant and whoever you are...don't do it. Remove fingers from keyboard and go self-reflect.\n\nYeah I was basically \"bullied\" by someone on this thread who kept commenting \"you're lying to yourself, you're obese just stop eating and lose the weight\" no matter how I would explain it wasn't their business... I mean come on that's the whole point of my post hahaha I had to block them for my own sanity.\n\nYes this has happened to me so much at yoga studios and I have been doing yoga for 26 years. There are tons of skinny people who are super unhealthy too.\n\nThanks for pointing that out. I’m one of those. Skinny isn’t a virtue. I don’t appreciate any personal talk, as I go there to escape and focus away from mySELF. I don’t want anything to be commented on, but whether I need to correct my pose.\n\nYes exactly\n\nYes!!! I’m usually an athletic looking person at my natural healthy weight. If I’m ever skinny either my gut issues are flaring really bad likely due to stress or my ED behaviours are back - I.e if I’m ever skinny my health is absolutely not thriving\n\nI am a fat yogi. I have to adjust my belly in a lot of poses. This is absolute trash behavior. That said, I am sure I don't have to tell you how a lot of people, esp in the wellness space, are terrified of fat bodies. I am in no way pro obesity nor do I believe anyone can be healthy at 500 lbs, but in the US especially, there are a lot of people walking around with an extra 50lbs. I have had instructors pay too much attention praising me for doing simple things like twisted warrior or even frog pose \"does that hurt your belly?\" huh? That all said, it comes down to ignoring them. I am doing yoga to feel good in my body and I have had a much larger acceptance in the yoga community then the cross fit ( ugh so glad this was a quick phase ) or my lifting/trying to run phase. I have found a lot of mean instructors in the pilates rhelm but I attribute that to many of my instructors have been past dancers, and imo very very skinny, so they are not aware of the things that are difficult if you have fattier areas. \n\nAnyway I digress. I am sorry you experienced that. I would advise you to look for a difft place to practice.\n\nI’m sorry that yoga teacher was an ignorant jerk.\n\nThere is so much ignorance about weight. Did you know doctors only receive a few HOURS of training in regard to obesity (I am absolutely not implying you or anyone else here is obese)? So even doctors have no clue. So that means that almost no one understands that weight is a more complex issue than calories in, calories out. Sure, there are people who overeat. There are people who overeat and are obese. But as a martial arts instructor, I saw so many people working their butts off (a taekwondo workout is supposed to burn over 700 calories an hour), and they still struggled with weight. \n\nI developed gut issues almost two years ago and lost any tolerance for alcohol or greasy, fatty foods, and I’ve always had trouble with sugar, so here I am eliminating alcohol, grease, fat, and limiting sugar, eating small meals, and I gained weight! I’m mad. If I can’t have my glass of wine, I should at least get to lose a few! \n\nMy point is that body fat is an area of enormous ignorance, and people seem to feel entitled to comment on other people’s weight. It’s disgusting. Even if someone is too heavy, its none of our business. And we weren’t all meant to look the same! Some are curvy, some not, some tall, some short. We also weren’t meant to look at each other with judgment.\n\nExactly! At this point I know most of it is a combination of slow metabolism, my own body shape and the fact I was over stressed most of my life and not able to properly \"digest\" my emotions. I've always put a huge emphasis on health, I eat very well, don't smoke, don't drink etc. And people have no idea how much effort I put in my health just by looking at me. Some people stay thin no matter what they eat. I am sometimes envious of them but I know that being mostly healthy makes it easier for me to keep good habits: I see it as an investment in the future. I am 40 years old and most people think I'm like 25. I always get told \"but you're still young\" but hey I take it lightly now :)\n\nCommenting on body shape or size is basically the opposite of a yogic mindset. I’m sorry you’ve experienced this OP, there’s a lot of surface dwelling fakers out there.\n\nI’m sorry that this happened to you. Sadly, it is common, and the reason that I avoid public exercise spaces. A lot of us grew up with negative experiences around PE and sports and those often carry over into the adult fitness spaces too. As I tell my students, “other peoples’ bodies are not your business!” Unless someone asks for specific feedback, it should never be assumed that it is ok to comment on someone else’s body shape, size, level of ability, etc.\n\nThat’s blatantly rude and disrespectful \nPlease let them know to be adults and to be compassionate when it comes to different body types and to draw your line with them regarding that\n\nThey know better.\n\n\nAnd anyone can join yoga\n\nWhile I don’t comment on body types, I have told a girl her hair looked beautiful 4 years ago, and she burst into tears, like heavy sobbing. After that, I realized she’s had trauma and I’ve never commented on a persons body since without them asking. \n\nYou never know how a person feels, or what they’ve been through\n\nI'm sorry that this happened to you.\n\nEach of the 4 yoga studios I've attended have had at least one teacher who was overweight but still able to do all the postures.\n\nWhen I was younger/teenager/child, I was bullied for being skinny. Even by my own mother. Kids at school would laugh at me for brining 6 sandwiches for lunch but never putting on weight (I had/have high metabolism). My mother on the other hand, was annoyed I couldn’t put on weight (hence she would feed me so much) and I later found out that it was because people in my hometown would come up to her and ask her if she starves me. So, as insecure and people pleaser person as she was, instead of telling those people off or laugh it off, she would take it seriously; almost like an offence. In her mind, those people were saying she is a bad mother. So, of course, she would then take it on me. Funnily, this all came from a person who gave me those genes and who used to be in the same situation I was (but never had any compassion from her). It got to the point where I couldn’t leave my the house (when my parents and I were going to a cinema for example) without her clothing approval because I couldn’t show up in something that would enhance my skinniness (I.e. tighter clothes).\n\nIt took me some time to actually like my body, and now I absolutely love the fact I can stay skinny in my 30s and don’t have to worry about dieting and can eat whatever I want without people commenting on my figure 🫶🏻\n\nSo it seems that you can never please people - they will complain and bully you whatever size you are. Skinny or fat. You name it. You just need to do you and do whatever makes you happy and it’s good for you. It’s hard to do it sometimes hence it’s important to be surrounded by like minded people.\n\n\"We should never comment on someone else's body.\" Excellent piece of life advice someone gave me years ago. I wish more people knew this.\n\nI am so so sorry to hear this, friend. Unsolicited comments on people's bodies, particularly those that may be triggering or harmful to that person given their history, are completely antithetical to the practice and philosophy of yoga (acceptance, mindfulness, being in tune with and honoring one's **own** body and proprioception rather than comparing with everyone else's). All bodies are yoga bodies.\n\nNot just teachers.\n\nListen, it’s not because people do yoga, they are simply enlightened or don’t display toxic behaviours. You do you yourself and follow your own path. I know it’s hard but try to ignore negative people. You already got into a path to try to be a better version of yourself. Don’t let the others take that from you. If this studio is not working out from you, find one that can.\n\nIMO, the studios I’ve attended are the most inclusive places in my city. \n\nAll studios and students should strive for that.\n\nI've just found these Instagram accounts which I love! I hope you find a more inclusive space\n\n[yoga by Lucy](https://www.instagram.com/lucybyoga?igsh=MWx5MDc2bWF5bTVqeg==)\n\n[scoteeisfat](https://www.instagram.com/scotteeisfat?igsh=aXFsZ3NmZjFlbnc4)\n\nI’m so sorry you had these experiences!\n\nI’m so sorry!    These comments are ridiculous.   I can’t imagine the intent.  At least they clue you in to who to avoid at the retreats.\n\nI’m sorry that happened to you. I’ve never been to a yoga retreat, but lots of classes of lots of different types and I have NEVER had an instructor say such a rude comment. I am not a thin person, either.\n\nYoga is for everyone, that’s the whole point of yoga. For all the ages and stages. Don’t let this dissuade you from continuing (but maybe skip that retreat next time, if that’s what they’re gonna be like). Also, you don’t need to explain your health status to anyone. It’s not their business, unless you want to say, hey I have a knee injury so I’m going to have to modify. Even then, most teachers will not even comment if they see you modifying, because like I said, yoga is for all ages and stages, and you know your body best.\n\nI agree. I don’t think they should that to you, and I am sorry that happened to you. You deserve better.\n\nAlso never be sorry for saying something like this. I don’t consider it a rant. Yogi’s need to hear first hand experience of community members not being treated with respect and dignity. You are speaking your truth and are still working hard toward being your true and best self. Mad respect!\n\nI understand completely the turn-off from this teacher’s comment but I hope you will continue to find your sacred space on your mat no matter where you choose to practice. As you’ve probably experienced, magic happens when you roll out your mat and prepare for your practice in the space that no one can touch. I’m sending you love and light to continue to go to that place regularly so there will come a day when this experience has been replaced with such love for yourself that although it may never go away, it will pale in comparison to the powerful place your Yoga practice has taken you.\n\nThat's so cool you could go on a retreat. I hope there was positive aspects of it. I find I focus on my negative interactions and they block out the good ones. Trying to work on it. There is so much suffering and pain in living sometimes that's all people have to give. But I try to believe there is more good than bad.\n\nThere was a lot of positive, but awakening past chilhood and adult traumas is never easy to digest. I still appreciate I could be part of it and I learned a ton. Still unsure how I will react with this teacher/ his students in the future cause I have a long history with them and I don't like ghosting people. I will see how it goes.\n\nThat’s shitty, I’m sorry you had to go through it 🥲🫶🏼\n\nAvoid the Baptiste yoga teachers, he had a weird thing about finding your \"perfect physique\" and from what I hear the teacher trainings in my area for that style training are huge on trauma bonding throughout the training. I have been so lucky to find a body positive studio, it has literally changed my life. This behavior is completely unacceptable. When someone says something tell them Yogananda is your hero and you are striving for his body style. (If you're not comfortable telling them to F off.) I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, no one deserves this\n\ni'm so sorry you went through this!!! &lt;/3 and you're totally right, it's so wrong for people to comment on other people's bodies like that. i'm very severely pear-shaped at any weight, and people have been making comments on my body my entire life because of it. it's none of their business, inside or outside of a yoga-centred space!!!\n\nthank you for making this post, i wish everyone understood how commenting on other people's bodies is harmful and hurts the people living IN said bodies. yoga is for every body. i wish you all the best, friend. :)\n\n3 meals a day with no snacks is an Ayurvedic practice and many yoga practitioners aim to eat this way in order to be healthy, your retreat teacher probably meant no harm and was most likely trying to help and may have offered that advice to anyone no matter what size they are 🙏\n\nThe is was my thought too. Perhaps the teacher noticed OP was missing from the majority of meals and wanted to make sure they were okay. It can become a liability if someone in your care for a week is starving themselves.\n\nI always receive unsolicited Ayurvedic advice at retreats and assume the giver means no harm.\n\nYeah that makes sense, lots of yoga teachers have training in Ayurveda and the lifestyle goes hand in hand with the asana practice\n\nYup. This is an example of fat-phobia. People are assuming they know exactly why you are the size you are and are imagining the life you live based on your body’s physical representation. I had a friend who gained weight while undergoing cancer treatments and she didn’t get an ounce of the sympathy that a skinny, bald, sickly looking cancer patient would get. People just assume they know why anyone is bigger or smaller and then make judgments off that\n\nThe bird’s papaya is a podcast that has a lot of episodes on fat-phobia and body positivity. Highly recommend!\n\nWhile I’d agree that every comment toward your body is insane and stupid. \n\nBut a principle of Ayurvedic medicine is 3 meals/day with no snack in between. In terms of Ayurvedic practices there is benefit and value to having an empty stomach. It would never be something a practitioner would say without being in a private 1:1 session. \n\nI want to acknowledge that commenting about bodies is 100% wrong, and teachers should definitely be reprimanded for doing so. But also encourage you that this was likely not a comment on your body, but an Ayurvedic practice who’s purpose is to obtain Ayurvedic health and not to loose weight or change your physical appearance.\n\nThree meals a day is not necessarily an ayurvedic principle. The most important meal should be eaten around noon, because that's when agni is stronger, and apart from that food should be eaten regarding our needs. Each and everyone of us have different needs, that's what I learned from ayurveda. Also one meal a day is in yogic lore since time immemorial. As they say, one who eats once a day is a yogi, twice a day is a bhogi and thrice a day is a rogi.\n\nFor sure! I didn’t mean to mansplain Ayurveda. More to say the person was probably following their checklist from whatever teacher they had. I also, should have empathized better because I know first hand how people will look at the size of someone’s body and assume they just need the basics. And how for some reason they might think only thinner bodies need the more personalized and custom approach. When the reality is no yoga principle or practice should be templatized or made basic and should always be open to the needs of the individual. Apologies if my comment came off condescending.\n\nVery inappropriate. I’m sorry you experienced that, I think you could find a better and safer place to practice! \n\nThe only sideways comment my teacher has ever made was about how we must have enjoyed the holiday weekend (because it smelled so bad at the end of that hot yoga class!). Which I thought was funny…\n\nWow, I am so sorry that happened, that is SO out of bounds and would understandably ruin the experience. I would totally support sharing this in any avenue you have for feedback so that person doesn't do further damage.\n\nI got into yoga when I was in eating disorder recovery as I had a horrible relationship with exercise! I HATE when teachers comment on bodies and nutrition!\nI really have to zone it out and try to think that’s ok they’re on their own journey but I also really value ahimsa (no violence) so part of me is also like eurgh this doesn’t feel in line with that as there are people who may be harmed by your words and opinions! \nHonestly I just block it out and sometimes have a little rant to myself but yeah very frustrating. \nThere’s a guy on Instagram I really like ‘scottieisfat’ I think is his ig name - he lives in a larger body and offers a really inclusive space - I don’t do his classes but I like watching his videos and he talks really beautifully about practicing yoga in a larger body which I find comforting\n\nI love my yoga class as there are a range of ages, body type, and physical abilities. I believe yoga should be a safe place and sad to hear your experience was like this.\n\nShitty for teachers to say that! I did once myself in a deep pose after a long pause realize my fat was spilling out and blocking me and loudly exclaimed \"damn this pose is good for noticing I should eat less\"...\n\nHopefully didn't trigger someone, but it was such a shock to me and the classes there were usually relatively chatty...\n\nI don't think there is anything wrong with commenting on appearance, but a yogi is not a dietician and shouldn't be offering advice on what to eat.\n\nIve known dozens of teachers and none comment about body types other than to provide adjustments options for those who cannot do certain things. IMO, sounds like you need to vouch your teachers better before signing up on retreats or YTTs with them. You should have good vibes with the ones you invest into\n\nYou need mental health counseling. Peace and happiness comes from inside.  Also being mature means being able to take constructive criticism and guidance from teachers.  And people avoid you because in carrying weight it’s obvious you are dealing with a lot of issues and people are not drawn to that.\n\nThat was not constructive criticism. I'm a teacher too and I have a background in mental health myself and the yoga teacher label is not a free pass to criticize/judge people based on how they look like. I don't need a stranger online to tell me what I need to do with my life, I am fine by myself. Who are you to tell me why people avoid me? Because of my weight people should avoid me? That's ridiculous\n\nThis was a very rude reply\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n* OP didn't ask for the input you've chosen to provide\n\n* Regardless of your actual job you are *not* OP's doctor\n\n* You were asked to stop and instead chose to continue\n\nThis is the only warning you'll receive in r/yoga. Continued participation of this nature will result in permaban."

Should we focus only on this pose for the flexibility or is it combination of others unlocked the potential\n\nThis is a combination of different things (entire back, core, hip flexors, shoulders) so having a balanced consistent practice is the key. But if I had to say one pose that is the most important here, I would say practicing [flying cobras](https://youtu.be/TZrZSkrlxS0?si=tbhuOZ2zn3wjLgjx) and locust, they will help you develop the back strength needed to support you and stay safe in these poses :)\n\namazing..!!\n\nThank you :)\n\nYou are incredible!!!

Palms are flat though. Your fingers are like brakes in a handstand; they keep you from falling forward so it’s important to claw the ground. The heel of your hand is like the accelerator. It’s a constant dance between the two while you’re upside down — that’s why I love it so much because it takes all of your focus to find that sweet spot.

My studio is a 20min drive for me (I live in Canada so that’s pretty close lol) and i do not fuck with intox driving. So i only blaze with at home practice and it’s great\n\nIt really is nice, so much easier to get into that quiet place in the mind. With motivation and intention, weed becomes a great tool for focusing and getting into the body!\n\nI have been practicing yoga for 15 years and then went recently after an edible. I couldn't believe how much I could let go in my body that previously has always held tighter or held unevenly for some reason. Truly inspirational and eye opening to what a more relaxed state can do!\n\nIt is! I do find it’s a fine line and for me personally just a lil bit is the right amount, an edible would be too much for me imo but everyone is different\n\ni smoke in the parking lot before class\n\nEdibles are my fave before yoga. They last longer and I can take I  advance. The. Best.\n\nDo people not have joints they smoke once they get to the studio?\n\nIdk about you but my classes are max two hours, usually one or 1.5, and i am always high as fuck after smoking a joint still by then. No way i could drive home !!\n\nFair enough. If I go out for yoga it’s usually a relaxed pace affair afterwards with some social time, so it’s not really something I consider. Good for you for sticking to the drive safe option. \n\nThanks man!! everyone has their own tolerance and knows their body:)\n\nTrue that! Cheers man!! \n\n&gt;i do not fuck with intox driving.\n\nBut you drive your body and mind intox.\nDon't mix substances with any form of yoga practice if you really want what's good for you.\n\nSee i’m not sure. I work a very stressful job &amp; often times find it hard to calm my mind (getting better day by day). By taking some marijuana before my practice i find myself peaceful and relaxed, i feel more in tune with my session and finally able to “let go”. Maybe you’re just more experienced in yoga than I, but this is my current method.\n\nI get you better now that you have provided more context, however, in the long run it will be damaging, rather accustom yourself for post yoga sesh, I have found this quite good, however, I discontinued it and only use that method for when and if I'm feeling external overwhelm.\nI'd suggest for your long-term betterment, at least refrain from a pre yoga sesh, avoid a regular post one as well. You could build yourself up to that system.\n\nGood idea! I’ll give it a try and lyk how it goes!\n\nwhat's damaging about it?\n\nCurrent smoker, and used to smoke pre and after sessions. Long run, it's really not worth it. You start to associate your yoga session with getting high. The ability to \"let go\" is deep and takes dedication. If you're using something else to help you \"let go\" then you're truly not letting go. It wasn't until I took my sadhana practice seriously that I realized my smoking was an inhibition. Still smoke, just not part of my practice anymore. It made me realize just how much I depended on smoking to get into the practice.\n\nI encourage you to keep the mindset that this is your \"current method\". You're stress should be managed and you should enjoy your practice. However, the real work starts when you can let go of everything you think you need to \"let go\" and the magic will happen.\n\nNo judgement, but when you feel ready, try the method of simply going to practice in the space you're in without needing to smoke to prepare. It will blow you away how hard yet satisfying it really is.\n\nLook at the amount of downvotes for me trying to bring to the forefront of OPs awareness. Luckily, he seems to have taken my input openly and neutrally.\n\nBut I am really intrigued to find out the reason for so many downvotes on something which was for helping somebody.\n\nBecause you were judgmental for no reason and didn't really give any actual advice besides saying something generic like it's good for you\n\nDo you vape any particular strain?\n\nI’m like sativa and something that’s about 80% THC. \n\nRaw Garden is a decent brand.\n\nIf you have the money, the brand cold fire is bomb. Check out r/coldfire to see what I’m talking about\n\nUgh looks like you can’t order them online :(\n\nabout 7 years ago i injured my back doing the same. i thot i could force a pose  since my muscles were relaxed but didn't have the stability to hold it. the high lets you go further but you need the strength and balance which is developed from time/experience to get to the next level\n\nFor sure! I think this is an important point. I’m lucky that I have a studio also so I mix up my practices quite a bit.\n\nhot yoga does this to people too. I think it's important to know your limits always.\n\nYeah this is the important thing to remember (the same goes for hot yoga btw), maintaining awareness of your body’s limitations in a natural state and cannabis moderation are key imo\n\nYin on an edible with a good loud vibey playlist is euphoria\n\nYin and edibles is truly a match made in heaven.\n\nmy first Yin class was on shrooms, I can't describe how profound of an experience it was\n\n“Weed makes everything better.”  - people who like weed\n\nExercise some caution my friend. It was really amazing while it lasted, and I was giving the same rationale. But slowly I fucked my lower back and cervical. Pot numbed the pain response a bit, so I went deeper into the poses, stayed there longer and slowly everyday, micro injuries accumulated. And one day the pain started while doing something else and then it was so bad I had to be admitted to a hospital and the doctor was unable to decipher how a person otherwise so healthy, can have these injuries without an accident. Then I mentioned yoga and he was like yaaaa, got it.\n\nAfter 6 month's physiotherapy, I joined a medical yoga class, where it took me approx 2 years to get back to baseline. sort of, the injuries in backbone are still there, I probably have more muscles to support it. So if I ever leave yoga again, I'm fucked.\n\nI hope your injury recovers well. Did you learn anything regarding preventing such \"micro injuries\"? I don't use the stuff so I'm not asking specifically about that, but more generally about yoga practice and recognizing the pain. So yes my question is off-topic but I saw your comment and found it interesting.\n\nDuring classes my teacher will say to not force anything, and immediately stop when there's pain. Yet, I will tolerate a small bit of pain in order to reach a pose. For me it's hard to recognize the difference between a *stretch* and *pain*. I wonder if you have thoughts about this. Thanks\n\nMy teacher says if it’s sharp then it’s pain and to come out. A stretch should be bareable. For example if i extend my feet and toes, i can often feel a stretch in my hamstrings. but a sharp pain feels different.\n\nBodies are weird. Everyone is so different!! it’s so interesting comparing how our bodies feel and our indicators.\n\nAs far I know from my own experience, if you are not \"on\" something, your body should automatically warn you when you are about to do something that can cause injuries. (except a very few people who can't). The problem in doing yoga while being high on something is that your internal warning system goes for a toss. And if you have been doing those asanas from a few years and you are a bit experienced, it will become very easy to suddenly jump to the next level and go really deep in each pose with more focus and intensity without much issue, because your body is more relaxed and more gooey and you are more focused and it becomes easy to visualize things, go really deep in all the mystical stuff. But that's where the risk lies. Overstretching is a thing, not being able to assess how much your body is screeching, where the limits are, is a major problem. If you do it once, it'll probably heal in a few days. If you do it everyday, then those issues accumulate. And eventually they may become big enough to completely derail the practice or land you at a doctor's place. So just be mindful. Pain response is there for a reason.\n\nThank you for sharing! I think your point and experience is good knowledge to have. I used to weight lift actively for years and found myself harming myself in similar ways to you. A combo of adding weight and maybe ego lifting a little. \n\nThat actually created my turn to yoga, as i found my weightlifting was fuelled by anger and my yoga was fuelled by the want for inner peace.\n\nI enjoy my weed separate from yoga. I practice yoga asanas, Kundalini, chanting and meditation. I prefer clarity during my spiritual practice. I try to reach different levels of consciousness and being stoned can distract from that for me.\n\n100% was advised this from both therapists and experienced yogis. They had nothing against weed use but rather encourage you to fully encapsulate the experience with a clear mind as it serves its own purposes spiritually mentally and emotionally and throwing weed on top of that just takes away from the natural experience.\n\nas a novel and fun experience: maybe  \nas a routine, personally a really bad idea. Sometimes it is about forcing (in a healthy way) yourself through it, at least in a sense that you do some work on your body and mind for a good cause -&gt; your body and mind.\n\ndo not get yourselves reliant on external induced experiences. Cultivate them on your own, from within.\n\nYoga to me, is all about being present in the rawness of our current reality. Weed is used to escape the present moment. It is fun from time to time but best not to make it a habit.\n\nAgreed. I do think weed can help you connect more the present moment, however, it can certainly be a slippery slope. I'm two months sober from heavy Marijuana use and it has taken some time to adjust back to not being stoned during yoga/hiking etc.\n\nExactly. Long term, chronic use is way more harmful than a lot of people realize. I am also two months sober from heavy use.\n\nThat's incredible! 1 day at a time!\n\nThank you! 🫶🏼\n\nWell said. \nI recognise the fun one can have with weed. I lived in Amsterdam (now 15 min away from it) and had good times using weed. Things can be more intense. \nBut I naturally stopped using it. \nI could see the experience of doing yoga when stoned, but I would really miss the real awareness as well.\n\nWeed doesn't make me escape anything. In fact I feel more centered and grounded. I have c-ptsd and cannabis has saved my life. Many people use it for mental illness as well.\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt; You are escaping your emotions instead of accepting how you feel you use weed to feel such a certain way\n\nAgain - how the fuck do you know what this person has experienced?  Do you have a PHD in Psychology or are you an expert on the effects of cannabinoids?    Now your comparing cannabis use to alcoholism?   You clearly have no clue what the fuck you're talking about?  \n\n\"This is real yoga not the Instagram bullshit look-at-me yoga\"\n\nGive me a break - get off your fucking high-horse!\n\n[deleted]\n\nWeed is very different than alcohol.\n\nThis ⬆️\n\nIt helps me get physically more present into my body sometimes and out of my head! But it can also have the opposite effect 😂\n\nThat's the irony of weed. People think it's helping them with their issues, but in fact it's just making them worse. Rather than dealing with the issues, they run away from them, meanwhile the issues get bigger and bigger.\n\nNot universally true. I've made major progress with mental struggles with weed. I am not a heavy user, never have been, and usually stay away from it when anxious or depressed. But a few times I got high and then experienced anxiety (I was generally anxious, this time weed made it worse). I was way too high, and just had to handle it. I took on my issues and actually developed some simple strategies and rules that addressed my problems. FOR EXAMPLE: I struggle with self esteem and finishing projects (diagnosed thru 8 hours of testing \"off the charts\" ADD). I developed a mantra: \"Moving forward imperfectly.\" (Feel free to steal that if it works for you). Another example -- I was massively down on myself for my life situation. Very high I realized, \"sometimes it's easier to beat yourself up than to do what's necessary to fix the problem.\"\nSo, there are many people who smoke too much, for whom it's a negative. But weed is complex; at the right time with the right brain, thoughtfully, it can push you to \"go deep\" and gain understanding.\nMore to the original subject, yoga high is amazing. Again, I can see how sober works, too, but sometimes high seems to help you go deeper in all ways. Not everyone, per above.\n\nUnless you're a doctor you definitely shouldn't be making these statements about other people. This is extremely judgemental and misinformation.\n\nPainting anything with a broad brush isn’t usually the best method. I was in rehab this summer for cannabis dependence and will still say many users are responsible and benefit from it.\n\n&gt; Weed is used to escape the present moment\n\nAbsolutely not - for most seasoned Cannabis users, it helps achieve the opposite.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI Think you need to step off of your high horse.   Do you not know anyone that has Anxiety issues?  Have you not heard or read about the countless medicinal benefits of Cannabis? \nWeed is definitely not for everyone - but it helps millions of people that suffer from a great many mental health &amp; medical issues INCLUDING Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Insomnia, Hyperarousal - which all - at least partially - stem from difficulty BEING PRESENT.   I suffered with anxiety for years - was prescribed horrible benzodiazepine drugs, couldn't sleep or clear my mind. Cannabis use, Yoga, and mindfulness have helped me immensely.   I don't tout it as some miracle cure-all and know what kind of side effects it has (especially for young developing brains), but used responsibly - It can certainly help a great many people.\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;  Not everyone is the same after all but this thread was asking for our own experience\n\nPrecisely - You are broad-brushing weed smokers as stoners who are masking or evading dealing with inner conflict.  I clearly stated weed does have downsides and it doesn't help everyone, in fact it can make anxiety much worse in some individuals.  Drugs (prescription or non) are not always the answer, but they work for many.  A Buddhists take on weed is irrelevant as I am not Buddhist.  Call it 'stoner arrogance' or whatever you want...  I totally understand your experience and wouldn't question what has helped you - as you did to me.   Also - I grow my own weed and never pay for it - marketing has zero bearing on any of it.\n\nOh my god you don’t even know what you are talking about. Do you even know the strands of cannabis? The benefits of them? How it is used to for medicine? I have ridiculous ADD. I do breathwork and meditate daily. These and yoga have helped. However, when I use cannabis, it makes it easier to just be present. It allows me to exhale and sit with myself and focus on what I am doing, without expectation on myself. I’m not escaping shit. It’s a plant medicine!! I’m so sick of yogis like you. Judgmental and ignorant. \nAlso, it impacts every person differently so you are in no place to judge or tell people how to be.\n\n[deleted]\n\nFirst I’m not sure where you are getting your false information.  Differing strands are not marketing. It’s fact. \n\nSecond, I don’t NEED it to meditate or do yoga or any of those things. However, it does help in some areas of my life. I’m not reliant on it. I would much rather have cannabis than ADD meds. \n\nLastly, yes I have done shadow work, breathwork and deep meditations. I am yoga instructor, so I am very aware of holistic healing. They have helped me in my life greatly. Plants are also something that can help. It’s not bad. It’s not good. It just is. \nYour mind is incredibly narrow, so I will stop the conversation here. But, there is no “test” to see if I still use cannabis in 10 years lol. I am perfectly capable of growing and healing and enjoying my own journey however I feel fit.\n\n[deleted]\n\nlol weed helps me be present. Honestly, my biggest irritation with the yogi and spirituality world is that everyone thinks their opinion is right for everyone else. The main reason people view weed in a negative light is because in most places around the world it was illegal for freaking ever. It’s a plant. From the earth. And it has so many benefits. Alcohol? Zero. Which I hate even comparing weed and alcohol, but just giving an example of something that is very much socially acceptable that is actual poison. How about everyone do what feels right/good for you and everyone else with an opinion do whatever you want and live your life. \nI love yoga high. I am in my body and feel so connected with my breath. It benefits my practice and I’m not escaping anything.\n\nI agree. I'm also sober and in recovery (5 years babyyyy). I am all about personal freedom, but I would for sure have a really bad practice if someone in the class rolled in smelling like alcohol or marijuana.\n\nWho told you weed is to escape?   For many, it helps to focus and be present.\n\nFor years I was not that fond of weed, except when mountain biking over rocks and on deadly cliffs.  And then, so high I could barely tie my shoes after, but when focusing,  one could barely detect a buzz.\n\n I'm just saying, weed is not like \"drugs\", it affects each person differently,  and helps many, not all, focus.\n\n57 now, smoke lightly, know when it helps and when it would hinder.\n\nYeah, same here. I partake plenty but don’t pair it with yoga frequently for exact reason. I like my ambient mindspace and how I explore that naturally with yoga!\n\nOooh judgement and misinformation - bet you're fun at parties.  \n\nI'm really disappointed to see this attitude in a yoga sub. I really thought people were more open minded here.\n\nOpen minded for whom?  This person is taking my experience and making it negative.  I utilize cannabis for pain management and CPTSD.  To have someone say it is an escape - when it is literally the only thing that has gotten me TO a yoga studio - is just GROSS.  \n\nOh I completely agree with you. I started doing yoga everyday day after cannabis got my c-ptsd in check. It was the only thing that stopped the darkness until I could stand on my own. I had a baby 2yrs ago and my condition spiraled cannabis reminded of who I am when the dark thoughts consumed every waking minute.\n\nWeed yoga is the best yoga\n\nThat's my morning routine. Coffee, smoke.. yoga. Highly recommended.\n\nOMG that sounds divine. But like... do you work after? When I wake and bake I have trouble focusing at work.\n\nNo I'm retired.  I've never worked baked. Although my focus is excellent in general. I don't need to drive either.\n\nThe effects of smoke fade within two hours. I and my husband work full time with no issues.\n\nAre you me?\n\nQuite possibly\n\nMy experience is that it is a bad, bad idea : Being high prevented me from being present in my body, which led to stretching deeper than my limit and that resulted in injuries that took weeks / months to heal.\n\nBe careful -- overstretching is a real thing and it's really painful\n\nMy experience was similar. Yoga gave me the self-regulation tools and confidence to realize that I was ready to retire my smoking habit, permanently. It didn’t take long to discover how the potent anti-inflammatory effects of MJ had been masking the elements of my practice where I was over extending myself. Why was my ass and neck suddenly so sore?! 😂 you live and learn.\n\nI went to a restorative class pretty stoned last weekend. It was great just rolling around on the floor stretching. So relaxing and fun.\n\nI call it cannabis cat yoga at my house! I have an aurora borealis projector lamp that sets the mood (this is an evening practice for me). I get an instructional video going and sometimes I mute it to put on my own music. And I'm usually fighting my cat for space on my mat. It's glorious!\n\nYes.  Juat in moderation.  Can’t be too gooey\nBut yes, gummy and hit a vape on the eay in…\nGood stuff!\n\nI’ve taken anywhere from 5-10mg of indica gummy before in-studio practice and here are my findings:\n\nA. I am increasingly grateful for the practice, my body, and what it can do.\n\nB. I’m less balanced- oops. Sorry Dancers Pose.\n\nC. I’m less hard on myself if I don’t hit the poses.\n\nD. I’m more willing to chat with people after class or compliment someone on their practice. \n\n10/10\n\nEdit: my studio is walking distance; no heavy machinery operation needed.\n\n1 thing i don't understand is the ego of individuals in modern-day yoga. \nKnow nothing yet pretend to be a know it all because you have read texts or attended multiple TTC or courses.\n\nI'm saying this because whenevr I call out bad behavior or wrongdoing anywhere or here, the kind of entitled offense people take on being told that something you are doing or believing is wrong, you may end up hurting yourself in one way or another.\n\nI sincerely want to know what most of here think yoga is? Subjectively taught and learned abstract systems dealing with a light-hearted or materialistic topic?\n\nThere are people actively damaging themselves and others who seek to learn from such individuals on a karmic level, for they are teaching something they themselves don't understand deeply and experientially, and are just simply going around pretending. \n\nDo whatever feels right to you in yoga, seems to have become an unsaid central philosophy of operating.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes, this is similar to my experience. Weed can feel like a shortcut or cheat code to relaxing and being present, but it leads to no where but dependence and confusion. Whereas yoga practice does actually hone clarity, patience, and surrender.\n\nAs a yoga teacher, you do what you want as long as you don't make it my problem. It's your practice.\n\nI also like to take a gummy about 30 minutes before I teach. I have a favorite kind and everything ✨\n\nDropping gummies and then teaching others seems like it crosses an ethical boundary. Don’t you owe it to your students to be clearheaded and present? I say this as someone who teaches yoga, and also has a medical marijuana recommendation. I partake in cannabis daily. I personally really enjoy the effects of cannabis on my personal asana practice. However I feel it would be disrespectful to offer practice to others while in that headspace. When people show up to a class, they have put their trust in us, that is a sacred thing that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Something to maybe think about.\n\nI took a class recently where I’m almost sure the teacher was stoned. I felt like she was in her own world and unable to connect with the students and hold space for us. I generally dislike being sober around others who are on substances, so in the future I will stay away from that teacher.\n\nYour feelings on this are valid.\n\nYikes, number one weed is legal and used for medical purposes. Do you say that shit to to people taking anti psychotics or anti depressants? It's disrespectful to tell other people what to do with their own bodies. It's unethical to shame people for taking meds that they say helps them.\nHere's a link for anyone who actually wants to learn about medicine:\n\nhttps://drexel.edu/cannabis-research/research/research-highlights/2023/\n\nI am a medical marijuana patient. Cannabis brings tremendous physical benefit to me as an individual. I also understand that cannabis has an effect on my mind as well as my body. Therefore when I am operating in my capacity as a yoga teacher I do not medicate before practice. I do this out of respect for my students, so that I may be fully present to hold space for them. No one is being shamed for using medicine, and I’m not sure how you came to that conclusion. \n\nAs far as legality is concerned; alcohol is legal too. Would you roll in to teach class after a couple drinks?\n\nThe fact that you are putting alcohol and cannabis into the same category just further proves you are not arguing in good faith. Also you can make as many statements as you please about YOURSELF, but you are not going to get away with pushing your opinions onto other people as \"ethics\" and \"respect\". You don't know anyone else in this group or what they and their doctor have decided helps them. Doctor's don't prescribe alcohol but they do prescribe cannabis. I guess a typical white Florida man wouldn't know the difference.\n\nCalm down. Maybe go do some yoga\n\nMaybe you should as well. If my comments bother you then you can just scroll past. Since cannabis saved my life and kept me from Killing myself I do feel very strongly about it and I will keep talking about it in case it saves someone else. ✌🏼\n\nNot sure what my race or current geographical location has to do with any of this. Feel free to ignore my opinion and enjoy the rest of your day. Maybe you could take a pause to reflect on your own reaction to my personal opinions/practices and why that is so upsetting. Up to you.\n\nI did it once and it wasn’t for me. I took an edible and was just dizzy and disconnected. I would’ve been ok being in shavasana the whole time lol\n\nAs a newbie, I have a hard enough time following along.  Would be great when I'm more experienced.\n\nThe 2 go together amazing, don't even get me started on psychs and yoga 🫠\n\nEh.. I don’t think marijuana is what yoga is about personally. I’ve done yoga to try to calm down when I’m too stoned before but in my opinion, yoga is supposed to be a healthy way to relax and connect body and mind. It can help you connect with your true self by itself. I have smoked a lot of weed but I’ll never be convinced that it’s without its consequences. Yoga alone is truly without negative consequence and the high is better if it’s done right. If yoga was just about stretching maybe marijuana would be interesting but since it’s about so much more I have to advise against it. Addictions are not the path.\n\nLol please no one get mad at me. It’s just my honest feeling on the subject.\n\nThat's how I start most mornings!\nAs someone who has their medical card due to fuckes up discs in my back, this has been such a game changer. Especially smoking then doing some yin early in the morning. I feel so good mentally after, and my body feels all ooey gooey in the best ways\n\ni love it for restore or slow flow classes but the heated power classes are more physically draining so I pass lol\n\n[removed]\n\nThat IS my opinion too. Remember, yogas chitta vritti nirodha, if You're stoned you're mind wont stop...\n\nI only practice at home and most of the time I’m baked while practicing. As long as you’re not bothering anyone I don’t see the harm.\n\nI read on this subreddit:Sundays are for smoking weed and doing Yin yoga and now I do that.\n\nI enjoy yoga and marijuana, also hot yoga and marijuana, it's just wholesome fun isn't it. Sometimes though for certain teachers I forego the whole getting high thing because some instructors at my studio do some really hard classes and that kinda harshes my buzz a bit\n\n100% agree. Much more focused on the poses and stretches are much deeper. Also gets me into the music I’m listening to while practicing.\n\nDefinitely agree - I focus so much more on my practice and don’t get distracted.  It’s more about how my body feels.\n\nAnyone doing drugs during Yoga isn't practicing real Yoga. Numbing out your senses is counter to the eight limbs. Off the mat is one thing, but if you really want to practice actual Yoga, that's going to take you away from the experience. Unless you're just practicing yoga for exercise, in which case please disregard this comment.\n\nNever tried it. Sounds nice\n\nI’ve found that my mind is sometimes more likely to wander or fill with other distractions or anxieties. I do better in yoga without cannabis.\n\nDue to medical concerns, I have had to be sober and not buzzed from anything else for nearly three decades. (CBD all I want, topically.) Edibles is better .\n..I hope I never have to smell/breathe in that stuff in a yoga studio in the future, wherein I could be breathing in secondhand weed smoke.\n\nFair enough. As stated my use is from the comfort of my home. No one should be smoking anything inside at all. unfortunately you can’t control the way people smell, but you’d only get second hand weed smoke if someone dead smoked in front of you.\n\nAgree and support, a mini-vape hit, but I did have a 10mg edible before a sound bath. It kept me awake, which was good. I'd worried that I would fall asleep and zzzzzzz\n\nSounds great but doing a headstand or any other more advanced positions high would terrify me. Stretching seems nice though.\n\nAll except number number 4. I will zone out and forget where I am in the routine. I don’t do a class just my own routine to music.\n\nI love smoken a fatty before class, gives me tingles\n\nIt’s such an amazing way to just tune out and drop in.\n\nMy breath and body connection plus the patience to hold poses all increase with a little bit of cannabis.\n\nI remember reading about a ganja yoga class. Must be in California.\n\nI do it too and it helps relax me for my evening wind down.\n\nStoned yoga not something I tried or thought about but we r all on a diff journey\n\nI find my balance is not as good. I wait till after class.\n\nIndica or sativa or whole plant?\n\nIt can be a fun experience but my balance is shot when stoned!\n\nFor me 420 and yoga is the only way I do it now, it is just by far best especially with a relaxing sativa.\n\nYou can feel every muscle fiber working together, you can feel every breath, its amazing\n\nIts amazing i agree. But, as someone who has abused the medicine as a drug for too long as a young fella it leaves me the realisation that although the 1hr/1.5hr class is deeper in alot of aspects it is reliant on that high to do so. I now am willing to do the work and time to reach such a state without relying on anything but the flow of prana. This do not get me wrong has not been easy to let go of and yes my practice has suffered. But its a sacrifice i have faith will pay off long term. Personal choice and experience only. Enjoy your journey and honour your path 🙏🦅\n\nI feel like it’s cheating (for myself) in a yin or restorative class.  In a more active class I think it would affect my balance and concentration.  I remember after my first yin class I said wow I feel drunk. It was amazing.\n\nWell nothing tops light exercise / stretching or yoga on the influence of ket 😛\n\nGlad to hear you’re doing it from home. It’s not particularly fun practicing next to someone that smokes weed—the stench alone is terrible and distracting.\n\nYoga studios are lovely places to practice focusing on yourself\n\nAbsolutely, but you can’t do that if you can’t focus on your breathe. Like I said, distracting and takes away from being in the present moment.\n\nThat is you letting yourself be distracted by it. Everybody has things they find distracting. It's great to practice focusing on yourself through the distraction. Weed is the least obnoxious smell I've had to sit near which is obviously personal preference. I get migraines from strong smelling soap but I would never blame my lack of connection and being present on another person.\n\nLike you said, it’s a personal preference, and I find it obnoxious and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. There are certainly things you can try to shift with your focus and certainly things you can reorient in your own mind, but visceral responses is not something within your control. I still practice non judgment and don’t blame people, but applause efforts of people who choose to be a little more considerate of others when they can be.\n\nI don’t need a class.  I have smoked then done yoga for the last year. Listen to my body and just let it do what it needs to do.\n\nI smoked with a friend just before we went onto class. We were hoping for an experience as you described. What actually happened was that we turned into giggle monsters and the instructor had to come over to stand between us for the rest of the class.🫠\n\nI do this all the time at home! I took a break while traveling, but now I’m in Thailand at a yoga retreat and I may have to hit a dispensary for my flow tonight…. It’s just a beautiful feeling.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo so many! I’m on Samui, and you see one every literal block! Apparently around 2 years ago it got legalized and they started popping up. I just grabbed a few joints at a dispo yesterday and we were curious about the timeline!\n\nI get so much deeper into the breath and hatha style meditation on weed.\n\ni very often practice with marijuana beforehand. the only aspect of stoned practice i find challenging is balance poses. i keep a vape pen near my mat in my home studio space and will often sit and do since breathework and vape before practice.\n\nIt makes you hit your runners higher like in 5 mins instead of 25 mins. It’s amazing before hot yoga class. It’s even better with friends. It’s absolutely an amazing combo. \n\n95% of the time I've ever done yoga I was stoned. I have anxiety as well as pretty severe ADHD and this definitely puts my head in the right spot to relax into the poses and be in the moment.\n\nI live in a small town on Vancouver Island and have never thought of doing yoga stoned. Great idea.\n\nWhen I do either yin or restorative yoga I’ll puff puff beforehand. My practice is relaxing and I’m able to go a little deeper too.\n\nWow! I wish I could have this experience on weed. It just makes me paranoid and I can’t shut my brain down. \n\nMy preference is to practice without any substances so I can be grounded and in the present moment.\n\nWe have a nightclub that hosts 420 yoga on Saturdays. They always have a DJ with vibey music and everyone leaves that class with a smile on their face. Instructors are so good at keeping you present too.\n\nWell, you are in good company historically.  There's a traditional association of cannabis and yoga.  Even Shiva, the deity credited with the creation of yoga, is associated with cannabis.  While visiting Nepal, it was interesting to note that cannabis growing wild all over the country, and to learn a bit of the history of religious cannabis celebrations that were openly practiced before the US war on drugs came to Nepal.  There's a great article that Harper's published about that recently-ish.\n\nAs to my own experience, I use cannabis very lightly, but almost never for practicing yoga.  Couldn't really say why. I will say that the occasion's that I have were because (and it is rare) I was feeling anxious while high, and felt like a nice breath-based flow would be grounding, and that is the case.  I have, though, had many students tell me that they benefit from using cannabis with practice.  I would never judge that.\n\nShould’ve tried this when i was still in california lol\n\nIts up there with the dumbest things you could ever possibly do. Darwin award worthy.\n\nyikes!\n\nSame to you.\n\nI think you might need to explore the world a bit more if your perception of the dumbest thing in the world to do is to practice yoga with marijuana.\n\nIf you think that's good, you should try it with 🍄\n\nI do hot or warm yoga with it and it's a game changer\n\nYou guys do sober yoga? Wow.\n\nI feel pretty disappointed in the judgement and uneducated shaming some commenters have made. I use everyday for medical reasons. The only advice I can give is ignore all comments who make general statements about cannabis involving \"people\" having negative outcomes. These are purely bs statements. I've attached actual studies \n\nhttps://drexel.edu/cannabis-research/research/research-highlights/2023/\n\nI like to smoke before Yoga, too. I also like to take Kratom for yoga, which is great as a muscle relaxer and helps a lot.\n\nUh me but with microdosing ketamine lol don’t fear I have a prescription it’s for PTSD. I love yoga, yes I’m coping in weird ways it is what it is lol, good day to yall.\n\nHow wonderful that your experience was good! I think it helps shift my mindset to zen and prepare for the day’s practice. I also like to light a candle or a few (make sure to keep them a safe distance from you and your mat) to curate the energy. From time to time, I lay my crystals on my chest (vertically on my sternum) during shavasana, I feel like it cleans and balances my energy.  Namaste🧘‍♀️\n\nHonestly LOVE weed &amp; yoga 🧘🏻‍♀️\n\nI always thought it would be cool to open up a 420 studio where one could smoke and do yoga.\n\nDude Yogis have been getting stoned for eons and cannabis opens the third eye. Yes\n\nMonday seems like Monday…Tuesday feels like Tuesday \n.\n\na lot of people in this thread blaming ganja for the lack of their own body awareness and limits."

    "all_comment_text": "hahaha are we in the same class?! no but seriously I have one of those, he also does jumping jacks LOL. I try my hardest to use him as my practice for patience, woooosaaaa\n\nOmg I'm laughing at the jumping jacks. I don't even understand how one would feel inspired to start jumping around and clapping during a yoga class. It's like, not a jumpy clappy vibe\n\nIt’s right before 26&amp;2 begins and everyone in class is laying in savasana 😂😂😂\n\nEveryone is laying quietly and he’s breathing like Lamaze class doing jumping jacks and high knees, I wish I was joking haha it used to drive me crazy, now I just appreciate living in a Seinfeld episode\n\nThis is such a Seinfeld ass situation lol. \n\nCourtesy of ChatGPT:\n\nINT. MONK’S CAFE - DAY\n\nJerry and Elaine are sitting in their usual booth. Jerry sips his coffee, while Elaine looks frustrated, stirring her tea aggressively.\n\nELAINE\nJerry, you will not believe what happened in my yoga class today.\n\nJERRY\n(with a smirk)\nYoga drama? This I gotta hear.\n\nELAINE\n(sighs)\nSo, we’re in the middle of shavasana—total relaxation, right? And there’s this guy, Brad, new to the class. Suddenly, he jumps up and starts doing jumping jacks!\n\nJERRY\nJumping jacks? During shavasana? That’s like doing the Macarena at a funeral.\n\nELAINE\nExactly! Everyone’s lying there, completely still, and all you hear is “One, two, three, four!” It’s insane!\n\nJERRY\nWhat’s with this guy? Does he think he’s in boot camp?\n\nELAINE\nI don’t know! It’s like he has no concept of relaxation. He’s there to work out, no matter what.\n\nJERRY\nSo, what did the instructor do? Did she just let him get his cardio on?\n\nELAINE\nShe tried to gently remind him that it’s a relaxation pose. But Brad’s all, “I can’t just lie there. I need to keep my heart rate up.”\n\nJERRY\n(sarcastically)\nOf course. Because nothing says peace and tranquility like a high-intensity workout.\n\nELAINE\nAnd then, he starts lecturing us about how shavasana is a waste of time and that we should be using every minute to burn calories.\n\nJERRY\nThe nerve! It’s yoga, not CrossFit!\n\nELAINE\nI know! And get this, after class, he comes up to me and says, “You know, you really should try adding more cardio to your routine.”\n\nJERRY\n(shocked)\nNo!\n\nELAINE\nYes! I wanted to scream, “This is yoga, Brad! It’s about inner peace, not your six-pack!”\n\nJERRY\nBrad needs to namaste his way out of that class.\n\nELAINE\n(laughing)\nExactly! Maybe I’ll suggest he try spin class. You can’t interrupt a spin class with jumping jacks.\n\nJERRY\nOr maybe he should just run a marathon and leave yoga to the rest of us sane people.\n\nELAINE\nAmen to that.\n\nThey both laugh as the waitress comes over to refill their cups.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nLOL! \n\nPerfect. It’s basically the same conversation I have with my brother.. \n\nMe: well, guess who was in class again \nBrother: not the jumping jack guy?! \n\nThis guys my Newman 😂😂\n\nYeah I’m surprised ChatGPT spit it out in one try. It’s starting to get really good lol.\n\nWow i have not been using chatGPT correctly\n\nlol. I use it for work so I have the $20 a month premium subscription that lets you use their newest model as much as you want. But yeah, there’s definitely ways of prompting it to ensure it makes better content. \n\nThe new model is significantly better though. Like all did was say ‘write me a script for a Seinfeld scene where Eileen is telling Jerry about a man that does jumping jacks in her yoga class’ and this was the first thing it spit out lol. I was impressed and surprised I didn’t have to prompt it any further.\n\nThat's crazy, it used to have that crazily whimsical tone I can't stand\n\nYeah, I know what you mean. The new one is a lot better especially with the correct prompts. Like a year ago it probably would have given me something terrible. Like now it legit understands the show, how the characters would talk, their cadence, the pacing and the jokes without me having to explain anything to it. I’m actually as surprised as everyone else it was that good lol.\n\nI read that in each of their voices. Bravo, ChatGPT.\n\nYeah the newest version has gotten a lot better!\n\nLmaooo... I love an extra warm-up before yoga too!! The difference is, I namely practice at home but if I go to an in-person class, I could never have the gall to do that inside of the classroom. I have however, done that in the parking lot for 5-10 mins hahahah. I am out there all by myself though, not disrupting the peace!! I get my extra warm-up/my little sweat on &amp; then I grab my mat &amp; walk right on inside for my class :D\n\nIt’s actually possible in my yoga class. We’re in a studio portion of the gym with the lights dim and hippie music playing and all that. Across the gym is a place called “hoop house”. Those guys like their hip hop. They have an industrial grade sound switch 18” subwoofers and all of that. Sometimes then they crank up something bassey I have to hold back the laughter. The rhythmic thumping cutting through the walls just makes the scene hilarious 😆\n\nI go to yoga classes in a gym, and the Zumba instructor likes to make these horrible high-pitched “whoop whoop” sounds that we can hear through the wall during savasana. We can’t hear the music, just the rhythmic screaming - it’s that loud. It’s kind of absurdly funny, really.\n\nLol, there's a chick in my class who looks like Abbi from Broad City. She will stand up and literally start running in place during class. \n\nIt makes me laugh to myself because not only does she look just like her, but I feel as though it's something cringe Abbi's character would do in the show.\n\nI'm an adult!!\n\nThis is totally something Abbi would do when she got hyper competitive 😂😂😂\n\nI just always remember the yoga episode where Ilana squished her way between two men while Abbi got sweated on\n\nMe before yoga: “Hey, Jack.  Jump your happy ass outside with that shit.”  Me after Yoga: “Namaste.”\n\nI think my guy tops jumping jacks guy. Not only does he arrive late… and leave early. He likes to shadow box on his mat mid flow.. as annoying as that is it’s the leaving early that gets me… it’s disruptive and honestly he could use Shavasana more than most in there.\n\nOmg not jumping jacks! 😆\n\nJumping jacks too holy crap!\n\nWhy am I laughing so hard while picturing this?\n\nThere’s always that one guy… and it’s always a guy. What’s up with that? I have one of those too. If I run into him in a class I’m less likely to go to that class again.\n\nBelieve it or not in my class, its a 75 year old woman who is doing crunches while the rest of us are in savasana!\n\nYep. Always one. I've also seen a few girls go to a regular class and just do their own completely different flow. Super distracting and pointless. They always do it in the front row. Probably Narcissistic people doing it for attention.\n\nI use “figit lady” in my 26 &amp; 2 class as a source of personal growth 😂\n\nOmg wanna say the same thing. Dude with a military care cut in a vinyasa flow class was busting out push-ups grunting during every chaturangaua. It was wiiiiiild \n\nI practiced with a dude who just got right to the point.\nHe put his big fat wallet at the head of his mat during hot yoga.\n\nI don't want to defend this man but maybe it's to keep an eye on valuables that he doesn't trust using a locker for??\n\nWhy…. Why would you do that haha. Maybe he was late to class and realized he had it in his pocket and didn’t wanna run out to put it away???\n\nHe was a regular and did that every class.\n\nSo weird…\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nHe's wealth signaling.\n\nthat's a thing? I'm glad I live under a rock sometimes. Weird world we are living in\n\nI'd laugh my ass out at it 😂\n\nDoes a wallet’s size have any correlation to a person’s wealth? \n\nI agree with the person below that he’s just keeping his wallet on her person cause he doesn’t trust the lockers.\n\nSavasana is the most difficult pose. You have to be with yourself. People who can’t or won’t have a lot of self exploring to do.\n\nFor a long time, I couldn't do savasana without bursting into tears. So I would quietly roll up my mat and make my way to the exit. \n\nI still prefer to meditate through movement, but I've worked through a lot of my trauma, and I can be still without crying now.\n\nI've burst into tears mid practice and in savasana. For me it's usually been triggered by the music the instructor puts on. Like, please no sad sounding music, especially around the holidays. \nOnce after a break up, I was in class and the instructor put on some \"marry me\" song and I started crying and the girl on the mat next to me asked me if I was okay. I kind of wish she would have just ignored me but she was trying to be nice.\n\nI cry on the mat all the time! I had a really hard year and I'm actually really grateful when it comes out on the mat because often in my day to day life I have a hard time letting it out.\n\nI sometimes sob in a long child's pose, I feel so light and free after.\n\nThat’s good. I’ve had that happen only once. It was really awkward but the instructor was so nice about it. Here’s to your healing! 🫂\n\nI totally agree with this. Dude’s doing yoga for all the wrong reasons and hasn’t found a therapist yet would be my guess\n\nYou are passing judgment and making assumptions.  You are not aware why this person is doing this or what their reasons are. Perhaps they have a therapist and they are being encouraged to actively do what feels right, as opposed to caring about opinions of others, because  that’s is healthy for them.\n\nYeah no shit\n\nPlease tell us more about how you know all the “right” reasons for doing yoga and why you are so sure some stranger you don’t know has the “wrong” ones.\n\nBruh, doing pushups and sit-ups in a yoga class is straight up *not* apart of the curriculum. And would actually take away from people’s ability to focus and center themselves.\n\nDo you even know *why* people do yoga in the first place? How tf you expect to be able to balance/quiet your mind and get your energy smoothed out while you got some dude huffin and puffin through sit ups and pushups like some anxiety induced crackhead. It disrupts the entire vibe and energy of the room AND the LITERAL reason for being in yoga.\n\nTo chill the fuck out lmao.\n\nEveryone has their own reasons for practicing. Some are more fitness minded, some do it to relax, others do it to practice spirituality. There’s nothing inherently wrong with creating your own practice in the studio. And yes, that can involve push-ups and sit-ups. Whether or not someone is being disruptive with their breathing or something else is a different discussion, but there’s nothing wrong with making fitness a primary focus of your practice. You’re definitely imposing your own interpretation of the “purpose” of yoga on others.\n\nHow do you expect to be able to balance/quiet your mind if you let something as simple as a guy doing pushups bother you so endlessly?  You have a choice whether you allow people like that to have such an effect on you. Who cares what their reasons are for being there or whether they are something you consider valid? It’s not really any of your business. It is about practicing  *despite* distractions,  not practicing *without* them.\n\nPeople in yoga *classes*, are not experts in mind body spirit functions… there is a reason it’s called *classes*… so people can *learn* how to do what you’ve said.\n\nIf you are at the level where you can intuitively and instinctually not have it bother you; then practice *mindfulness* and understand that most people are not at that level… hence why they are *learning* in *classes*\n\nYou ok? I am so sorry that on a thread talking about this dude - who is being a problem for all the other people in his class - I passed some judgement onto him. I explicitly said: “would be my guess”. Sorry for the thought. This dude is probably a stand up mature and totally self aware righteous individual.\n\nI love this \n\nIt reminds me I'm actually going to die and that makes me feel so free\n\nMaybe tell him this fact and challenge him by saying he must not be able to do it....\n\nI know a few guys who throw a few push-ups into their sun salutations, if you're not looking at them, you wouldn't notice. But doing it just randomly during floor time is kinda ridiculous.\n\nI had an instructor comment about this in the past-- re: another student, not me.\n\nShe said something like 'you do you boo', but it was kind of judgemental and sarcastic, which left me with a bad taste.\n\nI wonder if he can do what he needs silently-- sans grunting-- and that would solve the issue.\n\nMy thoughts exactly! Is it out of the norm to be doing push-ups during a gentle class? Absolutely. Is the point of yoga to conform to norms regardless of individual needs? Nope. It seems like an opportunity for several people to explore communication and consideration.\n\nI will say, I'd put the onus more on the teacher to ask him to reduce his volume level, but teacher may not be bothered by the noise or may not know that others are, which would put it on them to communicate that they are.\n\nUltimately I see it similarly as a person taking a child's pose for their own needs. If they're doing that while doing an indie cover of a broken dishwasher, yeah that's distracting to others. But if they're just quietly moving or not moving their body in a way that is supportive to them and not infringing on others' space, then let them do what they need to do.\n\nIt's not the same at all as a child's pose/rest though. Jumping around and grunting while people are trying to meditate is like quietly taking rest?\n\nApologies, I think I miscommunicated my ultimate point: if what they are doing/not doing with their body is not infringing on space or making excessive noise then it's fine. What he is doing *is* infringing on space and making excessive noise, so it is not okay. If he can find a way to do what he is doing without infringing on space/making excessive noise then I would consider that him just making modifications for himself. If he's ignoring the teacher completely and just doing something else for the entirety of class, that is a whole other issue that should also be communicated about.\n\nYeah I do this, but only a couple between Up-dog and Down-dog. Pushup Guy needs to chill.\n\nAsk the teacher about it after class some time. Could be she was not aware it bothered anyone or could be she’s brought it up to the owner and told to let him be.\n\n100% \n\nTell the instructor and if it isn't addressed before the end of your next session contact the studio or gym manager (probably a group exercise manager if its a bigger gym or chain i.e. YMCA). Or contact them both before you next session. \n\nIt's a gentle yoga class. This behavior shows a misunderstanding of yoga at best, or extreme selfishness and disregard for peers. \n\nAlso shame on this subreddit for not upvoting the comment above mine and the others similar that recommend going to the teacher.\n\nSome of these comments are definitely sus! Especially the ones protecting and advocating for his behavior. If it’s a paid yoga class, in a communal environment, there’s absolutely zero reason to go rogue and be so selfish.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPush ups are regularly recommended by health practitioners and benefit muscle growth and bone density important for living a long healthy life. \n\nThe practice of them is not an endorsement of hate or violence as you suggest. \n\nPerhaps you should continue to be supportive of the community aspect of yoga without defaming other practices.\n\nI lift and do yoga and am a guy and I hate these guys. I do kettle bell cleans at the gym and just realized maybe the rest of the class hasn’t seen me be good at kettle bells! I’ll be sure to bring them next time so everyone knows. But seriously I hate this because 1) everyone in the class is good and something they’re not doing in class, maybe the runners should run around? 2) if you’re a strong dude with solid upper body strength three or five extra pushups is not much exercise. It really is just showing off that your body is built for pushups, an exercise that serves no practical purpose.\n\nPushups have no practical purpose?\n\nI completely understand why this is bothering people and that it is not a place in that case but saying pushups have no practical purpose and yoga does is weird.\n\nI practiced in studio through the pandemic once the studios reopened. Class sizes were limited so that there was 6 feet between mats. It was tough to get in because of the severe limitations. One lady would take the class consistently but I don't think she ever did one pose with the rest of the class. It was a set series and she was out there on her own planet. After about a month of this the teacher kind of lost it and told her if she wasn't going to do the class she could use the empty room next door. The woman got very huffy and stopped coming. It was a much better class from that point forward and I still practice with that teacher some times.\n\nI’ve come across a few of those. I certainly don’t mind if you move into crow from malasana or kick into handstand from standing split, more power too you for expanding the pose! But there are times where someone is in a completely different world.  \n\n I can ignore them. But if they are taking a spot from someone who wants to do the teacher led flow? Absolutely not. I’d be so annoyed \n\nSometimes others are seeming community and the energy of the space, not the specific instructions\n\nEvery community has norms. If one seeks community, one must at least attempt to figure out what those norms are and how to relate to them.\n\nIn my experience most yoga studious do not strictly enforce the poses, in fact most of them I've been to have said \"this is your practice, if your body isn't feeling a pose feel free to disregard it.\"\n\nI am a teacher and I had a friend that was visiting from out of town join my gentle class. During savasana he kept stretching and doing more advanced poses like crow. It was so distracting and I felt it was disrespectful. I never experienced anything like it. After, I was like- what the hell man, what are you doing?! I think he got the hint. Definitely talk to the teacher. I’m very open to people modifying or staying in positions longer if it is working for them and catch up with us later. But this was wild. The push up man is on another level. A different fitness class or a power vinyasa may be a better fit for him. If I was the teacher I would explain the benefits of a gentle yoga class and give him a schedule of other offerings if gentle is not meeting his needs.\n\nReminds me of the behavior of little boys trying to outdo each other.\n\nYES and all the men in here commenting \"it's my practice I do what I want\" need to go make nasty grunting noises somewhere else. If I wanted to hear that shit I would go to the weight room or the basketball court.\n\nYES and all the men in here commenting \"it's my practice I do what I want\" need to go make nasty grunting noises somewhere else. If I wanted to hear that shit I would go to the weight room or the basketball court.\n\nWell I’m going to sympathize here with continuing to do stretching postures. I’m personally as warm and fluid as I’m going to be all day at the end of yoga and often go do another workout after. \n\n(Just so I don’t have to reply to it calisthenics during rest is silly)\n\nBut I’m talking about pigeon or supine twist etc not crow. Crow is a bit distracting. \n\nI didn't know crow was advanced for a gentle class. If anything, that could be the crescendo of a gentle practice for me.\n\nNice! I think I could consider it gentle in my own practice as well. My current gentle class regulars have been practicing less than a year and some have significant physical limitations. We have a ways to go before we get there but I’ve been doing some crow progression work in other classes to start introducing it to them. One day!\n\nReminds me of the behavior of little boys trying to outdo each other.\n\nif it’s not intense enough, workout needs to be done before or after.\n\nThis. That's why I do something prior usually.. I like to be very warmed up for the stretchy Asanas. I have actually done jumping jacks/High knees in the parking lot before class for about 5-10 mins.. but I parked away from everyone and was embarrassed when my girlfriend who was meeting me one time\"caught me\"hahaha. I like to have blood flow but everyone is different(just takes me a long time to limber up bc I sit a lot). My point is, I did it alone and away from everyone in the lot lol. Or I will ride my bike to the studio if it's close.. stuff like that. Hope on a bike at the gym if it's a gym class, beforehand. Very easy to not disrupt everyone omg I can not imagine.\n\nIt's such a fine line between \"doing your own practice\" and killing the vibe. Bring it up to the teacher and I'm sure she can gently suggest other modifications to him -- holding chaturanga, for example.\n\nDoing your own practice would be stuff like mysore based on their experience, or to add some variations based on their level - not to do whatever they want whenever they want :/\n\nDo your own practice at home not at a studio.\n\nYeah, I mean pushups are weird and an extreme, but I personally see people modifying poses to make them easier/harder all the time. If you're not a nuisance, then I'm cool with it\n\nNo most studios encourage you to do your own, reddit is not a reflection of real life.  99% of yoga teachers would never say anything except maybe about the grunting because its a bunch of adults doing a hobby together and yoga is about being one with your own body.\n\nMost studios around here would probably have a problem with it, especially if it was noisy and disruptive.\n\nLike I said, the only issue most teachers would have is the grunting.\n\nWell, and if someone is jumping around or something noisy during savasana or getting in others' spaces. \n\nBut I strongly suspect someone repeatedly disregarding the group practice to do their own thing entirely would be invited to participate with the group or to do their own thing in their own space.\nMost are very strict with arrival times and I have been in classes where instructors have announced at the start that no one is to leave early during savasana (barring an emergency) because the packing up and leaving is disruptive.\n\nMost studios??? Not in my world. Yoga is about the total destruction of the ego it has nothing to do with being one and attached to the body.\n\nYoga is most certainly about realizing your total awareness, being in touch with your body.  You used the word attached.\n\nDestruction of ego and being attached to the body  can mean doing your own thing because that’s what the body wants, and not caring what others think about it.\n\n[deleted]\n\n😝😝 love it\n\nBring it up with the teacher. This is ridiculous. My studio has a \"community agreements\" that addresses this yet still leaves space for students to vary their practice in a reasonable way:\n\n&gt;BRAHMACHARYA (moderation/right use of energy):**​**We conscientiously utilize our energy both personally and collectively. Rest, vigor, or exploration along that spectrum are all welcome as it feels appropriate during class. Simultaneously, we acknowledge the impact of our actions and words and strive towards right use of that energy in a way that supports ourselves and the collective. Our studio facilitates an environment that encourages individual exploration of movement. That being said, we encourage students to use their best judgment when adjusting sequences or taking breaks. Group classes can inevitably lead to myriad distractions and, when possible, we do our best to minimize those distractions. For instance, if a student feels compelled to move in a manner that largely differs from what's offered in class, they are encouraged to set up in the back of the studio, attend class virtually, or use the accessible spaces in each studio.\n\nAfter reading this closely, I feel like the last sentence could we worded more strongly but I think they are trying to use a subtler and less confrontational tone. At any rate, after years of classes in this studio, I haven't once encountered one of this push up guys, so they are doing something right.\n\nI agree with this paragraph, but feel compelled to highlight something--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;if a student feels compelled to move in a manner that ***largely*** differs from what's offered in class, they are encouraged to set up in the back of the studio, attend class virtually, or use the accessible spaces in each studio.\n\nAlright I know this isn't a 'legal contract', but this language makes a certain side of my mind come out...\n\nWhat does 'largely' mean? Who determines what 'largely differs'?\n\nAnd what about the opposite-- say I want to take a child's pose instead of an intense sequence. And that 'largely differs.' Are they going to give me the boot?\n\nFrom a 'reasonable person' standpoint, it sounds like the behavior OP is describing does 'largely differ'. \n\nIt's unclear if it's the grunting/noise that is disruptive...or something else. Obv if you're laying down (as OP describes), you're staring at the ceiling, so you can't see the other students...so it's not *seeing* dude doing pushups...\n\nDefinitely something for the instructor or owner to address\n\nThis is a grey zone and the agreement tries to strike a balance that I think is reasonable and just about anyone with self-awareness and courtesy will understand that you should not be jumping around during a seated opening with concentrated breathing exercises.\n\nAt this same studio, the instructors make a point to say that \"the poses I'm guiding you through are just suggestions\" and they are always encouraging you to personalize the poses and adjust to your own body, etc. etc. They offer options at different points. They always encourage rest poses; nobody cares if you sit out a round of sun salutations in child's pose. What they are trying to avoid is situations where the whole class is doing  meditative breathing and another student decides it's a good idea to do jumping jacks which will distract everyone. \n\nThese agreements are there to set a tone, and it seems to work. In 7+ years there, hundreds of classes, I've never encountered the push up guy. The only bad behavior I ever saw was a guy-girl couple who were acting really goofy, raunchy and disruptive in class. I think they were stoned because they were falling all over the place and looked spacey. The instructor told them to knock it off and they mostly did. I don't count their behavior as the same as the push up guy, they were just being idiots.\n\nThat makes sense. \n\nI actually have never encountered a 'pushup guy' firsthand, either...a past instructor commented on a guy who threw in an extra pushup or two during sun salutation, and recounted this in a critical way...I was thinking 'maybe he just wants to work out some excess energy...why does that bother you??'\n\nI always felt extra wary of being scrutinized/judged. Over the years, I have had many \\[generally older\\] ladies comment to me, things like 'are you a dancer?', and innocent yet intrigued comments about my flexibility...I always practice in the back, ideally a corner. So I'm generally out of the 'line of sight'. The owner/instructor of my current studio calls me 'my butterfly'. But it's a good-feeling, safe place at this studio.\n\nThank you for the emotionally mature response, btw-- realized after I commented that it might 'trigger' someone if they were on edge/took it personally...but it seems you understood my intention.\n\nRecommend he go to a barre class for a more intense workout\n\nOr HIIT based cardio / strength class. We do nothing but that kind of stuff with dumbbells in our hands. That’s the place he could bounce around all he wants and fit right in lol\n\nOr even just a power/strength flow class. Why join a Gentle &amp; do this? I do Gentle flows when I'm taxed but still want some movement/that isn't restorative(or I use it as a cool down from a hard workout). Odd to do this in this style, of all modalities\n\nIMO he’s doing it to boost his ego. I want him to join a barre class so he can get his ass handed to him while surrounded by women breezing through it.\n\nloll.. YESSSS\n\nFor all the people here that suggest we should not be irritated by such behaviour: maybe there should be special classes with lots of distractions, maybe a stationary bike or two, a few people listening to their own music or are in the phone for everyone to be able to practice acceptance and being able to let go. That would leave all the others to a sane yoga session.\n\ncommunicationg with the guy or your teacher should do it. Maybe you can even reccomend him some more intense yoga classes (if your school offers them) because its clear that it might be something he is interested in.\n\nThe teacher needs to address this. The first step to learning is to pay attention. This man is showing by his behavior that he isn’t listening to her.\n\nI agree with you. It’s baffling to see some of the comments that mention how yoga is about focusing inward and using this guy to work on patience, which yes, we all know these are great things to work on as we practice, but this situation is ridiculous and rude to the instructor and students. \n\nIt is one thing to modify and do your own thing at times, but this is a GENTLE yoga class with someone doing pushups and making loud sounds. That’s not cool and very inconsiderate. \n\nAs someone else mentioned and yourself—the teacher needs to address this and then possibly mention other power yoga classes that may be in line with what this student is looking for.\n\nTeachers aren't taught how to teach. They are shown how to demonstrate poses, not how to take control of a classroom and create an experience for the students.\n\nUh that sounds like nonsense. Teachers 100% teach, they absolutely do help create an atmosphere and experience for the students, they just usually aren't tyrants about it.\n\nMy background is in professional learning design. I also have a long background in yoga; I moderated a large discussion board related to yoga for a well known teacher where I was able to connect with teachers all over the world.\n\nWhen I started learning about the field of learning design, I felt like a big piece of the puzzle that is missing from yoga teacher training fell into place. \n\nIn yoga forums, I see so many questions about how to handle a classroom which are pretty easy to understand when you know how people learn best. This kind of behavior happens all the time in yoga classes, and teachers are generally not taught how to manage a classroom or why they need to do it. \n\nI think it's important for teachers to understand that in order to learn, students need to pay attention. A student who comes and distracts the rest of the class and demonstrates that he is not listening needs to be addressed, but a lot of teachers are afraid of \"judging\" a student who is just doing their own thing, listening to their own inner prompting. It's not judging to keep a room focused on your instruction; that's what I would like teachers to understand.\n\nThis is why I do yoga at home almost exclusively.  You can’t control other people and half the people on this forum will tell you you aren’t a good enough yogi if you can’t keep your mind on your own mat and not be distracted by others.  So say something if you want, or don’t go to class.\n\nI have a wonderful home practice as well for these reasons. I went to a pop up yoga class at a brewery with a friend recently and the yoga instructor was loudly playing harp music to drown out the really loud rock music the brewery was playing, the mic kept going in and out with loud, scratching static each time, and one participant moved her mat every 15 minutes to stay in the sun so she could tan, wore a swimsuit to class and everything. So yeah, it could be that I am not a good enough yogi for letting that distract me, or it could also be that these things are distracting and are abrasive to the practice.\n\nWhy can’t I scream in a library?! \n\nSome people just can’t read a room over their own wants and needs.\n\nIf you were a real yogi you wouldn’t hear the scream.\n\nlol.  Exactly.  I’m so weary of people saying I need to just drown everything out.\n\nI know for a fact that my instructor would stand for that nonsense for about .001 seconds. My guess is she would most likely go over to him and quietly tell him that his behavior was disruptive and he's welcome to stay but needs to make adjustments.\n\nUnacceptable behaviour. Pose modifications are ok, this is not. Talk to management.\n\nI’m a regular weightlifer 4x a week (heavy weights too), yoga 2x\nMy yoga instructor has called me out more than a few times!\n“Il Magn1f1co! This is not a weight lifting class! Relax your (insert body part here)\nShe does it a lot, I love it when she does too.\n\nNow I am really glad I can do my yoga in the privacy of my home...on my own.\n\nPrint out some flyers for hiit classes and paper the right side of the floor so he is sure to see one.\n\nI find it absolutely asinine for someone to choose a gentle yoga class for an intense workout.\n\nHe is extremely rude, regardless of how entertaining. The instructor should've asked him to cut it out the first time quietly after class.\n\nIf you can't get rid of him, you could join him, or all of those there for yoga only, can try to find a new class.\n\nThis is why I yoga at home or occasionally in a local park with an instructor who doesn't put up with that.\n\nHaha. Oh man. That stinks. I did a Yoga Sculpt class (like a fitness yoga) which are really intense as is, the teacher puts a lot of work into the sequence, and this girl shows up and basically just does her own thing. I can understand modifications, or maybe throwing in something extra here and there, but why even come to the space if you're just going to totally do your own thing. Worst of all, the teacher gently asked her to try to stick to the sequence during the class and she straight up ignored her. It's definitely a practice in itself to not be bothered, but it's no doubt distracting because you're supposed to be sharing the space in community. It should be up to your teacher to say something.\n\nAgreed, while concentration is a part of yoga, from this post it's clearly not only the OP who's being affected, it's the entire class when they're in savasana.\n\nIts some of the vibes you get from classes in a gym where people just see it as movement or a workout, then you get these gym bros with massive egos thinking they're so amazing. I'd throw in some harder poses to shut down their ego where a lot of yogis can do but these basic showoffs would struggle with. Being in a class though that isnt mine would be so cringey to watch. I'd bring it up for sure\n\nI'm sorry that you are having this experience but this is too funny lol\n\nI just got out of class and there was a push up one legged chatarunga guy in there. It was a power class. He couldn't keep it up. He was sitting there staring at everyone by 30 minutes in. I don't get it. Like, you're burning through all of your stamina for these idiotic push ups. No one thinks you're cool, push up guy!\n\nHaha reminds me when the teacher suggests “you can stay in childs pose if u want its your practice…” and i think to myself “what if i stay in childs pose for the entire class” 😂\n\nthere are some people in my studio that just lay in sivasana for half the class. that doesn't distract me but pushups and situps would!\n\nI take a hot yoga class in studio and from time to time I will see a lady who lies on her mat the entire class.\n\n\nI think she comes for the peaceful music and the heat. It doesn't bother me, and if anything makes it easier for others to feel comfortable taking a break when they need it. \n\nYeah but child's pose isn't disruptive. If you want to sit there quitely with your head down go for it but don't be jumping around all loud and ish, that's not cool.\n\nHaha true true!! At least he wasnt doing burpees … or was he?? Maybe he thought he was in the HITT class 😂\n\nWhat the heck? It’s GENTLE yoga.\n\nI had a guy last place I lived that would go a bunch of push ups before Savasana and then pant through savasana while we were trying to relaxed. Also made me crazy no one said anything to him.\n\nI used to go to a class and there was a guy who used to wear a heavy tracksuit and sweat an insane amount. Sweat would be flying everywhere and he would have this wet ring around him. I guess he was trying to do something but it was really awkward for people next to him that would cop his sweat. After a while a new person just hit him up in the middle of class and told him that it was gross and arrogant to put himself before everyone else. He never wore the tracksuit again.\n\nI had one of them in a glass once. I think they just like an audience for their push ups\n\nYeah talk to the teacher. As a teacher I would have addressed it already. Especially in my gentle class. There's plenty of options I don't offer or demonstrate in that class.\n\nEven in the vinyasa class when I give freedom I'll give guidance... Take an inversion of your choice. Before savasana, if there's any last quiet pose you need, take it now i.e. take a stretch, don't be launching into your handstand now. If they're adding extra pushups in a vinyasa sequence great. If it's at the end of class when we're cooling down that's a problem\n\nI’d bring it up to the teacher and then the manager of the studio. It’s fine if he wants to do his own practice at home, but this sounds really disruptive and quite frankly like narcissistic and selfish behavior.\n\nIt also sounds like this guy needs a personal trainer or 1:1 session if he wants special attention or a more intense yoga practice. Doesn’t sound like gentle yoga is what he’s looking for.\n\nI’m so focused on my own practice I usually don’t notice what’s going on around me too much, but that would drive me nuts!\n\nBack in the day in Oakland there was this famous yoga joint Monkey Yoga.  And Tim started each of his evening classes with push-ups and always had a more physical approach.  But it was instructor led and outside of the typical flow.\n\nWe have one of those, but at least it's during an active Vinyasa class and not gentle. 🤦🏻‍♀️\n\ni wouldn’t be able to not laugh omg how weird . i’ve done hot yoga and people were grunting kind of and there was some show offs but a normal yoga class ????  strange\n\nThat's fairly rude and inappropriate of him to do. If he wants to do calisthenics, he can do it at home or in a different class. My studio offers a hot core power vinyasa class with and without weights, and one of my favorite teachers in a yin/yang class incorporates push-ups and other strength training movements in her flows. I wonder if your studio has those types of classes as they would suit him. Otherwise, I'd gently let the teacher know how much his grunting is affecting your practice, but the sweating should be nothing of your concern because he likely can't control that.\n\nHave compassion for people like this. Even when the instructor is giving them a moment of stillness and peace, they can't allow themselves that grace, and that's really sad to me.\n\nYour teacher seems pretry incompetent to me, for allowing such insincere activites to happen. One cannot combine any form of exercise with a yoga asana practice, its extremely detimental for one's overall health.\n\nAs a newer yogi, I would not allow this.\nAlso he isn’t participating, he’s proving a point.\n\nI get there are times to focus on your own experience,\nBut his is a blatant distraction\n\nIf you join a class that isn’t for you… please join another or practice at home. \n\nWhen a group is in a yoga flow, it feels amazingly synchronized. The disruptions take away from others that are in the class.\n\nTell the instructor that they can tell the push up guy to go away, or the rest of you are going to stop coming to the class. It’s pure economics. One person isn’t worth the entire class.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’ve never been to a studio and things like this make me value that choice.\n\ni think we all have one of these\n\nLMAO…..push up guy!\n\nIs this in Philly?  This happens at my yoga studio and it’s rather annoying and distracting. We have to wait until he’s finished so others can lay their  mats down.\n\nI’ve taken classes with a dude like this before. I generally just ignore them. But the loud grunting would get to me. That is very distracting for other students.\n\nI have. Guy like this in one of my regular classes it bothers me so much I try to block him put and I am getting better at it but it is just annoying\n\nThere’s one in every studio I swear.\n\nThen he wins because you have allowed him to affect your peace.  Do nothing.   If he feels the need to do this,  then let him.  Your peace inside you can not be effected by someone outside of you.\n\nWe have two handstand girls who make noise during savasana hitting the wall and flying back down. Good for cultivating a strong meditation practice.\n\nHas anyone spoken to the instructor, or the owner/manager of the gym?\n\nbesides talking to him gently i don’t think there’s much you can do. use it as a lesson in ignoring irritations, breathe and let be\n\nRespectfully, you don’t know this person or what he needs. Maybe he has been through some injury or accident. Maybe he needs the gentle yoga class. Maybe the push-ups and sit-ups are the most effort he can muster throughout the week. Maybe the yoga class helps him to be able to do them, and he works up to them at the end of class. Maybe he’s new to yoga and uncomfortable with it, and push-ups are more familiar to him and make him feel comfortable. We just don’t know.\n\nOne thing we often practice in yoga classes (especially yin yoga, fwiw) is the idea of noticing without judging…noticing sounds, colors, light and dark, the feel and temperature of your breath, external sensations, internal thoughts and emotions…just seeing what’s there and letting it pass through. Maybe next time you see him, you can practice just noticing these things within yourself and allow whatever other people in the room are doing to fade away.\n\nThese people are a you problem and a great opportunity to practice nonattachment and contentment. Just let idiots be idiots, that’s not unique to yoga. \n\nHi - Yoga instructor here. While I can totally understand why it may be jarring, ultimately, it's HIS practice. And the fact that it irritates you means that there is internal work for you to do. Yoga is a lot more than just asana (movement.) It's what we take off the mat with us too. He's there because he needs something. You're there because you need something. Turn inward on your mat &amp; take the time for you.\n\nNah as a long time student, someone being loud during class is rude af and it's your job as a teacher to nip that in the bud. You're not a good teacher if you're letting dudes disrespect and disrupt your class.\n\nAs a teacher myself, I would not tolerate his behavior because it sounds unsafe and is detrimental to other students. Part is f yoga is also letting go of your ego enough to be considerate of others\n\nWhat seems unsafe?\n\nYikes. Your ego is showing by telling someone they have internal work to do, OP isn’t one of the people in your classes and their feelings about the situation is valid.\n\nLol these comments are so generic yogic comments in this sub. Irritation is quite natural, even yogis feel it. Nothing wrong that some people irritate us, not everything is a lesson to be learned.\n\nHe is not affecting your vibe.\n\n*You* are *letting* his actions affect your vibe. \n\nSo yes, there is definitely something you can do in this situation - you can use it as an opportunity to refocus on your breath and drishti and not concern yourself with what others are doing in the class. Each time you notice this person, it’s a sign to refocus. He is giving you a gift of opportunity.\n\nWhy do so many of you care what other people are doing on their mat? Focus on yourselves in class 🧘‍♀️\n\nYall would downvote this comment smh\n\nIt's their practice...let them be. Focus on your journey and don't worry about others. That's what yoga is all about.\n\nyoga is not \"all about\" one thing. it's hard to focus on your journey when someone is being deliberately annoying and seeking attention.\n\nIdk why the guy is doing yoga even though it's for flexibility and calmness forgive me if I'm wrong I don't do yoga but I think he is trying to train strength and stay flexible. If you want him gone I think you can try to help him find a gym that has a class for just that\n\nLearning to ignore things is a great life skill.  You  realize that yoga classes are public spaces and people are gonna do their thing, naturally.\n\n\nI believe that catered vacation yoga trips and boutique yoga culture have made it so many feel like they need a perfectly curated class where the perfect music is played.\n\nI’d say give him his berth or go to a different class.   This is a chance for you to examine equanimity or explore…. or complain to a teacher who isn’t frankly getting compensated properly to act as an elementary teacher.  \n\nIf you really feel like it’s an issue I would speak directly with the owner.  They can talk to the teacher and Iron out a new policy or do nothing.  The teacher would end up talking to them anyway.\n\nAlso, this person may have a medical condition that makes them grunt.  They may not have another time or place to feel safe doing these things.  So many  “if’s” compared to the concrete from your view.\n\nSo I think you have every right to be annoyed but if you can’t handle ignoring grunting that is squandering a chance to work toward pratyahara, IMO.  \n\n(have personally dealt with similar situations as an instructor)\n\nYou are spot on. Modern western yoga culture has made people think that it’s all about a shared group fitness experience that is perfectly curated to them. These people would maybe be surprised to learn about traditional Mysore style instruction, where everybody is doing their own practice at their own pace and you see all types together in the same room. The “vibe” is about the sound of the breathing and the fact that everybody is focused on solely their breathing and drishti - not about people doing the same asanas at the same time.\n\n“This person is selfish because they are affecting *me*! The hypocrisy is pretty hilarious actually. If you don’t want to experience other people practicing their yoga, then don’t do yoga at a studio and only do it at home. It is that simple. You are not privileged to a totally distraction free environment that caters perfectly to the experience you desire, and in fact this is actually *part* of the experience.\n\nAs a full time Ashtangi, I can guarantee that nobody in a shala is doing anything other than the Ashtanga series they're working on. Everybody in a Mysore room is deeply focused on their own practice for sure, but if somebody started doing calisthenics or pilates or some other thing that was not Ashtanga, the teacher would ask them to leave.\n\nYes, in the context of a mysore room, somebody wildly deviating from the ashtanga realm would be odd and would be called out by the instructor. Mysore rooms also tend to have a more strictly regimented vibe to them, because discipline is a part of the practice. Of course the Ashtanga instructor may tell a student to do additional things such as push ups to build strength, but they would likely suggest that is done outside of normal practice time. But it would not be weird if an instructor prescribed a student to do an abnormal backbending routine or something of that sort. The grunting and improper would be the biggest thing they would take issue with I think.\n\nAs far as the guy being talked about in the OP - outside of the context of Ashtanga, the generally accepted scope of asanas is wider (albeit often less advanced). Maybe this person's doctor suggested they should do push ups for some medical reason. Maybe a yoga instructor suggested they add in push ups during practice to build strength. Etc. In a mysore room, you would generally not be prescribed something that is outside of the traditional Ashtanga world, even if you are modifying or personalizing under guidance of a teacher. But outside of Ashtanga, theres a much wider scope of things that people are instructed to do. Push ups really are not that offensive and it is very likely that OP is exaggerating the situation here. I mentioned mysore rooms in this conversation more for the context of this notion that yoga classes are all about everybody doing the same thing together and that the presence of somebody doing something different than you is not normal. Doing high energy things during a gentle class is odd, yes, but a person doing push ups is really not that extreme and the level of vitriol for this person that I am seeing in these comments is unnecessary imo.\n\nIn another comment I mention the difference between a personal practice, say at home or in a one on one class, where you could and should do whatever you feel, and a group class, where it is tacitly understood that the dynamics of the class should more or less be respected. In the latter, somebody slightly modifying a pose or doing an extra movement during a vinyasa isn't a big deal, but somebody doing vigorous exercise like pushups and making grunting noises while everyone else is settling into savasana is selfish and inappropriate.\n\nDuring savasana it is never okay, I agree. Again we don’t really know the full complete context here and it’s likely OP is exaggerating. \n\nI deviate from what is being instructed in classes pretty often - because as an Ashtangi, my practice includes asanas that are not always part of other vinyasa classes. I go to a studio because I like the ritual of driving there and being in the space and turning my phone off. At home I have a small house with a dog bothering me and my work computer in the corner etc etc.  At the studio I practice at these days, I explicitly asked each instructor individually if they take issue with me doing my own thing. They are all totally okay with it. So I’m doing drop backs and eka pada and kukkutasana while the rest of the room is doing generic western vinyasa. And it’s not a big deal at all! Others may think my strong ujayi is weird but that’s their own problem and opportunity to learn. The instructors even come and give me assists frequently. So my point is that this type of thing can be done respectfully, and the OP doesn’t necessarily know the entire picture here.\n\nWell you described just how easy it is to be decent to others and still have your own practice! Just a bit of common sense.\n\nAs with most things in life, open communication and a bit of respect and compassion can go a long way. I also always set up in the back of the room as to be as non-distracting as possible. \n\nI get self conscious sometimes that people will think I am showing off (and for all I know, there’s been a thread here made about me). I had an interesting conversation with one of the instructors about how, much of the time, instructors say to curb your ego and not let it trick you into going too deep or overstretching. And for me, in the context of my practicing at this studio, my ego sometimes makes me hold back, because I have concern for how I will be perceived. And the instructor thought that was remarkable and unexpected, and encouraged me to do whatever I want because it’s better to be authentic and do my practice to it’s fullest expression, as opposed to holding back because I’m worried about the group flow or throwing off the vibe or whatever. He said that by doing so, I’m actually *creating* a vibe and contributing to the community more fully by being my genuine self.\n\nTo me, that is yoga. Yoga is not a fitness class where people are all expected to be doing the same thing together. Yoga is not a place where you can expect to not be challenged or distracted. Yoga is not a place where people should be worrying about what others think about their asana and letting that impact how they practice. Obviously you want to be considerate of others, but is it not also inconsiderate to think a person should alter their practice for you because you may find it distracting, when you should just be focusing on yourself anyway? That is ultimately my point here. Context matters and jumping on the bandwagon for hating on “push up guy” fails to consider the entirety of the situation and OP is probably biased and coming here seeking validation for their discomfort, whereas they could be proactively working through it themselves and/or putting that energy into more productive things, such as their *own* practice."

Keep the new one hidden.\n\nYeah this one is definitely hers now!\n\n[deleted]\n\nDo they leave a thousand tiny pieces everywhere? The cardboard ones do and it drives me crazy. Tried to be more eco friendly with the cisal mats but my cats hate those. I was hoping to find a softer carpet type material to assuage them, but it’s difficult to find carpet squares for anything less than $20 and I’m so tired of trying to please my tiny furry tyrants.\n\nMy cat tore them up. Got new ones. Then my kids couldn’t resist biting them. They left tiny teef marks around the edges, and now they’re 9 and 12 and I still have them and use them!.\n\nThis is the way.\n\nI keep my stuff in a closet where the cat can’t get to it. It’s not worth the heart ache (or money).\n\nThis is probably what I'll have to do with my next block, luckily she hasn't gone for my mat!\n\nMine has the gall to go for my mat *while I'm actively using it* \n\nSomeday I'll find a cheap mat at a garage sale and he can have that one all to himself!\n\nI have my bougie saved up and scratched on one and to deter my big boy I put out my old five below one next to me so he can have at it. It’s ridiculous, but it works.\n\n5 Below always has yoga mats and blocks! I have two kittens and I actually bought a yoga mat from there to line the bottom of their playhouse with! They’re not high quality, but they’re good enough and don’t break the bank when they get destroyed.\n\nThey liked the mat a little too much. It actually got tossed yesterday😅. Pink. Shrapnel. Everywhere. It did its job though. I just needed it to protect the carpet long enough for them to figure out how to use the litter box without *stepping in things.* They’re 12 weeks old now and their beans are clean when they exit the box so it’s no longer needed. 🤷‍♀️\n\nPut the cat in the cupboard while you’re doing yoga. Then swap the cat and the mat when you’re done.\n\nROFL\n\nSame here. Its ugly as hell now.\n\nBut he will want yours.. the one his momma is on 🤣😸\n\nI was both horrified and livid when my car did this LOL\n\nHappened to my Manduka mat 😭 now I keep my yoga stuff in the car.\n\nYet 😅\n\nMy previous cat would tear up mats RIP. New kitten likes to sit on it but she hasn’t scratched it up yet 🤞🏻\n\nMy cats used my rolled up mat as a scratching post! Luckily it’s just an old one I don’t use much.\n\nThis, put them away when not in use.\n\ni would rather keep cat in a closet all time\n\nMine used to do the same thing, even though they had several scratching poles in every room. She just loves to scratch soft foamy things. I was so sad at first because the blocks were brand new and I was a student, so money was tight. I put them up on a high dresser and later kept them in a yoga bag, because I didn’t have enough closet space. It worked for my cat but if you can, I definitely would put them in a closet. \n\nSide note: 10 years later I still use the same scratched-up blocks, now stored in the closet. I don’t care about the scratches anymore, they’re part of my practice. Just like the fact that the first 3rd of my extra large mat is always taken up by the very same kitty. It’s all part of the process for me\n\nthe cork and wood ones are cat tougher.\n\nAgree. I left my old block (which look like op’s) and I do a better job of protecting my cork ones but they don’t have as much interest.\n\n👆🙏\n\nI love the cork ones, just so comfie and nice texture!\n\nBeen considering getting a cork yoga mat as my next one too (a bit expensive), though my current one is pretty good and has served me for years without damage..\n\n[deleted]\n\nIs your cat constantly stomping around driving you crazy? Is your cat clawing at your furniture? Think there’s no answer? You’re so stupid! There is! Kitten Mittens. Finally, there is an elegant, comfortable mitten for cats.\n\nOmg shed hate that but I'm tempted haha\n\nOof I keep mine in a wicker basket and keep lots of scratchers around for them to use. I have 4 cats and they stay away from my equipment as long as i give them alternatives.\n\nI’ve got a bamboo block, that should hold up better than foam.\n\nCork\n\nHa, as if cork was safe from kitten murder mittens. Ask me how I know.\n\nMy cats are super scratchy and they have never touched my cork blocks 🙀  My cork mats are another story…\n\nMy cats never touched my cork blocks\n\nYup! One of mine had an absolute vendetta against my cork blocks. He also went after my mat but only when I was actively trying to use it, haha. It was frustrating at the time but now I miss it.\n\nMust go on a cat by cat basis! My cats mess with my foam blocks and will scratch a mat if it’s rolled out and unattended. Won’t touch the cork blocks though.\n\nMy foam blocks taste good. Cork is not worth eating*\n\n\n*according to my cat\n\n\nHe came to us as a distinguished senior gentleman who was declawed, so I can't speak to what makes a good scratching post.\n\nCork isn’t safe either\n\nMy cat decided the corners of the cork block were just too pointy and tasty so he chewed off the corners of the cork. Like come on man brand new $20 block why. He'll only go for the mat if he is trying to get attention which is annoying\n\nWood\n\nWhy my yoga gear stays locked in my guest room closet: Exhibit A. Sorry, OP, I once lost a whole mat to mine using it as a scratching post.\n\nOhh noo not the mat! I'm lucky she's only attacked the block\n\nIt was a cheap mat, but I still wasn’t happy. 😂\n\nMy dogs must have had a great time demolishing my mat 😖😅\n\nOmg! Mine look just like that! 😂\n\nMust be the ideal cat scratchers! 😂\n\nNote the cat's guilty face.\n\nThere's a liquid spray product called Bitter Apple that might help.\n\nHaha I thought she had a face of no regrets! \n\nThat sounds interesting I'll look into that\n\nOmg! Any time I unrolled my yoga mat, my dog would saunter over and sit on it and refuse to move, but I've never had a cat so I didn't know they did such things! \nDo they destroy mats too? I would be heartbroken if I found my mat all shredded\n\nLuckily she hasn't gone for my mat, she just likes sitting on my mat when I'm moving between poses haha.\n\nAwwww so cats do that too! Cute 🥰\n\nStill works.  Just let it remind you of her sometimes.\n\nNothing is cat proof. Try tungsten.\n\nUse a storage bin.\n\nCork??\n\nSpraying them with citrus of some kind; even just rubbing them with orange peel can help.\n\nShe didn't do it! She would never 😂\n\nCork is harder to damage, but not fully cat proof. My bricks have nibble marks on the corners. It's also harder, which is sometimes a good thing, and sometimes not. I feel like storing them away from your cats would be good advice...except I have cats who open doors and like participating in yoga with me, so it's never quite that simple. \n\nOh no. Is there an option of a dedicated yoga room with a cat proof door? I created a still room during the pandemic.  I keep plants, yoga stuff, and it houses my shy babies. (A veiled chameleon Keren N. Finance and 2 Australian Whites Tree Frogs Bob and Linda Belcher) Alternatively,  you could keep them in a wooden box with a lid and latch.\n\nCork blocks, and spray em with a stinky citrus or peppermint essential oil. They do not like that. I had to spray down my hemp mat with an orange oil to get my cat to stop scratching it.\n\nOohhhh, I use Mrs. Myers clove and orange scented spray to clean my mat, I wonder if that's enough of a deterrent? I don't leave my mat unrolled though, so I may never find out.\n\nOmg look at him/her behind it looking guilty as hell that’s funny.  My cat claws mine too so what I decided to do is use something else for blocks - it can be books, I’ve even taken a small shoebox, weighed it down with sand and put duct tape around it - I know it’s not aesthetically pleasing but I can’t use those blocks anymore.\n\nI mean you can still use them as it is 😅😅\n\nYour cat is adorable in the background!!\n\nThat block is still usable. Cant you share?\n\nWhat is mine is also my cats haha\n\nSame issue here but my beagle is the problem! I’m trying to switch over to cork and from what I’ve read I’m hoping that cork blocks will be more dense and harder for them to bite/scratch.  No experience here but cork might be your answer\n\nIt’s not. My shiba inu has left teeth marks in one corner of my cork block.\n\nHaha! Nope. Put them up when not in use. The blocks, foam\nRollers and yoga mats too! Whyyyyy?\n\nMaybe they can smell the endorphins from our workouts? Haha idk\n\nMy cats have their own yoga mat &amp; block &amp; mine are in the closet\n\nA cabinet...\n\nI just accept my fate -- my girl manages to destroy anything I care about enough. Replacing things tends to just be a setup for repeat action. As Long as it's still serviceable, I say keep it\n\nMaybe putting it in a bag and hanging the bag on the wall can prevent your adorable little goblin from getting to it again.\n\nI had to laugh at this because I had saved up for a nice mat (caught a Manduka sale) and the first thing my lorge void did was a nice downward stretch with me and scratched into the mat that now looks like I’ve had it for 20 years. I keep everything up and away anyways but I just let it be.  Best thing to do with cats is keep it out of access because they don’t respect boundaries in any way.\n\nThey make wood yoga blocks. That might work\n\nExtra yoga blocks, cheap used small ones from old Wii Fit off of eBay; spray them with catnip oil\n\nTry a cork one - much harder to scratch - but keep it hidden.\n\nYou can get yoga block covers!\n\nShe's so cute. That look on her face is like\"what? Did I do that?\" :)\n\nCork maybe?\n\nI had to start hiding mine from the cats, and I even keep my good mat in my car trunk to only use it in class, because they will scratch that as well.\n\nCareful about the heat breaking down your mat in the trunk\n\nYeah when it’s really hot I bring it inside.\n\n💜\n\nMy cat did this too but he doesn't touch the cork yoga blocks. Get some cork ones! They're nicer anyway.  \nAlso watch your mat because my little guy also ripped the hell out of my favorite mat and it looked just like this when I discovered it :'(\n\nI doubt they have cat proof blocks. You will probably have to put it where your cat can’t get to it.\n\nOne of my cats used to that to my yoga mat, she died last year, I still have the mat, I'll never throw it out.\n\nKeep them in the fridge\n\nOh man! I have no recommendations. Cork would get just as destroyed but also crumble off.\n\nI have 2 dogs. Last week, one of them (the 2 yr old) went into my studio where I left my Manuka pro mat out and she freaked herself out seeing these “other dogs” in the mirrors (there are 5 of them). So now I have some really deep claw scratches on my mat now. A permanent reminder that “Suki wuz here”\n\nOak\n\nKeep those as decoy blocks and have two others you keep in a closet.\n\nKeep then in plastics\n\nI like the manduka blocks. They are a bit more durable.\n\nidk but if you find it, let me know because mine look the same\n\nI had this happen too *sigh\n\nHaha I feel your pain! My kitty loves them. I got a couple of solid wood blocks. Tough to use for anything other than bringing the ground closer though (they’re heavier so gripping between the thighs, using for core etc.. is a little harder). You should probably just hide them out of paw reach when you’re not using them.\n\nI like hugger mugger cork blocks. I think they would be harder for cats to chew on.\n\nTop shelf storage, closet or drawer will solve your problem!\n\nWood\n\nCork\n\nI feel your pain. Our little guy has started going after my mat and gym mats recently as well :’)\n\nYes, get rid of the cat.\n\nSame thing you do with all \"pet protection\" remove it from them.\n\nGive those to your cat, buy new ones and store them somewhere your cat can't get to them when you aren't using them.\n\nI have a wooden yoga  block , might fare a bit longer.\n\nWood\n\nI use wood blocks.\n\nCork\n\nMy puppy ate a large chunk off the corner of mine 🥲 I just flip it to where I can't see it but it still hurts a year later.\n\nkork\n\nIt’s still a block what’s the problem\n\nI have never seen a thread and clicked on it so fast. My cat destroyed mine\n\nI switched to real bricks. She still attacks them 😾😾😂\n\nWooden blocks. They're not as soft but should be less scratchable.\n\nWhat's the point of yoga if you can't chill with the kitty? Personally, I think it looks better that way 😁 it demonstrates kitty fun and what else could be better karmic universal energy? Nothing! That's what.\n\nThey are still fine to use\n\nShelf\n\nMy cork blocks look like this.  Had to put them away.\n\nlol I could have posted this. I still use it like that 😂\n\nYou can get wooden blocks or you can just get yourself a good storage solution\n\nI got cork blocks after this happened. She chews them less, but scratches them more. I just keep my mat and blocks hidden now lol.\n\nCork. Better blocks too.\n\nYou can get wooden yoga blocks!\n\nGet a wooden one. They’re better anyways\n\nThere’s one room in my house that the cats are not allowed in and they have learned not to sneak in. This is where I keep anything I don’t want them getting into.\n\nI don't know of any cat proof yoga blocks, but I think simply putting them in a bag that they cannot get into would work.\n\nTrain your cat\n\nThey do make wooden ones but they aren't suitable for every activity\n\nIf you can handle it, you can wrap them in aluminum\n\nLuckily my cats were not interested 😂\n\nWeld one\n\nThere are blocks made of wood.  Maybe that would work?\n\nYeah, teach them to scratch at cardboard.\n\nI have wooden ones for this reason (and the kids liked to destroy them too).\n\nCinder blocks?\n\nI recommend a cork one! \n\nAlso I would throw that one away ASAP. My cat loves foam and when he was not quite a year old, he ate some of my exercise mat (similar material) which resulted in a blockage and surgery + a few days in oxygen from complications during the procedure.\n\nDo you really need the internet to figure this one out?\n\nJust like with children, if there is something you don't want them to have access to, put it up high or in a place they can't get to. No access = cat-proof\n\nCat claw protection spray coating.\n\nTheres wooden blocks. Or get a dog :D\n\nSorry but the cats gotta go ;)"

    "all_comment_text": "I’m doing Adrienne’s July calendar! Yoga was also instrumental in my getting sober and generally getting my life back together\n\nCongrats on your sobriety. I have to quit smoking weed (daily smoker for 20 years) and I am scared, but it is time. I also do yoga 2-4 days per week already, but I am hoping that fitting in more yoga will be a good way to find the anxiety relief i find in smoking. Thanks for the inspiration to know that change and growth are possible.\n\nHey, I just wanted to say hi from the other side. I used yoga and meditation to quit smoking weed. It wasn't perfect and I relapsed a few times, but it's been 3 years and I'm no longer a daily smoker!\n\nI see you, friend. Yoga has actually helped me lay off the weed, since it makes me feel the same chill.\n\nI absolutely need my yoga for help with my anxiety, lol.\nPracticing every day did not happen overnight. \nEven if you only practice once a week, it will naturally progress. It will take time. It took me almost a year.\n\nI know quitting weed is scary, but I am a daily smoker, and every time I’ve had to quit I don’t even think about it after a few days. And I SMOKE and take edibles. One beautiful thing about sobriety is that it’s its own type of high. You might be pleasantly surprised and enjoy the ‘ high’ that sobriety provides.\n\nIf you mix tobacco with your weed, you're most likely addicted to tobacco\n\nI don’t.\n\nI am sorry then, good luck 🤞\n\nI used yoga to quit smoking, I'm so proud of anyone who gives up their unhealthy vices for healthy ones! \n\nCongratulations 👏🎉\n\nCongrats! \n\nI believe so strongly in a daily practice that I offer I free month of classes to anyone who shows up all 30 days in a month! 😆\n\nAre you located in the greater Pittsburgh area, by chance lol?\n\nNo... sadly!\n\nWell done on quitting drinking. I found yoga basically replaced booze in my life. It’s magic IMHO\n\nYoga(the umbrella) helped me when I got sober too. The mental clarity and stability of a daily practice(sometimes meditation, asana practice or breath work) was exactly what I needed. Congrats on your sobriety and the consistency is so crucial! 💚\n\nI love that you said you want to focus on consistency as your goal. I can relate to that so much. I’m going to work on my consistency as well and maybe I’ll finally stick to my workout goals too.\n\nSo incredible!! I also recommend Cole Chance Yoga too - she's talks a lot about her own experience with sobriety and how yoga has helped her!\n\nCongratulations!\n\nRemember, the hardest part is showing up to the mat!🤗❤️🥳\n\nThat’s awesome!! I love the “ah haa moment” of yoga\n\nThis is awesome! Great job, OP!\n\nCongrats, and it’s not silly at all! Building healthy habits is so important for overcoming the unhealthy ones. And I promise if you stick with it, yoga is going to change your life.\n\nNot at all silly! You should be proud of yourself…. On the sobriety front and the yoga front! Good for you!\n\nCongratulations on both your sobriety and your commitment to your health!\n\nNothing silly about sobriety.  Thanks for posting - judging by the number of responses, your thread was spot on.\n\nCongrats and best wishes for continued sucess!\n\nGood for you!!\n\nCongrats! Way to be disciplined\n\nThis is wonderful!! Congrats!! Adriene is so great and accessible.\n\nI love Erin from Five Parks Yoga- I did a 30 day challenge with her at start of pandemic and now I’m doing a 300hfytt- it feels great to find regular practice.\n\nI hope you keep enjoying and feeling good.\n\nYes really like Five Parks. Congrats to you!\n\nNot silly at all! Congratulations on your self-care &amp; wellness journey! This year you made YOU a priority (and doesn’t that feel amazing?!) ✌️\n\nCongrats OP!! Cheers to growth indeed &lt;3\n\nGood for you!!  You are making it happen.\n\nLoveeee her 30 day challenges. I wasn’t going to the gym but I was relatively active years ago with volleyball and occasional hiking so I wanted something ‘light’ but consistent. Decided to get into Adrienne’s 30 day challenges. Would do it every morning right as I wake up before class. Did a number of her 30 day challenges, it just leaves you feeling so fulfilled.\n\nCongrats from another sobernaut. Yoga is helping so much with recovery. I've set myself the challenge of practicing every day for 90 days just to see what happens if I do.\n\nNot silly at all.  I’m in the same boat, want to and never get off my butt.\n\nSo proud of you!! Not silly at all but something that brings you fulfillment, and never ever downplay it!\n\nCongrats on completing your first 30 day yoga challenge!\n\nYWA is how I was able to be consistent, too. I do the Down Dog app now but I absolutely needed Adriene to get me into the habit. Way to go!!\n\nOoOoO i love 5 parks !!!!!! And hell yea, keep up the good work😁🧘🏽‍♀️\n\nI thought I was ready for her. Boy...5 days in and I am HUMBLED\n\nCheers indeed! Good for you!"

    "title": "Locked out of Class? ",
    "body": "I recently went to a hot yoga class at my gym (the 2nd time with this instructor), and during shavasana I was experiencing some post nasal drip that was making me cough. So I sat up and took a drink of water, but there was only a sip remaining. I was about to have a full blown coughing fit so I quietly get up, put my shoes on and tip toe to the door, unlock it and slip out. I get water, cough it out, and go back to the door. The door is now latched shut and LOCKED. Weirdly enough you can turn the lock from the outside, so I did, and quietly returned to my mat to finish shavasana. After the instructor said “namaste” he proceeded to “remind everyone” that if you have to leave during class to do so before shavasana, and if you have to leave during shavasana you will not be allowed back into the classroom because he wants to preserve the peaceful moment for all students. I was shocked and embarrassed. As someone who has battled crippling social anxiety my whole life, just walking into the gym is an accomplishment, not to mention exercising in a room full of people. So to be singled out like that was an actual anxiety nightmare come true. \nI understand wanting to protect the peaceful environment, but I disagree with the way he addressed it. I feel like any other yoga instructor would have pulled me aside at the end to inform me of their policy and ask that if I need to leave again to please wait outside the room until the class ends. \nI’m unsure what to do now, because the idea of returning to that class is terrifying but I justify the expensive gym membership because I take 2 fitness classes each week. Do I address this with the instructor? ",

    "all_comment_text": "“Hey I wanted to apologize for coming back in during shavasana. I left because I was about to have a coughing fit and didn’t want to disrupt the class but wasn’t thinking when I came back in after it subsided.”\n\nPerfect way to address it, if she feels she must\n\nShe had a human experience that he could clearly see, why in the world is he locking people in and out of the room???! They just seems so crazy.\n\nIt is kind of crazy.  Only creates awkward and bad feelings such as OP’s story.  Unnecessary.\n\nThis is a good reply... But I don't really think ppl should apologize. She was being considerate when she left.\n\nI wouldn't apologise... And \"wasn't thinking\" eesh.\n\nEh- whether I’d apologize in this situation depends entirely on how much that rule is emphasized for that particular yoga class. If it was just hidden somewhere in the fine print and assumed that everyone knows, I wouldn’t, but if it’s mentioned and posted everywhere, I’d probably want to, personally. \n\nThough I can completely understand being so focused on getting out before the coughing fit and then going, “Cool, disruption averted, now back to class,” before having a “Doh!” moment. Whereas for the instructor, the rules are probably burned in the back of his brain since it’s his job, so it seems more obvious to him. Though if that’s a trend he’s noticing and it wasn’t just something the OP did in this class, it explains the general announcement.\n\nAgree, jf OP wants to come back to this class, they should apologize to the instructor. \n\nOP, you made this whole thing about yourself. You say that being singled out by the instructor was a nightmare come true, yet you had no qualms about coming into a quiet room during everyone else’s shavasana when you knew you’d been intentionally locked out? So only your comfort is valid? \n\nJust learn from this and move on. It’s a small yoga etiquette thing and not worth getting so worked up about it.\n\nOh for god's sake. Sometimes in shavasana ambulances pass by in the street outside. People in nearby offices might talk in the halls. Someone drops a prop or sneezes or god forbid, farts.\n\nThe whole point is that conditions are not going to be perfect, and if we try with our graspy needy hands to make it perfect, we're going to find we can never find peace, because there is no 'perfect', there is an unsteady, rocky world where dogs bark and people have to pee and we have to find peace \\*within that\\* and within the specific set of circumstances we face in each moment we are given.\n\nI would argue that having to find stillness in conditions that aren't perfect is a good learning experience for savasana\n\nAnyone can achieve enlightenment by going to the mountains and abandoning everything. It's those that achieve it while having a normal work and family life that are truly impressive. (Just a sentiment that's pretty popular in my country)\n\nSame.\n\nBingo\n\nAbsolutely\n\nI fully agree with what you’re saying, I just think that since it caused a disruption that then escalated, and OP has anxiety about going back to the class after being called out, it might be nice to clear the air.\n\nYeah, but for OP, not for the instructor. If it helps OP then, yes, great.\n\nThe instructor put himself before his students and if I'd been in the class, I'd have been pained about how it was handled and wouldn't go back. I would have noticed and cringed.\n\nSo it's not just those who are singled out and feel shamed, it's those who are afraid of being singled out and feeling shamed that are affected. And even if I didn't have a horror of being called out in the middle of something that is intrinsically meditative, I would have felt...well what is this about, then? A perfectly soft sacred world the is like a bed of feathers? Because that's not the world we're confronted with, and it certainly isn't the 'self' we are confronted with. \n\nReally, the only person really who we \\*know\\* was thrown off by this was the instructor. Everyone else could have been lying there noting the distraction and returning to their breathing. But he chose to draw \\*additional\\* attention after the fact. \n\nIt just seems antithetical to the whole point of the thing.\n\nAnd it made me think about how my kid has to ask to go to the bathroom in high school. Like 'hey, is it okay if my bodily functions exist?'\n\n  \nGah\n\nOP shouldn’t apologize to the instructor to go back to that class. Don’t be ridiculous. It’s been addressed and that’s the end of it. \n\nAnd OP didn’t make it about themselves, they are awkward and socially anxious. \n\nTell me you have no empathy without telling me you have no empathy. Gross take.\n\nThank you for saying this. The lack of empathy in this world is so upsetting.\n\nAgreed. This has been addressed, OP now knows what to do next time and no need to apologize, especially if they tried their best to be quiet and respectful, not after they’ve been locked out. If anyone, It’s the teacher that should apologize for locking the door and putting everyone in the class, OP included in an uncomfortable and potentially unsafe position or rather acknowledge their behavior along with aknowledging OP’s novice and harmless minor faux pas.\n\nDid whomever locked the door disturb the shavasana? The instructor sounds like an ass\n\nAgreed. I would not take another class from this instructor and just be mindful moving forward\n\nSo does the person above you\n\nI was wondering if the door was always locked from the outside from the start of class or if they literally got up and locked it during shavasana? \n\nI feel that should be something disclosed up front at the beginning of class if doors are ever being locked, and there are many situations where locking doors makes sense. As a trauma informed spaceholder, I generally only lock any doors that lead into and out of the main building and only after announcing to everyone and receiving consent. \n\nLife can be loud, part of the practice is sitting with. We are also human beings with needs and punishing someone for such is pretty bizarre to me, but they also end their class with namaste so…I guess I shouldn’t be shocked.\n\n[removed]\n\nIsn’t the whole point of shavasana to learn to tune things out? Yoga is a practice for a reason\n\nWow! What part of “social anxiety” did you not understand? For her, I think it was a big deal. She explained her situation and you are not taking this into consideration before being harsh.\n\nIf your meditation or yoga actually not even it's shavasana where you pretend to be dead - is getting disturbed by people walking around you then shut the f up and quit doing it. You don't know how to do it. Everybody's body is different. In a class everyone will have their own pace. The instructor must accommodate. It's not a fking big deal if he had to walk out during shavasana. Better than coughing his brains out due to lack of water and disturbing everybody.\nPeople like you will never grasp the essence of yoga and will keep doing asanas all their life thinking they achieved something.\n\nThe instructor is the asshole here. Locking the door is needlessly petty.\n\nYou don’t need to address with the instructor unless it’s important for you to do it. \n\nThe reason, I suspect, he made the announcement was bc you didn’t know and other students might not have either. I understand why it caused you anxiety, but he was just communicating the boundaries. \n\nIt is totally okay that you didn’t know before, and now you do.\n\nPerfect response. Thank you for being empathetic and honest.\n\nI wanted to thank you for this post because I never knew any of this.\n\nEvery teacher and studio is a little different, actually. \n\nI do think, generally, it’s good to leave before Savasana if you need to leave early. But I’ve had plenty of students who had to leave and come back and honestly, it’s fine. \n\nI sometimes even use things like that as a teaching moment — the world is not always going to be calm and quiet. If you lose your peace at little disturbances, what are you actually learning in yoga?\n\nNo one is going to remember or even care. They probably had their eyes closed. The instructor spoke to “everyone”. If they had publicly chastised you by name Scarlett letter style that would be different. Often when I replay embarrassing moments in my mind eventually they lose steam when the moment is dissected rationally. View this as a new challenging Asana that you don’t want to do because it seems hard. Just show up\n\nI farted once \n\nI fell asleep in a yin class and snored \n\nSomeone else farted and thought it was me \n\nThese are much worse than what you described\n\nAlso kicked over my metal water bottle repeatedly \n\nAlso if we are working towards being beings of compassion the others in the room deserve to have their space protected. Forgive me but It seems that you could be making this completely about you when others were involved in this “moment”  \n\nIt’s not a big deal unless you make it one\n\nOh my god the metal water bottle! Why is that the loudest noise and it always happens in slow motion too haha. \n\nI totally agree with this though. When I’m in shavasana or any form of meditation, everyone else around me is tuned out. People can’t or shouldn’t expect complete silence and perfect stillness during these moments in a group class (or ever at home!) As long as you’re respectful, as OP definitely was here, do what you’ve got to do! \n\nOP not a big deal at all, definitely go back. As someone who has also suffered from anxiety and depression my whole life, and as a 15 year practitioner, this space is for you! Take it up!\n\nThank you so much! 🥰\n\n[deleted]\n\nlol it’s ok it was an accident\n\nI know. People have done it to me too are I get it. It is just like an \"oh fuck\" moment.\n\nI’m sorry I laughed so hard at someone else. Farted and thought it was me.!\n\nI was the only guy in the class and could tell that everyone thought it was me even though it was the lady next to me. There was nothing else I could do. I wanted to stop the class and say that was her not me….but didn’t think that was very yoga like so I just accepted it.\n\nI do love the thought of you feeling awkward so you interrupt everyone to make sure they know you DID NOT fart. Feels like a Tim Robinson sketch\n\nIt was like a good 10 seconds of serious thought. I should have said excuse me and made a friend for life lol\n\nIt so would be! Like the door handle. But worse. Just so much worse.\n\nTotally agree with you here. I once twisted my knee once and yelled “FUCK!” really loudly- it hurt. Probably took some people out of the zone and of course I felt embarrassed and awful about that. But I imagine they’ve long forgotten it, just like I can’t really recall any particular disruptions from the gazillion yoga classes I’ve taken over the years. OP, people aren’t thinking about you as much as you are thinking about yourself. It’s really ok.\n\nomg lol one time I broke my own glasses by kicking over my bolster onto them in class and everyone saw - you just gotta get back up on the horse when you embarrass yourself in a class, it's like dying in Dark Souls, you know that it will happen again and you'll be okay afterwards no matter how badly you screw up, and when you accept that, it becomes okay\n\nEXCELLENT REPLY. I admire your ability to use your own mistakes as shared humanity.\n\nIt's you who drops that metal bottle!? We found him folks, he's the one! Get him!! Loool\nTbh, farting is equally bad especially if it's indoors.\nThis shit is hilarious btw.\n\nThe instructor didn’t do anything wrong, it’s fairly standard in yoga that you don’t leave during shavasana if you can help it, and returning is unnecessarily disruptive (it was a mistake on your end to come back into the class after leaving). It’s not like he called you out by name, he gave a polite reminder. At this point I would drop it rather than talk to him about it. You’re not the first or last person to be mildly disruptive during shavasana.\n\nIf you need to leave during shavasana again, the polite thing to do is leave as quietly as possible and wait for the class to end before returning to get your things. Shavasana is generally the end of the class anyway, so it’s not like you’re going to be waiting that long.\n\nIf I were you, I would have just waited quietly outside the door until people were leaving and then went back in to get your stuff. You couldn't help the coughing, but putting shoes on, walking out, then the instructor walking over to lock the door, then you picking the lock (that part was funny to me 😅) to get back in...all sounds like it could have taken the rest of the participants out of the moment. Honestly, I wouldn't say anything to the instructor.  I'd keep going like it's no big deal, but if you have to leave during savasana again for whatever reason, I'd wait outside and let everyone else preserve the moment.\n\nHey… relax. Yes, you made a mistake. Some instructors feel very strongly about the disruption.\n\nIf you can, apologize. Then move on.\nBring a hankie with you. Do your best to accommodate your needs &amp; the others in the class.\n\nMost of all? Don’t beat yourself up. We all make mistakes. Life is meant to learn from these lessons. ☮️\n\n[deleted]\n\nI usually have zero issue picking up on unspoken social rules and I wouldn't have guessed this one. The unspoken rule to me is, \"minimize noise and disruption as much as possible.\" Tending to your immediate physical needs has always been completely acceptable, as long as you aren't being obnoxious about it. It's a yoga class, not a funeral.\n\nYeah, to me they’re both overreacting really. Each one piled on to the molehill\n\nI think some were mentioning that it may cause interruption of the moment for the other students, which could also be upsetting for some. Something about considering other peoples comfort as well\n\nThe locked door is the sign here\n\n[deleted]\n\nA locked door is always a sign not to enter without explicit permission.\n\nJust because they didn't know doesn't make it not a mistake. Anyway, they didn't know, teacher informed their protocols and that's that. The teacher doesn't have any ill will towards the student nor will they even remember after the class is over.\n\nI’m an instructor and this is NOT a known thing.\n\nI mean, the locked door was a pretty strong hint. OP could have just waited till the class was done.\n\nMy two cents is people constantly leave during savansana and while it is disruptive imo, at the beginning the instructors always say \"if you're going to leave during savasana please position your mat towards the door.\" I feel like that sometimes helps. I also have insane social anxiety to where I just take yoga classes at home, finally started doing it at a gym, but I freeze and can't use equipment. I feel like it was a mistake, lesson learned.\n\n\nI still think \"phones on silent and mats at back of room if you leave before/during savsana\" should be addressed at the beginning. And even with that being said people phones all seen to go off, people come in late and legit THROW keys and waterbottles down loudly. \n\nWhat’s worse - disturbing an entire class once as you leave during the middle of quiet meditation? Or disturbing the entire class twice as you not only leave but needlessly barge back in during the middle of quiet meditation? If you have the slightest bit of common sense you would know the answer without needing to be told. \n\nOh don’t forget about the instructor getting up and walking across the room to latch and lock the door. But given those three options, I’d say the worst is having no empathy for a human that made a simple mistake and asked the community for input on how to move forward. Fun game! 🙃\n\nExactly this! Quit beating yourself up!!!!!!\n\n&gt;  So to be singled out like that was an actual anxiety nightmare come true. \n\nAs others have said, you are overthinking this. The reminder was *to the entire class* and to ensure that everyone (not just you) knew that the door is locked and why. If you didn't know it's very likely that there were others in the room also unaware, and your having left and found the door locked brought to the teacher's attention that there's an information gap in the situation. There are plenty of people who would have been offended had they been 'taken aside' after class, and the only thing doing so ensures is that it will continue to happen as students have to find out for themselves. \n\nTaking it a step further, it's also how most teachers are trained to provide feedback during practice. Instead of singling someone out and saying, 'x, stack your shoulders over your hips, you're leaning forward/backward in vira 2', the message to the entire class will be something along the lines of noticing alignment between hips and shoulders and ensuring you're upright vs leaning forward or back. Yes, you might notice that you're leaning forward or back but you're likely not the only one.\n\nYes, totally agree that this is the standard “best practice” for teachers. It gently reinforces the message for everyone and doesn’t single you out at all. Certainly, getting told privately would also feel horrible, like getting scolded by your parent.\n\nThe teacher is correct. If you must leave, you should leave prior but, if you need to leave during savasana (for whatever reason) - definitely stay out of the room until the class ends. Pretty simple. Same for students who think savasana is a great time to start packing up their shit or chatting with their friend. Be still and be quiet. The locked door was not an accident -it was a discreet 'stop sign' and you blew right through it - and pissed off the instructor.\n\nEveryone gets corrected now and then. New people (for example) regularly walk into the studio wearing their shoes until they are corrected. Some handle it gracefully - but I've also had people argue (insulted that they need to follow rules and norms). Crippling anxiety or not everyone needs to follow the rules - hardly a personal attack.\n\nDespite your intentions, what you did was disruptive and the instructor’s ask seems reasonable enough. Seems like the locked door should have been enough of a hint, so that’s why you got the announcement. Lesson learned and move on. Not a big deal unless you repeat it.\n\nI think this is the correct take.  It was a mistake made without any ill intent.  Just move on and don’t make it again.  I would go back to the class/instructor and think nothing of it but just be sure not to do the same thing twice.  I don’t see the instructors actions as being particularly malicious.  I don’t feel like he singled her out in the least.\n\nWhat type of world do we live in where we can’t have normal human experiences? Getting water is a standard when practicing any type of physical activity and locking people in and out of the room? WTF\n\nI was totally with you while reading the story but I think the key difference here is that they were in savasana. I think any other part of the class that would’ve been perfectly fine! But they are in the closing meditative portion.\n\n\nEdit: Which only last a few minutes\n\nIdk. The four corners of our mat is where we take up space. As an instructor, I personally would be OK with a student coming back to their practice after I just saw them struggling with a coughing spell that would’ve been way more disruptive than them leaving and returning quietly. 🤔\n\nPlus finding that the door had been locked behind you should be a pretty big indication that you should wait outside? Savasana is a couple minutes at most.\n\nDid you not read the story?  You can have water all you want. You can leave the room for whatever reason you want. What you can’t do is disrupt the rest of class by walking back in during savasana because that’s selfish and rude.\n\nWhen we practice Yoga we take up the four corners of our mat. People going in and out at whatever time is not even on my mind bc I’m focused on my own practice. If I hear someone coughing and needing to get up water I want them to go take care of themselves and then come back to their practice at whatever point we are at. Like locking the door from the inside while people are inside just doesn’t seem reasonable or safe?! 🤔\n\nGood for you. I agree with the instructor and like having rules of expected conduct in class. It’s not a free for all.\n\nThat is upsetting if you have a lot of anxiety. Idk if this will help, but here's a blurb if you feel like reading it.\n\nTeachers often give reminders like that to the whole group, be it in yoga, school, first aid training, what have you, because things come up that ARE good for the whole group to learn. As awkward as it is, remember that you're learning this rule with a number of other people, and them telling the rule to the group is how they prevent other people from making the same mistake and facilitate group learning. And remember the number one rule of yoga, that it's ok to be uncomfortable. Your teacher is holding space for that discomfort because it's ok to experience it. A trauma informed yoga class is designed more for people who aren't in a place to be ready for discomfort, but regular classes help us to feel ok with discomfort and push the boundaries of our comfort zone in the name of personal growth. You can breathe through those moments just like you can breathe through the dreaded chataranga hold.\n\nYes, sometimes it just reminds the teacher they had meant to mention it before.\n\nI’m sorry but you’re overthinking this. The teacher didn’t do or say anything wrong here and neither did you. Go back, explain your situation if you want to or not. \n\nAt most every yoga studio I've gone to they've reminded students of this at the beginning of class. Maybe the teacher would start doing that, is it confusing if they don't tell you and you haven't heard of that. There's no shame in going back\n\nThere is a laundry list of do's and don'ts at every yoga studio. I am not opening every class by reading it off. No shoes, no phones, no video/photos, clean up after yourself, put your props away, no talking during class, if you are sick - stay home, restrict your attention to the perimeter of your own mat, go easy on the cologne and perfume, on and on. It's posted on our website.\n\nI have a bladder disease and often scope out a spot in the back near the door for this reason. If this happened to me I wouldn’t let it bother me although the regulars around me know my story.\n\nThis is a standard response and a standard expectation across the board that you do not leave during savasana. They addressed it in an appropriate manner. That way you are aware of the expectation and others who witnessed it don’t start doing it as well. If you choose to address with the instructor, it is not going to go the way you think it will. I would say move on and don’t do it again.\n\nI’ve literally never heard this or seen this practiced\n\nI've practiced all over for 6 years in studios in the US, Europe, and SEA, and it's been either a written expectation in the rules, or a verbal one. I've seen strict teachers also mention it after class if someone leaves early or is noisy during shavasana- not by name, but definitely in a stern tone. \nThere are a lot of teachers and styles. OP made a mistake and was disruptive, and the teacher did nothing wrong by locking the door or making a comment after class. Just my two cents!\n\nYoga therapist here 👋 \n\n1) as a teacher I would never lock someone out of my class, no matter what is happening. So I don't like how the teacher did that. Disruptions happen, it's normal! If everyone's savasana is so fragile, we have a problem. I think you probably should have not unlocked the door to go back in, it's a pretty strong signal to stay out, but meh, I don't think it's a big deal. \n2) I don't like how the instructor handled this, singling people out like this is not okay in my opinion. There just isn't a need for it, I don't think this was the most compassionate way to go. If he felt it was necessary to say something he should just say something after class. \n3) hey, you know you have anxiety, so connect to your best coping methods right now. If your mind cannot move on, go do something fun so you can get that dopamine and happy chemicals going. Weird social interactions happen, it's okay!\n\nGood comments. And, compassion is the operative word 🙏\n\n\"Hey, I'm sorry for coming back in during shavasana.  I was about to have a full blowing coughing fit and didn't want that to disrupt the class.  In the future, if something I do needs to be discussed, could you please instead pull me aside?\"\n\nWow people are judgy here. I’d hate to have a disability and be in a class where having to step out gets you chastised.  Here’s the thing, is it mildly disruptive? Yes.  Does it matter? No!  Yoga makes it so we can handle the disruptions in life, and sometimes that happens during yoga. I have to use the restroom fairly often so I have stepped out of class as needed regardless of the point of class cause my health is important.  A class can still be focused despite someone getting up. This is life. Not to mention, this is a yoga class at a gym, you mentioned, not a studio. In my experience, they are way more lax than some studios I’ve been to.  Either way, do what you need to do. Don’t feel judged.  Sometimes we can’t control what our body does and if people can’t get over it, maybe they need to study yoga more.\n\nOmg thank you. So shocked at the other responses.\n\nYeah I don’t take yoga classes, I practice on my own at home, and the instructors in this thread make me remember why. How is it acceptable to just lock the door on a student in your class? That seems so aggressive and rude to me. Folks get so weird and unwelcoming about yoga culture. Why would I pay to be treated like that? They had a coughing fit! Shocking to me that folks are telling OP to apologize, I would never work with someone who treated students like that.\n\n100%\n\nSAME!!!!!\n\n100%.\n\nI think the teacher should have just pulled them aside at the end instead of shaming them in front of everyone…a simple “hey its nbd but for next time…” is more appropriate imo. But yes overall, who cares!? Its just a yoga class…\n\nthe problem was not stepping out but coming back in when the door was locked\n\nExactly, the locked door was a quiet reminder for OP that entry was no longer allowed! An alternative could've been for OP to find a comfy spot in which to meditate while she waited for shavasana to be over!\n\nNeither of you did anything wrong, despite what everyone is saying. It's yoga at the gym, it's not a big deal. Every gym based yoga class I have taken I could clearly hear weights, talking, etc from outside of the room. Now you know this instructor's preferences. Don't let this one experience stop you from taking classes you typically enjoy. I also don't think it's something that needs to be addressed with the instructor. \n\nSide note, I do agree that you could benefit from addressing your anxiety.\n\nRight! Who knew yoga at a gym was so serious.\n\nThank you! This is an impartial and encouraging comment. I appreciate your input!\n\nSome of these responses are uptight as shit. I agree it’s very passive aggressive for the instructor to address what you did in front of the WHOLE class. That’s unnecessary and honestly a bit of a power trip. Part of getting into a meditative state *includes* staying serene while dealing with the interruptions of the outside world. Like someone who had to step out, walking by you. Which is totally no big deal. These people are acting like you were stomping around talking on your cell phone or something. \n\nI would have felt the same exact way as you - don’t let these other comments get you down. They’re being a bit…. “precious” as my grandmother would have said nicely.\n\nHahaha!! Thank you for injecting some realness and humor! 🤣 I appreciate it.\n\nI teach gym yoga. People talk through Savasana. Get up and leave. Knock their water bottles over. Fuck around with their friends and giggle the whole time. Cough nonstop. In a studio maybe it’s a little more rigid and I’ve seen teachers lock the door and not let people in that were even a minute late but gym yoga is a free for all. If you want to go back in, go back in.  The instructor is being a punk for locking the door and trying to drag you. Live your life.\n\n[deleted]\n\n“They had no idea there was a fire outside the room. They just thought it was a Bikram yoga class.”\n\nBut the instructor didn’t single you out, he addressed the whole class intentionally not to single you out. \n\nIf you were about the have a coughing fit how did you have a enough time to put your shoes on before leaving? Why not grab them and put them on once outside? It all sounds a little awkward, especially that you then picked the lock to get back into class. I’m also awkward and have social anxiety so I can understand ruminating about this. But honestly this whole scenario is funny, if your friend told you that this had happened to them, wouldn’t you laugh at how silly the whole thing was?\n\nThere is absolutely no need to apologize to anyone for this. It was a mistake and I promise you the instructor doesn’t care.\n\nEdit: all the typos 😳 I just woke up\n\nLol! I couldn’t pick a lock to save my life. The lock is really more like a second manual latch, it can be toggled from the outside. \nIt was a scratch in my throat and I knew I only had a few seconds before it escalated. I know my body pretty well!\n\nI mean this in the nicest possible way: nobody cares. Your classmates won't remember it,  they probably don't even know that it was you that walked out, and it's something your instructor probably says once a week between all of their classes. Don't dwell on it or take it personally. \n\nPlus, you thought it was okay to go back in even though it's against their policy, so maybe the reminder to the class was needed.\n\nI’m actually really shocked that people are jumping on OP. It sounded like she managed the situation with care and respect. Honestly, I feel her horror at being singled out! It took me years to be okay attending yoga classes because of the eliticism that I felt. Now, that I am an instructor, I really try to NOT alienate neurodiverse people who may feel anxiety about being called out. Someone moving quietly through a room during savasanah is NOT a big deal!\n\nI teach Restorative so we are sometimes always in Savasana and I've never locked anyone out during class despite letting folks know they're welcome to use the restroom, get water, whatever. I personally wouldn't go back to his class but I'm picky about how instructors speak to me. Some folks cling to the idea of the environment they create, some recognize control is an illusion, I prefer the latter when it comes to my life it sounds like he's attached to the former. Perhaps there's a better fit for you with a more flexible instructor.\n\nJust talk to the teacher. Apologize for the disruption (yes, even though you were quiet people knew you were moving around and you took their attention from savasana to the room). My money is on the teacher being understanding and will let you know that you are welcome back to class\n\nAs someone who also has social anxiety I hate when people address things in this way too. My old manager used to do it all the time and even if the email wasn't about me I would worry that they thought that I was the one doing the thing they were emailing about. I guess people do this so that they are making sure that everyone knows the expectations. But I agree that it's embarrassing. Unfortunately I think it's commonplace, so my best suggestion is to use this as motivation to work a bit more on addressing your social anxiety.\n\nDepending on where you are going for practice (a studio with rooms vs a room at a gym), I find it ridiculous to lock someone out if they have to leave.  \n\n\nIt's not like anyone is setting out to interrupt (if they do, you address what needs to be addressed).  \n\n\nHere's the thing: you had a coughing fit and left to avoid being a distraction (instructor may have asked anyway, fellow student may have silently wished it).  But presumably you still have something of yours-maybe the mat-that you now need to wait for.  \n\n\nI just...I'm sure there is a reason that makes sense and people are fully on board...I'm not there.\n\nOP, I'd feel the same way if I were in your place and I wish your instructor was a little kinder and more emphatic. However please don't discontinue. In the next session, no one is going to remember this incident apart from you. At some point in time, we've to accept that our anxiety although arising for valid reasons will not let us take the right steps. Trust me, no one including your instructor would want you to quit your class. So please continue on this journey.\n\nI have anxiety too. If you can find a studio not in a gym, it may be better for you. I find the gym yoga teachers to be a little harsh and not as understanding of simple biology like coughing. It’s a little ridiculous considering the most distracting classes are in gyms with weight noise, bass from other classes, etc. Sending love from one anxiety sufferer to another.\n\nI would have not known anything about the Shavansa norms and I love yoga. I do most yoga at my house so I guess I just haven't learned about it yet?? \n\nI feel like, if the instructor feels that strongly about that norm/ritual, then they need to talk about it before class starts. Like \"hey, we take this Shavansa thing very seriously. It's an expectation that you do not return to class if you have to leave the room no matter what.\" Would save the embarrassment of their pupils. He also should have had a private convo with you instead of announcing it to the whole class\n\nUpdate, I read through the comments and apparently it's supposed to be a known norm....I seriously had no idea and I've taken many many yoga classes at different studios. I swear I've never heard of it. I totally understand your embarrassment and the locked door would have confused me, too. If they had a gentle warning sign like \"door will lock after shut due to Shavansa. Please wait until class ends to return.\" \n\nBut either way, what can you do? I'm sure it's not the first time the instructor had to remind the group about random norms. Don't beat yourself up for not knowing a norm that nobody told you about\n\nIt’s not a known norm. I’ve been in a lot of studios in many different states and only a rare few take things that seriously. You did fine. I’m sorry you were treated like that 🙏\n\nLol I'm glad we are not alone! 😊\n\nI structure proably didn’t really *care* but just had a job to do as far as creating and maintaining the atmosphere of the class. It sounds like it was an existing rule and they were repeating it because obviously people didn’t know and probably as their way of apologizing to the class if they felt disrupted without saying “sorry if that person walking in just disrupted you, I usually try to prevent that but I guess this person ain’t aware”\n\nBut I agree with others, just apologize and I’m sure you know for next time and you’re good. I stricter proably knew you needed to walk out and likely knows you weren’t being rude.\n\nI totally understand the embarrassment but addressing it that day wouldn’t saved you a lot of overthinking. Don’t let the anxiety cloud the things you know. You accidentally broke a rule, that’s ok, just apologize. You’re all adults, nobody got hurt lol. \nI would’ve instinctively mouthed “I’m so sorry!” In the moment and been sure to just talk to the instructor after. Likely they would’ve reassured you it was no big deal. If they don’t, I’d find a new gym because I can’t deal with snooty bs lol\n\nIf I had to walk out during Shavasana, I would not walk back into the class until it was done, out of respect. The instructor wasn’t being unfair or rude. \n\nI get it, you have social anxiety, but just chalk it up as a mistake you did and don’t do it again. Next time, be more mindful of other people and their experience. This was a learning experience for you.\n\nRegarding addressing it with the instructor: I would just move on and not confront her, but if you’d like, you can apologize for walking out of the class and walking back in and that you’ll be more mindful next time.\n\nI think you and the instructor are both overthinking this. You should be allowed to get up and he shouldn’t lock the door.  \n\nJust keep going it will probably never happen again and really no one should remember this.\n\nShavasana is always at the end of class so why did u even come back? Doesn’t really make sense to me\n\nNext time, if you have to leave, either grab your things beforehand or wait until class is over to get them.\n\nGrabbing your stuff before leaving would cause even more disturbance.\n\nThat's not really what this post is about though\n\nChill, nobody but you will remember. Now you know. :)\n\nIt sounds like what happened prompted the instructor to remind everyone about how leaving and coming back during savasana can be disruptive. I have done the same thing when someone's phone rings, I don't single them out but rather have a general reminder to everyone about checking that their ringer is off or whatever. Now everyone knows this and hopefully it won't happen again.\n\nIt depends on the class. That class might not be your space! I go to a studio that lets you step in and out as long as it doesn’t become disruptive. You gotta hydrate though and it sounds like it would have been equally if not more disruptive to stay. I personally believe that type of yoga thinking can be restrictive and alienate people from the practice.\n\nIt sounds from the OP like coming and going is fine except for a very small portion of the practice - one during which people are encouraged to relax, something that many people have a hard time doing. Locking the door is not necessary but doing so does emphasize the importance and minimizes the disruption, both in terms of it happening both going and returning and that it's less likely that human nature will kick in and people will think, 'I don't really *need* to, but I want to and it's fine just this once'. \n\n&gt; I personally believe that type of yoga thinking can be restrictive and alienate people from the practice.\n\nTaking the bare minimum of steps to ensure people can relax in savasana is hardly restrictive. As teachers we are expected to hold space, be trauma sensitive, let everyone do exactly what they want while not allowing distractions of any sort to creeep in, and generally read the minds of everyone in the room, etc. etc. What's been described here is a small and reasonable act that holds space for the rest of the room.\n\nNext time have the coughing fit right there if they have a problem with you leaving and then returning to a class that you pay for.\n\nYa. It's absurd to be chastised for disturbing the class when they actually left in order to be less disruptive. This is a perfect example of people enforcing rules for the sake of having rules to enforce, rather than having common sense and respect for others.\n\nThank you, I've been going wtf over and over in this thread. There was a similar post the other day that had similar comments. Didn't know the yoga community was like this :/\n\nThe way he handled this was wrong IMO. It's never right to single someone out in front of everyone. He should have addressed you after the class if it bothered him. There's never complete silence during shavasana and what you did was really considerate so you didn't have a coughing fit during it.\n\nI'm sorry that happened to you. The instructor shouldn't have done that.\n\nPeople, maybe sometimes relax and be human. As an asthmatic person, it does happen to me sometimes, to start coughing like crazy, and having to leave a space and come back. That kind of cough can be over difficult to handle, we do feel like we are dying . It never happened to me within yoga, fortunately. But it could. And then I would go out , not only to not disturb everyone like crazy but also, to like feel alive and survive. Now , I am also a yoga instructor. If an instructor, can’ t make the difference between a person who leave just to leave and a person experiencing something distressing, and trying to Côme back to a calm moment, we have got a problem of compassion. Also, yoga is also a time, where people need to experience, and keeping relaxed and focus in savasana no Matter what , could be a lesson. Let’ s practice more yoga and compassion, and less rigid bullshit, maybe.\n\nTry not to take it personally. You were not aware of this policy beforehand, and now you are. The instructor did embarrass you, which was insensitive on his part. If you wanted to let him know, that could be helpful to him, or he might get defensive, depending on his own issues. Either way, I am sure that neither he, nor anyone else in that class, thinks less of you for leaving the room and coming back in that one time when you did. Try to let go of your hurt feelings. You didn't do anything horrible, you were quiet and considerate, you simply didn't know the policy. Keep going back! Yoga is full of lessons, some of them quite unexpected. 🙏🏼\n\nThat would be a goodbye 👋 from me if a teacher locked the door, no matter on which side I’d be. This is a safety issue and it’s ok to report this. Sounds like you could have waited outside, you didn’t know and now you do, but you did nothing terribly wrong, no need to feel embarrassed. But I understand the stress of this situation. It is not only very mean to lock the door but most importantly dangerous in case of emergency. Unacceptable. This should have been cleared out with words instead. The amount of stories of hideous behaviors from yoga teachers I read here on this sub is astounding.\n\nWhy are you getting downvoted? It IS a safety issue. TBH, yoga is so heavily gatekept in this sub it's wild. The culture around yoga in the US is honestly gross.\n\nHonestly, no one will remember this, including the instructor. I say chin up and carry on if you enjoy this class and find it beneficial. You had a human experience and now know the expectations of the studio/teacher. Breathe in. Breathe out. Try not to allow this to get in your way of doing what you need to do for you.\n\nYou weren’t singled out. The practitioner made it a point not to single you out. No one will think about this another second unless you do it habitually. You’re good to return and no one will even remember.\n\nSucks that you had that experience OP. I can definitely sympathize. But imagine if everyone in class at random moments decided they needed more water. One disruption doesn’t seem like much but if you’re allowed to do it then everyone is. Probably why the instructor made the announcement rather than pull you aside. This way everyone has the same information\n\nI understand you felt singled out (many of us would) but if they didn’t point at you or say “Hey, LNA918 did the wrong thing today everyone ..” then they really didn’t single you out. That was the best way for them to protect the overall integrity of their class\n\nI find it frustrating when people do things like that while I’m practicing. I accept that it happens but appreciate when it doesn’t\n\nI'm so sorry the teacher reacted that way! That's not okay to single someone out.\n\nAs a person in 200 hr YTT, this is really helpful to hear your experience and also the opinions of others. I personally would have addressed it a bit differently by talking to you first, then the next class I would remind everyone of the boundary of when you have to leave shavasana. I have totally felt this way in a class before though so you’re not alone. I’ve literally fallen backwards into another classmate lol\n\nHonestly, this whole thing sounds like a bunch of nothing. So what. I would’ve just said my bad and moved on. I bet you no one else is thinking about it at all. Not to be mean, but you’re the only one concerned about what happened. \nKeep going to yoga because it helps quiet the mind. Focus on your breathing whenever you’re in situations like these. \nNo need to apologize. You did something, he reminded you of the rules. End of story. \n\nDon’t hold people to high bars. People are people and it’s up to you to decide who matches your energy. Same goes for yoga studios. People quietly walk in and out during Savasana all the time at the place I go to. Instructor tells us it’s part of life to keep the peace in a noisy world. But to each their own.\n\n*After the instructor said “namaste” he proceeded to “remind everyone” that if you have to leave during class to do so before shavasana, and if you have to leave during shavasana you will not be allowed back into the classroom because he wants to preserve the peaceful moment for all students.*\n\nI don't know why so many people are so incredibly insensitive. I was told constantly as a kid I was 'too sensitive' and 'thought too much'.  That's fine, I've learned as an adult those are positive things for me personally, and also belatedly able to access the retort 'yes, but that's better than being an insensitive doofus and thinking never, about anything, but you seem to like it' but god, how hard is it to understand when leading a class with a spiritual component that some people might be feeling pretty raw? Is it really that difficult to understand that other people are going through things you can't see?\n\nIt would NOT be hard for him to address this next class. All he had to say was nothing.\n\nThat said, can you write the incident down on a piece of paper and set it on fire? Sometimes that helps me let go of things that are grinding at my happiness.\n\nSometimes.\n\nI would, the class is for you—not for him. I would tell him that you have really bad social anxiety, that you understand why he said something, but that it made you feel unwelcome and unsure if you want to come back. You can suggest that in the future you’d feel more comfortable with him telling you directly and alone rather than in front of the whole class. \n\nIf he cares about creating a good environment, he will want to know your feedback\n\nThis is why I practice at home - on my own, with a routine that some friends who are yoga teachers and pilates instructors helped me develop.  I do not suffer from social or emotional anxiety - but understand that many people experience social/emotional anxiety during shavasana.  Most YTT puts an unnecessary emphasis on shavasana in an effort to include a spiritual/meditative component in a practice that overly emphasizes asana at the expense of the other 7 arms of yoga.  Honestly, I find the made-up meditation patter annoying and really do not enjoy typical made-up shavanasa practice that I have experienced in the classes that I used to attend.\n\nYou were correct to leave class.  Your teacher had no business shaming you for returning to class and should have spoken to you privately.  As mentioned by others, there was also no reason for you to return to class until the door was opened for you.    \n\nHopefully, this experience will inspire you to explore all 8 limbs of yoga, develop your own practice, explore other types of meditation to see what works for you.\n\nIt’s funny, I went through the locked door because I was following the same logic so many people in the comments used; don’t overthink it. \nI just didn’t believe that someone would lock the door behind me on purpose because I left to cough and not disturb anyone. I’ve been going to yoga classes for about 15 years, and I’ve never 1) left a class 2) been locked out. \nI didn’t think much about it. Which is where the anxiety kicks in. Anxiety says, “Someone did this on purpose, they’re trying to keep you out! How rude/mean!” But I constantly push back against that voice, so I counteracted it with the usual thought of “Oh it’s nothing. Don’t overthink it. Go back to your mat.” \nAnd here we are! 🤣\n\nI get that you felt embarrassed, but the teacher did not call you out. It sounds like this triggered a pretty real insecurity spiral for you, or maybe you don’t expect criticism and accountability in spaces where you’ve paid what you consider to be a lot of money.\n\nThis is not an issue with the teacher, this is your issue.\n\nLet it go. They have these rules so the end is peaceful. You don’t have to explain yourself to everyone\n\nOP, I wouldn't see this instructor anymore.\nShavasanana-bo-bana is about finding inner peace in an otherwise chaotic world. It is not about controlling everyone/everything around you in order to force the world to be peaceful.\nThere was no true need to lock you out of the class, it was just some jerk trying to control everyone and their calling you out was just an adult throwing a temper tantrum cause you came back instead of leaving.\nIf you do go back, you should definitely cough when you need to cough and fart when you need to fart, even if the need occurs during corpse time. If that instructor says anything to you about your coughing, farting, or sneezing during their peaceful moment, you can remind him that you're only trying to follow his rule of not leaving during shavasana.\n\nSUPER shitty way to single out a student. Some yoga instructors are so out of touch with the humanity they crave. Some. Not all. But you’ve just encountered your first passive-aggressive yogi. Dude, there was a person clipping their toenails during shavasana…and the teacher just gave me an irked out half-smile when I opened my eyes and looked around like, “what the heck is happening here?” You were polite to avoid the coughing fit. Too bad your teacher is a dink to notice that.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis happens be the quiet time for everyone and at this point I would have chosen not to go back in and disrupt everyone for maybe 10 minutes if that.\n\nSorry for that experience. There are some forms of yoga that I believe a bit too focused on rules and such. If I had that experience, I would look for another class asap. At every studio things can happen at any time to cause distractions. One of the popular studios in my area shares a common wall with a major fire station, where fire engines are constantly leaving with their sirens running.\n\nYes, we want a calm, peaceful environment for Savasana. And, naturally, sometimes it will be less than perfectly silent. IMO, a good instructor/studio will use those less than silent moments as opportunities to learning how to mentally filter out distractions and control our own focus, which is a key aspect of yoga. We are there to learn to control our focus, not the environment. That this happened at a hot yoga studio is not surprising to me, though. Far too many of them are focused on \"performance\" and manipulating the environment in order to create an experience, rather than on learning how to create the experience we want by controlling our own minds.\n\nSadly, yoga as it is often taught in the West is more about the former, while yoga in it's unadulterated form is about the latter.\n\nI totally agree and I'm pretty surprised by all the comments here, especially since I'm a yoga teacher myself. The idea that everyone should be entitled to \\~pure unadulterated silence\\~ during savasana is not something I've ever been promised, or expected in any class that I've taken, and I don't understand why people feel like they're entitled to it.\n\n100%. And, the idea that a student needing water because they are coughing should not quietly leave the room in order to avoid disruption is... I'm sorry - I don't have another way to say it - just bonkers. It is enforcing a rule for the rule's sake, not honoring the purpose of the rule (a peaceful environment).\n\nTOTALLY bonkers! Also, as a student, I WANT my yoga classmates to be comfortable and take care of themselves, even if it means a little bit of noise.\n\nI don’t know why you’re getting downvoted so much. At my studio people are super respectful but there is always someone who will accidentally kick over a metal water bottle or something like that. I think I value a space that doesn’t make people feel embarrassed for making mistakes and focuses on non judgmental observations of our environment. I think that is the most valuable part of yoga for me.\n\nOP - I hear you. I would have been mortified. I’m sorry you experienced that and I hope you can find a comfortable solution, whether it is accepting it and returning, or finding a new teacher. Good luck!\n\nI think it is because the culture described by the OP is far too common in yoga studios in the West. Like Bikram himself, they are hyper-controlling and they do not like being called on it. And, as with many things in yoga, they run counter to actual yogic training. It is what it is. If I get even a whiff of that sort of culture at a studio, I stay far, far, far away.\n\nI’m sorry you’re getting downvoted, u/OurUrbanFarm.\n\nA lot of Redditors misunderstand what upvoting and downvoting is for, and will downvote things they simply disagree with. (Reflective of a more systematic societal problem, but I digress!)\n\nAccording to Reddit itself (https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette#:~:text=Vote.,a%20particular%20community%2C%20downvote%20it. ), “If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.\n\nYour comment was on topic and in my opinion absolutely contributes to the conversation, whether or not people agree or not. Downvoting your comment I think is an example of the kind of act that detracts from our community here, and worse, makes it less “safe” for all of us to voice our considered and rational takes and share our own experiences and thoughts in a welcoming and considerate environment.\n\nSo, this not disrupting savasana thing is a nuanced topic. Whether it’s a great rule or not, OP should have known that in the studio culture there that re-entering the classroom during savasana is not cool. Could have been the instructor’s shortcoming, too — maybe this unwritten rule was never voiced where OP heard it, who knows? So there’s that.\n\nI agree with u/basicparadox that learning how to ignore distractions that actually don’t have to affect us is not a skill we were born with. It needs to be taught and it needs to be practiced.\n\nFor beginners, simply being able to lie still in savasana for even a minute can be challenging enough. Eliminating distracting noises and motion is helpful and to have a rule about it can be beneficial to that part of practitioner’s yoga journey. Quiet is quite beneficial there for almost everyone.\n\nLearning to ignore or withdraw from sensory input — pratyahara — the fifth limb or auxiliary practice of Patanjali ashtanga yoga — is not the first limb for good reason. It’s a more advanced practice. First we learn to control our actions (yama and niyama), then our body (asana), then our breath (pranayama), and THEN we are much more ready to learn to control our senses. Having distractions at this point on the path is actually helpful sometimes—we have to practice not following them! (Yes, the limbs aren’t really meant to be completely followed in order always but there is a method and a logic to their ordering nonetheless.)\n\nIf we had a different kind of yoga infrastructure (I’m talking only about my experiences in the USA, primarily NYC), we could provide leveled classes and workshops more often that recognize how to support practice at different points along the path, and spend some more effort encouraging practitioners to practice at appropriate levels for them. As it is, we more commonly have these crazily broad open level classes that try to be all things to all people and we end up with slightly silly norms (like instructors locking doors against their own students) because the teaching modality has huge gaps in it and instructors are trying to do the bestest for the mostest and that’s really hard.\n\n(I do put my money where my mouth is and go to a studio with leveled classes! It’s been a real game changer for me.)\n\nThis is a great comment and I agree with it almost entirely. To be clear, I absolutely knew my comment would be downvoted, and I knew why it would be downvoted and, generally who would do the downvoting. It is a sad reality of the culture more broadly, and I would argue, is the kind of issue perpetuated by the kinds of rules described by the OP.\n\nThe thing I disagree with is the idea that OP should have known the rule and followed it. There is an extreme logical disconnect in that people downvoting my comment argue that the rule is to keep the studio quiet during Savasana, yet the OP was doing their best to honor the space by leaving because of a coughing fit.\n\nIt is convoluted - at best - to suggest that a student should remain in the room, when needing water to calm a cough, rather than quietly leaving. It makes no sense. It is a rule being enforced simply for the sake of a rule, even when the enforcement of the rule achieves the opposite result. That is not really that hard. Using some common sense and treating people respectfully (exactly what the OP was doing) isn't really that hard.\n\nOh thanks for your comment. I agree with your disagreement with me! I went back and read my own comment again and the part about what rule I was writing about is actually super unclear.\n\nIt’s very likely that OP would have heard a studio rule about not leaving during savasana, though maybe not.\n\nBut to take that literal rule and reasoning it back to the underlying purpose (Minimize distractions during savasana) and then figuring out in real time that leaving during a coughing fit during savasana is better than staying and then staying out until the end is better still, I guess is not necessarily going to be obvious to everyone!\n\nIn any case, whether or not we love the rule, I hope OP goes back to class and doesn’t let the anxiety over this minor and very forgivable faux pas divert them from practice.\n\nI don’t agree with this. It’s sort of like dog training. You learn in a peaceful environment with limited distractions, build up the skill, and then apply it around distractions. If you start around distractions, it’s going to be a lot harder to progress.\n\nI agree that we strive for a peaceful environment in Savasana. However, these sorts of rules are extreme overkill and unnecessary and, IMO, prevent learning some of the most important aspects of yoga.\n\nNot only is that not a yogic thing of the instructor to do, but to lock someone out of a space??? Really? (By the way a space that’s not legally theirs if at a public gym)That also flirts with legal issues. Without consent of patrons unknowingly (in shavasana) locked in a room or preventing you from obtaining personal property in the event of an emergency. For example, if you had to go back in and grab your keys or phone but it was locked in an active class. I’ve seen cases where that’s criminal charges. These “instructors” are so full of themselves and yoga is never that serious. \n\nThe professional way to convey HIS wishes in class during shavasana is addressing it before every class begins as a friendly reminder. Also, look into the gyms rules. I’m very confident for public health, emergency and safety reasons, doors especially during business hours are not to be locked.\n\nYoga masters in India practice with freakin tigers lurking around and noises of nature . All while their eyes are closed in meditation. But you have a human quietly coming in or out of a room during shavasana being a big deal? It’s just laughable how ridiculously far first world yoga culture take things.\n\nI have Gerd and sometimes have a cough from it.  If I can't stop it, I get up and go to the bathroom to preserve the peace.  If someone locked me out, I would find another yoga class--or stay for a couple of others and have a coughing spell and see how they liked it.  Not a good teacher.  Leave.\n\nThis is on you.  Your need to cough/drink water shouldn't trump everyone else's desire for a quiet shavasana.  Leaving to cough/drink was the right call, coming back in was where you f'ed up.\n\nI can tell that you are a thoughtful person and a dedicated student.  I am sure you are very much welcome in the class, and I hope you continue to attend. \n\nSometimes instructors address the whole class to prevent students from taking it upon themselves to correct one another. \n\nYou did a polite and self-compassionate act by leaving to care of your cough. \n\nThese moments of human imperfections pass, just like the clouds.\n\nDude one time in a yoga class I got my PERIOD and didn't realize until we were in happy baby and I saw it in the reflection of the mirror wall. Fucking mortifying! But I went back again and again and I'll keep going back in the future. I will probably do something embarrassing or awkward in class again in the future. It's okay! We're just weird little dudes trying to feel good about ourselves. Please go back to yoga again, don't let this stop your practice, and it's also okay to try a different class or even a different studio after your contract ends.\n\nExactly what bumbling-bluebird-90 said, but add “I didn’t think it was very kind of you publicly shame me like you did.”\n\nI think it’s oké that he mentioned it to everyone to remain clear. Sometimes people think oh he did it now I can go out during class as well, vbecause the teacher didn’t mention something. But actually he wants to keep the class uninterrupted. I don’t think it is to personal and also good to mention why you left and apparently did interrupt his class. Life is messy sand sometimes we don’t know what’s going on.\n\nIf it's important to you to attend the class then address it with the instructor. You don't have to apologize. Just clear the air. You had to leave to deal with your situation and felt quite embarrassed by how it was addressed as it wasn't your intention to disrupt the class. Most yoga instructors dissuade people from exiting during class (especially if the lights are turned low). I'm sure it's as much a liability thing as it is preserving relaxation. If you don't feel better after you talk to the instructor then talk to someone higher up explaining that it's important to you to attend the class but you now feel uncomfortable with how the situation has been handled.\n\nI'm so sorry this happened. :(((\n\nSeems like the instructor is the person who should be embarrassed. Real leadership would have pulled the OP aside and mentioned the rules after class. Then, the next session, the teacher could clarify these rules for everyone else. Then no one is singled out so publicly. I don’t have this kind of anxiety anymore, but I did for a long time. It’s not something that goes away easily, and can reappear at the most unexpected and dismaying times. 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nPerhaps, by addressing the whole class, the instructor was not singling you out for an innocent mistake and making sure everyone else knew for the future? \n\nThat was my take on it, but i dunno. \n\nI would feel mortified if someone spoke to me afterwards but less so if it was addressed to the group! \n\nEta - completely understand worrying, but i promise you nobody else will remember or care that it was you (not even the instructor). \n\nIt was an innocent mistake and a useful lesson!\n\nI’m sorry this happened to you! I’m used to very strict yoga studios when if you leave at all during the class, you are not allowed back in. While I agree that while it can be disruptive for other students, we are all human and especially if we are new to yoga, it takes time to settle in to the way people do things.\n\nI would address it with the instructor, because you two have a relationship as teacher and student. They may not have singled you out one on one at the end because they may have feared that was being too confrontational, so they chose to convey their rule (idk if it is a studio rule or their rule) in this manner that comes off as rather passive aggressive.\n\nYou are learning how to be a student, but they are also on a constant journey learning how to be a teacher. Even if they brush you off in the moment, they will be sure to remember your feedback for later. They also see many students and may have not had to deal with a newbie in a while. In my experience, they are also not used to their students bringing things up to them one on one, so it may facilitate a good conversation between you two where it becomes clear that you are new, you were trying not to be disruptive, and you are committed to trying to be the best yoga student possible.\n\nAs an instructor, I would have addressed the student privately to avoid embarrassment. I think this could have been handled better. Sorry you experienced that.\n\nI am sorry for what you went through. As someone with social anxiety, I can totally relate. But don't take this incident personally. \nAs a yoga practitioner, I can not emphasis enough on the shavasana. And how it should be done without any disturbance or distraction. \nMy suggestion for you would be to forget about it and  continue your classes.\nYoga will do wonders to your mind and body. "

    "all_comment_text": "First off, great control. You’re doing great. I think there’s two things you need to work on. First off keep pushing hard through the shoulders. You can see the push get soft and it’s hard to stay controlled if you lose the push in the shoulder. Second, work on pushing into the finger tips to prevent overbalance. Try working on heel pulls at the wall and focus on generating the push through the finger tips.\n\nThank you!\n\nLooking between your hands or couple inches below should be fine at your current level, with experience you will eventually be able to look to other places and even close your eyes, but that should come after getting at least 30 seconds with full control of your balance.\n\nTo stop your body from leaning backwards you can either make soft corrections, which come from pressing or releasing your fingers, or hard corrections, which come from your shoulders and hips. For a good handstand we need make the least amount of hard corrections, but sometimes it is inevitable. Judging from your video it seems you could have pressed your fingers more. You can train that finger pressing by handstanding with your back against the wall and trying to release your feet from the wall without kicking, only by pressing with your fingers.\n\nI’ll definitely try that, thank you!\n\nA coach told me this little tip back when I was doing gymnastics: “ squeeze your butt so you don’t fall back and your abs so you don’t fall forward “. Worked for me so I would suggest giving it a shot.\n\nYou seem to have a great foundation already, but I would definitely try to actively engage your core and keep you arms strong pushing against the ground to keep from arching your back. \n\nOne thing that may help is trying a double stag handstand as well to get the added balance of having your legs on each side of your head and really focus on engaging your core to keep from bending your back in that position. Once you can hold that position solid and you’re familiar with the feeling in your core, then it should be easier to do the straight leg handstand. As for where to look, I always look at the floor directly in between my hands\n\nI’ll try that, thanks!\n\nAbout a foot or more below your hands for now. Back wall when you can be still. \n\nfor me the overbalance and the mid body/legs becoming a solid line was improved by dropping  the legs a foot or so and then up again, either near a wall or freestanding, practice lowering the feet/legs a foot and back up to straight. This helped me to engage enough  muscle in the low back to hold control of the legs and make them an extension of the core. This takes core strength as well.\n\nyou have  very good straight line , better than mine.  Maybe a little more overall strength and time growing the zone from which you can regain balance when out of line\n\nI get my daily drill program from utubes Natalie Reckert, and there is a great new short video from Adell Bridges on some drills to help with balance and having better awareness of each joint during handstand I recommend \n\nkeep up (side down ) the good work\n\nLiterally any Abdominal exercises will strengthen the core &amp; even out the arching of your low back. \n\nOk thank you! I feel like I do core exercises all day long… maybe I’m not engaging well enough\n\nAre you pulling your abs in AND up? \n\nYou might benefit from reading more about the bandhas &amp; exactly how to engage them. \n\nI don’t think I am. Do you have any resources you recommend?\n\nNot necessarily. I would just Google “ how to engage the bandhas” &amp; read through whichever articles are easiest. \n\nThere might be some Youtube vids on it too. \n\nI’m a teacher &amp; always tell my students to do handstands against a wall &amp; start doing crunches by bringinf your legs into the “cannonball” stance, you obviously can’t use your arms bc they are extended. But just imagine the leg portion of jumping into a pool, cannonball style.\n\n, You should have no problems doing multiple crunches in a handstand if your abs are strong as you think they are. 😝\n\nYoga humbled me in this area. \n\nSuch fantastic advice here.\n\nstart with some seated deep belly breaths. on your exhale, slither like a snake. and feel the deep core (transverse abdominis) engage. once you get a feel for this engagement, then you can start to feel for it in active core exercises. you dont need your six pack abs for handstands at all, just the deep core. Look for \"hollow body\" core exercise.\n\nI have this main issue as well, though you already seem more straight than I can get. Get up and then take a half second to really think about and pull in that core. When I do so I do have to rebalance a bit, but it feels solid when I get the focus in the right place.\n\nBeautiful for sure.  I’m trying but struggling terrible but I still love it. You are doing a great job way to go !\n\nLook for capoeira videos for the best handstand technique\n\nLet your head drop between your arms ..!\n🙂👍🏼✌🏽\n\nSqueeze the ground with your hands. Look up proper hand position, as contraction causes your body to come backwards.\n\nI don’t have any advice but I do have compliments. One: you’re hot, Two: gorgeous dining room.\n\nCounter pressure with abs and butt. Charge your calf’s and toes. Try against a wall until you can stay vertical without discomfort/ overcorrection. Be content with where you’re at, right now it’s enough.\n\nYour shape looks really great!  One tip I sometimes give people related to gaze when I'm coaching is to look a little BELOW your hands (rather than between them).  This helps people working on their shoulder mobility to keep a nice straight spine.\n\nIt will feel weird at first but most people find it becomes comfortable surprisingly quickly.\n\nAll that being said, I haven't seen any of you other than this one handstand so it's possible that this isn't the right queue for you at all (take it with a grain of salt)\n\nEnjoy your practice, you're looking good!\n\nEasiest method do your handstands next to a wall so you can't fall that way. Try and not touch the wall at all but if you start going that direction practice using the smallest/softest correction to get back straight. After you build up enough control to stay off the wall at all for a minute then start moving further and further away and once you are a foot or more away from the wall you can do it anywhere.\n\nenergy wise - find a way to rebalance the energy back.  \na. kick up with less force  \nb. learn to controol the hips to take the energy back  \nc. use the toes to point the energy back.  \nd. keep the shoulder up and stable so the sift of energy wont break the base of the structure.  \ne. do fall into only the ego and physical dimension.  \nGood luck"

How does one develop this inconvenient issue?\n\nI'm learning to play the guitar.\n\nAnd here's Trey Anastasio:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxQp5Z6vqo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxQp5Z6vqo)\n\ndidn’t expect to see this vid linked on the yoga sub 😂\n\nAs a man, the orgasm women experience is obviously already perplexing to me, I can't imagine how a leg raise at the gym could. I have no other words to use other than perplexed.\n\nEdit: men can have them too apparently albeit rarely.\n\nLook of a medical diagram of a clitoris: it’s actually huge, most of it is internal. There are tons of erogenous zones in the pelvic area, and all over the body for many people (neck, thighs, nipples). I just chalk it up to some people have erogenous zones that get tickled just the right way with certain exercises lol. Lucky us.\n\nusername checks out\n\nThe hamstring machine for me\n\nIt happens to me on the hamstring machine, too!! 🤣\n\nSame here\n\nHow do you keep quiet when orgasming 🤪 you’ll have to let out some breath at some point and most likely it’s be a little louder / different than breathing through a flow in a yoga class?\n\nI'm with you. Maybe I could be quiet, but I convulse all over when I orgasm and someone would definitely notice. Best case scenario they'd think I had the chills. No way could I hold a pose through an orgasm.\n\nYeahh especially a bridge pose 😅\n\nThere are different strengths of orgasm that the same person can have! I can have milder, silent ones from exercise, sitting a certain way, etc., but ones with a  buildup from sex or masturbation will involve convulsing, heavy breathing etc. Both are definitely orgasms though.\n\nI just can't get over the image of myself flopping over like a fish on dry land while on a yoga mat.\n\nAgain, it's not even close to the same level! There's the involuntary pulsing and resolution of tension that's unmistakably an orgasm, but without the full buildup there's no full-body experience. It's localized. It happens to me and no one knows- and this doesn't mean that my  orgasms during sex/masturbation aren't intense and obvious!\n\nI am mostly being flippant 🙂\n\nOk haha I couldn’t tell if some people really couldn’t conceive of this other reality! \n\nI can be dead silent like nothing's happening, probably because my orgasms are extremely disappointing no matter how it's achieved.\n\nI'll have what she's having.\n\nWhen Sally Met Bridge Pose\n\nThis is good. Thank you for making me smile\n\nYou’re welcome ☺️🫶🏽\n\nAmen!\n\nive heard about this, i think its called a coregasm bc it happens when engaging muscles in ypur core ? i dont know much about it but maybe thats a term that could help you research:)\n\nI’ve had this happen when doing leg lifts. Super weird\n\nWhat kind of leg lifts?  Which muscles are being activated?\n\nI thought I was the only one!!! Yes this happens and it is SO weird....I can feel it building up so I honestly haven't let myself climax from it (because I'm normally in class or at the gym lol) as I can catch it ahead of time  but I know if I keep going I'll get there.\n\nYou aren't alone sister....just can't tell if it's a blessing or a curse for us yet 😅 I do not \"give my all\" to bridge while in class though, I already do enough unintentional and embarrassing things in my practice\n\nThank you so much for this comment - I’m glad I’m not the only one here that is experiencing this as a regular occurrence. I think we need a support group haha.\n\nHeh, your username.\n\nexercise-related orgasm for women has been documented heavily, usually having to do with crunches, pull ups, core stuff. see \"coregasm.\"\n\nMen if they hurt their junk they curl up and grab their stomachs.  All kind of nerves related to genitals goes through the core area.\n\nI had never heard of this, and briefly considered this being a creative writing exercise, but googled around.\n\nApparently you’re not alone! \n\nhttps://www.verywellfit.com/what-is-a-coregasm-5095046\n\nYESS I was just going to share this same link. I am a runner and I have had two orgasms already whilst running and I couldn’t figure out how or why and I’m very loud when I orgasms so it’s embarrassing\n\nThis is crazy. Can you do it with slightly off form to avoid it during classes? Or “practice” at home to focus on avoiding it?\n\nYes, if I do this lazily so to speak I can completely avoid climax, but if I’m fully engaged (the way you’re supposed to) - glutes, deep core, shoulders engaged - then it’s game over.\n\nGame over. You win!\n\nI think you might need to step away from the idea that there's a way you're 'supposed' to do yoga, and focus on finding the right way for doing yoga for yourself. If that's using less effort in bridge, then use less effort.\n\nDang you must have immaculate form! You just inspired me to work on my bridges :D\n\nYou win the game!!!\n\nSyntribation is the act of clenching one's muscles to induce orgasm. It's more common than you think. Engaging the core in the right way can do that. I heard that many yoga poses can cause orgasm in that way -- I think chair pose was listed as one example. But it can happen in many other benign activities,  like swinging on a swing.\n\nI understand the weird nonconsensual nature of it happening to you in public. I wonder if there's a way you can modify bridge pose to make it more chaste in public? Ie only doing a baby bridge, or just making it your standard practice to switch the pose for another one because you \"tweaked your back that day\" or whatever?\n\nI would be so upset if this happened. I would never do bridge again in public.\n\nCoregasm\n\n[removed]\n\nI'm a man and can orgasm while doing weighted crunches. It perplexes me as well. I mean, bridges and crunches involve your pelvic floor, so there's your answer I suppose.\n\nThis is called Exercise-Induced Arousal and it has been well researched and documented, especially through the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University. There are plenty of academic articles you can peruse, just do a quick Google Scholar search. There are specific exercises and patterns of exercise that have been identified to be more likely to induce orgasm. Generally, engaging your core intensely immediately after about 20 minutes of cardio is the most common. There are specific workouts plans that some people use to purposefully experience it to motivate them to work out more. It is not something everyone can experience, but is a totally normal bodily function and nothing to be ashamed of! It does NOT mean you are a perv and it is usually not a kink. It's just an odd thing that some bodies do. Many people experience this during workouts regularly and no one around them would ever notice. For many people it is indistinguishable from a sexual orgasm, but the experience of an orgasm in such a completely different context means it is often desexualized, just a pleasurable perk of working out.\n\nI will need those workout plans 🤣\n\nJust for the record, I referred to a kink in my comment not because OP is experiencing this phenomenon (human bodies are funny and sometimes things just happen!) but because she has precisely stated she very much knows what causes it (a bridge pose when she consciously engages all the muscles) and can easily prevent it from happening in public but she sometimes just doesn't because \"core activation and meditation\" is a part of her practice. I can only compare it to a guy who gets a surprise boner in a yoga class (can happen, it's a body reaction) vs a guy who repeatedly continues going knowing he will get erection as soon as X asana happens because it's \"part of his practice\" (most people I know would not feel comfortable with such a companion).\n\nShe didn’t say she “sometimes doesn’t”. She said she “forgot”. Those are different things. She clearly isn’t interested in doing this on purpose in public, which is the entire point of the post.\n\nRight plus not every yoga class involve bridge pose so she may not always remember\n\nNever heard of it. But honestly this “problem” is so easily “fixed”.  &gt;&gt;&gt;Just don’t do it in public. \nbtw im jealous\n\nEveryone is talking about core muscle engagement causing this, but it’s more specifically your pelvic floor muscle engagement that’s at work here. \n\nReach out to \n[Leslie Howard](http://lesliehowardyoga.com/), a pelvic floor yoga specialist, I’m betting she could give you both more information about how your pelvic floor engagement is involved as well as pose modifications so that you can participate in class without fearing involuntary orgasm.\n\nAnd cool it with the jokes y’all, unintentional orgasm in public can feel embarrassing, humiliating, or shameful to some folks. Bottom line, it’s making OP feel uncomfortable enough to ask how to stop, so this is not an experience she’s enjoying or that feels good to her on an emotional or mental level. \n\nIt may not even feel good on a physical level if it’s happening this way. You all may not believe that, but context is important for how we experience what’s happening in our bodies. For example, The excitement in your body that you feel riding a roller coaster is the same bodily reaction that you would have if you were fleeing an attacker. The same hormones are released and the same bodily responses are happening. But because of context you emotionally and mentally interpret it as fun and exciting rather than as panic and fear. Same thing here. She’s not enjoying this, it’s not feeling good, your jokes are unkind and insensitive.\n\nthis isn't talked about much in MPY modern postural yoga - most studio practice and trainings today. but the roots of our Hatha yoga practice are in large part related to the cultivation and movement of various energies within the body, including sexual energy. \n\n\nbridge pose especially activates the Svadhisthana chakra while closing the Jalandhara bandha to prevent that energy from rising, an orgasm is one possible outcome. Another might be the intentional shifting of that energy to the Anahata, or letting it build and be released through the crown as you move into wheel or fish. \n\n\nsome find this energy movement easier to practice and visualise in stable conditions far from orgasm! others find that having some energy to work with gives them more feedback. \n\n\napologies if this is overly esoteric, but that's yoga\n\nThank you so much for your thoughtful reply, esoteric is exactly what I’m looking for here. I am going to dig into these chakras, are there any resources that you would recommend to learn more about this?\n\nI'm glad it was helpful! yes, the chakras and meditations on them are a good place to start. bandha and pranayam are an integrated part of your asana practice? if not, find a teacher who will teach and cue bandha and breath for each pose.\n\n\ntaking it further really requires a teacher in front of you, even a community around you. and there's no book i could say at this point is the best place for you to start, but there's a lot out there! there's also a lot of muddied stuff going on under the name tantra, so if you read, read widely and expect understanding to come slowly.\n\nCue me at home furiously practicing bridge pose….\n\nI thought I was the only one. Not bridge pose, but leg raises in pilates. I had to stop because I could feel it coming on.... haven't been to class since 😆\n\nI get a little bit of this sometimes when I do cobra pose, never in a yoga class though, and usually when I'm not that warmed up and just trying to get my body moving in the morning. It's quite overwhelming because it comes on so suddenly, I have to move out of the pose 😅\n\nI think this is what parts of tantra are about\n\nCoregasm! Happens to me when I do the Hundred in Pilates.\n\nIt’s called “water under the bridge pose”.  Very rare and amusing for everyone involved.  Congrats.\n\nIf you know that's how it's going to end (congrats!), just don't do it in public (you can always do a different asana while others are doing bridge, similar to people who can't/won't do it because of various health reasons).\n\n*Last night I forgot about this during my flow and inadvertently climaxed in the middle of class, again.*\n\nLike, you have forgotten that you orgasm during the Bridge pose? I find this very sus / border impossible / sounds like it's your kink.\n\nDefinitely not my kink, its been months since the last time I was in this position in public and I just wasn’t thinking about it. If I don’t fully engage I can avoid climax, but if I’m deep in a flow meditation like I was yesterday doing all of the fancy yoga things and fully engaged it’s immediate and I don’t have time to react - it completely disrupts my meditation and is jarring.\n\nIn the post you say you climax every time you get into the pose and activate the muscles, that it can result in multiple orgasms and that it's happening for years (many people reading are jealous right now lol) - it does not sound like something you could casually forget or not \"think about\", especially when doing it in public. If you keep it to yourself it might not be that problematic, but if you moan or make weird sounds, I can guarantee it's not only your meditation that is disrupted and it can make people uncomfortable. Seems like you know exactly when it's happening (bridge pose) so it's easy to avoid (or take advantage of in private).\n\nI think the downvotes are very unfair\n\nWhy? Everyone’s telling her to just engage less WHEN IN PUBLIC, but OP refuses to acknowledge this as a possibility. Literally just repeating “this sucks and there’s nothing I can do about it” it’s weird. And to be frank it just sounds like you (OP) are using this forum to say “look what I can do” under the guise of “oh no, I cum during class” this whole post is fucking ridiculous I’m sorry\n\nI agree, it's like the \"doctor when I this it hurts\" - \"don't do it then\" thing. It's a non-issue and not a compulsory element of yoga to do the bridge pose in perfect form in front of a group of people. And honestly, bodies just do all sorts of weird things. It's not that uncommon for women to orgasm during various forms of exercise, or men get random boners.\n\nRandom boners, at least in my experience, happen most often when we’re relaxed.  Vigorous exercise tends to shrink the penis somewhat, maybe because the blood is more needed elsewhere.\n\nThe downvotes are very unfair\n\n\n &gt;Why? \n\n\n Because you are discounting the mitigating factors plainly recounted by OP:\n\n\n\n\n it may happen reliably, but it's  infrequent \n\n\n\n\n OP has indeed found out how to control it, but this works against immersion in the process / state, which is the aim of yoga \n\n\n\n\n The aim of yoga is Dhyana; this is an impediment and the student is asking for help \n\n\n\n\n You are imputing insincere motives to the student based on no personal knowledge of the student, only what the student has shared in this post. \n\n\n\n\nBased on a content analysis of OP's statements (full of regret and frustration,  not gloating and pride) and yours (full of harsh judgment and accusations of boasting), I think the much more likely explanation is: you are jealous, and wish to tear  down another person based on their fuller expression of sexuality than your own. \n\n\n I believe you are projecting, and I would bet money you have serious issues around your sexuality, competition with other females, and status.\n\n\n\n\n Because jealousy in a case like this is much more likely to come from  a woman with a competitive streak than from a man (a man is more likely to have understanding arise in this case), I guess: the downvotes are simply toxic femininity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n That's why.\n\nOP being like: \"I totally can prevent it if I don't engage all the muscles or don't do the pose but sometime I just \"forget\" and climax in public and I'm sad because it disrupts my meditation, WDYT?\"\n\nDoing full breath work, core activation, and meditation is a part of my yoga practice that I take very seriously. I completely agree that there is an option to just ignore or avoid what’s happening, and people have a right to that. In fact, I have been doing that - for years. And now I’m here asking the community their experiences and recommendations because I want to work with/through this, and deepen my spiritual and physical yoga practice in the process, and to see if there are others out here who experience the same thing. You are welcome to have what ever response, reaction, or interpretation of this that you are having. Thank you to all of the wonderful people who took the time to offer constructive and meaningful feedback in this thread.\n\n When I was injured I constantly forgot my elbow couldn't bend in a certain way even though it hurt every time. Just stop.\n\nI completely agree with you! She is clearly aware that this is a genuine issue for her, and yet does it anyway. And as for the other absolute lunatics commenting on your opinions, just ignore them. It always amazes me how people become judgemental asshats after reading a single comment, and then ironically become the very thing they accuse you of! Just laugh at them and move on!\n\nThanks, I would agree.\n\nLmao right? Oh my gosh, I forgot, That I literally come loudly in the middle of class when I do a certain pose. Tehee, oops! Oh my God I did it again! Whoops, I forgot that I’m orgasmic in bridge pose. Oh my God it’s happening again!\n\nyou added loudly. also you're an asshole. Lots of things are easy to forget. When I was injured I constantly forgot my elbow couldn't bend in a certain way even though it hurt every time. Just stop.\n\nMy bad, maybe she just keeps coming *quietly*? Either way of temporary injury is way different than an orgasm! My wrist hurts, so I’m gonna take it easy for a week with the wrist stuff. OK. I orgasm when I bridge pose, I should do that one at home only. \n\nMaybe she just really can’t help it and it’s not a kink. Like when you go outside and you look towards the sun that you sneeze? But if every time I looked at the sun, I orgasm, I would at least wear a hat and sunglasses so I didn’t Come in public.\n\nAs a man reading this, the word “repeatedly” is where I lost hope of this being accessible to me\n\nOP - Thank you for posting this!!!  This happened to me a couple times when running 5k and twice when doing a bench press (only happens when lifting heavy)!! I didnt say anything to anyone cause I was embarassed. Like others have said I can feel it building so just stop the movement and it goes away, but has gone away then smacked me with a big O with no build a couple minutes later. I'm off to go research coregasms 😅\n\nA female teacher relayed to me that a training she went to used to call Camel pose “Happy Camel” for just this affect. As a male yoga enthusiast I’m a bit jealous that I’ve never had any yoga pose do anything to my genitalia other than make them uncomfortable.\n\nI’m stealing this! It’s happened to me in Camel but also some other activities and poses with active core muscles.\n\nJesus, I have to concentrate like I’m doing my taxes to even set the groundwork for an orgasm and you guys are all out here having them accidentally 😭\n\nCan we have a class on this please?\n\nI gotta stretch more! 😄\n\nI haven’t heard of this specific issue before but it makes me think about my experiences with a trauma release exercise that I’ve had some powerful physical and emotional results from— not orgasmic really but the ‘tremors’ always reminded me somewhat of a sexual response (legs shaking and major tension release). This is the video I use &gt; https://youtu.be/N8Iw1Z8lolc?si=ptFufaU3DxyHdFur\n\nI’ve also heard of people reaching orgasm from kundalini yoga or meditation. It may be kundalini energy that you are cultivating somehow.\n\nI think this dovetails into one of the core questions that I really have about this, which is is this an actual practice somehow that I’m inadvertently tapping into? I do a LOT of energy work, meditation, and breath work, but it isn’t necessarily a kundalini practice - I’m more practicing these elements in a standard power flow class. It’s difficult to find good sources, which is really why I’m asking here.\n\nJust want to preface this by saying I have very little knowledge on any of these things, but based on my experiences and from what I’ve heard from others I think it would make sense that you may be accidentally tapping into this kundalini energy from all of these practices that you are involved in. The intention doesn’t need to be there in order for this type of response to happen. I tried a kundalini meditation just once and had an orgasm from it, which I had no idea was even possible until I looked into it after\n\nAlso look into that TRE video or other TRE exercises and see if anything makes sense to you. The video I sent works by first tiring your leg muscles and then allowing the tremors to flow through your legs then the rest of your body (this is very therapeutic as it releases tension and built up trauma). But you have to get into a bridge pose in order to reach that point and activate the tremors. If you’re doing bridge after tiring out the rest of your body in a yoga class, that might be enough to activate the tremors and the orgasm-like response you’ve described.\n\nThank you so much for your reply here. I will check out the video you posted!\n\nThere are a ton of books written by yogis in eastern cultures that are translated to English. I used to read a lot of the *real* Tantra Yoga books and dug into Kundalini a bit, but not much. I would suggest searching for some books on Amazon or Audible (this is how I did it) and looking for ones that are written by people from those cultures and not the western world.\n\nOkay thank you! Do you have any recommendations on specific texts that you’ve found more insightful?\n\nAnything by Christopher D. Wallis but I really loved [Tantra Illuminated](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01ACM9BMI?source_code=ASSORAP0511160006&amp;share_location=pdp). \n\nIf you start there, you should be able to find a lot of like-minded authors. :)\n\nThank you SO much - this is exactly what I was looking for here.\n\nOf course :) I hope you enjoy Tantra Illuminated if you decide to read it. It was really eye opening for me.\n\nI second this book recommendation!! It’s fantastic.\n\nThat sounds tricky. Anything involuntary is unsettling, let alone something so intimate and personal.\n\nThe core muscles are right near the Swadhisthana so if you are activating those muscles and engaging yourself in \"energy work\" (what is this, kriya?), meditation, and whatnot then it's no surprise that this could lead to an orgasm. Men frequently become erect when meditating for similar reasons.\n\nKriya is noted, I will be looking into this.\n\nThis happens to me in camel pose! Never tried to figure out how to prevent it, though.\n\nContracting muscles around your groin, the thighs and the low back opening etc… yes it can cause an Orgasm. \n\nI’ve had it happen in other scenarios \n\nThis is interesting. \n\nI would say practice at home and try to move that energy up (or down if you’re upside down) the spine \n\nLet it get out, let it heal others. Send it to someone in need. Seriously. Forget who; just send it out. \n\nSee what happens. \n\nIf you’re ever just alone and having a touchy time, do the same thing. Manage it. Don’t let it manage you.\n\nI love this, thank you.\n\nNot me but it happened to a friend of mine in a yoga class once 😭 she kept her cool\n\nHaven't experienced it in bridge but when you engage your core and pelvic floor muscles, it may lead to an orgasm. I've felt it whilst doing pull ups\n\nNot sure if this helps, but all the people who can”think off” practice yoga. \n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/thinking-off-the-pleasure-of-controlling-your-thoughts_b_57a8df01e4b08f5371f1c72d\n\n...I'm jealous. 🤣🤣🤣\n\nIf you are concerned, I would recommend having an evaluation with a pelvic floor physical therapist - especially if you have any other symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction like frequent/urgent urination, any pain during intercourse, etc. Bridge engages the pelvic floor and posterior chain more than the “core,” so it might be beneficial to look at potential pelvic floor conditions. Almost everyone could benefit from some pelvic floor PT. :-)\n\nSuddenly I have the urge to get back in to yoga!\n\nDamn I want this superpower.\n\nBridge exercises stimulate sacral chakra upto throat chakra if we breathe properly, focus is on sacral and root we will experience orgasms / ejaculation (for men), try to bring the focus to your third eye / crown chakra when your core muscles are about to be fatigued use different focus point on body to distribute the energy created because of bridge  exercises. Like bring the energy to your toes or heals bring it back to head/ third eye hope you get the picture when you get on the mat. Happy yoga days to you fellow human 😇😁\n\nThank you! I will give this a go!\n\nI had an O while trying the monad meditation model before it was best O id ever had 😳\n\nI have not read all the answers or responses but I sympathize although I’m a man I have a similar thing, certain weight lifting combos leg raises etc has a similar effect to me!  \nI’m aware of it so in public gym it’s easier to not do that set of moves…\n\nI can barely do camel much less bridge. I envy you on a couple different levels. Go into Child’s Pose in class or just do Camel pose.\n\nThis happens for me in cat-cow\n\nLol I want to experience this! Hahahahha\n\nSounds like lovely motivation to learn bridge pose.  :)   But perhaps you need some chakra work to transmute the energy?\n\nOh my! I thought I was a freak! lmao. I practice Ashtanga and for me it happens when I get into Utpluthih… crazy shit I’m telling you\n\nI get a similar sensation while in a backbend but it comes from the compression of the sacral nerve. While I don't doubt for a second it's possible I think it would depend on your individual anatomy, alignment, and dare I say, the energy flow.\n\nIs it bridge pose where your shoulders are on the mat or where your hands are on the mat? Sorry I’m not super familiar with the pose so I was curious.\n\nI’m curious, what is Ray theory in regard to yoga?\n\nYes! Have wondered if it’s got something to with set of pelvis, mine is tilted\n\nA former girlfriend of mine would orgasm anytime she used an ab crunch machine and we worked out a lot.  Seems to be pretty common.\n\nI get it holding plank pose.\n\nNot bridges, but for SURE with exercises like pullups and hip thrusts. It's the core contracting that causes it!\n\nLook up a coregasm!\n\nHow do I achieve this?!\n\nI’ve had this happen doing reverse crunches. I could feel it building up and I was like what is happening? This can’t be an orgasm coming? Then it happened and I was mine blown. I always need stimulation on my clit to orgasm. I was so shocked I called my mother to tell her about it lmao. Something about your core makes it happen! I can’t do it everytime though\n\nNo I don’t do this but sis…what muscles are you engaging that you have an orgasm when you just go into one pose???\n\nThis is pretty common. I can also imagine that in bridge pose you're engaging your pelvic floor muscles. In order to engage the transverse abdominal muscles, pelvic floor muscles are also engaged. Physiologically, an orgasm involves waves of contractions of the pelvic floor muscles, so it makes sense that it could trigger it, or feel like it.\n\nTeach me your ways...\n\nI’m not a woman, but I’ve experienced a phenomenon that maybe could help you? You said you do energy work and breathwork, so perhaps you’ll be able to do this like I’m able to?\n\nI am able to use my breath to move my energy into the upper chakras and out of the lower chakras. I do this by closing my eyes, straightening the spine, putting my hands over the sacral chakra with open palms facing my body, and touching the tip of my tongue to the roof of my mouth just behind the front teeth, and bringing my focus to the third eye. When I breathe in through the nose I draw my energy up into the crown or the third eye, on the out breath I can then send the energy down through the feet. If I do this for a while, the energy reduces in the root chakra region and it can take some time, sometimes days, for it to be easy for me to become sexually stimulated. You might be able to develop a similar technique before your yoga practice to move energy out of your root and make orgasm less likely. The down side is I’m not sure whether this will put you at higher risk for receiving revelations through the anahata or visions through the third eye. For me there does seem to be a correlation to moving my energy up and then becoming more sensitive and open to higher spiritual phenomena.\n\nCheck out r/syntribation, I wonder what they have to say about this\n\n[removed]\n\nThis is a great recommendation, and a few others have recommended similar. I will start looking into this as a potential practice!\n\nIt’s the guy nutting in his pants during frog pose all over again lol jk but does anyone remember that?! Lol\n\nIt is always acceptable to pass on a pose, or do another variant. I would also feel violated to have something so personal happen in a public space. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo perhaps just do a modified version that doesn't cause the issue. And you can bridge pose in your own private practice later.\n\n………………. bridge pose makes me have to poop\n\nThe Armchair Expert podcast had an episode on accidental orgasms where someone called in and talked about this exact phenomena happening to them as well. If I remember correctly, it has to do with how you’re engaging your abs. Check it out for more info 🙂\n\nThis happens to me during some poses that elicit vagal response (pigeon, for me) but not so extreme as a full climax that feels overwhelming. But if I stayed in it, sometimes I know it would go from small flutter to full blown. \n\nIt's of course fun to make light, but I hear you, OP, that a no-sexual-thoughts orgasm that's coming from \"inside the building\" is not just the mellifluous experience one might imagine, and can feel, yeah, sorta nonconsensual.\n\nI get that when I Squat heavy weights 🤣 fun times!\n\njust don't do bridge in class if it's that much of a problem. you can skip a pose.\n\nIve definitely experienced....vibrating in my pelvic floor while doing deep backbends amongst other sensations that you have described...whew! I played around with adjusting how I activate my bandhas, and ease into it the activation of the mula bandha actually has helped me deal with the...undesired sensations - I hope this helps and good luck!!!\n\nAre your knees together or apart?  Tell us how to do this please?\n\nI (M) experienced this too. Not in bridge, but different poses.\n\nI think it is normal. It just means that the chakra there is being opened and the orgasm is the energy being released. If you keep doing it then it will be fully opened and then the orgasm will be less frequent or stop.\n\nI am so jealous.\n\nI'm a man so thankfully his doesn't happen to me but from time to time when I get into a deep squat I involuntary let off an absolute stinker.\n\nSo in other words I know the struggle.\n\nWhat is ray therapy? A simple Google search isn’t providing a clear, definitive answer.\n\nI first heard it called ‘ray theory’ in the book “Yoga: the spirit and practice of moving into stillness”. Just doing a quick search, this is the closest to what I am talking about: https://yogamattersjersey.uk/how-you-make-your-own-lightening/\n\nThanks for answering that. I’ll look deeper. Has it helped you in any way?\n\nIt’s absolutely helped my yoga practice more generally - I feel like my poses are stronger and it’s much easier to get into a proper flow meditation.\n\nWhat is the bridge pose…so that I may avoid it?\n\nWell this is going to make yoga very popular...\n\nThis sub is weird. Entertaining at times but weird.\n\nAre you female or male?"

    "all_comment_text": "As someone who hates being touched and hates touching people that I'm not extremely close to this is a nightmare 🤣\n\nWould be lovely for those who enjoy this though\n\nI know they mean well, but I've had a few surprise foot rubs during savasana, with no warning.  I'm extremely ticklish on the bottom of my feet.  I had the hardest time trying to suppress a laughing attack, with tears ready to flow.  I'm sure the other students were thinking \"WTF...?\"\n\nOh the way I'd panic if my feet were randomly touched. That's not okay....\n\nOh! This is not okay. I am super ticklish. \nUncontrollable reaction type of ticklish. \n\nIf some poor soul took it upon themselves to rub my feet during Shavasana it’d be embarrassing. They’d likely be greeted with a large and almost bellicose squawk + spontaneous flailing limbs.\n\nsame, I was in a deep shavasna once and the instructor came up and pressed down on my shoulders with no warning. It startled the hell out of me to the point I made an audible noise and disrupted everyone around me. \n\nAlways ask for consent!\n\nI don't blame you! I'd be shocked! Definitely have a way for students to consent or revoke consent at any time comfortably without pressure.\n\nI love this idea but never seen it in practice. Do they only do it with small classes? Are they able to get to everyone &amp; do they get permission to touch people ahead of time?\n\nMost of the instructors at my studio do it, though our classes are typically only 8-11 people, so definitely small. Ours do make sure to get permission to touch people each time, and have always gotten to everyone who wants one! They'll either put out a disc that you can flip to invite assists or not, or they'll ask for the whole class to close their eyes and for those who *don't* want assists or massage to place a hand on their belly. I always find it so relaxing.\n\nOkay, I have a confession.\n\nMy instructor does do this and they’re so devastatingly attractive that I melt, but of course, they ask everyone to raise their right leg if they don’t want to be touched. \n\nI have a secret crush on them but whenever they give me that scalp massage and massage my shoulders or adjust me, I swear I start blushing.\n\nThis is so cute actually lol I have a crush on like, half of the instructors I go to. 💀 So you're definitely not alone.\n\nThey were there today 😭\n\nOh my God, I teach and it's never even crossed my mind that someone would be attracted to their yoga teacher. That's so upsetting to me haha.\n\nIt's more like \"girl crush\" than actual crush if that makes sense. Like, wow this person is very cool and I would like to be their friend but it's weird because they're the instructor. Lol it's hard to describe\n\nI see! That makes more sense, I totally get that about my pole teacher! Like genuinely has to be one of the coolest people I've ever encountered.\n\nI would never proposition anyone, especially at their job. I have that happen to me on multiple occasions and I would never want to jeopardize our professional relationship! \n\nThey’re just incredibly cool and the way they teach makes them so attractive to me.\n\nMe. Too.\n\nThey make the class fun as well and I’m sitting there like “OMFG I’M TRYING TO BE ZEN, STOP BEING HOT AND FUNNY.”\n\nI LOVE this. The disc idea is so great!\n\nThe only time it's happened to me, the teacher asked at the beginning of savasana to \"raise your hand if you're not a fan of lavender, I'm going to go around the room applying it\". Which I took to mean maybe wafting lavender oil around us or something, but it actually meant a full on lavender head massage. I hated it lol.\n\nMany of my teachers (after hot) do the cold towel….placed firmly across forehead. Press third eye, then onto pushing your shoulders down in a messaging patern. Crazy good\n\nI love the cool towel and my old studio scented them too. So good.\n\nYes eucalyptus or some other oil that’s mild on the skin. Love it\n\nWhen they put their palms on your shoulders and press down gently to help you release a little deeper ahhhhh bliss!\n\nWhen they rub your third eye in shavasana\n\nLove it when you find a good instructor\n\nInstructor is everything.\n\nI just got done with the opposite of this.    It was actually the opposite of flow.   It was supposed to be a 26:2(bikram)that i used to go to.  The instructor had this winey scolding voice where he would mumble through all the important transitions mrmrmblemrmble mrble murmble. Then out of nowhere..  CHANGE!  (This was his transition out of the posture)  whole class was lost in the sauce.  Then he would find some not so importat detail and go off on a tangent until the next transition which was of course  .....  CHANGE!\n\nOh I hate that\n\ncounterpoint: entry adjustments are fine but after that don’t fkn touch me in savasana\n\nThat's totally fine! Our instructors are awesome about getting permission first. My husband doesn't like being touched at all, so when they ask he always just indicates that he would rather not and they respect that. More time for me anyway 😆\n\nBut do they ask again for savasana? I think OP's point is that when people give consent for \"adjustments\" at the beginning of class they do not necessarily mean \"by the way, tell me to clear my mind and basically go to sleep and then quietly walk up behind me and push my shoulders down hard into the mat\".\n\nThey'll often ask at different points depending on when they plan to have contact. For example, yesterday, the instructor only did light touches during savasana so she asked for permission right after we laid on our backs. There was only one point before then where someone next to me needed a pose adjustment so she walked over and asked if it was okay before touching them.\n\nit’s not really about being touched. I’m all for hands-on adjustments, including in savasana while people are settling in. after that, some touch may feel good but it defeats the purpose of the pose.\n\nehhhhh no thank you. I'm trying to dissolve in shavasana. I don't want to be brought back to my body by somebody else.\n\nI started taking yoga as an actual college class. First semester, I came to class with a migraine. It was day four of a migraine, so my professor/instructor already knew about it. I made it through, and after the practice as we began shavasana she rubbed my head and neck for the nearly the entire pose. That memory still brings tears to my eyes. I had hardly been in school, I was new to yoga, and she was so kind and caring.\n\nI had a teacher who used to push hard on the soles of our feet in Shavasana three or four times. On one hand, ew gross. On the other it was like a magical door way into another deeper level of relaxation.\n\nI loved it.  \n\nLiterally my favorite. &amp; I hate to be touched except in these situations lol\n\nI have never heard of this or any of the other stuff people are mentioning in the comments - the shoulder pushes and third eye rubs etc. I live in Indonesia, been to a few studios, and none of this. The instructors only touch to make adjustments, and even that is done sparingly. Is this a USA thing? I can't see it going down well here. For me it would definitely be a hard pass.\n\nI've only taken yoga classes in the US so I can't speak to anywhere else, but a number of the instructors I've had (across four states) offer some very short massage. Typically only ~20 seconds or so, with firm but gentle pressure. In my experience they've often started by pressing the shoulders down, then kind of walking the fingers up the back of the neck to the scalp where they apply pressure to the temples in small circles and give a very brief scalp massage before gently tugging my hair and finally pressing on the third eye with both thumbs and slowly separating them, letting up pressure as they move across the forehead. \n\nI have a really hard time shutting my mind down and typically the little massage is what stops my thoughts in their tracks and I'm able to actually relax my mind and body after. I absolutely love it, but I definitely understand that it isn't for everyone!\n\nI agree, but also...\n\nJourney before destination, Radiant\n\n🙅\n\nAhhh, hello fellow SandoFando! I don't know if you were a part of the absolute chaos that happened yesterday, but I can't tell you how much that 20 second massage helped calm my nerves down 😂\n\nLife before Death 🙅🏼‍♀️\n\nUgh bring more of this back! It’s fallen off since the whole 2020 thing 🙄\n\nOmg I love when one of my instructors presses on the crown chakra and third eye with medium pressure and then swirls around the 3rd eye lightly. Sometimes she does reiki on my crown chakra and around my temples and I can feel the heat from her hands - it's amazing !!\n\nMy instructor gives us ~ 30 seconds of Reiki above our heads during Shavasana and I melt every time. She warms lavender oil in her palms too\n\nPlease do not touch any of your students without explicit consent. However nice some people think it is, there are many, many individuals who would be incredibly uncomfortable at best and at worst can traumatize them."

It can be scary to do something like this for the first time but you did it!\n\nCongratulations and thank you for sharing! I haven’t taught my first class yet after graduating in February, but I’m looking forward to it. Thank you for the words of encouragement, and I’m so glad you had a great first time teaching experience!!!\n\nCongrats! Doing your first class is the biggest step! 🩷\n\nThis warms my heart!! I remember my first few teaching sessions I was like “ahhhh!” Inside. I was saying “remember to breathe” for as much myself as who I was cueing. 😄 congratulations and yeah, just getting up there and doing it and the magic happens is awesome!\n\nHaha, exactly!! It’s hard to not calm down once you start, because you’re literally doing yoga. Just the studio itself is enough to calm me and help me get into the zone.\n\nThank you for posting this! I still have yet to teach my first class and I’m terrified.\n\nI taught my second class today and it went as well as the first! As someone who is extremely shy and anxious, my anticipation has been 100x worse than the reality. I can say that I end each class feeling so relaxed, accomplished, and literally just happy. I’ve been smiling on my drive home. I really hope you can get the same experience from it! 💖 best wishes!!\n\nYay ! Happy for you!! Congrats!\n\nYay!!! I love reading this. So happy for you. 💗\n\nCongratulations on your first class!! I'm so happy for you 🎉🎉🎉🎉👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\n\nThat's so inspiring! \n\nI am teaching my first class this Friday. \n\nWhat flow have you decided to teach?\n\nI could use some inspo!\n\nAhh, congrats &amp; good luck! \nI teach a lunchtime class, so it’s only 45 mins. It’s a vinyasa flow. \nWe warm up with some seated spinal twists &amp; side bends, cat/cow, then move into Sun A for 3 rounds. \nThen our flow is W1&gt;W2&gt;Reverse W&gt;Triangle&lt;W2&gt;W1&gt;Vinayasa. Repeat on the other side then we take some time in Tree Pose. Cool down with some stretches, seated forward folds, supine twists, savasana. (Just a rough idea, I left out some specifics) but I’ve had fantastic feedback after all three classes that it’s perfect for lunchtime &amp; a good balance of challenge/stretch/relaxation. \nSo excited for your first class! 🤗\n\nLove it, this is actually very reassuring to hear. I am going with a classic flow as well, nothing fancy, clean simple flow. This is awesome, thanks for sharing! \n\nI only have 1 person signed up for one class and  3 people signed up for the second one 🥹 but I am so excited to teach, it's just a beginning ☺️🙏🏻\n\nYou’ll feel so much better after the first class, it’s such an accomplishment! Congrats again! ❤️\n\nCongratulations!!\n\nCurious - what type of teacher training did you complete? What type/s of yoga are you hoping to teach? I'm \"considering\" pursuing TT, but it's an investment, so trying to think it through.\n\nI ended up using YogaRenew, which was an all online course. I absolutely loved it! Worked perfect with my schedule and they still have live classes/zoom sessions, and were very responsive to any questions I had. \nThat being said, I’d been practicing yoga for 10 years prior so I had a very good base. Someone starting out with less experience might prefer an in-person/hands-on course. The price was incredible and I totally recommend it!"

I’m still a little scared to try without my safety blanket of the wall.\n\nI totally get that!

When I hear \"float to the top of your mat\" this is exactly what I envision. Keep up the great work🕉\n\nExtremely satisfying video\n\nImpressive! Nice control\n\nthe sun being up and down, the floats &amp; flexibility! 🤩🤩\n\nWow, so much grace and control. Inspiring!\n\nTruly inspirational! Hope I could do this in the future\n\nWow. Incredible. I can only float like that if I’m coming down from handstand. It feels so heavy if I’m just trying to catch a pike\n\nIt’s a skill that looks effortless and takes forever to develop. I feel like I’m only just starting to get the hang of it after years.\n\nWhat are your fav drills for this?? I have a ton of jumping entries/good handstand endurance but need work on my compression/press\n\nYou kind of said it. Compression and press drills. I find there’s also a big mental barrier. I almost need to do a combo of thinking light thoughts and not thinking at all. Any kind of doubt kills it and I still can’t do this consistently.\n\nYeah 😅 I avoid press drills like the plague because I don’t find them enjoyable lmao but I need to just suck it up and do them. I know them, and have plenty of resources. What are your top 3 fav drills? I love asking diff people that question. I also have a mental block around press I’ve realized there’s a bit of fear involved with how much forward lean and wrist torsion is involved\n\nSame. I hate compression/core drills, and it’s a weak point for me as a result. I tend to planche and rely on shoulder strength to compensate.\n\nYou have to find drills you don’t hate, cuz otherwise you won’t do them. Honestly the top drill is just taking classes more often. I do two per day and always stay and do 5-10 mins of handstand drills after.\n\nThe best drill for presses will always be negatives from handstand. Tuck and straddle negatives are good for different things. Also I did a ton of holding an L shape pike handstand. The negative is hard but is worth trying once you’re ready to come down. Press walks up and down the mat help get the initial feeling going. Those are the main ones I did, but I’m always mixing it up and messing around.\n\nYou’ve gotta just suck it up and start chipping away at it daily. You’ll be glad you did. You didn’t come this far just to come this far.\n\nOh I take a ton of classes, it’s helped me a lot in my handstand journey, I totally agree and give the same advice! I also do 2 a day sometimes but no less than 3-5 per week, hot power vinyasa, and I do handstand specific drills inbetween too. Been working belly to floor in straddle forward fold as well.\n\nThe consensus is always negatives!! lol. I have been doing toe to wrist taps often, even when traveling to top of mat in sun sals and also as a separate drill, already feel slight improvements even from just that. Pike handstand still feels soo heavy and hard for me to hold, just gotta do it more though. But you’re right, I need to commit to more consistency and pick a few drills that are the least bad to me lmao. Thanks for the chat!!\n\n&gt; no less than 3-5 per week\n\ngood baseline. i tell people 4 per week is the minimum. for context i do 14 per week (two per day).\n\nIt just depends… time permitting. I’m a yoga teacher, I teach 4 classes per week I also make room for weightlifting on top of another almost full time job. Wish I could do doubles daily!\n\nAdding toe taps to your wrists into your handstand negatives is a good one too! I’ve been doing that for about a year and just got my straddle press\n\nThis is cool\n\nYou are\n\nNice , love the video\n\nWow 🫡\n\n🫡\n\nVery nice!!\n\nI could only wish to have the same strength and control\n\nLittle by little. Again and again.\n\nHow long have you practiced and how long do you do this practice when practicing?\n\nFive years. Two classes daily now. At least 20 mins of handstand training per day."

That was in 2007. Let’s not pretend you’re wrong here.

It was lowkey stigmatized as some exotic, sexual pretzel activity.  \n\nI think the activity itself has now become more desexualized, although there are more social media yoga chicks sexualizing themselves online for clicks now.\n\nI'm in my 50's &amp; have been at least interested in yoga since the late 70s, it's been happening for as long as I remember.

Just the other week someone posted some... interesting pictures so I clicked on her profile and basically it was all posts promoting her only fans.\n\nIf i start to type in \"yoga\" to pull up this sub, there's more NSFW subs than regular ones lol.\n\nMe too. I am absolutely blind to social media trends and topics. Everything is so unhinged and real life is absolutely nothing like what the internet represents. It’s the law of attraction. People should simply get off their phones and just look around.\n\nYou mean online /social media I hope? I really do not recognize this, I do yoga in studio and at home with youtube stuff. I am not on insta and places like that.\n\nThis isn’t recent. I was webmaster for a major yoga teacher 20 years ago. About 1/10 of the traffic to his site was through an article that mentioned him. It was in a sex column asking how one performs a bj on oneself. \n\nThe search term “yoga pants” has always resulted in fetish sites. \n\nThis is part of why I’m very careful about who sees me doing yoga. When I worked in engineering, a mostly male environment, there was a popular yoga class in our on-site gym, but I didn’t want my coworkers to see me doing yoga because I didn’t want to be specialized.\n\nTiktok is the worst of everything. Everything is sexualised if it gets clicks, yoga included.\n\nThis started long before tiktok though, when I type yoga in the reddit search a lot of NSFW communities sexualizing yoga will pop up.\n\nThe comments I've seen on youtube were way worse than anything I've seen on tiktok.\n\nTiktok is built off of sexualizing everything\n\nIsn't this just life as a woman?\nI learnwd many years ago that once you go out in the world you will be sexualised.\n\nYes. I was a high school cheerleader who did cheer because I was a former gymnast. I’ve been sexualized since 9th grade and it’s always made me so uncomfortable.\n\nWe had the skirts that had slits where pleats would be, and our bloomers had our school name on one butt cheek….with a crop top.\n\nYour post makes me sad…  Cheerleading is a pretty twisted concept if you stop and think about it.  I know, I’m sure some women feel empowered by it and it’s great exercise, true athleticism… All true, but always in the sidelines for men and why the scantily clad part…?\n\nAbsolutely! Just go to the Halloween stores and check out the adult costume section. Sexy nurse, sexy teacher, sexy secretary, sexy sexy sexy. As for yoga I only follow non sexualized social media and the studio I go to has a style that could be called “middle aged frump” lol\n\nLike in Mean Girls [where she dresses up normal spooky for Halloween.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei__hV1R7jo) DUH!\n\nNow the Halloween song from the musical is stuck in my head! Be a sexy doctor and cure some sexy cancer!\n\nUnfortunately 😞😔\n\nSo much truth here. I posted in another comment that I have shared my yoga practice on Instagram, and I have definitely been DMd by creeps. Thankfully, I’ve had way more positive experiences than the few strangers on the internet trying to sexualize something sacred to me. And it’s really sad that as a woman you just have to accept this is part of being out in the world.\n\nSadly, many things are sexualised . Yoga is no exception .\n\nYeah, beyond our control. It is what it is\n\nOn one hand, it’s a natural part of the human experience; on the other, it can be exploited/manipulative/take away from the intended expression of the yoga.\n\nPersonally, I steer clear when something feels yucky and keep what I share as a teacher clear in my intentions.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMeanwhile I’m over here making slides on my instagram about the yamas and niyamas. 😂\n\nWell, to sell literally anything, they end up sexualising it. Be it fruits or fruit juices even. It's just what sells these days.\n\nFruits or fruit juices 😭🤣 soo true\n\nYoga.  From the place that brought you the Kama Sutra.\n\nSexuality has been a part of yoga for ages, whether you choose to follow that path or another is entirely up to you.\n\nYep\n\nI couldn’t care less. Sexual health is part of a whole which includes physical health. Many people get into yoga in order to improve all aspects of their physical and spiritual lives, including their sexuality. It’s more strange to me that people imagine that a division exists between the different aspects of their health.\n\nI think that the appearance of yoga or yoga clothing in pornography is all about people’s fantasies surrounding the type of people they see out in the world wearing workout clothing and carrying yoga mats. On the other hand, it’s also related to people embracing aspects their physicality and spirituality (including sexuality) through yoga, and other people subtly picking up on this, often unconsciously.\n\nMost people aren’t prepared to have frank conversations about the above phenomena, so it’s largely a moot point. Saying yoga has nothing to do with sex and sexuality is totally wrong IMO, but a lot of well-meaning but misguided people will try to promote this view.\n\nWhat could be really challenging is if some fraud or huckster starts promoting yoga in an overtly sexual way or claiming that it’s primarily about sex, which could be harmful to many people.\n\nThat's a good point! I initially felt ick about yoga being sexualized, but after reading your comment I think my ick is when yoga is depicted in a way that's sexually objectifying in a way that people don't consent to. Like if a woman is being sexualized because she does yoga or is wearing yoga clothes and does not want to be. \n\nTo me conversations about sexualization and yoga need to include consent. I don't think the average person that sexualizes yoga is ready to have those conversations (I hope I'm wrong!).\n\nI can't help but see disingenuous tribe-signaling when people claim there's nothing sexual about it and they're totally appalled that it is\n\nI think signaling that it's something they ought to be ashamed of is what allows them to enjoy it. \"Well, I acknowledged I'm not supposed to like it, so that means I can.\" People are so deep in denial because they have to be. \n\nEvery yoga studio I've ever been in is full of exhibitionists and voyeurs, and that's OK. It's completely ordinary human behavior that's always operating under the surface, inherent to all our relationships.\n\nI just wish we could drop the tiresome charade and people didn't have to lie about how totally sexless they are\n\n😔  this makes me sad. I want yoga to be a safe, healing, wholesome activity for me. That's how I view it. Suggesting that it's inherently sexual and that studios are full of exhibitionist and voyers feels so icky and unsafe to me. The opposite of what it should be. ​\n\nI don't think it's inherently sexual at all. I feel the same way as you do though, it makes me feel gross to think about it like that. People always tend to sexualize everything, especially activities that are woman centric. But I think there are a lot of people who think like us and just view it as a healing thing. I wouldn't worry too much about that statement about it being sexual, I think it's pretty inaccurate as a whole. Maybe in some circles and some peoples perspective, but I think the average people who partake in it don't view it that way. Especially being on Reddit, the type of perspectives people have on here are not accurate to the average person in real life.\n\nAny adult who thinks in these terms is likely extraordinarily dissonant toward their own motives and actions\n\nStop seeking safety and instead seek strength. The human condition is irresolvable because our nature's are rife with pathology and perversity. To deny it is to generate more cruelty through hypocrisy, to accept it is to become congruent with the way it actually is.\n\nMating behaviors are always playing out and I don't see why we should feel bad about it.\n\nWhen you're ready to be honest, I'm here to accept you\n\nI am a super sexual person and very open about it. \n\nI do Yoga 2-4 times a week. There’s nothing sexual about it for me and I feel like it’s the same for the people I’ve been in classes with. \nI do a lot of kundalini, where the pelvic floor is incorporated. Still, not sexual. \n\nDoes Yoga help with flexibility and stamina during sexual? Absolutely. Does that make Yoga inherently sexual? Absolutely not.\n\ndue to my shape, people have confronted me for, \"doing yoga to attract the opposite sex,\" and it is like ... no?\n\nso, idk, the sexualization of anything, a body, an activity, is weird to me when it isn't consensual.\n\nI think that many forms of exercise have been sexualised. Take aerobic workouts in the 80’s with the sexy little leotards and leg warmers lol. My mom was into Jane Fonda’s workout books haha. No one can help the fact that with certain exercises, yoga being one of them, that wearing form fitting exercise clothes are more functional, and the longer you keep up with something the better you’re going to look. Unfortunately you can’t change how other people are going to be, but you can certainly practice in private, or simply feel a little sorry for the folks that seemingly are looking to get attention.\n\nIn the 80’s there was this workout show that, I swear to god, was basically porn, back when aerobics was new - it might have been before Jane Fonda started publishing. So, yeah, there’s always been sexualization of exercise. I’m sure there was more before that.\n\nMake sense. It's beyond our control so better to ignore and shift the focus offline\n\ncoming from the land where yoga comes from, we are advised to wear comfortable cotton  clothes and a cloth mat. Commodification of Yoga is a rich industry - 100$+ mats, yoga wear, bottles, etc.\n\nMy $100 mat has lasted 15 years so far with no visible damage. For me it was a lifetime investment in something that would never have to be thrown out or replaced.\n\nCotton rugs were used for a reason. washable, less space, usable for many years, and cheap. you could also make your own using old clothes or whatever. There's a reason why certain things were used, not just from the Yoga point of view but also other ways. \n\nI am glad you found value for money and convenience in your yoga mat, and to each their own. There's also the huge cultural and lifestyle difference point here, but my point is that commodification of Yoga is massive industry, whether it be yoga wear or expensive mats or branded accessories.\n\ni personally practice and teach directly on the ground. no mat, no rug, just me and the floor\n\nI was told to always have a mat for meditation / mat; carry my mat everywhere; not share my mat with anyone nor use anyone else's mat.   \nI always have my mat with me when I go to caves and mountain treks.\n\nDoesn't it slide around on the floor?\n\nnoPe. woven mats, cotton mats, traditional mats (jute etc) - none of them slide. Look for Mysore cotton mats (not the brands, the local stores). they have excellent grip.\n\nTo be honest I can't say that I have noticed it. \nPerhaps it's dependent on location?. Here in southern Spain yoga is just yoga.\n\nI haven’t noticed it either. I think it’s more of a social media thing than a real life thing\n\nI’ve only seen this rhetoric online; in real-life spaces this hasn’t been an issue personally\n\nSociety can turn anything into porn. Ignore it. Do you!\n\nI think the problem lies with you and your perception.\n\nYou can’t control what everyone does. \n\nInstead what you can do something about is how you perceive things. How you look at people. How/when you choose not to look at people.\n\nWhy be pre-occupied with that noone should practise in ways you don’t like. There’s plenty of yogi’s that aren’t sexualized. Just change the channel.\n\nJust go ahead and show what you consider a good example and don’t focus on judgemental/moralist mentality.\n\nprecisely - this seems like a perception problem than an actual problem\n\nIt's not new at all and everything gets sexualized (rule 34).\n\nI don't let it bother me, and I promote a non sexualized yoga to my students.\n\nThe only yoga person I follow on social media is my teacher. She’s quite wholesome.\n\nAs a man, I hate it. I want to practice yoga for my own benefit of practicing yoga and not be accused of doing it for sexual reasons.\n\nI mean everything gets sexualised. I don't agree with it at all, I had to stop telling men in my life or men I meet I practice yoga because I was so sick of them making sexual comments about how flexible I must be 🥲 \n\nYoga is a sexless and safe space for me, but we live in a world where everything gets sexualised.\n\nRule 34 applies to everything. That being said, I haven’t seen it in the classes I attend nor in my online communities. But the OF folks are a creative bunch, I wouldn’t put anything past them.\n\nThere's nothing gradual about it. It's been like this probably forever. It's just in your face more because of social media.\n\nI look down on people who sexualize it to get clicks. Those people who take photos of themselves with their asses toward the cameras in yoga pants are dumb as rocks.  \n\nOtherwise, it doesn't bother me.\n\nIt feels like something that was already [sexual](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantric_sex) long, long, long ago was purified by western culture and now the mainstream social networks are realizing the sexual aspect of yoga and demoralizing its original nature.\n\nI hate how sexualized things are in general. Disgusting world.\n\nYes it bothers me a lot, especially as an asexual. I do yoga for my physical and mental health, not for men to gawk at…\n\nIt feels like it’s a practice that I have to keep secret, if I don’t want creepy comments about “how bendy I am” and “what positions I can get into.” Even my girlfriend was guilty of this in the beginning of our relationship, it’s just become normal unfortunately.\n\nI also made the mistake of trying to learn some new yoga poses on TikTok by searching “yoga” and I was just met with softcore porn instead.\n\nIt can’t get any worse than [Bikram Yoga](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/hot-yoga-founder-ordered-to-pay-nearly-6-5m-in-damages-in-harassment-suit/).  That was nearly decade ago.  Objectively seeing hardly any Bikram yoga studios anymore one could argue things have been getting better.\n\nBikram himself is awful, but bikram studios are still everywhere (at least in my neck of the woods). They just got smart and started calling themselves hot yoga studios to avoid being tied in to his lawsuits &gt;.&lt;\n\nAt my studio it’s all kinds of folk, none in sexualized clothing, practicing.\n\nI would say the sexualization of yoga has been happening far longer, given some very predatory and abusive nature of  notable teachers and \"gurus\"\n\nIt's gross and disrespectful and feel like the \"sex is part of life\" comments here don't understand that there is a difference between the more healthy and (for many people) spiritual side of sex and the type of exploitative, male-gazey type of sexualization of yoga that's on social media sites or reddit. \n\nUnfortunately, so many things, especially if women enjoy it, get sexualized. I've seen weight lifting, aerobics, equestrian sports, and yoga all get sexualized because the participant is a woman.\n\nThat's a sad reality :(\n\nDon’t see it in studios in Los Angeles\n\nI think this is a common theme with all things sacred and reflect the times we are living in. Yoga is being exposed to many insincere people who care about serving the body and ego and use yoga as another platform for self gratification and are not interested in higher states of consciousness or enlightenment. Only attention, self gratification and perversions.\n\nThe first thing that came to mind was briohny's equinox commercial that came out over a decade ago.\n\nSo it's definitely not recent :/\n\nContortionist here.\n\n\nThis isn’t new\n\nNot a new thing at all\n\nGetting that from comments :(\n\nRecent? Gradual?\n\nOnline yoga has always been sexualized. Yoga Porn. You’re not going to change or shame the creators so just focus on your own practice and stop looking.\n\nI kinda hate it when I look for yoga videos on YouTube and it’s obviously a woman doing it for a sexual audience. And I get how it’s disheartening But on the other hand if a consenting adult wants to sell her sexy yoga videos to other consenting adults then I guess I don’t really care. I don’t have to watch the videos and as long as my partner is not watching them then it doesn’t really affect me or my practice.\n\nThe fact that Bikram himself was/is a predator was sad news to find out, and now I’ve seen a bunch of Gen zed instructors teaching yoga online in loose cropped tops with their entire underboob hanging underneath. I’m sure dudes click on it for a look would make up the majority of the views. Views views views. I hate it. If you do it in person you’ll find a studio and an instructor you like and stick with it. It isn’t tainted everywhere :)\n\nThis might be a weird opinion but personally I think the sexualization of yoga is coming from the viewer and not the person practicing it. I think the poses I see women doing are actually really beautiful and inspire me to try and get to the level and the yoga clothes they want to wear while doing them/ or lack of is something they feel comfortable wearing and confident in. So who cares??? Don’t sexualize it and it won’t be a sexual thing\n\nAnd this is coming from a straight 28 year old woman, just my 2 cents.\n\nEdit: add more context\n\nAnything can be sexualized if someone wants it to be, doesn't mean it's inherently sexual so there's nothing to worry about. Doesn't bother me at all. Those who sexualize stuff are just showing us who they truly are while also not having the decency to keep it private.\n\nagreed, half the classes at my yoga place are female only. remember 3-4 years back when it was just a couple a week. need to reconnect to the spiritual aspect of things.\n\nI also have not noticed this. I'm not on social media (besides reddit)\n\nA friend of mine told me that I was doing yoga to get “better at sex”. I’m still annoyed by that comment because this is something I am only doing for me and to think that it’s a practice to please someone else seems ridiculous.\n\nI don't think that there is a conflict between something being spiritual and something being sexual.\n\nDisgusting! Yes, it’s bothersome.\n\nIt is, I feel like reporting it whenever I see something but there's too much of it now\n\nNot much we can do bc there’s always people out there providing sexualized content using yoga and then of course always an audience unfortunately.\n\nyeah, even when you type yoga into the search bar on reddit, 2 of the subs that pop up are subs dedicated to sexualising yoga pants and yoga shorts. its gross :(\n\nIt doesn’t affect me\n\nSexulization is in the eye of the beholder. Have you observed this in other human behaviors? Yoga is the one place I can go to be rid of ego, and while yes, there are people at class whom I look at, attractive yes, but I really don't derive arousal from it.\n\nYoga is spiritual. Sex is spiritual. They do not have to intersect, but they do.\n\nI’ve been practicing for 30 years, def not new.  It’s something that goes hand in hand with marketing… so it’s been a part of the westernized version of yoga and the businesses (sports attire companies) that crop up alongside this industry. Also, you have to understand that the studios are trying to create a vibe/aesthetic to attract a certain demographic. And the real money maker at any studio is teacher training. So they want to attract the type of student who will take teacher training… and they want the teachers to be the type that will attract that type of student. Hence the marketing/sexualization. \n\nYou can choose to participate or not.  It’s liberating to realize that you can dress however you want in a yoga class, but just know if you show up in baggy sweats you will likely stick out (esp if you practice in an urban area).\n\nThe marketing aspect of it makes complete sense.\n\nthere’s also the risk that these portrayals create unrealistic body standards and exclude individuals who might feel self-conscious or disconnected from the mainstream image of a “yoga body.” It can alienate people from feeling comfortable in spaces where yoga should be about personal growth and self-acceptance.\n\nEXACTLY!! Kills the entire purpose of yoga and attracts men and women with physical expectations only instead of the spritual/mental ones. these unrealistic expectations are toxic.\n\nMeh, people can sexualize doorknobs, so why not yoga? It is what it is.\n\nSad but true\n\nI personally wouldn’t sexual yoga but I don’t judge others on their practices. No, it doesn’t bother me because it’s not sexualized in my own practice.\n\nGood for you mate\n\nI could be reading your tone wrong, since it’s text after all, but you asked if it bothers us as much as it bothers you. Everyone is different, I hope you find a community that can foster what you need in your own space.\n\nYou're overthinking. I just said it's good for you if you think that way. I wish I could see it the way you do.\n\n No. I hate it. It's bad enough that Western tradition of yoga has divorced the philosophical aspects of yoga from the physical aspects.\n\nIt's the sad reality of our times. Can't do anything about it.\n\nYoga is my own tool. I use yoga for my own well being. I’m not really paying attention to how others use it\n\nhate it\n\nIs sexuality separate from spirituality?\n\nDepends what you mean. There being yoga to crank to? Awesome. People applying that mentality to everyone doing yoga? Not awesome. Same with everything else. A hot step mom is a hot step mom but don't treat them all like they wanna bang. All in all it's a good thing since it's a rapidly dissuadeable notion the moment people try for themselves and popularizes and destigmatizes yoga. I got into it for the hotties and stayed for the knotties.\n\n[deleted]\n\n„In recent years“ I believe it was always like that\n\nSocial media, like so much of the stuff that we just don’t need, is marketed mostly to teenagers *because* they don’t know any better and are easily manipulated. I think as we mature a little we step back from social media. Your best bet is to get off TikTok and Insta and focus on the real world.\n\nYes, the porn-ification of everything is a problem. But let it be a problem for individuals making their own choices. And while you can hope that they got the parenting and support they need, you don’t have to spend time engaging with content that gets you upset.\n\nCome off social media, yogi. Your life will be better without it. You can still find interesting content via other forums, like here.\n\ni think it’s disgusting and disappointing\n\nMy very authentic experienced baba yoga teacher had no problem telling me I was beautiful on multiple occasions. I know you didn’t explicitly say it but the sexualisation is not just from the western influence. Most humans are sexual beings . Brahmacharya is something we can all practice in our own ways but there’s always going to be people who mix elements of their being ie sexuality with their spiritual practices also. \nI found the members of a sivananda ashram in Vietnam a lot less sexually inclined (not at all in fact) than ashtanga practitioners in India\n\nI completely agree to your points but it does not bother me.\n\nI can't tell anyone what to do or not do. But these conversations are valid and need not be taken as judgements. This paragraph is not directed to you but I saw a lot of comments saying to embody what you want and ignore the rest of the things.  Turning a blind eye / ignoring things has never been a solution. These conversations are important in bringing awareness and enumerating alternative ways of living and doing things. For example, someone also said that sexual expression is a part of Yoga, etc. Which is UNTRUE. On of the Yamas of Yoga is brahmacarya which can mean a range of things from chastity, to sexual restraint, to sexual focus depending on whether you are married, unmarried or an ascetic. Yamas are the first stage in Yoga. Asanas are the fourth. If someone wants to limit their practice or understanding of Yoga to only asanas, I cannot stop them or make them see light. Neither are they invalid when they choose to do what they want to do... not every one does Yoga for enlightenment and thats fine.  \nBut to shut down these conversations, or label someone as being judgmental etc when they want to talk about deeper aspects or have a different perspective towards trends because of a deeper engagement with Yogic theory and practice, is where the problem is.\n\nCan we do anything about this as a community?  \nYoga is a holistic practice. As many people said in the comments, you continue to embody it. You continue to question and talk about your grievances. You continue to spread awareness of what you find valuable. If capitalists can market consumerism, I don't see why you can't speak about what you find value in.\n\nIt makes me so incredibly sad 😞\n\nHi. I'm a yoga teacher in training and a Professional Dominatrix as well as a content creator. I'm sometimes sexy, sometimes not. I teach my fans how to be healthy and also teach sexy kink training type stuff. \n\nI'd love to know is what's wrong with sexy yoga and how that affects spirituality to you. \n\nYoga can be very ascetic but it can also be just bendy, relaxing stuff that allows people to tap into a meditative headspace. \n\nIncluding tantric meditative spaces which could also lead to sexual activities. Tantra is another topic that can be sexual or completely not sexual.\n\nHumans are sexual creatures. We come from sex and it's unavoidable part of life that sex pours over most aspects of life.\n\nI do understand how frustrating it must be to see so much sexy yoga, it's naturally mesmerizing to the majority of the viewers. \n\nSome sexy yoga creators can definitely be a bit too sexy, I feel like those are very similar to really annoying ads where the product is exaggeratedly put on your face.\n\nI get it. Maybe it comes down to class. Which is a social construct.\n\nWhich leads to us being judgmental.\nFrom a spiritual point of view, maybe that's something to meditate about.\n\nNamaste 🧘‍♀️\n\nMaybe I'm hopelessly naive but no I've never noticed such a thing either now or in the past. This is all news to me!\n\nYes, I don’t think it’s anything new. I spoke to my therapist about this recent. I was concerned that as an instructor, I was passing along the wrong message with my video content. My content was in NO WAY sexual, but I found myself getting attention and DM’s that were all sexualizing my practice. I ended up backing off and opting for only female clients in a one on one setting, simply because that’s what aligns with me. But I wish there was some way to weed out the people who want to practice yoga, and the people who want to just enjoy it as a fantasy. \n\nSide note though, I have a wonderful marriage with a husband whom I adore and he absolutely took interest in me initially because he sexualized my yoga practice, even if he wouldn’t admit it at first 😂\n\nIsn’t tantric yoga a thing?\n\nI do Bikram Yoga. You can’t help but admire the physique of certain practitioners. As for certain poses like downward dog used in memes with the caption “this is the lose a house and kids pose” it’s not porn, it’s an attempt at humour. \n\nWe’ve seen it women’s tennis\n\nThe first forms of yoga where done in the nude. It didn't have anything to do with sex. However sex sells so if someone or some company can make a buck, they will. I don't agree with it but what can you do?\n\nit was not recent, it's been going on for way too long.  My issue is the almost naked, perfect bodies in some crazy pose that's not accessible to the majority of yogi's.  It's just to get clicks.  After that my issue s the perfect meditation pose.\n\nI admit I’m not on tiktok or insta and since I’ve started researching yoga I only come across websites of specific studios or about meditation practices. Nothing sexual at all. \n\nI’m planning to start practicing and to sign up to classes nearby, I saw some of the pics from the classes and there are mostly middle aged gals attending. I surely hope I can just go there and learn, not have to be anxious about someone sexualising me while I’m stretching. 🙄\n\nI dont really care cus i dont follow that kinda content. I just go to yoga classes and focus on my own journey\n\ncause social media, sex is easy, spirituality is not, so sex wins….\n\nRecent this has been happening for years\n\nI think some people have very different algorithms than others. When I search \"yoga\" on youtube and instagram I get actual yoga videos but other people get the Ananda Balasana vulva shots and downward doggy-style boomerangs.\n\nI also think yoga can be a very sensual experience and I think that comes across unproblematically (imo) in some creator's content, and I don't have any issue with that.\n\nYup, I searched \"yoga\" on YouTube and it spits out practical yoga, too–and not the kind of yoga done as foreplay or part of sex acts..(or, for that matter, more suitably belonging on Porn Hub)...\n\nThe algorithm is working...\nOf course, two sites I fairly recently have used for instruction influenced this...\n\nNot to say that a former subscription to Elephant Journal hasn't jimmied some of the results...because yoga pants\n\nYeah, it’s gross but nothing new.  One thing that bothers me is when people promote tantra as “sacred sexuality”.  I don’t buy it.  Since tantra says that every aspect of existence is divine, that includes sex.  Ok, that’s fine but how come tantra workshops never include doing your taxes or washing dishes?  no, they’re all about carnal gratification.  People use it as a way to insert sex into a place where it normally wouldn’t be accepted.  The nudist club I currently run has been up against this a couple of times already.  Tantra/yoga teachers have offered their services to our club even though we have strict, clear rules that our events must be of a non-sexual nature.  They act like bc the sex is “tantric” or “spiritual” they get a pass.  Nope!  I wasn’t born yesterday.  I’m not a spiritual person but it bothers me when people use spirituality to legitimize something else.  It gives other spiritual people a bad rap.  I don’t mind if people want to have sex workshops but they should just call them that (and don’t try to have one at a nudist club).  And same thing with yoga in general- stop making it all about sex.  I think yoga can be good for overall physical and mental health and therefor sexual health, too, but that’s not the primary focus and some traditions of yoga even prescribe abstinence so, yeah, it’s annoying when that’s what people focus on and fetishize.\n\nNot bothered at all! People who are proud of how they look from simply exercising, should feel free to boast if they want to. For some, adapted attire is a part of that. Humans are sexual creatures and nowadays we simply have more ways and freedom to express this.\nI'm happy to see that more and more people, from different walks of life, are doing yoga. That can only be a good thing!\n\nA man once told me that they (men) imagine themselves on the women they see doing yoga poses. 🤯😖😤😡🤬🤮😵‍💫🤢😓😪\n\nIt’s always been like this, unfortunately.\n\nI don't know man, just look the other way maybe?\n\nThere's a deep rooted  problem in Western society with sexualization AS A WHOLE. It's not that simple. \nIf anything I'd say that being uncomfortable about it its the right way to go!\n\nSeriously, don't normalize it.\n\nI completely agree that the overt sexualization of yoga needs to stop. However, it's important to consider that some yogic paths aim to awaken kundalini, the dormant energy. When this energy passes from the muladhara chakra to the svasdishthana, it can awaken sensual and sexual energy… I've witnessed this in myself in my yoga teacher training. We shouldn't demonize something that is natural, but we also shouldn't get stuck in the animal experience &amp; sensations. It's essential to transcend and transmute this sexual energy into our highest form. That is the true goal of yoga, to reunite our animal nature (not reject) to meet our divinity.\n\nI don’t see a problem with what others find sexually appealing, as long as it harms none. We are humans with bodies that view other bodies sexually because of thousands of years of evolution. There’s nothing wrong or degrading about it - it’s completely natural and even spiritual for some. I would focus on myself, my practice and think about why sexuality in yoga brings up negative emotions.\n\nI do yoga often and don’t know what you’re talking about\n\nI completely understand where you're coming from, and it bothers me as well. Yoga is meant to be a sacred practice that promotes inner peace, mindfulness, and spiritual growth. Seeing it increasingly sexualized undermines its true essence and disrespects its roots. The commercialization and superficial focus on appearance seem to have overshadowed the core values of yoga. \n\n\n\nAs a community, I think we can start by supporting creators and teachers who honor the spiritual and holistic aspects of yoga, rather than those who focus on the sexualized or purely aesthetic side. Educating people about the true meaning of yoga and encouraging authentic practices might be the best way to counteract this trend. If we can collectively shift the focus back to its origins, we might be able to preserve yoga's integrity. 💜🙏\n\n[deleted]\n\nI envy you\n\nI think sex is also a spiritual practice and having people become comfortable with their sexual selves is a part of the journey. Working through the toxic shame of our puritanical conditioning is a never ending battle. \n\nI do find the vulgar use of it distateful, however. \n\nIt doesn't have to be a bad thing, but it can be a bad thing. Yoga is beautiful, bodies and sex are beautiful, use your sex beautifully.\n\nI think the Kama Sutra made it progress faster. Us westerners neither understand, nor care to understand that pleasure is a state of being, instead of some satanic, or divine quality. It goes against the radical views that our governments have trained us to believe and so we condemn it, or worship it, depending on which side of the coin we were born on.\n\nThe only place I've see this is on TikTok... so I feel like there is nothing \"we\" as a community can do because there's nothing really to do about it. It's not real life, it's not in the studio, where I practice, so I don't really care what some \"models\" sexualize. To me this is obviously not yoga, so I don't concern myself with it.\n\nWasn’t this posted a few weeks ago? I swear I saw a post like this.\n\nBut anyway, everything gets sexualized in the media now.\n\nNope. I posted for the first time in this sub.\n\nHi. The questions says more about the perceptions of the individual rather than the community as a whole. \n\nYoga is for all for all. Regardless of gender and age, race, nationality or creed.\n\nThe aim to explore your own body, how it works, where the energy cones from and the spirit that drives it all.\n\nThat the practice necessitates stretching and holding positions that may may be considered provocative postures is neither here nor there and frankly says more about the perciever. The purpose is to develop the potential of the individual.\n\nThat individuals select practice outfits on the basis they are stretchy, self wicking close fitting and comfy is a personal choice. That they look good, feel good and are comfy is an added benefit.\n\nThat the outfits have become a 'fashionable' garments that show off the figure and satisfy the self esteem and a need to feel attractive of the inivididual is nothing to do with Yoga. It is  everything to do with commercialization and profitability from design thru manufacture and promotions. \n\nI feel sad that such perceptions are apparently so prevalent\n\nThat's the beauty of yoga. You can pick and choose whichever parts work for you and ignore the rest. Basically any form of fitness is going to have sexual elements just because of the natural overlap between the two types of activities in terms of bodies working hard and getting sweaty.\n\nBeing attuned to body and breath is a sensual act. Most people on the yogic path are also healthy compared to the majority of westerners lifestyles, which makes a person appear as ‘sexy’ by nature. Health is sexy, period. By and large our society is repressed sexually, so when witnessing a person in their health and sensuality they can’t handle it and the movement practice becomes deemed as sexual. Now the person who is simply enjoying movement in their own body is the one deemed as acting unfavorably. \nIt’s really backwards.\n\nI know exactly what you are talking about. Absolutely hate seeing those virtually nude yoga videos and those ridiculous leggings which make your bum look vulgar!!\n\nBut I have another grievance regarding sexualising of yoga by others even when it wasn’t intended. During covid lockdown I began brushing up my yoga and used to regularly post my yoga videos of advance asanas on my Facebook like headstand, pinch mayurasana , Scorpio, back bend and drop into chakrasana and various palm balancing poses.  Always fully clothed in all videos and I’m very petite so leggings don’t look vulgar on me. But my own mother once slut shamed me saying that I’m attracting unwanted male attention by posting such videos. WTF!!!\n\nEgads, you just bright up a memory from my last job. I worked at a community center for people with SPMI and some clients would watch naked yoga the computers. Then act like it was educational when we caught them. I do not miss that place."

    "all_comment_text": "I can relate… farts will always be funny, and I lack the maturity to not giggle or laugh , regardless of the setting\n\nSame\n\npure truth to my ears. And nose.\n\nWell I guess put me in the same boat as the other commenter farts=funny. I would have laughed with you.\n\n😂 omg I relate so much. When I was transitioning to a vegetarian diet I had A LOT of gas. And I farted in warrior 2 and as I did the teacher walked up. Let’s just say it was silent but deadly. The teacher started adjusting me in my feet cloud and then lost her train of thought. It smelled sooo bad and was so thick I considered leaving to make sure I didn’t poop myself. Luckily it dissipated and I survived. Just commiserating that this happens 😅\n\n😂 Omg I would have dropped dead right on the mat. Cause of death: died of embarrassment after a gnarly fart\n\nOof hahaha the stealth 😅\n\nI would have avoided her classes for a bit so that her memory of that might have also dissipated, lol.\n\nBut she probably forgot about the whole thing in minutes, as it happens and we’re human.\n\nmy mom farted going into savasana when we were at a class together, we were both trying so hard not to laugh we had to pack up and leave early then i laughed thinking about it every night when i was trying to sleep for weeks.\n\nLmao. If there is one thing that I bust out laughing when trying to sleep it’s fart related too.\n\nI laughed so much just reading this comment. Thank you for sharing\n\nI love your mom! My mom would simply never go back. Being able to laugh at yourself is huge, in my book.\n\nIt's the sound (or smell) of the ego breaking down and your reaction, either embarrassment or laughter, or both, is part of the process.\n\nTruly an important step on the path to enlightenment 🙏💨\n\nEnfartenment\n\nIn future I hope someone sees this comment in your history completely without context.\n\nOnce we were doing savasana with all of our legs up a wall. I was so relaxed one escaped and I felt like it vibrated the wall for everyone\n\nThis is gold 😂 Like, I rarely laugh out loud at comments but this one got me 🤣 Please say you went back again :) It's definitely natural!!\n\nI went back for a few years until they closed the studio- I think my massive fart closed it(not Covid)\n\nI’m crying. I’m a flight attendant on the way to Seoul, it’s in middle of the night and I am LITERALLY laughing so hard in my jump seat I’m crying at these comments!!!\n\nSeoul from where? I assume the US and its a really long flight\n\nSeoul from ATL. And it’s a VERY long flight. lol.\n\nwow... i am fascinated by this.\n\nlol!  It’s a different job for sure.\n\nIt’s great to laugh about yoga farts on a long flight\n\nHope you moved your legs around and made some decoy vibrations to camouflage it…\n\nHonestly I wish there were just fart yoga classes sometimes for these poses specifically (not in a hot enclosed room omg)\n\nOutdoor fart (\"digestion support\") yoga class would be awesome hahaha\n\nI have a specific yoga routine to make me fart when I have trapped gas, would be hysterical to lead a class on it lmao\n\nI would 100% take this class (outside or in a large room 🤣)\n\nOutside though or in a very large room 😆\n\nOmg this got me. I just laughed so hard I woke up the cat\n\nThe other \"wind release pose!\"  Let go of what no longer serves you.\n\nA deep exhale in the wrong direction ✨️\n\n😂😂😂\n\nPigeon when leaning forward. Just squeezed it out slowly. Felt like it went for half the class. Teacher commented that I must be in the correct position\n\nA couple of these comments have made me laugh but this was the best one so far! 🤣👏\n\nA couple of these comments have made me laugh but this was the best one so far! 🤣👏\n\nA couple of these comments have made me laugh but this was the best one so far! 🤣👏\n\nA couple of these comments have made me laugh but this was the best one so far! 🤣👏\n\nThere's two types of yogis. Those who have farted in yoga class, and those who are going to fart in yoga class.\n\nThe queef during sarvangasa..I thought if you cough loud enough no one will hear..I was so wrong 😑\n\nBeen there, done that. 😅\n\nIts really a compliment that the yoga teacher has you doing the real work inside as well as out.\n\nConsider yourself initiated.\n\nAbout a week ago I was teaching a yoga class and only one student showed up. Just me\nAnd her in the room, and I totally farted going into warrior 2. I tried to keep a straight face and just kept teaching. Makes me cringe and giggle just a\nLittle bit.\n\nTeacher here! Happens all the time. Let 'em go! Means it's working 😉\n\nthis happened once to me in a kickboxing class. it was just me and the instructor one on one. that may have been my most humiliating moment in that class\n\nTbh best way to win a kickboxing match 🤷‍♀️ disorient em\n\nI just came from the class where I barely managed not to fart. I dread the thought that there will come the day when I will not be able to hold it in\n\nDon't worry, you won't see it coming\n\n:')\n\nBetter to fart than shart\n\ndefinitely\n\nPeople do this fairly frequently, it’s also natural so nothing to be embarrassed by.\n\nIt’s the most awkward thing when someone farts in class and we all pretend we didn’t hear it 😂😂😬🫢\n\nInhale deeeeeeeply 😂\n\nDid the teacher say 'ok now we are going change the class and practice Kumbhaka pranayama - breath retention? That's what it's for you know.\n\nThat is just a right of passage in yoga class. Downward dog will get you every time.\n\nI have been one of those people taking everything not to laugh at a fart it’s the hardest things I’ve ever done in a class\n\nThe difficulty of this aspect of yoga is very underrated\n\nPotty clogger being the OPs handle makes this funnier. Sorry for the embarrassment but thank you for the laugh.\n\nHappy to share the joy 😄\n\nHappy to share the joy 😄\n\nBenefits of doing yoga at home!\n\nHe won’t claim it but my husband let out a SBD in yoga class a few months ago. It smelled awful. The teacher has a habit of lighting some sage towards the end of class and she fired up some right after the smell, it was about mid class at that point. It was an awesome save.\n\nWhat would have been awesome is if she ended the class right then too\n\nI once was in a morning class and noticed a bad smell and didnt know where it was coming from but suspected the girl either to the left or right…. The whole class one after the other was quite upsetting…later at home I let one rip and realized it had been me the whole time😂\n\nLol. \n\nrite of passage. i think hearing someone else fart in class is almost more comforting because it reminds me that everyone has clenched trying to avoid ripping ass in class at least once!\n\nClassic Potty clogger\n\nU can count on me\n\nI had to drop an entire class after a questionable fart... And now I've completely changed gyms. So I know what it's like to die from the inside out. You're better than me for sticking around.\n\n“ a questionable fart “ ??? 😬\n\nYou think that’s bad — I’ve queefed in a class multiple times 🤦‍♀️\n\nThe worst because you can hold in a fart/usually know when it’s coming, but you cannot predict nor hold in a queef. \n\nEveryone in yoga gets one pass 💨\n\nYou either have farted in yoga class, or you will fart in yoga class. \n\nI haven't let rip a loud one yet, but I have snored in savasana.\n\nI would have laughed with you. I’m very immature and laugh when people fart\n\nI'd be laughing all day about that! Lol\n\nedge offend quarrelsome existence simplistic thumb vast serious violet impossible\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nShame no one said bless you.\n\nI’ve farted once during some cat-cows and it seemed either no one heard, no one knew it was me, or no one cared. But I haven’t let my guard down since.\n\nWell, if it helps, I would have laughed. :)\n\nROFL!!! I’m sorry no one laughed!  If I had been there I would have!  We would be best friends by now. 😂😂\n\nNice.\n\nOf course, if you were fully enlightened as a yogi, your embarrassing bodily functions cease because you would be pure. Sarcasm.\n\n[Potty-Clogger strikes again!](https://media.tenor.com/H97bjfWgJ60AAAAM/jessie-pinkman-breaking-bad.gif)\n\nUsername checks out\n\nI would have laughed with you!!! Lol\n\nI’ve not done it but it’s happened lots in classes I’ve been in. No big deal.\n\nOh no. I relate to that awkward laugh so much.\n\nI always just \"bless you\", or \"well articulated\"\n\nfarts happen, they are usually funny to me, but come on, it's an accidental part of the whole thing. Glad you got a good laugh at your own flatulence. If I were in that class I would have laughed and high-fived you later\n\nUsername checks out\n\nI'm literally crying reading these comments!!! 🤣🤣🤣\n\nI laughed now and if I’d been with you I would have laughed too. Farts are hilarious and deserve a good reception.\n\nI haven't farted publicly doing yoga. I used to be very farty. Yoga has helped me with my bowel movements tremendously.\n\nI was adjusting a student into bow pose. As i done adjusting she couldnt hold it any more and farted loudly. there were like 18 students, all of them start laughing in every pose. Then i lead the class like breathe in, fart out. It was more of laughing yoga class. 🤣\n\nHaha. I can totally feel how much more embarrassing that would be 😄\n\nSome bros would pay more for that.\n\nTT\n\nI always tell my students “you haven't begun yoga till you have passed gass”\n\nI teach a few times a week in a 55+ rec center. Sometimes it's like the winds section, crazy notes, and not a single chuckle, not a word, no one's tellin'.\n\nIt’s all good, happens all the time.\n\nDon’t worry abt it, if anyone brings it up they’re the weird ones. If they do, just laugh it off"

I get my yoga mat and lay it at the front to make sure the only person I'm seeing is the instructor. \n\nEven ten months later I still feel awkward. But I force myself to go as the benefits outweigh any embarrassment I feel or any annoyance that the females may have (I must stress no one has said anything).\n\nYoga has helped eliminate some severe mobility issues I was starting to have. Before Yoga my joints would randomly seize and I would be on crutches. Consultant did all the tests, didn't find anything and suggested Yoga. It's been a revelation. I'm more mobile and haven't had any joint issues since starting Yoga. It really has dramatically changed my quality of life for the better. \n\nAt the moment I'm doing one class a week and would like to do two classes a week.

    "all_comment_text": "Uh no\n\n\nGo do your thing\n\nWas literally going to say the same thing.\n\nI think men are just unfamiliar with being in a women dominant space. You're fine and you should be there, but if you haven't ever been the odd one out you will feel it.\n\nSigned,\nA woman engineer who is often the only woman in a room.\n\nTwins!\n\nYour username is proof of that!!\n\n100% this. I used to make my operators try to imagine being at a sewing circle and imagine being ridiculed and hit on by all the grannies. Because that’s what they would do to me. I don’t think it really sunk in.\n\nGotta bring em to the next sewing circle I guess.\n\nWow.  As an engineer and a dude who does yoga, this insight cut me to the bone lol\n\nWelcome to allyship!\n\n&gt; I think men are just unfamiliar with being in a women dominant space. \n\ni understand what you are saying but its not the same. i have been in a room full of women talking casually and it can be a little awkward but the yoga setting is a little different. most men have a strong desire to avoid making women uncomfortable and getting the label of \"pervert\" or \"creep\" is a big deal. a yoga class filled with women feels like a particularly dangerous place if you want to avoid these things.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni am not saying this is the reality of the situation. this is just how a lot of men would feel about it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nedit: please recognize that i am talking about what men are afraid of and not how women really feel. i can't believe i am taking so much slack for suggesting that men want to avoid things that they think might make women uncomfortable. wtf?\n\nI have had this discussion with my partner (55m) and he is very aware his presence may make women uncomfortable so makes the extra effort to stay to himself out of respect. I generally don’t pay attention to men in the room, but we each come from a different place and a yoga practice can make us feel vulnerable. I appreciate the consideration and awareness.\n\nIf you need to hide in your basement to feel comfortable, go for it. I think that's a you thing, not an other people thing.\n\nYoga is for everyone. If you can't be in a mixed gender class and feel comfortable, that's not my problem. I stand by the fact that men are used to being the majority everywhere they go, and not being the default can feel deeply uncomfortable.\n\nHonestly, I think you missed the point. Nobody said it was your problem. And while not being the default may feel uncomfortable, that’s not what they’re talking about.\n\n\nI have something similar in Pilates class.\nI don’t mind that it’s entirely women other than me. I can handle being the odd one out\n\nI mind that I might be making the women feel uncomfortable. So I do the class with my eyes shut most of the time - to try to avoid them feeling that some creep is perving on them.\n\nI think this is largely from years in the gym where some other guys made no secret that they were ogling the women.\n\nDo those women feel uncomfortable with my presence in class? I don’t know. Maybe not at all!  But I’ll put up with some inconvenience if it helps to avoid that.\n\nNone of that is blaming those women. Just a (possibly unnecessary) attempt to be considerate.\n\nThe down votes on this are wild. Crazy that someone providing an experiential perspective would be shot down so hard\n\nthank you. its just because i picked a dumb username and people are assuming things about me because of it. is it really that crazy of an idea that men are afraid of making women uncomfortable or being labelled a creep? this is the basis of OPs whole post.\n\nI think it’s more that you completely missed the original point. Women are very used to being in male dominated spaces, but the discomfort doesn’t come from being worried about making men uncomfortable, it comes from a long history of being physically assaulted from trying to penetrate those spaces. First women to run marathons, look that shit up.\n\nThe general vibe is if women can power through and get past the known, actual risk of being physically attacked to get into those spaces, y’all can deal with some minor discomfort that has NOTHING to do with actual danger no matter how much you choose words to imply that it does.\n\nSuck it up.\n\nI think you are intentionally misunderstanding what’s being said out of spite, or at least that’s how you’re coming off, but if you aren’t, then take a moment to view things from the other sides perspective. \n\nIf you are a man, your own discomfort DOESNT MATTER. This is what is said to men again and again. You are saying it now. You are misunderstanding. Most men don’t actually care about their own discomfort, because of this mindset and this societal expectation towards men to not have feelings, and “just suck it up buttercup” and all of that toxically masculine bullshit. This is what generational trauma coming down the line looks like. This is the kind of stuff that separates women and men and everybody in between from each other even further. Most men would rather continually suffer, and punish themselves for being weak, than actually admit that they are suffering and need help, because of the shame that’s forced upon them from people like you.\n\nWhat the concern is here is NOT actually the guys discomfort. He’s not saying I’m uncomfortable feel bad for me. Again you’re misunderstanding. He’s genuinely worried about other people’s feelings of safety, and comfort levels. He’s literally prepared to stop doing something that he loves because he’s worried it’s effecting the people around him negatively. He’s trying to avoid making people uncomfortable. His own discomfort wasn’t even part of the question. I don’t understand how this guy could try any harder to be an ally. I don’t understand how this guy could try any harder to be respectful and thoughtful of other’s feelings. And yet everyone is shitting on him. This is so frustrating to me, bc he has the intention of protecting and helping other people, but everyone is misunderstanding and assuming he’s trying to protect himself.\n\nI think women have explained over and over what makes us uncomfortable and what doesn't? Like the mere presence of men isn't discomforting for most women. Men talking to us is not discomforting to most women.  \n\nWe don't want to be stared at, or in general, hit on in a yoga studio. If you do ask us out we want you to accept no for an answer.\n\nThis is a fair assertion, and I think you are right, but many men have problems with this kind of thing and also many women don’t feel the same as you do. I think it’s trauma and negative self perception above all that causes men to think like this, but that’s just a theory.\n\nI find this response incredibly articulate and the extreme reaction to OP really, really weird. I highly encourage women who think OP’s concerns strange go to r/AskMen and do a search for yoga. I had no idea this was what was what was going through men’s heads re: the subject of yoga. Rather than reject/deny it, I think it’s just important to accept it and then think about what it might mean to be welcoming to the men who do actually show up. Probably not much (I think that’s more on the teacher and other men in the class) but we can all keep emphasizing in anonymous forums that men are very welcome and women DO NOT CARE.\n\nHere is one thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/s/hNPb525352\n\nThis reminds me of the kind of comments I used to write before I went on testosterone.\n\nAfter a couple years of behaving the exact same way towards women as I did before hormone therapy - which had never been an issue when they saw me as a cis female, but caused some pretty stark reactions once I grew a beard - I had to admit that whoops, there might have been something to that paranoia some men had been describing, after all.\n\nPeople are a lot less likely to respond these days if someone casually assaults me, especially sexual assault, and most gender-conforming cis women (gender conforming as in: has never seriously worried about being kicked out of a bathroom based on their appearance) straight up do not believe me when I tell them how often it's women doing it. (Women who are less gender-conforming tend to know exactly what I'm talking about, because women with a higher-ranking gender performance have done it to them.) Until I started talking about this experience, I never got to hear how many cis dudes have also felt utterly helpless to stop a woman sexually assaulting them, as they felt that fighting her or even yelling at her to fuck off would have caused onlookers to assume he was the aggressor. Many consider this experience so normal, or have been taught so well that it really is their fault if they're ever misinterpreted, that they would never report it, even on a survey.\n\nTo be fair, most men don't articulate or identify this fear very well; nobody has taught them how to parse out why coming off as \"asking for it\" is such an ever-present fear and makes them feel endangered - if they're taught to be aware of it, it's through the lens of \"it's my own fault if people think this way about me\" and \"the danger is being seen as creepy\".\n\nI get the benefit of being able to clearly identify why being assumed horny is so scary, and why it leaves such a mark even if it's only happened without cause a few times, because I can directly compare the feeling of living with \"men are always looking for sex\" attitudes vs \"if you go out dressed in that skirt you're asking for it\" attitudes, and because I have learned through experience that no amount of extra upper-body strength stops your freeze response kicking in when you're in the moment and afraid of the consequences of fighting back.\n\nI don’t actually understand your comment.\n\nIt sounds like you are trying to say that the fear of being physically assaulted is the same thing as the fear of being perceived as horny?\n\ni'm confused. i am very aware of the bullshit women have to deal with. that is why i try to give them space when i can. so your advice is to stop worrying about possibly making women uncomfortable and just do whatever i want? that doesn't sound right. i would rather error on the side of caution on that one.\n\nNo she’s just asking you to try to be a normal human in a yoga studio. And that if you treat people with respect, no one is going to think you’re being a creep. You will likely still feel uncomfortable, and that’s what she’s asking you to sit with. I don’t mean this confrontationally or anything either, just trying to help clarify. Having this discussion is a good thing!\n\ni appreciate translators in these sorts of conversations. we need more people like you. thank you.\n\nI feel like part of the misunderstanding here (which has already been touched on, but I would like to reiterate) is that women in male dominated spaces, aside from having to live with the risk of being assaulted in or adjacent to those spaces, also have to deal with the various social discomforts of being judged as not belonging in those spaces for a barrage of “reasons” that are used to undermine our confidence and self worth, such as:\n\nThat we’ve only been allowed there because we have *manipulated* the system as sexual objects.  That we are assumed to be *incapable* of the same effort or talent as our male peers.  That we don’t take our work as seriously.  That we are only there to “find a man.”  That we have manipulated the system through affirmative action.  That we hate and envy our male coworkers.  That we shouldn’t even be working at all and should become home makers.  That we need and want the assistance of our male colleagues.  That any favor from a male coworker should be taken as a romantic gesture. And so many more nuanced interactions that we so often are made to tiptoe around.\n\nSo, given all of that, some women could understandably be annoyed that you would *seemingly* complain about the difficulty of your circumstances, when they are facing much the same, with a score of other similarly disheartening problems, as well as situations that potentially risk our lives even if we are as careful as possible.\n\nEven so, your feelings and concerns are still valid, and deserve to be addressed, but that may be something that would be best to figure out with a therapist.  Just know that for many of us, the sense of privilege and entitlement of your only having to worry about the one issue, can be jarring, if that makes sense.\n\nThank you\n\nI really hate everything about this sub thread. I don’t think we need to ask men to “suck it up” just because women have been so shafted in every possible f’ing way. I love yoga. I want people to be healthy. There are so many men who would benefit from a regular practice. Many, many, many men feel so uncomfortable coming to a yoga class that they never do. When they are honest and vulnerable about why, it makes me want to be welcoming and to allay their fears. This is a unique, specific, and ubiquitous experience men are having. I don’t think the comparisons are all that helpful. Neither is denying what they are experiencing or trying to explain their experiences for them and engage in arguments when they disagree about those explanations. Perhaps men are reliable narrators of their own experiences just like we are?\n\nIf you don't exhibit behaviors like staring at women, making  sexual comments/comments on our bodies, and or touching us without our permission, no one thinks you're creepy. \n\nLike talking to, or looking at a woman isn't creep behavior.\n\nAs a man... you're definitely overthinking this. I get why people downvote or criticize you below, because thinking about this as much as you do, does give off some weird vibes. This isn't an issue I've ever encountered in any yoga class that I've been to. It's not that hard to just be a considerate and respectful person, even as a man. I promise.\n\nA one hour yoga class is more challenging then working in a male dominated space? Is it so hard to not be a creep- no it’s pretty easy. Please learn to emphasize with women as much as men\n\nIt's always crazy to me how many people need the \"ok\" from women to participate in a women-dominated space (on the internet at least, I've never seen this sentiment in real life). No one cares. Just do it. They should realize they are not the victim here, and that women shouldn't need to reaffirm that it's ok.\n\nMaybe Mr Turbo Slut has some thinking to do about why he feels like a pervert or a creep in a woman-dominated space.\n\nPretty much every self aware man has to be mindful of this as a possible perception. Not a great feeling either. \n\nExactly. I don't understand how this is so surprising/unthinkable to women? We don't like this feeling either. We wish we didn't live in a world where men can be seen this way. But it's a sad reality: some men are creeps. How is it so hard to see that women and men alike would have acquired certain behaviors to adapt to this reality?\n\nWell said!\n\nIt's yoga. Why is this such a big deal? Why would women have this perception about a man wanting to exercise and meditate?\n\nthe self imposed burden of not being seen as a “creep” is very real… nowhere trying to compare with the difficulty women have navigating a man dominated world everywhere, but just saying that the emotion exists in some men. saying it aloud sometimes draws snorts of derision from the women, because men struggling with gender imbalance issues is somehow trivial (to some people).\n\nthat sums it up well. i think some people, in this case women, have a hard time seeing others perspectives. i try to explain how a lot of men see the situation and because it doesn't line up with how they see it as women then it must be wrong. thankfully, it appears that are also a lot of people in the comments that get it.\n\nYou’re absolutely right here. I signed up for a block of 8 classes, after being assured that this instructor was excellent with both sexes and with newbies as I am.\nWent along and I was the only male in a very small space, 7 other women all filed in, some pregnant.\nThere wasn’t enough space for 8 people, let alone one male and 7 women.\nThe whole way through I got this ‘we’re not comfortable’ vibe and on the way out 2 were speaking of going to a different session next week.\nThe thoughts I’d made any woman uncomfortable, let alone a group of them, was so strong in my head that I didn’t go back and just took the loss on 7 classes.\n\nMaybe they just wanted to go to another session because the place was too crowded in general and had nothing to do with you. Just because you got a \"vibe\" doesn't mean that's what was happening.\n\nHallelujah! Men have no clue how often we are only 1 of 3 women in a space completely dominated by men.\n\nYou might be overthinking this. Heaps of men practice yoga.\n\nFound the Aussie\n\n Why yes, g'day.\n\nHeaps was the giveaway 👍\n\n🤣\n\n🤣\n\nDoesn’t bother me in the least as long as they are acting normal.  Glad you’re seeing so much progress!\n\nI have never noticed who is in the classes I attend, I’m too focused on not falling over\n\nAs a man who has only been to a few classes… this is definitely my experience of yoga. I wish I was good enough to worry about anything other than straining something unpronounceable or falling over…😂\n\nHappy Cake Day!  :D\n\nThanks. I noticed too late.\n\nIt’s all good my friend!  I hope it was still a great day.  :)\n\nSame! Could not tell you who was there at all😂\n\nTeacher here. I love having men in my class. I hope that I'm providing a space that's safe enough for *anyone* to practice without feeling too obvious\n\nAbsolutely not. We are all humans with bodies that desire/need movement. Enjoy.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis. If I’m looking at anyone it’s:\n\n1. Where did they get their clothes?\n2. Damn, I wish I could do that.\n\nSame, I couldn’t give a hoot about anyone else as a general rule unless I’m scoping their nice yoga gear in a fleeting moment.\n\nNope\n\nAbsolutely not! Honestly the only person I think about when taking a class is myself. Please go to your classes and enjoy yourself.  I'm glad the practice is working for you 💙\n\nNo, I actually love seeing men in yoga classes.\n\nIt’s a public space, generally/loosely speaking. I would only expect men not to be there if it was explicitly labeled a ladies only class. \n\nIf I went to a general yoga class at a gym, I would think it unreasonable of ME not to expect men to be there. \n\nNot at all! We have a few men in my regular class and I always recommend it to my male friends. They always say the same thing, “I’m not very flexible” and I’ll say, “you will be soon!”\n\nNo! I love to see it. I have an older friend and her friend bring their husband's who are pushing 60 to my yin class. At first they were uncomfortable but the more they came the more they liked it. One guy got so into it that he'd stay after class to ask the instructor for more stretches to do at home for his back. \n\n\nI've also never been to a class with a creepy man. You definitely hear stories but thankfully I haven't encountered it. \n\n\nOnce the class starts I'm so focused in my breathing and movement I don't even register what other people are doing. If you like it and it's benefitting you I see no reason not to continue your practice.\n\nI like to see men in my yoga class because it isn't meant to be a \"women's space\" and the benefits of yoga can help all people. It makes me happy to be part of an inclusive practice and space. I have yet to meet a man in a yoga class for the wrong reasons e.g. enjoying the view, etc.\n\nNot at all. I barely notice anyone in class anyway. It’s an internally focused activity. The only time I care is if someone is wearing strong perfume/cologne and talks loudly in the room.\n\nAbsolutely go to class! I'm a studio owner and instructor and I love that we have men attend and I've never had one single female express they are uncomfortable with a man in class.\n\nI'm a 35m in NYC, and I think I understand what you're talking about.\n\nYoga, for one reason or another is often viewed by a lot of male people, atleast in my anecdotal experience living in the west, as a sort effeminate interest, and an exercise for women, which they often believe is entirely focused on flexibility.  I was one of those guys until I dated a yoga instructor at a time when I was very into cross fit.  I had said something similar to her, and she told me I was all wrong, and she could run me through some progressions right now, in her apartment, that would kick my ass, guaranteed.  I accepted the challenge, failed it, we laughed, and now I'm still into yoga 10 years later.\n\nI now go to classes, and sometimes am the only male attending. I DO also try to keep my eyes to myself, and be extra respectful when it feels like a space for women, but I think everyone understands it's open to everyone, there's just less male interest.  Probably for some silly machismo reason, I'm not sure where it comes from, really.\n\nEdits for spelling\n\nI used to attend yoga classes with my wife. I was usually the only male. In the beginning, in my mind, I thought \"This is gonna be a waste of my time. I need REAL exercise!\" I was thinking weight training, etc. You know...guy stuff. I was also a little uncomfortable being the only male in the room. i didn't want to be perceived as creepy or anything. So I was very conscious of my behavior...for the first few minutes. After that all I could think of was \"This yoga stuff is HARD! I may die!\" The women were doing poses that I was way too inflexible to do. The instructor was great and she pushes her students to go deeper, stretch further, etc. I don't remember what she called that style but it was REAL exercise. I really began to look forward to classes and could quickly see the benefits in my flexibility, sleep, and mood. If the women in the class remarked upon my presence at all, it was always in a positive manner. They were very encouraging and seemed to enjoy seeing my progress. It was an overall positive experience for me!\n\nUm…never in my life did I think about men being in yoga class is an issue. Like why would it matter? My hubby has gone with me before. It’s normal and expected.\n\nNope you do you! :)\n\nNope, not at all.\n\nNever\n\nNo, not at all. \n\nUnless they're being annoying, but then I'd be annoyed at them regardless of gender.\n\nI, M51, I'm regularly the only old fat dude in a class. We have other men in the class, but they're always an amazing shape, and skew younger. I haven't ever been made to feel like an interloper, but I definitely am cognizant of my otherness.\n\nLike you, I do things to try to make myself less likely to be perceived as a \"creepy old dude.\" Keep doing your thing. You might be making another guy comfortable to start attending through your own attendance.\n\n...why would it? Like, are you being weird about it?\n\nNot at all. I feel like an intruder in an activity that is seen as being mainly female.\n\nYoga is for every body so yoga is for everybody!\n\nI'm not sure why men get downvoted for statements like this, but it happens every time they're made in this subreddit.\n\nYour experience is valid. People notice when they are consistently the only one of X group in a Y space, and it definitely can feel awkward. I notice when I'm the only woman in a typically male dominated space. I notice when I'm the only person of my ethnicity in a group of other ethnic backgrounds. Men say they notice being the only man in female spaces, and people of color are aware of being the only one in white spaces. \n\nWe *shouldn't* feel like intruders, but we do, simply because we are visibly, noticeably different from everyone around us. We're not responsible for our first thought (I feel like I don't belong here), but we are responsible for our second thought, which should be 'but that's not the reality, and I have a right to be here.'\n\nNamaste dude, keep showing up. We really don't mind.\n\nI have had quite a few male teachers and always had men in classes. I don't really feel it's just women at all.\n\nHey, your experience is valid, too! OP explicitly stated that he is the only man in his class though, so that's what I spoke to. My own experience is a mix. I've been in classes with none, one, or a couple men, but I don't think I've ever had more than 3.\n\nYoga is not strictly a female space. Come and find your zen 🧘🏼‍♀️\n\nthat is part of your issue.\n\ni am male and i don't see yoga as a practice, activity, for only females.\n\ngo to India or other countries where this sentiment does not exist pertaining to yoga. \n\nyoga is part of being in a community, bringing opposites together, and being in the moment with yourself. \n\nhave fun. enjoy your space, wherever it may be, and let go of that that does not serve you.\n\nYou do know yoga came from Indian monks right?  Men invented it and practiced it for hundreds of years.\n\nUh... no... yoga isn't a woman thing, it's an everyone thing.\n\nNo, I’m not annoyed. Usually there are more men than woman in the yoga classes I attend. I become annoyed if they try to talk to me or engage me in any way.\n\nNo yoga class I’ve been to in the thirty plus years I’ve practiced has ever had a problem with men attending, most of the classes had male participants anyway. \nYoga is not a gendered thing, although I have noticed that a certain type of naive man sees it as a ‘soft’ option - they are also the type to embrace toxic masculinity and to really struggle to keep up within a class!\n\nWoman who loves yoga here : I have zero problem with men who respectfully do their own thing in class. I feel sad for men for who feel uncomfortable in women-dominated spaces and I feel like a lot of dudes are missing out on great gender-neutral things (art class, fitness class, meditation group, just to name a few I participate in) because no other dudes show up. Thanks for breaking the mold and hopefully making other dudes feel more comfortable joining in.\n\njesus man let it go. yoga is for humans.\n\nthe teacher wants more students. the yoga studio wants more clients. the other practitioners want more group momentum/energy. everyone is glad you are there.\n\nthe only awkwardness is in your mind and practicing consistently will dissolve that. your practice will become even more beneficial through the process.\n\nI would recommend leaning in and challenge yourself to practice daily for a month in a studio on an unlimited membership and see how you feel on the other end of it. I suspect you will feel tired, stronger, calmer, make a few friends, and be able to look back at feeling awkward around yoga forever.\n\nbtw, historically yoga has been a male dominated activity. the current situation might be just bringing things back into balance.\n\ngood luck!\n\nMaybe do stop saying “females” though\n\nNo problem with it. I'm happy to see men there as it feels more inclusive. Most classes I attend have at least a couple of men, and one class I go to weekly is about 25 people and at least a third male.\n\nNope. Men are allowed to do yoga. It's OK to be the only guy. Nobody cares as long as you're not a creep.\n\nI work at a yoga studio and there are a ton of guys that go to yoga, plus several male instructors. Nothing to be ashamed of at all.\n\nThe benefits must be massive. Two classes per week sounds ideal for maintaining those benefits.\n\nI just sit in the front and focus on Yoga\n\nThe yoga physical practice was mostly intended for the male body. So… pretty ironic isn’t it?\n\nSounds like the only person who has a problem with it is you :) \nJust go, do your yoga, get in your headspace, and enjoy.\n\nMy only issue with men is yoga is that in my experience they tend to grunt more than the women (if the women even grunt at all). It drives me nuts. But if they can breathe quietly, I generally love seeing more men in yoga\n\nYES…can they not control it or do they just not notice that they are the only one in the room grunting? LOL\n\nNo but your sensitivity is appreciated\n\nThis comes up too often. No i don't care or think anything of a man in yoga class. Why is it only yoga I hear this? No one asks this about my Orangetheory classes. Do men think yoga is sexy? Is that why they're worried about it? I think they need to ask themselves why it feels weird to them. I generally don't understand this question coming up all the time. Lots of men practice at my studio and we have several male teachers too.\n\nNot at all\n\nAbsolutely not\n\nNot at all. I’ve made friends with a variety of people and love the diversity in a class.\n\nNo. Not at all.\n\nAbsolutely not. Yoga is a practice where everyone should be welcomed!\n\nIt's all in your head!\n\nI have no issue with it! As long as the space is respected which it sounds like you’re doing all is well!\n\nNope back when I did classes there were lots of guys of various ages and abilities. Didn’t really think too much about it. My concern was always finding a spot for my mat\n\nAs a guy who's done quite a bit of yoga, including teacher trainings, I've never heard of women objecting to someone being in a class just on the basis of them being male.  I think at this point there are men in yoga classes frequently enough that it's not really unusual any more.\n\nMaybe it’s my crunchy urban upbringing but I’ve  never been in a yoga class that didn’t have at least 4 or 5 men. I don’t think about anyone else in class unless I came with a friend who’s not as into yoga as I am or I’m seething about not being able to do a handstand no matter how much I try but mr core-strength over here is making it look easy.\n\nMy husband and I both attend the same yoga classes. He's usually the only man in our small studio. Most of the other women members have expressed their envy that we both do yoga and that they wish their partners would also attend. We need more men in classes!\n\nWe need more men in the wiry who are in touch with their bodies and practice meditation. I love seeing men in class personally.\n\nAs a man, I try to sit in the front of the class whenever possible to reduce possible anxiety that I'm there just to stare at women's butts or something. I've never experienced people being annoyed or upset simply because I'm a dude. But there are things you can do to make yourself less of a \"threar\". Don't say creepy stuff, don't stare at people, make it clear you're there to practice and learn yoga and I don't think anybody will have a problem.\n\nBe Roy Kent from Ted Lasso! Who cares! Keep going!\n\nThe way the Western society has turned yoga into a more trendy/girlie thing just kills me. Yoga is for everyone and in the beginning, it was exclusively men. Women were not allowed. I wish there were more men, to be honest. We have much to learn from each other, and I've learned quite a bit about asanas from men. Keep going. Please.\n\nMen are allowed to do yoga, dude. Go do it. \n\nI’m on the side of being happy to see diversity in the classes and that very much includes men. \n\nFor my young boys the highlight of their summer is going to yoga camp, so more men in yoga studios hopefully means they will keep their enthusiasm for it as they grow up. \n\nI'm a larger, strongly built man, I literally do not care if women are upset or made uncomfortable by my presence in the studio lol. It's not my problem, and it shouldn't be yours, either. Just don't be obnoxious or disruptive as you would in any public setting.\n\nWe’re all people, and all yogis. Unless it’s a gender specific class, it simply just does not matter my friend 🙏\n\nMore annoyed by how many of these posts there are tbh\n\nIt’s weird that you’re making it weird. My yoga instructor is male and there are plenty of men in the class. I also go to classes where the instructor is female and there’s.. still men in the class. I don’t even give them a second thought. Yoga is not a “female thing”. Yoga is believed to have been evolved from the Brahmins who were mostly men. The yoga sutras were written by Patanjali.. also a man. \n\nI realise western yoga these days can sometimes be more associated with women in Lululemons but IME this is mostly a joke with people who don’t actually do yoga. Go to your class and focus on yourself instead of others, if anyone has an issue with you being there then that’s a them problem.\n\nlol, I’ve been going 6 days a week for 108 weeks, often the only guy. Never occurred to me folks might be uncomfortable. Source: am engineer🤣🤣\n\nI am the only male in the class that I go to. Everyone is pretty friendly, and we all just mind our business\n\nAbsolutely not. Yoga is for everyone. I think it's great seeing men discover the benefits of yoga and you seem very conscientious and respectful of others.\n\nI don't care who is in the space as long as they are following reasonable yoga etiquette and not being creepy.\n\nThis is a perfect example of embracing yoga, and all its limbs. Not just Asana, it’s part of the mental practice too. Imposter syndrome is real, and manifests itself is some interesting places. If you’re practicing for you, it will show. I am often the only male in class (I find evenings much more diverse) and when I first started I felt this. Now that I know most the instructors and done some TT myself. It’s people, and we all need yoga.\n\nIm in the UK, I’m thrilled to see men on the mat! I know how good it is (so stoked to hear it’s been such an improvement for you) and I know how much more of a barrier there is to get men in the room. The fact that you’re thinking about this means you’re probably not being a creep and you’ve found something that really works for you - keep going back, id be so happy to see you in my class. \n\nIf you’re there to do yoga and are acting normally, no issue whatsoever. The only time I’ve been in a class where a man was acting in a way I considered inappropriate, the guy was moaning pornographically at every movement and tbf I would have been equally annoyed if a woman had been moaning like that too.\n\nNever had a male clothing issue in yoga. I did have a guy I had to tell he needed to wear tighter shorts when teaching pole because… parts were sometimes showing when he did inversions (I have had to give this advice to female students as well)\n\nNot at all!!! I’m trying to get my husband and son to go. At my studio, we have a lot of senior aged men. It’s beneficial to them. And they’re super nice.\n\nI think this is all in your head. At its true roots in India many men practice yoga and are the top yogis. You have let a society stereotype creep in. Everyone there is just trying to get their work out in and no one is thinking about you. Not a soul\n\nYoga is for everyone and I’m so glad your practice has been serving you. I happen to practice at a couple of places (nyc) where there is tremendous gender diversity among students and instructors and class is always a joy. Keep showing up for yourself and remain a respectful member of your community and you’ll be grand.\n\nI've honestly been trying to get the men in my life to join me for years 😂\n\nWhy would you be embarrassed? Yoga is for everyone. We are glad you’re here.\n\nNot at all, why would I be annoyed? It’s not a women-only exercise. Go and enjoy.\n\nthe world would be a better place if more men did yoga, and it would be a shame if this kept you from practicing! \n\nyoga is for everyone. there’s no need to other yourself on the basis of gender. i understand where you’re coming from, but as long as you’re not being a creep you’re fine. you seem very cautious of your behavior towards women in class settings so it doesn’t sound like there’s an issue here!\n\nI’m in the US, and not at all.\n\nI will not lie. I have felt uncomfortable, but that is not on the men who want to do yoga. I have had bad men in my life and I recognize that and I push what I have aside because it ain't about me.\n\nBut it is a space for everyone unless it's labeled for women only or men only. You go and enjoy it. It can be quite fun :D\n\nIn the places I go, a lot of the classes are a 50/50 gender ratio. Yoga is not inherently gendered\n\nI don't feel uncomfortable at all with having men in classes I'm in. I'm also a yoga teacher and many of my nicest students are men, and my own favorite teachers are men as well. The only time I can think of that a woman has ever expressed discomfort during or after a class was because of a guy who was standing around taking photos of the women in our outdoor class, but other than that one very creepy incident, I can't think of any other times when guys in my classes have made anyone else feel uncomfortable. I really hope you won't let this concern stop you from practicing, it sounds like yoga has been really good for you.\n\nI think its a shame that even after 10 months, you still feel awkward. I really hope you can get over that and actually enjoy the class fully!\n\nOnly when then grunt, make lots of noise or snore during savasana :(\n\nI’ll add my male perspective. A little over a year ago, my bipolar wife left our family and accused me of all sorts of things over way out, including verbal abuse and hating women. I hope you can take my word for it that neither were remotely true (I was raised by a feminist mother and have primairy custody of our 2 daughters - I believe the hate women comment was designed to cause maximum pain at the time). Part of my recovery was to start therapy, soooo much therapy, intentionally with a woman therapist and to start yoga.\n\nI felt the same way about yoga being a woman’s space and went daily, literally keeping my head down and saying nothing but thank you to the instructor at the end of every class. Maybe it was a woman’s space and maybe I did make people uncomfortable - but after a year I was totally integrated in the studio and was made to feel totally comfortable there. No one needed to stroke my ego and tell me that I was ok to be there, but I was treated like everyone else and it was so normal and rad. Made yoga friends (like friends in class, definitely never tried to be friends with anyone outside of class), got comfortable being adjusted, learned to love having a safe hour to myself, and just felt like I belonged there. Even engaged with light chitchat before class. In one year I initiated one conversation with a woman about her mat and ended up buying a fabulous lifrform mat that i totally cherish.\n\nI guess my point is that we all have our own yoga journey and this was part of mine - and it was all in my head, maybe it was objectively true that people didn’t want me there, maybe it was not. It does not matter to anyone but me. \n\nI left town a few months ago, and leaving the studio was incredibly sad for me. I’m now in a bigger city with a vibrant yoga scene and trying to find my new yoga home, it’s still uncomfortable going to new ones, but not because anyone is objectively judging me (maybe they are, but that’s my issue to transcend).\n\nGo to yoga my man, but do it for yourself completely. Don’t be a creep (unsolicited life advice for all of us in general) and do your thing. It’s a transformative journey and worth any initial discomfort.\n\nThat’s probably more a UK attitude? We have plenty of men in quality yoga studios in the US.  If it’s really a good instructor then men will attend.  Also men instructors too!  IOW, all types are welcome in the studios where I practice.\n\nAs a 50+ year old man in a yoga class where everyone else is female and 90% are much younger I can safely say my biggest worry is that I might fart in a pose where I cannot hold it.\n\nNo- that’s so sexist. Everyone can enjoy yoga!\n\nNo\n\nOverthinking, no one gives a f about who attends as long as they're not being creeps.\n\nBut drop the \"female\" word, it's not so difficult to write \"woman\" instead, woman is even shorter so there's no excuse to objectify women\n\nI have never ever ever looked at a man in a yoga class and thought any negative thing. It’s nice to have a mix. I would never feel annoyed. Please enjoy your class and I’m glad you’ve found yoga helpful for your joints\n\nI love to see men in class. Please just go to as many classes as you want to.\n\nI genuinely love practicing alongside men. I love when men come into women-dominated spaces for the same reason I love seeing women enter male-dominated spaces. Because yoga isn’t just for women. Weight lifting isn’t just for men. We all need each other.\n\nNo. Could not care less. You do you.\n\nI think this post has triggered everybody. \nAs a woman, it’s never crossed my mind that a man in a yoga class would think or behave like a pervert! \nThere are plenty of men of all ages in the classes I go to, and they seem very much focussed on doing yoga….\nYoga is meditation in movement. \nEverybody is usually just struggling with their own personal best and couldn’t be bothered if the rest of the class is green, yellow, male, female, gay, transgender. \nIf the studio is very small and over-booked, and people’s personal space is being invaded, then change studios. \nIf your studio is full of people in tiny outfits showing off, then it sounds pretty shallow and you might be better off finding a more serious studio. \nIf you are busy watching people instead of watching yourself, then you are going to piss people off. \nIf you really can’t keep your eyes off the woman in front’s bum, then just get there early and get into the front row. \nWhen appropriate, just lower your eyes and look away. \nIt’s really not that difficult.\n\nIt’s absolutely fine. The only “rule” I can think of is “no leering “ and “wear proper shorts or joggers” …to prevent any wardrobe malfunctions …actually this applies to everyone. Lol\n\nNo way! It makes the class more diverse plus most of the time people are focusing on getting through the class themselves versus what anyone else is doing\n\nBaby boy, you are asking the right questions and we love you and thank you for that. Practice in peace, bro!!\n\nNope, not at all. I’m in the US and there’s usually 2-3 guys in my smaller class of about 12 and 3-4 in the class with about 30. \nI think the guys are there to benefit from the yoga as I am, and don’t think a thing of it, even if I’m in puppy dog with one behind me.\nI’d like to see more of a balance but the stigma is still real.\nCarry on and do more yoga tho!\n\nHi there. I'm a man, and can understand these feelings of being on the spot or watched. I used to go to the middle of the rooms to see the instructor and other people doing poses I wasn't sure were happening (I don't know the Sanskrit names, etc.) and I actually felt like I was expected to be a creeper... which put me off my practice. I also noticed real creepers in there, and it made me feel weird for the women and the feel of the room in general. Some instructors had all the men to the front, which I was happy about, until the instructor got up and walked around the help people get deeper into the poses. Then I was left not knowing what moves were happening unless I looked around, which made me feel like I was mistaken for a creep. All very distracting. \n\nHaving said that, I think you can tell which guys are there for the yoga, because they're really trying and can actually pull off some of the poses. They also feel less weird - which is a pathetic description, but I know women know what I'm talking about. And then there was this one time I was next to a woman who was on her phone while doing poses... texting and whatnot. I complained to one of my friends later and they said she was somewhere else besides her practice, and SO WAS I! I realized I wasn't focused on what I was doing with my own breath and body poses because I was caught off guard by her phone being in the mix. Well, obviously, I should have kept my focus to the practice and felt okay with that and just did the work. Which is kind of the big take-away for me in yoga anyway. It makes us walk into challenges in the class so we can better face challenges outside of the class. \n\nSo if that metaphor can serve you as it did me, then great! I learned I get in my own way too much, and ruin my own practice in and outside of the classes. Maybe that will help remind you to focus on you, and brush off the creepers who are too distracting? But, then again, that's a gross oversimplification of the real issue which is men being terrible people towards women. So please don't think I'm telling you how to live your life, or trying to minimize your very real concerns. I'm just trying to help a little because I'm hypervigilant myself, and have a hard time not watching everyone in the room or out in public because of trust issues I've always had. \n\nMaybe some guys are trying to meet women there? What better place if they too are into yoga and want someone who can work on self-care like they do? But really, that's just me trying to be diplomatic, because I don't try to connect with women at yoga classes for this same reason you're concerned about. I would feel weird and creepy, even when I know I'm not cruising or trying to hook up. \n\nAnd if you really want a dumb story, ask me about the time I went with a former girlfriend and she took me to her yoga studio... and her ex-boyfriend was the instructor! Talk about silly drama. I was so naive, and really had no idea what was going on until I added things up later. The good news is he tried to \"help\" me get into some difficult poses, and because I actually practiced at home often enough, I could bend and flex into postions where he was obviously trying to hurt me. And even then, I was such a fool that I thought he was just a hands-on kind of instructor... though, he really didn't help any other guys, or put his full body weight into \"helping\" any other folks in the room. Overall, I was a fool in a silly situation, dating a toxic woman who was trying to cause some kind of drama... maybe THAT'S why I don't want to connect with any women in yoga classes? Damn. I bet it is. All these years later and I just figured that out. I guess giving people the benefit of the doubt and being a fool is a trait I still carry today. Maybe taking advice in any form from me isn't the best idea. Sorry about that. I hope some of this helps, and I hope you get to interact with the instructors you enjoy. Don't let the creeps throw you off your growth. Best of luck\n\nIm not annoyed. I love to see men in class, I love that they're opening themselves up to enjoy yoga as I have plenty of men in my life who I wish would do so. Theres an older guy that comes to class every week, he struggles to get into most of the poses but he keeps coming back and I love that. I figure if he's making progress so am I. Anyway I call him my friend in my head lol, and I'm always rooting for him, in my head &lt;3 Not the least bit annoyed.\n\nI stay in the back (56m).  I’ve never got bad vibes in any way from females but literally when I’m the only man i feel like an intruder.  Luckily it’s pretty rare that I’m the only man.\n\nI used to be at the back but then read that women may be uncomfortable so I moved to the front. Now I worry about my skinny arse.\nIt also avoids the woman who made a comment about my “crotch.\n\nThat's the word I was looking for. I do feel like an intruder, mainly because Yoga tends to be seen mainly as a female activity.\n\nHeck no. My bf does yoga and so do I (somewhere different), most classes are about 50/50. Yoga is for everybody- and every body. It shouldn't be gatekept. \nYou do you.\n\nDefinitely not annoyed! Our studio is more balanced than some; most classes have a man or two - sometimes they’re even closer to 1/3 of those in attendance! However, I have had the odd all-female class every once in a while. We are always happy that the guys want to show up!\n\nOnly when they grunt loudly during every move 🙄\n\nLiterally no woman thinks about this, because we're all used to having to be in male dominated spaces.\n\nNo, Who cares\n\nHell no. You are entitled to be at that yoga class just like everyone else.\n\nNot at all! But it does annoy me if they aren’t wearing a shirt in class\n\nYou are experiencing a unique feeling for a man. This is what it feels like for women who’ve been sexually assaulted walking into male dominated spaces or people of color in all white spaces. Use it to help you be understanding to others. \nI could care less about men or women in my yoga classes. So enjoy your gains.\n\nNo of course not! \n\nHeck  my favourite yoga teacher is male. There is absolutely no reason why yoga should be a \"female\" sport. It's for everyone, and a lot more men would probably feel a lot healthier if they took it up!\n\n(So would a lot of other women, for that matter! Yoga is fabulous 🤩)\n\nIn India it’s more popular with men (it was passed through male teacher-student lineages) Go figure!\n\nIt's OK to notice people's body's dude. Just don't touch or stare. You're a human being and have the right to have human feelings. \n\nLet judgmental shaming people suffer the fate of being a judgmental shaming person\n\nOf course not! Yoga is for everyone. So glad you found something you enjoy and that helps your joints.\n\nI hear you, OP, I often felt awkward, but as the ladies have said, I think it was just mainly being the odd one out. Annnd being raised as \"tough guy, manly man, \" I always had nagging feelings of it being a feminine thing to be doing. (which is stupid and BS, but it still took time to push pass that in my early 20's) I'm glad it's helping you, I always feel amazing after and like a whole new person when I practice consistently!\n\nbe the change you wish to see. where I am at in the world my classes are full of men.\n\nNo, I love seeing men at the yoga/pilates studio. Yoga is beneficial for all bodies and isn’t a “feminine thing” like some men make it out to be.\n\nYoga is for everyone! As long as you are being respectful and not sexualizing/judging people (which also applies to everyone) you’re welcome !\n\nThe class I go to is about 50/50. I've also been to several classes with male instructors. Sounds like it's helping, so keep going!\n\nDon’t stare at any bums and you will be fine.\n\nNo if anyone has an issue with it thats on them and is crazy. When I see men at yoga I think nothing more than \"hm stretchy man.\"\n\nI think mostly women who have maybe been through trauma with men or feel uncomfortable in their skin would feel this way in yoga(and maybe some men too) but a lot people probably don’t think about it too deeply unless you’re being creepy\n\nThere are several men who regularly practice at my studio. It's no big deal for any of the women as far as I can tell and certainly not for me!\n\nI think it’s super cool when men are in yoga class. Never annoyed!\n\nNo issues with men joining class. We have all ages and sizes in my classes. I think it is great! Everyone is usually too sweaty and caught up in their own poses to bother with anyone else.\n\nAbsolutely not. Our class is about 50:50 depending on who shows up that day.\n\nNever thought twice about any of the men who show up in class.\n\nAbsolutely not, AS LONG AS they are not being creepy. Creepy would include hitting on women in class or after class, standing too close to women, inappropriately ogling them. Just don’t be a creepy inappropriate weirdo, and I don’t mind at all"

How long did it take you to be able to do that?\n\nThank you :) it’s a hard question to answer because I didn’t particularly “train” to be able to do this pose, I just practiced consistently backbends, splits and worked a lot on opening my shoulders (which is the hardest part of this for me) until one day I was backbending in the splits and realised I could do it 😅 \n\nI’ve been doing yoga for 12 years, about 7 years into it I became more consistent with a daily practice and started being curious about exploring more depth both physically and spiritually. I took things slowly :)\n\nEveryone’s body is different so it’s hard to say how long it would take you.

Seems like a win.\n\nIf she's playing the statistics, that's the safer bet for her inbox. :)\n\nTIL…\n\nit was traumatic the day i learned😛😛\n\nSame, I never saw that one coming. So naive! 😂\n\nOh wow wtf I would never have thought of that 🤦‍♂️ that’s so wild ppl have to deal with ppl who do that\n\nBut why not socks??\n\ni can do both 🤔\n\nbut legit i was just about to leave the house and had a few moments of free time but already had my shoes on\n\nhaha no not normally but i was just doing a few poses &amp; stretches before leaving the house\n\nTry to get your hips and shoulders to both be more facing front. But I never called this mermaid so maybe we have different variations of it. \n\ni have been working on squaring my hips as well as not overarching my lower back, any additional poses you could suggest to help me get there? or just continually practicing this? i feel stuck, i’ve been at this point for years it feels like lol\n\nIve been told/read that mermaid is the variation that the body/hips are slightly turned vs king pigeon is more square and facing front. So consider that before you try to be square in mermaid!! I do a variation inbetween both 😅\n\nYou gotta stretch (and train!) your psoas/hip flexors. Push the bottom of your crescent lunge forward and come all the way over your front heel with your knee, way lower than you want to. Slowly straighten your back leg.  To train it, kneel in half crescent and square your hips, lift your front foot about four inches in the air while keeping that leg at 90°. 3 sets of 10. \n\nwhat do you call it?\n\nKing Pigeon -  Rajakapotasana\n\nA variation of, yes, but the opening of the upper body vs. a front-facing backbend reaching the head toward the foot means it's just not the same thing, hence the difference in (conventional) naming. Mermaid is what I've always heard this one called.\n\nKing pigeon is over the head, mermaid is behind it.\n\nI don’t remember at the moment and checking with my teacher. But def not mermaid. I would walk away from it and dive into other poses and see what comes up. Focusing on the one thing can be an issue.\n\nYou are in a good place currently with this pose. A lot deeper than most can comfortably get.  Some other poses to help you go further with mermaid… \n\nFor your shoulders I would reccomend Anahatasana(puppy pose) with your elbows on blocks. This will allow you to drop your chest and head further past your arms getting more opening into the shoulders. \n\nFor your quads… Anajaneyasana grabbing the back foot for a quad stretch. Or a King Arthur pose. Or reclined hero’s pose. All those will lengthen quads. \n\nBridge and wheel pose for back extension and front body opening. \n\nMake sure to do a good amount of core warm up so you can stabilize your core to control the backbend. \n\nLastly, try to add a little posterior tilt in your pelvis as you go into the back extension to keep the compression out of your lower back. \n\nYou can also ues a strap to lasso your back foot if you want to start working into king Pidgeon pose. It’s definitely a possibility based on where you are at with mermaid. \n\nBest of luck on your journey!\n\nYes !! Thank you so much! this is exactly what i needed to help me, i will work on all of all of\nthat! thank you for your encouragement and knowledge!!\n\nAlso, try to bring your front shin to it is more parallel to your shoulders, so instead of your foot being by your hip, it's 16-18\" forward. It'll amp up the stretch in your outer hip/ IT band, and give you more range of movement in your hip joint.\n\nthank you\n\n&gt; King Arthur pose\n\nHa! TIL! https://www.erinjorich.com/posture-pointers/2021/1/2/king-arthurs-pose Thanks for providing a name to something I've always just taught as quad stretch and deep backbend prep. :)\n\nI've never seen anybody doing yoga with shoes on..\n\nlol i really didn’t think that would trigger people 🤣🤣\n\nMaking a comment on something doesn't imply in any way that someone is triggered. Most over used word I've heard in a long time..\n\nlol ok geeze my apologies. anything else???\n\nHaha reddit always trippen on things posted that u dont consider … happens to me all the time!!\n\nTry clasping your hands together which may open your left shoulder more, resulting in your hips being more squared towards the front.\n\ni will try that!\n\nThis is a really beautiful pose.  How wonderful you can achieve this.  Enjoy the journey.\n\nthank you so much! i love this pose too!\n\npossibly move your front foot out from under i to our hip so you can bring your hip forward to face front, along w your torso. this may mean you can’t elbow your back foot just now.\n\nyes sometimes i pull my leg forward but then my knee sticks out more, i never know which alignment matters?\n\nknee still aligned but move foot not knee. see how that feels\n\nFlexing your inner thighs will help you straighten your back.\n\nthank you! i will give that a try!\n\nI would suggest next step would be working Eka Pada Rajakapotasana instead of mermaid variation.  Try using a strap around the foot to square both shoulders forward (it will also help to open more through the shoulders/chest and strengthen the back). There are also plenty of online tutorials on how to enter it with use of a strap.  Best of luck!\n\nOk thank you! I’ll start working on that one.\n\nMy favorite pose. Love the Vans too!🤍🤍🖤🖤\n\nthank you. skater girl at heart 🫶🫶\n\nLove the flexibility\n\nthanks! i’ve been working hard at it 😊\n\nThis may sound stupid, but try this breathing technique.  Take a deep breath filling from your tail to your upper chest.  Once you are full you are going to squeeze your bandas.  Mula, Uddyiana, and Jalandhara. Then you are going to sip in a little more air to create internal pressure. Hold it for 3 to 5 seconds.  Then let it out and breath normal while you adjust in the post to take up the slack created.  Sometimes it is a fear reflex the pressure along with the locks act as an internal massage and feedback circuit to the nervous system. And the added oxygen helps to nourish the tissues.\n\nthank you! i love adding more breathing aspects to my practice and it is definitely something I need to work on, I do sometimes get a little panicky and some poses too. I will try that! 🙏🏼 thank u\n\nWhy do you have shoes on? Your form looks like you know what you’re doing but wearing shoes says otherwise…\n\nI was just popping into a few poses before leaving the house, waiting for my kids to get ready, you know Mom life 😛😛\n\nLol. I do understand though I know dad life. 🤣too funny because it’s so real.\n\nInteresting pose. Where do you feel it the most? I can’t really get close and do the 90/90 thing\n\nRed hair and a shiny fish tail for your lower half?\n\nbetter then the shoes apparently 🥴🧜🏼‍♀️\n\nTry working on lengthening up through the torso -- think of a string on top of your head pulling you upwards&lt;3\n\nIn general... Everything is head lead body follow. It looks like your head is 'yawing' left and getting away from the ribs. This would create tension in the neck... And it looks like you can see strain in the right pectoralis to achieve this. There's a good chance you'll feel tension at the base of the spine as a result as well. \n\nNow how you deepen this pose can go one of a few ways. I prefer to think top down rather than bottom up...\n\nIf you stop worrying about facing forward, you'll probably find that this pose feel quite relaxed for you with a slightly rightward facing. If you feel the whole length of the spine saying 'heck yeah this is easier!' then you'll be able to every so slightly have the head lead you forward and see if the upper back will spiral along.\n\nIf ANYTHING pushes or pulls to achieve this then there timing of the head lead/body follow is off. Stop. Think. Feel. Slow down. Try again! 😸\n\nLooks good to me\n\nthank u 🙏🏼\n\nArch your back a little more. That’ll help your wrist situation. Deepens this be bringing your foot to more of a 90 degree angle instead of tucked up next to you. Great work!\n\nI wouldn't recommend this at all... Unless she starts to look up... Otherwise the head will be out of balance with the back and she'll get tension\n\nWow...you are gorgeous\n\nthank you so much 🙏🏼🙏🏼"

You have really great form by not hovering over your forward facing leg.\nI find getting into splits a little easier at night than early morning since your ligaments would be more warmed up walking around, doing the general day-to-day activities. Compare how you are in the morning/afternoon to at night to see if your body works similarly.\n\nAlso when you get your full splits. (Left or Right). Let me know if you need tips for oversplits.\n\nThanks I will reach out to you in future\n\nOmg what a backdrop!!\n\nI am practicing this myself and find it much easier one way! Like almost full split with right leg forward, a good 8 inches at least off ground if it's the left leg forward...\n\nHey there I am in the same boat cant do it with the left leg.

No one will care what ur wearing.\n\nYoga teacher here.\nI encourage my students to wear what ever makes them comfortable. In my class, you can wear a full on yoga outfit, or trackies and t shirt. It's all about the spiritual experience, not fashion. \nWear what you are comfortable with, don't worry about what everyone else is wearing. That's their comfort zone, you stay in yours. 🧘\n\nFull Mongolian horseback soldier regalia it is then. I'll just leave my bow and hunting eagle next to my mat.\n\nIf that makes you comfortable, then perfectly acceptable in my class.\n\nLeave the combat pony outside.\n\nSend us a video of the eagle doing yoga too! the dog videos are always popular.\n\nI'm sure it would be amazing at crow pose.\n\nI tried to, but it just lies there spread eagle\n\nSame 💜\n\nThen time to rock my mankini next time 😂\n\nBut on the other hand, it would be so great if you had that body and wore that outfit for those who might enjoy looking at you.\n\nParticularly not the males!\n\nI think you can still wear it but perhaps some more padding in the groin area for elaboration \n\nLots of men I see at yoga wear loose shorts (like soccer shorts) with tanks or tees. Doesn’t have to be tight clothing.\n\nHave a look on amazon. I believe you can order muscles from Brussels like he did.\n\nYes but the standards are different. \n\nYou will probably get comments on it / people will say it made them uncomfortable.\n\nIf a woman wears this attire no one bats an eye.\n\nSure, but we women don't usually have our genitals outside of our body. You can call it unfair, but it is what it is. I also find it unfair that men have 10 times more testosterone than we do and can build muscles so much easier, but again, it is what it is.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBreasts are not genitals.\n\nYou cannot.\n\nThat is exactly my look, but with white sunglasses.\n\nThe Kanye west ones with the bars as lenses\n\nyess all men at yoga wear this. you’ll fit right in\n\nAre you kidding?\n\nmaybe\n\nJust wear a speedo and a high end wrist watch, you’ll be good\n\nLol this is the way.\n\n😂😂😂\n\n😂😂😂😂\n\nI dunno, that pink gi in the background is pretty sweet.\n\nI personally would go for the pink karate outfit in the background.\n\nYes absolutely\n\nPerfect, no notes \n\nI had a guy in lime green/black shark print shorts (resembled swim trunks didn't pay THAT much attention) and an orange camoflage tank top last night- it made me smile.\n\nI see swim trunks fairly often on the yoga men and it makes sense in power yoga where we sweat so much.\n\nThe pants need to be tighter\n\nWear what’s comfortable for you and appropriate for class. Like a long sleeve shirt and thick leggings probably wouldn’t be great for hot yoga because you’ll be sweating so much and may overheat. Booty shorts and shirtless probably won’t work in a yin class because you’ll be too cold. Try some classes at home in this outfit first to make sure the top doesn’t uncomfortably ride up and the pants don’t roll down or bunch up. Otherwise, looks good!\n\nYoga is not about what people wear, wear that, wear pajamas, wear anything and get your practice on. :)\n\nThe color combo is not my favorite because of the fact that the top has sort of a yellow undertone and the bottoms are more purple undertone but the overall fit is fine\n\nI must be color blind because I see neither yellow or purple in this outfit\n\nOh no, we’re not doing this again.\n\nundertones refer to the warmness and coolness of colours, the top is warmer blue (closer to yellow on the colour wheel) but the bottoms are cooler blue (closer to purple on the colour wheel)\n\nTop looks icy blue and the bottoms look like blue\n\nyeah exactly, the lighter colour means it’s more green/yellow on the colour wheel\n\nAs a guy,  I'll tell you this much: \n\n\n\nThe underwear you wear is more important. Some poses require your legs to be pretty firmly together and then there's sometimes some movement or a progression.\n\n\n\nYou want \"the boys\" to be well supported and contained, but also somewhat lifted and pushed forward to keep them out of the way. I tend to wear fancy jockstraps from the gay underwear stores. They're somewhat expensive, but testicular torsion FUCKING HURTS\n\nAny jockstrap recommendations?\n\nAndrew Christian makes some good ones,  and skull and bones. It's going to depend on your body shape and size as to which ones work best for you. \n\n\n\n\nFind the underwear store in your local gayborhood and go try some on!\n\nNot jock straps, but dance belts are often recommended around the sub.\n\nBig agree though I am a big fan of the ball hammock boxer briefs personally. Had a Shinesty subscription for a year and have a nice collection. Will restart once these start wearing out more. Keeps everything nicely in place.\n\nI’d personally go with the all pink gi. Gotta let people know I’m not one to trifle with.\n\nThis comment sent me\n\nThat’s a hard, well, semi-hard, yes.\n\nOnly if you can do splits like van Damme 😂\n\nThat's the goal ig hahaha\n\nThen dress for success. Seriously, I want to be one of those hot 80’s aerobics ladies and I’m rocking the leg warmers. 80’s fitness was the best fitness.\n\nLiterally no one else cares what you wear\n\nLeggings are the optimal pant for men in yoga.\n\nKeeps dry, and has good grip against bare skin, for knee-elbow/tricep arm balances.\n\nI wouldn't wear a stringer to a yoga class though 😂 Either short sleeve, shirtless, and if you must, a full width tank.\n\nI wear men's tight yoga pants. they absorb sweat. my shirt is sewed at shoulders. it's your preference..\n\nYes\n\nIf you can rock this, you can rock anything\n\nActually ….. this is not too far off what I wear to vinyasa. Never thought of myself as a Jean Claude acolyte but I suppose it’s possible we met in the astral plane\n\nLol the only real rules are 1) no socks and 2) nothing that can get until your feet or obstruct your movement in any other way.\n\nI always wear socks and I’ve never been told not to. I even wear them at hot yoga\n\n🧐 I strongly recommend taking them off. You don't have the ability to engage your full oot correctly through the socks. Less grip etc. It is both about your own safety but also the quality of your practice.\n\nI’ll try it today. It is interesting no one has ever told me this but I mainly practice Kripalu.\n\nNice! What you should notice is that you have a lot more stability and that you can press strongly I to the ground. You should be able to feel and engage your pada bandha.. As you press into your feet, you'll feel more resistance, and you'll feel your leg muscles engage more powerfully. Let me know how it goes!\n\nThanks :-) I will.\n\nI’ll keep it up for the week. Time to pay more attention to how my feet look lol (I’m a guy and a laborer so they get beat up)\n\nNo one cares what you wear as long as you’re not naked. Just wear what you can move in.\n\nI like yoga pants from willit. And I like to wear tank tops in the summer. Winter I also wear yoga pants from willit and some light weight merino wool shirts to keep warm and easy to pull off if too warm.\n\nI have been doing yoga for more than 4 years have not seen this outfit before… men usually go with what’s comfortable such as shorts, t shirts, joggers etc… you should wear whatever YOU feel comfortable in rather than what you think looks good 👍🏻\n\nUpvote just for JCVD. 😍\n\nThis is a silly post and people responding as if he’s serious. \n\nBut the answer is no\n\n&gt; But the answer is no\n\nIt's perfectly fine to wear. It's similar to what a lot of yogi wear in the West.\n\nWest of where\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world\n\nWhy... Why did I click that link, I knew what you meant lol.\n\nI was honestly a bit surprised lezboss didn't understand what I meant\n\nSo bc many men wear these shorts, according to your source of you, that means it must be appropriate?\n\nIt's appropriate yes. If you can't handle a man's curves **under** his clothes then maybe stay home lol\n\nThis response is exactly the issue. “Behold my dick! Or stay at home” so I guess I turn my car around bc a man wants me to\n\nWe are able to handle breasts in our presence, you can’t handle being in the presence of dicks? \n\nDo we need to tape it down for your approval? \n\nThat’s absurd.\n\nNo, you turn your car around because you want to prevent some people from wearing tight pants just because they have a different anatomy.\n\nOk\n\nSaid literally no one.\n\nTruthfully I don’t care about your answer, of debating this. You’re gonna let your dick walk you around regardless.\n\nIt’s always in front, nothing we can do about that.\n\nEast\n\nI am serious tho, i like the outfit\n\nEntering a largely women’s space with your crotch hanging out? You gonna remove your shirt as well? So fucking dense dude. Get a better outfit and save this one for your kink nights.\n\nMen are not allowed to wear tights at yoga class?  Looks like the crotch isn't hanging out. It's concealed behind the tights.  Form fitting clothing offers many benefits in yoga. Seems strange that you would say this article of clothing is not for men.\n\nIn zero context, it’s fine. And I want it also to be fine in the context of a VERY! vulnerable and female dominated space. \n\nBut to be mindful in class, it really isn’t a wise. Women can cover their butt cheeks; men can cover their genitals. It’s the space which demands you consider your surroundings. If it were Bikram, this outfit would be overdressed.  \n\nThere’s no debate about the chest, one is sexualized one is not. Women can’t be topless, men can. So a sports bra being debated as similarly unmindful as these bottoms is out of line. Won’t have it here. \n\nLastly, if this fellow wants to wear it he can. But he ought to develop a practice before, and make his presence known before he walks in with his dick leading the way\n\nDays when I feel very vulnerable I just practice at home instead of expecting others to conform to MY standards.\n\nI don’t pay these people mind in person but here we are saying how we feel.\n\nImagine that, a camel toe gatekeeping a moose knuckle.\n\nSorry what?\n\nWhat’s your issue?\n\nStop being misandrist\n\nCan’t stop won’t stop \n\n/s\n\nYikes, this kind of toxic shit is why the average man's mental health is in the toilet. Wear some basic athletic attire and somehow you're accused of being a sex predator. \n\nLiterally what is the difference between this sentiment and shaming women for tight clothing?\n\nAnti sex progressives sound exactly the same as conservatives half the time. Everything about the human body is made out to be sexual. Weaponized shame.\n\nI thought yoga pants weren't that revealing\n\nHow much of that is tuck and how much of that is just a weird shadow on his lower abdomen?\n\nWhat are you referring to?\n\nWhatever it's happening in his pants\n\nI think he got semi hard in this scene lol it was flatter in other scenes\n\nYou call that semi hard?\n\nLet's give him the benefit of the doubt lol\n\nFWIW, in general the semi-official guidelines I’ve seen in yoga classes are to wear clothes that cover your inseam down to a certain length (which these bottoms do) and to cover the shoulders (which this top does not). The idea behind the guidelines at that particular studio was to allow teachers to give hands-on assists without touching a student’s skin. If your studio’s culture isn’t assist-oriented, the expectation around clothing may be different. You might choose to wear something with a little more coverage the first few visits to a new studio to get a feel for how things work there and how comfortable you feel in your practice. You might find that you feel more comfortable in this amount of coverage, or in slightly more.\n\nYes please\n\nI’m a guy and I wear regular sized Lulu yoga shorts and no top at my hot yoga studio. Loose fitting shirts always fall “down” when I’m in downward dog and tighter shirts keep too much heat in. As others suggested, just wear what you’re comfortable with.\n\nRunners shorts and a headband. I wore a shirt when I first started, but it was usually drenched in the first 10 minutes so now I go without.\n\nI mean of you look like SCVD than yea, but if not probably wear sweatpants.\n\nIf you're JCVD you can wear whatever you want and nobody will make fun of you.\n\nSrsly tho - that totally looks like a women's top. \n\nI'd wear a baggy t-shirt, bike shorts to hide my junk and then loose shorts over top\n\nI’d go shirtless if you’re comfortable. No wasted sweaty shirts!\n\nYeah but lose the chubby\n\nThe what?\n\nThe semi-erection, as it's referred to in medical nomenclature\n\nAh, yeah this was maybe the wrong scene to post a pic of, he didn't have a semi in the other scenes\n\nOr maybe this is as the beast appears in its natural and relaxed state, who can say\n\nStep 1 is look Like JCVD. Once we are there you can just go to target and pick a top and bottom and just go.\n\nYes, in 1985\n\nYou mean the pink PJs in the back? Totally!\n\nLive your life ✌🏼\n\ni do yoga in tanktops, it don't with leggings tho\n\nI don't know why they named a skin tight track pants after yoga. Yoga is always done in loose and cotton clothing so that one can sit without getting bothered of tightness of clothing, neutral &amp; unaffected by static charges from earth or air. Fashion searches business opportunities everywhere. The West is ruining the definitions without knowledge. Proper knowledge is important. Yoga is a concept of getting more and more knowledge about one's inner conscience and finding true purpose of the soul on this earth. Yoga is completely different from what's suggested in the name of yoga in the Western World. The one who is interested in the truth of what Yoga actually is, must read Bhagawad Geeta,  True meanings Yoga, Dharma and Karma। Those who will read Bhagwad Geeta, will never buy Those tight pants.\n\nYou’re obviously talking about the pink gi. You would rock it I’m sure!\n\nLook at that unit\n\nSomething that doesn’t show your butt crack when you’re in different positions. Can’t go wrong with harem pants or bike shorts\n\nJon Claude was one of those hot guys who looked terrible in clothes.\n\nIs this photo mirrored, or are all those dudes in the back wearing their *gi* jackets incorrectly?\n\nBehind him are mirrors i think\n\nMasc-presenting people at my studio usually wear a short-sleeve running top and some loose shorts that hit above the knee, but as long as you're comfy and you can move your body fully without anything slipping out, you're good to wear whatever.\n\nHalf the guys in my yoga class take their shirt off during the class. But wear what makes you comfortable.\n\nAs a participant. I don’t want to be distracted by men’s junk. I know it’s totally sexist and not pc. I don’t want to be distracted in yoga when I’m trying to focus\n\nWhat suggestion are you making about how men should dress for yoga classes?\n\nNo leggings and or tight fitting pants?\n\nThat’s one hundred percent YOUR problem.\n\nAbsolutely, fault is all mine.\n\nBut you need to wear tight clothes to see what’s going on? I do ballet and we see *way* more dong in the studio than is shown here. Why would it even be distracting? Focus on yourself and don’t be a creep.\n\nAbsolutely, fault is all mine.\n\nJust because it's there doesn't mean you have to stare.\n\nI agree!  Fault is all mine.\n\nStill??!? It never was\n\nReally? Thought he looks cool tho prolly just me\n\nLike someone said above I would strongly suggest developing a practice a bit before walking in like your practice is more important than others. \n\nPersonally I wouldn’t feel appropriate dressed like this, and I look great and am confident, but that’s just me.\n\nYou do you.\n\nYes. You'd be slaying the yoga class.\n\nI think that unless you plan to go to a, uh, *bath house* afterwards, you might fit in better with a more traditional men’s tank top. Think Tony Horton\n\nI've been doing yoga for about 6 months now, steady everyday for about 2 months and I struggle with the balance poses like the tree pose or warrior three and I'm just asked tips on how to be able to stand in that pose and balance myself. I'm good for about 15 to 20 seconds but it's supposed to be for a 1:05 on this app I'm using.\n\n[removed]"

We tried two different scales because we couldn’t believe it. \n\nThis is all because of yoga.

    "all_comment_text": "My feet grew at 50!   :-(\n\nI think the condition of my spine has got me up at least 1/2\".  I used to be about 6'5\" on the nose.  Started yoga about 47 and now I'm closer to 6'6\" than 6'5\"\n\nSo cool! Who knew we could grow vertically at our ages?\n\nThat’s amazing! Yoga can really make a difference in posture and flexibility. It’s inspiring to hear about your growth—literally! What other benefits have you noticed from your practice?\n\nThe biggest thing is my back. I started Yoga at about 47 due to unreal back pain.  I’d be unable to walk for a week at a time 2-3 times a year and it was a constant issue.  At about 51 i finally got an MRI even though i was feeling better.   Turns out i have one herniated and two bulging discs.  The doc tested my mobility and asked about my lifestyle (lots of golf and way fewer really bad episodes) he said the MRI looks really bad but he recommended  i keep doing what im doing rather than surgery.   Now I’m 56 and i haven’t had a bad episode in a few years.  Super stiff every morning but that’s about it. I usually practice in the morning (hot yoga) and usually feel fine the rest of the day. I don’t care about growing other than i presume my posture is better\n\nI'm a tad younger and have the same story.  I went to an upper cervical chiropractor, and it was miraculous.  They only manipulate the atlas, which is the top part of the spine.  If it is off by even the slightest, it can affect you in multiple ways.  My lower back would be so bad my wife would have to help me off the couch.  Regular chiropractors made me feel worse sometimes.\n\nMy feet too! My toes spread out and lengthened noticeably from practicing.\n\nThe feet growing sucked. Went from a 13 to a 14.  Probably a dozen pairs odd shoes had to be donated.  And 14s are much harder to find.  The happy back is another story though.  Couldn’t be more grateful to yoga over that\n\nThat's funny. I'm a lady with tiny feet. It was harder for me to find shoes before lol it's hard to find steel toes or heels in basically children's sizes\n\nWhat am I doing wrong I’m 43 and shrinking. Used to be solid 6’2” now I’m like 6’1.25”\n\nCheck for ostheoporosis, you can shrink for almost 4” because of it. Do a bone density scan. My mom is a lot shorter now because of it.\n\nAlso osteoarthritis in the spine. It's degenerative which means that the disks are disappearing.\n\nI'm about to start doing yoga like crazy now lol\n\nRight??\n\nI grew 2\" with yoga. Nice to finally get to 6'.\n\nSame thing happened to me after starting yoga. People I saw infrequently kept telling me I looked taller and when I measured I was indeed almost 2” taller than I’ve measured previously as an adult\n\nWhat an unexpected benefit!\n\nI started yoga in my twenties and at that point I was 5 ft 4 in. By the time I was in my early 50s I was 5 ft 5 in. I have known several people who have successfully straightened out some sciatica through yoga.\n\nI’m taller as well I started a while ago and I’m so very grateful for the practice.  It has changed my life.\n\nWait this is so crazy 😂 I've also been 5ft 3/4 inch since I was 12 years old and never thought to remeasure my height. I'm so intrigued.\n\nGo measure and report back!\n\nSame 😅😅\n\nI have been 5’4” since high school and have been practicing 20 years. Yoga has improved my posture but I am still not 5’5.\n\nWhen tissue relaxes or uncramps, height is added. It also works the other way\n\nAnother one here. \n\n\nWas just under 5'10\" all the way up til 24, started my practice around that time and, 12 years later, I'm just over 5'11\". It's always made me wonder how compressed the spines are in the majority of people who don't put much focus into stretching/hanging/decompression as a part of their fitness.\n\nabsolutely. Have a pull up bar installed at home and just hanging/ swinging feels amazing. I'd put a whole monkey bar installation like we had as a kid if i had the space lol.\n\nSeriously, congratulations! That is a massive achievement. Adjusting your body like that is hard work that should be celebrated!\n\nThank you! ❤️\n\nIt is hard work and takes massive amount of discipline. It’s heartwarming to hear these stories. Congratulations to everyone.\n\nThat is mind blowing!\n\nI always feel somewhat taller when walking out of yoga. Good for you!\n\nMe over here at 5'2 with some posture issues like 🤔 just curious, how often do you practice in a typical week?\n\nHot yoga (power flow) about 3-4x/week.\n\nThat's wild! And very cool. I saw my mom a few weeks back and she said I look taller. I went home and measured myself 😅 however, I did not grow. I've only been practicing very regularly for about 3-4 months, though.\n\nExcellent! Years ago, my neighbor’s mom told me she grew an inch in height from regular yoga. She was probably in her mid-40’s at the time.\n\nHoly hell what?? I can't believe there's so many people here that have also grown, that is so cool\n\nYou gotta measure yourself! It’s wild.\n\nWait, you’re saying you grew 4 &amp; 1/4 inches??\n\nI don’t doubt that yoga can improve your posture but I’m doubtful that it actually made you grow taller.\n\nI have to presume they meant they grew 1\" or 2\" from 5'3\" or 5'4\" to 5'5\"...not 4.25\" from 5'3/4\"...in 1.5 years.\n\nThat would make more sense. Confusing how they worded it.\n\nYea, I'll never say anything's impossible...but my impression was that typically you could gain, or regain, up to about an inch or so with spinal restoration...but not 4\"...and certainly not that within just 1.5 yrs.\n\nOmggggg I screwed up!! It was 5’3” (and 3/4) and grew to 5’5”. So I grew 1.25in.\n\nno, 1.25 inches\n\nShe said 5 ft 3/4 of an inch. That’s 5ft and .75 of an inch. \n\nIf it was 1.25 inches she would have started at 5ft 3.75 inches.\n\nShe meant 3-4 inches.  A second look at the post would make that clear\n\nThe after was 5ft, 5 inches so that isn't right.\n\nWhat is wrong about it?\n\nThat would mean she grew over 4 inches. She's stating she grew 1-2 inches I believe. 4 inches would be nuts.\n\nYes, I agree.\n\nBetter posture is how I understood it (not literally physically growing taller). A lot of people have awful posture and “grow” when they actually stand up tall. Personally my head has more practice being in tech neck position and I’m “taller” when I remember to hold my head better.\n\nI’ve heard this could potentially happen from yoga. I just started and thought it was just a myth but that’s interesting. Hopefully I can benefit from the same result along with many more 💯\n\nThat's great! Gives me hope!\n\nwow!!!\n\nYou mean you grew from 5'3\" or 5'4\" to 5'5\" in just 1.5 years?  Wow, that's amazing!  I've actually been growing more curious about that too and just started charting my height yesterday...as I have a hunch I may regrow some as well due primarily to the spinal regeneration.\n\nI’d heard yoga, in particular spinal twists can make you taller. Interesting to hear it’s true!\n\nMe too, and I thank you so much for sharing because I thought I was just ego tripping the feeling that I got taller\n\nI go to a chiropractor every week and I’m now one inch taller.\n\nNow I'm curious... I am 39, and 5'4\". I've lost 2\" in the past 20 years. 14yrs ago I got a back injury and have DDD. If I were to do yoga, I wonder if I could regain my lost height?\n\nThis is incredible! I grew a quarter of an inch from practicing the last 5 years,.. I’d love to lengthen my spine even more 🙏🏼 my arms have definitely lengthen though. The mat used to be bigger than me and now when I’m almost as big as it!\n\nFr? Because I’m 5’ and 3/4” and have never grown. Just did ballet. Did yoga. Nothing. Wtf\n\nCome to think about it, I think I'm closer to 5'7 at 50 than 5'6 which I thought was my fully developed height. I needed some positive news today!\n\nWow! You are talking over FOUR INCHES!! Had you ever been diagnosed with scoliosis? That’s very amazing!! I bet you’re glad! How many years did it take to notice it!?\n\nI grew an inch doing yoga too.\n\nYou should try wall yoga if they have it near you.  The inversions will for sure stretch you out.\n\nI grew too. I grew an entire inch. in addition to that my feet and hands spread too. my hand used to be kinda small but now it's almost as big as my husband's. Even though my feet spread it didn't Change my shoe size.\n\nwas your posture not ideal before? even if it wasn't bad, maybe you had some kinks still?\n\nWow this is great! Thanks for sharing 🙏🏻❤️"

I just stick to the basic principles when combining techniques that I do, for example:\n- active breathing and after breath holding - this could be Uddiyana bandha or breath holding after inhalation. It is important to do breath holding after kapalabhati or bhastrika.\n\nSo, you can start with: kapalabhati 30 seconds - breath hold - bhastrika 10 times - Uddiyana bandha + Nauli 6-12.\n\nI’m thinking about to do free course to share some of experience.

    "all_comment_text": "Many yoga poses resemble poses dogs and cats normally do when they are relaxed, interested in play and socialization. Down Dog resembles, for example, what they call a \"play bow\" in dogs. Cats who are calm and relaxed will stretch in a very similar way.\n\nIn other words, when you get out your yoga mat, you look like a cat rolling around on the floor looking for attention.\n\nMy cat always goes under the bridge when I do downward dog. He feels quite fancy while doing it lol\n\nMy cat does that too, and she eats my blocks hahaha, but otherwise I really appreciate her presence.\n\nMy cat joins to scratch my matt 😅\n\nSame! I took an old mat and cut cat sized mats to put out next to mine so the kitties can scratch and stretch on their own mats\n\nOh that's so cool!!\n\nSame, my mat is full of scratches and when he is bored in the middle of the night he plays and moves the mat around my room \n\nJust for reference, my mat isn't small or thin, it is just that my cat is unusually big for a house cat (not fat, BIG and long)\n\nI left my mat outside ONCE overnight, put it on the table to dry it and my cats managed to find it and fuck it up :D\n\nSame!  There are nibbles out of my blocks. Lol\n\nHaha, my blocks also have tiny teef marks in them.\n\nGet a real tiny mat for her and she’ll probably use it along side you. Cats like to mirror behavior as a social interaction. I’ve seen prayer mats for cats in muslim households and tiny keyboards to put along side your actual keyboard so your cat can “partake” in the activity\n\nMy wife cut a quarter of an old mat, and our cat Lola definitely knows it’s hers. She’s loves it!\n\nMy cat has her tiny desk bed and I have my chair. I still usually have to put on Finding Nemo for her to leave me alone though\n\nThose Muslim cat videos have me dying. They're so cute and definitely think a cat would also enjoy their own yoga mat.\n\nI need to do this 🥰\n\nOne of my cats always does a \"big stretch\" when I do puppy pose, it's hilarious, it looks like he is in puppy pose too! Not as into cat pose unfortunately\n\nWhat's cat pose? Sit on your butt with one leg in the air and your head in your crotch?\n\nThis is more accurate lol\n\nOMG. That about choked me. LOLOL I scared my smaller lap cat.   \n\nGoals. LOL\n\n[deleted]\n\nStop it that is the sweetest picture 😍😭\n\nAwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\nMy cat does it too! She loves to join me on my mat and just chills there for a while, or rubs her face against my arms and legs.\n\nOne of mine almost always joins me when I roll out the mat. She chirps and meows and knows it’s time for yoga. She has a real fondness for my sweaty armpits and decides the best time to try and nuzzle and bury her snout in them is during child’s pose, but sometimes makes it interesting and decides to flop right down in the middle of mat during flying lizard. She keeps me on my toes.\n\nOh man, one time I mowed the lawn, and my sweaty armpit was the greatest thing to my cat. I was like what is going on here. 😂\n\nWhen they sniff you and then do that slight open mouth breathing to really get the scent.  Of course it looks like they are disgusted, but that’s not true. \n\nIt’s our pheromones.  Helps them know you are one of the family.\n\nThe stinky face cracks me up. That time, I laid on the couch for about 15 minutes after mowing to catch my breath before showering. And my cat kept rubbing her head in my armpit. 😂\n\nI’ve got a sweaty armpit-loving cat as well; she loves to get a little taste lol\n\nMy cat always loves stretching with us and seems to recognize when we are on a mat for such a purpose. Whenever I watch a Yoga with Adrienne video, by the time she mentions her dog Benji, my cat usually joins right about then too. I do somewhat believe it’s an energy thing and that the temptation of you setting out a mat and sitting on it to do something special is too much for a cat or dog to ignore.\n\nDefinitely- cats will sit on The Thing because it’s different than the floor all the time. Fallen printer paper, paper towel, regular towel, the throw at the foot of the bed, etc.    \n\n\n\nThey must go “OOH, it’s sitting on rectangles time! I’m so glad my human likes doing this too!”\n\nMy cat does this too. I think she likes that I’m more on her level a lot of the time\n\nMine often lies down next to my mat and takes a nap. I have to be careful how I move!\n\nOh! Here's one. As soon as I get to matsyasana with full padmasana, my dog plops right next to my face and starts licking her leg. 😂\n\nSame!  My cat LOVES yoga time!  He weaves around me while I’m in various poses and head butts me when I’m in supine poses.\n\nIf I'm ever in down dog or plank, my kitty runs underneath me multiple times. The one time she even slept on the top corner of my mat, so I had to do my routine around her. It brings me such joy to have them join for a session :)\n\nMy cats recognize savasana and park their little heads next to my hands for pets.  I used to think they actually knew the word but I've realized they actually recognize the music cue and come running when the music gets really mellow.\n\nMy cat just likes to stand directly under me when I'm trying to transition from plank to chaturanga\n\nMy dog is always behind me when I'm about to attempt to jump back to chatarunga or extend my leg for spinal balance, he wants to help 😅\n\nThe second you get on all 4s, the animals are down to clown\n\nMy dog gets mad when I do yoga for some reason and starts barking at me and nipping my feet. I have to go in a different room and shut the door to do any yoga at home 😂\n\nMy dog used to have quite the tantrum when I first started yoga. It is crime to lay on the floor! He would bark and stomp. Now he usually just tries to take over the mat. I often find myself doing yoga next to my own mat. I tired giving him his own mat, he just wants which ever one I’m using. Haha.\n\nMy cat likes to play-bite me when I’m doing yoga so sometimes there isn’t an option for me to do yoga at home :/\n\nYes, mine gets bitey too, nothing too hard but definitely disruptive. For this reason I do my yoga when he’s napping\n\nYeah one of my cats (Yes only one out of 3) comes to snuggle as soon as the matt is down.\n\nHe loves passing under me during downdog and cat/cow etc. The other day, he did the same to my best friend whom I was giving prenatal class :)\n\nI gave my dog something like a mat and he loved to hang out on it and watch me do yoga. I recommend you give your pets their own space right beside you. Such great activity buddies! 💗\n\nI keep trying to get my dog to do yoga since she already does a stretch like it. Most of the time she sits right on the mat where I need to be and stares at me like I’m neglecting her 😂 (she also does this if I open a pack of cheese or don’t pet her 24/7, she leads a hard life lol).\n\nSometimes my dog interrupts my savasana, sometimes she joins. 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nOh yes, both my girls are very interested in what I’m doing. It’s very cute until one of them lies down in the middle of the mat lol\n\nboth of them, every time\n\nI have a cat at my house and one at my dads (where I work out due to a basement gym) and both always like to join in when I’m doing some yoga\n\nMy cats and little dogs do too. It’s so cute\n\nMy dog also joins immediately when I start with yoga and it makes it 10000 times harder because she tries to sit on my lap or cuddle with me lol\n\nI have to put out another mat for my dog she’ll curl up and sleep on it while I do yoga and sometimes try to do stuff with me\n\nI have a cat that doesn't really like me. But when I meditate she always comes. So I always wait  5 min before I really start to open the door for her. She then just sits with me\n\nOne of my girls is my faithful yoga companion. The other is my faithful nap time companion.\n\nI wish I could say that about my cat but he rubs against me and knocks me over, rolls onto his back at just the spot I was going to put my hands on downward dog.  If in the floor he flops down on a leg or tries to get in my lap.   He’s a big persistent boy and won’t take no for an answer.  I try to do my yoga when he’s asleep. LOL.\n\nEvery time lol I have several so they surround me\n\nMy cat shows up sometimes to snuggle in my elbow during shavasana and I melt every time.\n\nOne of my dudes love to join in too! We’re attached at the hip and he always wants to be close to me no matter what I’m doing. He also gets worried if I’m on the floor - if I pretend to fall down he comes running to check on me, so when I’m doing any floor poses I have to make sure he knows that I’m OK. \n\nI also think that he just likes to lay on the mat, so I’m planning on getting them their own.\n\nMy cat and I do yoga every day for the past two years! He likes belly rubs between poses lol. He lays beside my mat and head butts me in chatarunga. When I taught yoga online during Covid he was the guest star of every class so everyone else started bringing their pets to virtual yoga. 🩶🐈‍⬛💕🕉️🙏🏻\n\ntwo of my cats love hanging out on my mat while i'm practicing. one loves attacking the mat and sometimes me lol but the other i think just loves laying on the mat. i try to just practice around him\n\nYes, I think it is my calm and relaxing energy, they also come when it’s time for me to meditate\n\nI just has a nice little session on my mat with one of my cats. She loves yoga ❤️\n\nMy cat always runs over when I get on the floor for whatever reason, and always gets involved when I'm doing cat/cow or downward dog. I like the suggestion to put a little piece of mat out for him next to me so I can get through my flow without fear of squishing him lol\n\nMy kitties all always join me! They either lounge around while I do my flow or they crawl all over/under me during my poses lol they always have to be involved\n\nMy cat lays on my mat when I do chaturanga. Guess how long I can keep plank 🤣\n\nMy cat loves yoga. \n\n\nWhen I plank he jumps on my back and \"falls asleep\" and acts super put out when I come down and \"wake him up\"\n\nSpeaking as both a yoga teacher and a cat sitter: you’re on the floor and they want your attention 😹\n\nYes!! Except she claws my mat when she stretches. I use a cheaper mat at home because of her.\n\nMy cat sits on the couch and watch when I am doing my pilates session\\^\\^\n\nMine enjoys taking part and I enjoy spending time with them, but often they curl up in an inconvenient spot.\n\nMy cat gets very excited when I roll out my yoga mat and immediately sits in the middle of it.  She really likes to climb into my lap in sukhasana or on top of me during savasana and it makes me laugh every time.  She really thinks she is doing yoga too.  \n\nShe does sometimes claw my mat so I just bought her a kids yoga mat that I will roll out with mine when I practice to see if she enjoys having her own mat.  \n\nCats.  They really are the sweetest things.\n\nThis is probably the only way I would consistently do yoga.... I probably should get a cat."
