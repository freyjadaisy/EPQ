    "body": "Hello! Many of you have been discussing this, but now it's official. Matthew Choi, a running influencer from Austin, Texas, who finished the New York City Marathon on November 3 in 2:57:15, has been disqualified from the event after he ran much of the course with two people alongside him riding on electric bicycles and filming his race.\n\n\nhttps://www.runnersworld.com/news/a62810736/matt-choi-dq-nyc-marathon/",

    "all_comment_text": "Runna has also dropped him as brand ambassador: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RunNYC/comments/1gk7jtq/runna\\_has\\_terminated\\_their\\_relationship\\_with\\_matt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunNYC/comments/1gk7jtq/runna_has_terminated_their_relationship_with_matt/)\n\nI think that's actually more meaningful than being disqualified from the race.\n\nEspecially considering he ran with the CEO, didn't he??\n\nI read their co-founder ran with him near the end but they are now doing damage control about \"not knowing about the bike\" etc. etc. Regardless, I do give them some credit for dropping him so quickly.\n\nNah not near the end he actually paced him from runna's ceos own statement\n\nco founder\\*\n\nTough to believe that they didn’t know about the Houston Marathon fiasco. That got some decent media traction.\n\nRight. Although that one didn't seem to be quite the potential PR disaster this one is...so cutting their losses I suppose.\n\nThat's actually not true. He said he knew about the bikes, but thought that NYRR had approved it, since the crew was wearing high vis vests, etc. (and probably assumed that no one would so brazenly break the rules at a world major)\n\nThat's how people get away with trespassing etc, just pretend they belong, it's a solid technique.\n\nThis guy trespasses\n\nNah he didn't even have a clipboard. Rookie mistake\n\nA ladder is the real secret sauce \n\nhttps://youtu.be/NiEMcjSQOzg?si=U2iRjkNqJB-TDBcH\n\nIts 2024 replace the clip board with an iPad and use to take pictures like your doing something meaningful\n\nA hardhat adds a nice touch!\n\nIt would be a career suicide if they decide to keep selfish acts to represent their brand\n\nThe co-founder paced him, he’s the one who made the comment in the linked post above\n\nThis is the big problem of modern marketing. A lot of your \"Ambassadors\" are rogue influencers who do not follow instructions. Usually because they don't want to be working under anyone so one of their big clauses of contracts is \"you're paying for my authenticity and my time so you need to let me be me\". Turns out, influencers being authentic is a PR disaster over and over again.\n\nI think you’re overestimating the level of oversight and micromanagement the brands are interested in putting into most of these deals. They’re just as happy for it to require zero effort, and just cut them loose if something goes wrong \n\nAt least in my experience this isn’t true. At least for any halfway serious/big company. Where I work we do some comms consulting and I’ve seen vetting we have down for brand partners. It can get extremely extensive. Possible they don’t do that here, but some of the dossiers we’ve put together are *thorough*\n\nWhen I worked at a bank, this was the case. However, outside of banking, its definitely been more rogue \"spray and pray\" microinfluencers who can do whatever they fuck they want with their contractually agreed on number of posts.\n\nProbably because the Venn diagram of “influencers” and “narcissistic assholes” is almost a perfect circle.\n\nHe says in the comment that he thought the guys on ebikes had permission to be there. I'm not sure I buy that.\n\nIf you’ve run races there are a bunch of rules. It’s hard to believe he didn’t understand that a huge road races with thousands of people doesn’t want e-bikes in the race course with the runners.\n\nNot saying its a valid excuse but there's plenty of bikes and cars and motorcycles on the course covering the event. Granted thats pretty much only for the elites and for TV coverage.\n\nThe tv coverage is for the elites who are ahead of everyone so they don’t get in the way of all the regular runners. It’s completely different.\n\nWe’re in the era of “do what you want, apologize after”.  Glad the excuse of “oops I didn’t know tee hee” is being treated properly.\n\nI can see a situation where they were not aware. The Runna guy probably had a laundry list of tasks to do around the race. It sounds like they had put a lot of planning into the event and making sure they could film properly. So they probably assumed that everyone else would do the same. I could see in the moment just not thinking you needed to ask questions and making an assumption.\n\nFor me, that's not a plausible excuse. No major race is going to permit someone on electric scooter to ride in the middle of the pack filming. It would be a huge liability issue for them. What happens when one of the scooters crashes and takes out a runner?\n\nThis is just so obviously a thing that would not be allowed.\n\nThat’s hilarious because they commented “👏🏻” on his latest post 😂\n\nwow!!\n\nInfluencer culture is a plague. Stuff like this is a step in the right direction.\n\nI can't believe there's such a thing as a running influencer.\n\nI got my sister into running, by saying \"you should run some races with me.\" I like to consider myself a running influencer.\n\nI was influenced to start running my by friend twelve years ago 🤣\n\nNow you just gotta scale\n\nHe’s just gonna run with someone else’s bib. I just reported a Chicago runner this year running with his 2022 bib. Absurd\n\nHe actually did that in Houston last year I think lmao.\n\nI think having to go a few rounds with Tyson is another good “opportunity” for influencers.  Don’t love the extra publicity, but gonna be fun watching the beating…\n\nRunning is one of the few sports I still have faith in because of how responsive the sport has been pushing back on this kind of behavior.\n\nHe bandited a friends bib at Houston Marathon and BQed for him… and Houston Marathon did nothing about it (which is far worse than than this)\n\nThey banned him from the race for two years.\n\nThere were threads about him doing this stuff like 6 months ago, so I don't know if I'd say they've been great in their response. I'm glad they finally did something, but it shouldn't have gone on this long.\n\nNYRR did the right thing. I’m hopeful other race organizers and sponsors take note of this to prevent this type of selfish behaviour.\n\nFor those out of the loop, this guy already came under controversy for using someone else’s bib at the Houston marathon (after which he apologized), and then did something similar with his camera guys on bikes during the Brooklyn Half. \n\nThese people do not deserve attention.\n\nI saw them filming during the Brooklyn Half and I was pretty confused why there was a guy riding an e-bike on the course. I assumed he was doing NYRR socials or something official (he was wearing a reflective vest), but it was kind of distracting. \n\nSeeing all this news, it dawned on me it was the same guy. I'm glad NYRR came down harshly. You have to set an example for these people. Plenty of \"influencers\" film \"content\" without violating the rules of the race. Hell, multiple Olympians were in the field and they didn't have film crews breaking rules - why did some slightly above average running influencer think he could do this?\n\n[removed]\n\nHe had a camera crew of six at HardRock and alot of people complained about the crowding at the tents.\n\nHe did it during the NYCRuns BK Half as well. It was really annoying to be around his pace and have to deal with it.\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment of your comment, a 20-29 year old male running a 2:57 puts him in the 98th percentile of finishing times according to RunRepeat. Hardly \"slightly above average.\" Just sayin...\n\nFair, but I had to get a dig in lol\n\nNon-olympian works too\n\nNon-olympians run 2:20. 2:57 is a galaxy away.\n\nMy rule is: “if your finish time isn’t a full two hours faster than mine, you are only slightly above average.” This guy just barely misses that mark, so, I agree with the original post.  \n\n😉\n\nI hope they also crack down on people having their family/friends walk/jog for half a mile. I get it, you need that mental boost, but so do 50,000 other runners. It just doesn't scale.\n\nThere’s this smaller YouTuber who, for the last three years of a particular large HM event, stops in the last 200m finishing funnel to help his kids over the advertising hoardings to run across the line with him. People seem to think it’s adorable, but can you imagine if everyone did that? “Doesn’t scale” is absolutely correct. Other runners even had to stop suddenly last year to avoid one of the kids meandering, so it’s not like it isn’t already affecting other people’s races. Fucking ugh. I’ve never had the heart to comment because I’ll get shot down for being a miserable bastard. Which I am.\n\nThis should definitely be a DQ. Shaming on the result page would hurt most runners.\n\nGive us names, ya miserable bastard!\n\nRunning with Stephen, his annual Great Scottish Run videos ‘22, ‘23 and ‘24. He might do it in other races but those are ones I’ve observed with a countenance resembling that of a miserable bastard.\n\nFinish line hogs really irk me. Just dominating the entire finish line taking photos with their families while the runners behind them get skunked on their photo opp. \n\nthere's no pictures of me crossing finish line at Chicago marathon because guy in front of me pulled out a huge French flag and I'm behind it in all the pics. I kept trying to move around but he kept swerving randomly same direction as me. asshole.\n\nif it's any consolation, I've never seen a picture of myself crossing the finish line of a race that I'd ever want to share with anyone.\n\nNot even the one where you are waving a huge French flag?\n\nNot for me, I'm bulldozing through. I've bumped people who stop short for water without pulling over too, if they don't care I don't either\n\n&gt;but so do 50,000 other runners. It just doesn't scale.\n\nWell, they don't want it for 50,000 people.  They want it for themselves.  Duh!\n\nI find Ironman do their finish lines the best. Cordoned off chute, line and recovery area before your friends/family can get to you.\n\nThe big running races should be similar.\n\nI just don’t know why people follow him? Actually I don’t know why people follow anyone, I just don’t get the appeal of it.\n\nOne of many clips of just how dangerous and why these are banned [the ebikes in question during the race](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2VgJWEpCGNWtPkar6)\n\nFor those wondering why they weren't removed; It's more dangerous in the midst of 50,000 runners to pull them directly off the course in the middle of the race also majority of the people working the course aren't aware of the rules as they're every day people who volunteered. \n\nTherefore only those who knew the rules and worked within TCS Marathon could've pulled them off course. There were even off duty officers working as security there who questioned if they should be allowed on course.\n\nHe and his team knew ebikes weren't allowed before applying for the credentials to film and he also knew they could be used to pace anyone to the time desired as a secondary reason for them being banned. The ebikes being banned is quite readable, easy to understand and pretty well stated when you apply for credentials.  \n\nClipping runners (during the race 7 runners complained they were bumped into or out right clipped) forcing people to run around them this is one of the countless reasons they're banned as well.  Friendly or not he knew the rules and ignored them. \n\nThat's all that matters here. Don't break rules, Don't get into trouble.\n\nAs a non frequenter of this sub this makes sense now. At first I was like this seems like a slight overreaction to someone trying to film content that may be technically against the rules\n\nGlad they banned him! Do you know if they were also supporting him otherwise? Hydration and/or nutrition?\n\n&gt; Do you know if they were also supporting him otherwise? Hydration and/or nutrition?\n\nThis I would care a lot less about. He ran a 2:57, not a 2:07. He's not competing for placement so the rules about outside support seem irrelevant. The issue is really the safety concern.\n\nI know some people take the outside support rules seriously, but imo it's a bit silly outside of the people at the front of the pack competing for prizes. I don't care if some random runner just out there to run the race has a bottle handed to them by their friend/family.\n\nI’m with you. I’ve seen someone flag down a race official of a local marathon to tattle on someone running a 3:30 marathon getting a bottle from a friend on the course. Gimme a freaking break.\n\nYeah that’s just goofy imo. There seems to be a breed of runner who takes it a little too seriously for their skill level.\n\nIt’s not even about safety to me. It’s about practicality. Imagine if lots of people did what he did. It would be madness. Nip this stupidity in the bud.\n\nGood, as he should. I was a follower of his because it seemed to be motivational and encouraging content. I wasn't aware of the Houston issue. Then after seeing this NYC situation I unfollowed. Go ahead and film with your phone on a huge race like this, that's fine. But to have a \"crew\" who breaks the rules and messes with other people's experiences is terrible.\n\nSame.  Dude is a douche.\n\nSince I’m unaware of this guy for the most part, what happened in Houston?\n\nHouston is a flat race during the winter in Texas. Many of the races in Texas during the winter are hilly. Many people use it to BQ. Pre-COVID it was popular but post COVID it got even more popular. Houston was always a popular race for the above reason but with the increase in runners the race sold out. There’s no transfers or deferrals with Houston. So, instead of actually registering, like a normal human, he just took the bib from an injured friend. Dude wasn’t even “new” to running. He knew. He’s just a tool.\n\nAhh ok yeah what a scum bag. I’m from Houston and have run that race (my only one) and it’s incredibly flat so I can see the advantages of it for sure, just wasn’t sure what exactly he did here that was controversial, but thanks for the insight!\n\nBib muled basically pretended it was totally fine until he got called out then made a non apology\n\nHow long until his fake apology?\n\nWhen he realizes he's dropped from all his sponsors\n\nHe already took them off his bio\n\nProbably so people don’t flood them with calls to drop him. I’m sure the tags will be quietly added back next week.\n\n\"Guys, I messed up.\"\n\nNot even. He'll claim that he had no idea that any of this was against the rules or disrespectful, and then ask his followers what rules they've learned since they started running.\n\nSo, more engagement farming. Too much to ask him to shut up and take the consequences.\n\n\"I'm sorry you feel that way\"\n\nHe issued the apology, explained the punishment, took full responsibility. Nor much more to do on his end at this point. He is still a dick and I don’t care for him but the apology was about as good as it can get from an “ownership” point\n\nHe already used the “I didn’t know, I’m new to the sport” excuse. What could he possibly say that anyone would buy at this point?\n\nNo one is going to buy he’s new to the sport at this point, plus he’s done it before. People would respect him more if he just owned up to it and showed real remorse/change instead of more excuses.\n\nAt this point, that's all he can do. That, and hopefully disappear. I mean, at this point, no company in their right mind would sponsor him.\n\nCould be a non apology \n\n\"I'm sorry if people are upset\"\n\n3 minutes ago! Lol\n\nSaw a comment on that video that said if he was really sorry he’d take down all the content he shot that day and I’m 100% with that commenter\n\nInfluencers love to hear themselves talk, so I can’t imagine it’ll be that long.\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/mattchoi\\_6/reel/DB\\_wQcfxrNf/](https://www.instagram.com/mattchoi_6/reel/DB_wQcfxrNf/)\n\nI find it hilarious that he's \"apologizing\" to the runner's who couldn't access the aid stations and were affected by his stunt since he would have never done that until now, when he's being called out and punished.\n\nIn terms of apologising for dumb stuff it's not bad. Obviously normal people wouldn't have done it in the first place but at least he's owned it and isn't whinging\n\nIt is designed to appear like a good apology, but it's not genuine.\n\nHe knew what the rule on ebikes was before he did this. He broke the rules and knowingly put people at risk for content. He is only apologizing because he got caught and banned.\n\nHow do we know?\n\nThis isn't the first time he was told not to use ebikes in a marathon to film content - he has been warned many times in other races. But he didn't face any consequences do he kept doing it. Now that he is banned from NYRR events, he is forced to apologize.\n\nGood. Running influencers who can't produce the content without disturbing and disrupting others should just stop.\n\n\"Influencers\" should just stop.\n\nNo. I like Kofuzi. His runner’s weekend videos are top notch.\n\nEven he runs races with a selfie stick which can be obtrusive but yeah he's prob the most reasonable of all the influencers\n\nI don't mind them if they behave, but I don't see the appeal of those influencer like Matt Choi who just film themselves running and nothing else\n\nChoi posted an apology to Instagram a few minutes ago. In it, he opens by saying he f**ked up, takes all of the blame, and said he won't appeal. He also said he won't have e-bikes follow him in the future.\n\nHopefully he also means he won't have *any* bikes or people on any other means of conveyance follow him and won't have drones following him or anything else which will interfere with other racers, staff, volunteers, etc. Whether his apology is genuine and sufficient is open to speculation. I just hope he doesn't do anything like this again, other running influencers won't do similar, and race organizers try to establish better ways to mitigate this kind of behavior as it's occurring.\n\nHis apology video: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DB_wQcfxrNf\n\nI love how part of his excuse was “I was excited to get a sub 3” \n\nYou can get content and celebrate your sub 3 without having a whole videography crew on the course blocking and injuring runners. Use the .5 lens on your phone, problem solved.\n\n[removed]\n\nAs apology videos go it’s decent but if he was really sorry he would delete all the context shot from the bikes which he hasn’t done. He is sorry but will still reap the financial benefits from it.\n\nStill be there with a massive selfie stick though won’t he…\n\nMaybe he will switch to drones, scooters, or gasoline fueled rollerblades.\n\n[deleted]\n\nwhat happened\n\nThey worked with that man and he was a complete asshole \n\nhahahaha good, I’ve had this guy blocked on instagram for forever. Couldn’t stand seeing his face pop up - he is the textbook definition of a self-absorbed “influencer”\n\nRunning Reddit has now taken down Matt Choi and Spring Energy. What other super-villains shall we tackle?\n\nTicketmaster? \n\nOr did you mean running-related super-villains?\n\nCan we not call him an \"influencer\" and call him what he is: a selfish asshole.\n\nI don't see a difference.\n\nIt's the same picture.\n\nGood. He’s a self-important asshole\n\nGood. At this point I'd also be on board with other marathons banning him preemptively. This isn't the first time &amp; he's gonna keep pulling sh*t every event he gets in.\n\nShould be the case where if you've done something bad enough to be banned from one major that you're automatically banned from all of them.\n\nYeah I saw a video on tiktok from last year for one marathon he said he got permission from the president or ceo of whichever company was hosting the marathon, to film content. So we know it involved an e-bike. Whether he has permission or not he’s robbing people of their experience and putting himself about everyone else.\n\nWhy can’t people just do things without recording themselves doing it?\n\nOk, so because he's an \"influencer\" he doesn't need to follow rules and risk injuring another runner?  He's special?\n\nHe's banned?  Good.\n\nGood luck getting that Abbott medal.\n\nI sense a “break from running” is coming and he goes the hyrox route all while claiming that the running community has become too toxic.\n\nmaybe a \"morning routine\" video\n\nHe just posted his response\n\nAt the core, this is about consideration of others, selflessness and safety. If someone were to create a runfluencersinthewild feed this clown would consume many of the posts from his past shenanigans. \n\nBut the worst part of it is all the brands fanning the flames by creating partnerships with these people and thereby putting profits over all else. If a major running brand invites them to special events and extends their reach it gives these self-centered folks “license” to act how they’d like. \n\nThe whole industry that’s popped up around shake out runs of hundreds of people showing up to hopefully be part of the edited YouTube vid the influencer posts, get a free hat to promote something etc. &lt;gag&gt;\n\nFor as many positive impacts to our running community (all the clubs around the world that bring people together for group runs that have popped up post-pandemic etc) there are unfortunately these folks who feel they’re in a position to tell us which shoes to buy, and worse, get in our way on race courses due to thinking they’re Spielberg on Peba. \n\nThat being said, not all of these influencers are toxic. Some create enjoyable content and ARE considerate in the way they develop their content.\n\n*Curb Your Enthusiasm music playing*\n\nOr Sunny\n\n“The Gang Gets Disqualified” 😂\n\nGlad he is being punished but how did the race organizers allow this to happen in the first place? How did an e-bike even get on the course?\n\nIf you wear hi vis vest and act like you belong, people will just assume it's something official and won't bother checking\n\nI presume they were waiting on the sidewalk for him at Mile 1, something like that. It's not a closed track.\n\nThis is crazy bc I was volunteering at mile 26 of the Chicago marathon this year and there was a whole team of course Marshalls/ course officials with vests on who’s entire job was to grab bandits and haul them off course. If you didn’t have a bib you were not allowed on course. They were working for the marathon event staff and were all marathon runners themselves (who had done Chicago multiple times) so they were literally chasing people down which was cool to see. By the time my shift was over, 90+ people had been kicked off the course, including kids (I didn’t realize it was such a thing to “cross the line” with your kid/spouse/partner/whatnot). 10+ cops next to us too so they could get involved if need be. There was a few e-bikes too that I was confused how they got on the course. We were one of the last places that they could get caught tho so everyone took their job very very seriously.\n\nI have definitely seen that at the end of road races but never on the whole course. I'm not sure how practical that is for a big city race that's 26 miles and open for 9+ hours\n\nNYC is usually pretty strict about keeping people off course while the faster runners (sub 3:30 or so) pass through so I'm a little surprised they got bikes on at that pace. The only race I've seen absolutely 100% no course intrusions are the Disney races cause the Mouse don't play!\n\nI think that’s why they were so stringent on it since we were literally the end. It was more crazy the people who were fighting back. One guy was yelling “I already the ran the whole thing who cares let me finish!” I imagine more people would have fought back even harder if there weren’t all the cops right there milling about. The course Marshall’s were telling me to just wait, a ton of kids might come thru to us because they couldn’t be on the course either and people would just hand the kids over the barricades to runners. I only saw 1 for my early shift and the cops helped her call her uncle to come get her.\n\nI assume the cyclists picked a spot a few miles in, waited for him, and then hopped off the sidewalk and onto the course. I’ve never run NYC, so I don’t know exactly what that course looks like, but for most city marathons the course is just a street. There’s traffic control at intersections to prevent people from driving onto the course, and there’s fencing at the start and finish, but it’s completely open everywhere else.\n\nThat is the real question.\n\nThis is why, when I become a running influencer, I will only rely on AI drones to film me.\n\nOr an inline skater.\n\nWhen I lived in Austin, Matt moved in across the street from me. I'm not a runner, but a lot of my friends are in Austin, so that's how I knew who he was. Let me tell you, when he moved in, it was endless entertainment every day, seeing the douchey stuff he would do on our street. This news was a wonderful way to start the day—I was kicking my feet laughing so hard.\n\nIs that a lot of followers ? Who gives a fuck\n\nAnother influencer bites the dust\n\n*bikes the dust\n\nMaybe I'm old (30) but running to me used to be a humbling hobby to do \n\n\n\nIt's all about clout\n\nI love running but honestly it’s just about the most boring sport I can imagine to film. What would even be the point of more than 30s of footage?\n\nlol the thing about his 2:57 time is that he probably would’ve done a 3:30 by virtue of having a literal force field in front of him the whole time. He doesn’t have to focus any energy on weaving, he could literally just close his eyes and focus on running while the bikes carve a path for him. 3:30 is still a good time for me, but the fool speaks so highly of running culture being supportive that he forgot to contribute to this culture himself.\n\nGreat decision by the NYRRC!  I just canceled my Runna subscription due to the inappropriate behavior of their CEO and “ambassador”\n\nHe's also barred from my feed lol\n\nAbsolutely idiotic. I see runner influencers filming their races using their own gopro or whatever which is fine. Having two people on bikes filming you? What a selfish prick.\n\n[deleted]\n\nOne day in the not too distant future I hope to look back and say, \"hey, remember 'influencers'? What a weird trend that was..\"\n\nLaughing my fucking ass off\n\nGood.  I followed him on IG when he started but quit following.  He is a narcissist who has people ride bikes to video him.  F that, I just want to run and not worry about being on video or a bike on the road\n\nMy kids have a book titled “What if everyone did that” and it seems to fit here.\n\nNow ban filming in gyms!!!\n\n[deleted]\n\nSome runners have tried! I remember Choi posted a video of himself getting flipped off during a race by another runner and Choi posted it being like “don’t be like this guy, we are all here to make each others day brighter” and everyone hated on the guy who flipped Choi off in the comments\n\nLink: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3nlFUmOqNJ/?igsh=d3d2ZjlkZ25vbzJ1\n\nThat guy was right after all.\n\nI mean I have to imagine most people assumed the bikers were official or there was something else going on. in the middle of a race how would you know\n\n\"im not a runner, im a creator first\" the gen-z brainrot is real\n\nGood, that guy is the worst.\n\nGood. What a jackass.\n\nI cant stand Matt Choi with his fake bro energy. This is the second time he’s had an illegal bike in a race.  Running influencers can be insufferable but he’s probably the worst.\n\nMatt Choi is breathing a sigh of relief today. He's no longer in the headlines.\n\nGood but I doubt this will discourage him from being a turd in the future.\n\nI’ve run a lot of marathons but I’ve never heard of this guy. I’m glad my algorithm hasn’t shown me the running influencers 😂\n\nI never really liked him. He always idk gave me such a off vibe. \nWhat is the Houston situation? Accidently switching bibs?\nOr like he just took someone else's but why?\n\nIt was just straight up muling. He didn’t register in time so he ran with a non transferable bib from another runner. If it went under the radar he could have gave some random person a BQ or whatever.\n\nInfluencers are cancer. Good decision\n\nso he's banned for having a film crew, but hasn't cheated? that right?\n\nYes, but you could argue what he did is worse then cheating. Having a film crew bike along the course with him disrupted alot of other runners.\n\nDepends. If all they were doing was filming that's a clear violation of the rules, but it might not be considered \"cheating\" if it didn't help his performance. If they were also pacing him or giving him drinks or gels that would definitely be cheating as per USATF regulations.\n\nIf they were clipping other runners and blocking access to water stations then they were still cheating. Helping him by hurting others.\n\nYeah fair enough. Even if unintentional it certainly sounds like negligence and hurt other participants.\n\nHAHA ban him from all of the Majors\n\nWhy the fuck do hundreds of thousands of people waste their time watching some dude jog?\n\nThis is petty.... Lol but why does he post, \"I PR'D BY 9 SECONDS\" just above the strava badge that says, \"this is Matt's second best marathon.\" How and why and huh?\n\nHe did the same in Sydney . I ran past him and the bike rider filming\n\nPeople on runnit love to hate running influencers and I totally understand it but there are actually some decent running content creators who aren’t vapid narcissists. \n\nThis guy is definitely not one of them though, I honestly cannot understand why anyone would watch his videos. Even without the cheating he’s a total d bag.\n\nLmao serves him right.\n\nRunners worldwide should have no outside assistance, an end to this crewing nonsense. Rely on the volunteer Girl Scout troops out there to get it done and don’t edge your race with outside assistance. \n\nIs he going to do the same at Boston?\n\nI feel like this would bring out the most Boston side of Boston. Good luck to him if that happens. People who have never run a race before will enter just to check him into the boards. The city will put up boards for this to happen.\n\n“I fcked up” but he does this literally every race.\n\nRunna dropped him too 🥳\n\nGOOD.  But let’s not forget they were literally running right next to him.\n\n&gt; “He has been banned from any future NYRR races.” \n\nBest part about this.\n\nIsn't the bigger question here why/how the bikes were allowed on the course in the first place? I don't know anything about Matt so maybe I'm missing some context, and obviously he shouldn't have been able to do what he did. But surely people aren't allowed to follow the marathon course without being actual participants?\n\nThe election is not over and the people have already won.\n\nMaybe he can sell his 30 bracelets and pit viper sunglasses for rent next month.\n\nYOU LOVE TO SEE IT! Content creators are beyond douchey.\n\nWhy does it even matter how many followers he has?\n\ngood. I have run 10+ marathons in my life and it is a deeply personal and private moment in my life. I can't imagine the distraction and harassment his bike riding posse was to other fellow runners. Especially at the most congested parts of the race- like when you are starting at Verrazzano bridge and also in parts of Brooklyn where people are shoulder to shoulder packed in. It is extremely selfish and inconsiderate to others he thought this was okay. Glad NYRR banned him for life. I think all marathon organizers should do the same if he pulls this again. He already did this at the Austin Marathon and wouldn't be surprised if he does it again.\n\nGood. He's a clown."

    "all_comment_text": "Jesus. She suffered way too long.\n\nMy thought as well.  Horrible way to die, on top of the terror she must have felt in the moment.  Just straight torture.\n\nJesus fucking christ.\n\nAnd one of her daughters viewed the assault. I can’t fathom….unbearably horrific and utterly tragic.\n\nput him in a hole and throw away the hole\n\nAbsolutely horrific. I hope she can rest in peace. There is so much femicide especially in Africa and this case is getting publicity because she was an Olympian, but there are so many stories we never even hear about.\n\nThis isn’t an “Africa” problem, this fits in with overall intimate partner violence, which is a problem in western countries too\n\nIntimate partner violence is particularly prevalent in Eastern Sub-saharan Africa\n\n&gt;Regional variations by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study classifications showed that the estimated lifetime prevalence of physical or sexual, or both, intimate partner violence among ever-partnered women aged 15–49 years (the age range for which there is the most data on intimate partner violence) was the highest in Oceania (49%; UI 38–61%) and central sub-Saharan Africa (44%; 33–55%), followed by Andean Latin America (38%; 31–46%) and eastern sub-Saharan Africa (38%; 31–44%;\n\n  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8885817/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8885817/)\n\nAccording to this paper, the rate of lifetime physical or sexual, or both, intimate partner violence among ever-partnered women aged 15–49 years was in Uganda is 45%. The rate is Kenya is 38%. According to the paper I linked \"Given the sensitive nature of the issue, the true prevalence of physical or sexual, or both, intimate partner violence is likely to be higher.\"\n\nRAINN cites higher numbers for Kenya:\n\n&gt;40.7% of ever-partnered women in Kenya have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence in their lifetime; 25.5% in the last year. \n\n[https://rainn.org/africa/kenya](https://rainn.org/africa/kenya)\n\nIf she were not an Olympian, we would not hear about it, as it would be just one of many cases.\n\nAccording to WHO, the rate is 30% globally.  Every place has it's own unique problems and causes, but this is far from Kenya or Africa problem, and I don't love the implication.\n\n&gt; If she were not an Olympian, we would not hear about it, as it would be just one of many cases.\n\nNow, that's a fucking fact.\n\nedit: typo;  30%, not 38\n\n&gt;According to WHO, the rate is 30% globally. Every place has it's own unique problems and causes, but this is far from Kenya or Africa problem, and I don't love the implication.\n\nRates in the US are &gt;30% but the Americans and Europeans on Reddit love pretending like their \"civilised\".\n\nYup! They forget they have legalized child marriage, cops beat their spouses at over 40% etc etc. just love trotting out stats about darker people. Hate this so much.\n\n_“Intimate partner violence is particularly prevalent in Eastern Sub-saharan Africa“_\n\nDid you spell “world” wrong?\n\nAnd South Asia. And the US. And most of the rest of the world.\n\nThis keeps getting posted as if it's unique to Africa and women.\n\nQuick wiki search:  Its actually slightly higher that men experienced violence from women at 42.6% vs 42%, based on US statistics...\n\nCan you post a source for those stats?\n\nNobody is saying it’s unique to women or Africa? Murder via domestic violence is significantly more prevalent when men are perpetrators, however, which seems like an important distinction in examining these issues.\n\nThe original post literaly refers to this being “prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa.”\n\nDid you just not read it?\n\nCitation please\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_men#:~:text=The%20CDC's%20National%20Intimate%20Partner,intimate%20partner%20in%20their%20lifetime.\n\nMen just need better press agents.  No one cares about violence against them not even other men....\n\nThe text you're quoting does not say that men experienced more violence from women, it's says they experienced violence from a partner, with no gender specified that I'm seeing. Considering the 0.3% difference I don't think you can justify assuming.\n\n&gt; No one cares about violence against them not even other men....\n\nBased on what?  People are talking about violence against women in this thread because the article is about a woman who experienced violence and ultimately died from it.\n\nIf you're interpreting \"Violence against women is bad\" as \"violence against men is good\" then that's a you problem.\n\nSuch a lie. Men experience more violence from other men.\n\n'Olympic athlete Rebecca Cheptegei murdered by ex-boyfriend'\n\nYou fixed it\n\nThis is a horrific day in humanity. May she rest in power. May her children heal. May her murderer never know peace or rest.\n\nUmmm what the fuck?!\n\nThis is one of those posts I'd like to downvote because it's so sad, but it's important for this to reach as broad an audience as possible.  Absolutely tragic, and hopefully it will open the eyes of everyone in the West who have put Kenya on such a pedestal the past decade+.  Keep in mind Rebecca was living &amp; training in Eldoret, even though she was Ugandan, and she is not at all the first victim of femicide in Kenya.\n\n[Here's](https://sites.uab.edu/humanrights/2024/03/14/femicide-in-kenya-a-silent-crisi) a summary, and you can find many more news articles and scholarly research studies.\n\n“Hopefully this will open the eyes of everyone in the West who have put Kenya on such a pedestal”.\n\nAre you serious? Have you picked up a paper and seen the type of horrific shit that is happening in the West on a daily basis? The horrific actions of this murderer do not reflect on Kenya as a whole.  Certainly no more so than recent rapes and murders and school shooters in your country reflect on you. There are sick people everywhere.\n\nI'm not going to comment on the whole East vs West culture war aspect of this, but the part about \"have put Kenya on such a pedestal\" is very weird to me.  Like, the notion that it's time for Kenya to be taken down a peg?  Huh?  Because they've got big running creds?  Seems like the news from Kenya over the past decade has been a pretty mixed bag.  I swear, feels like everyone lives in a universe of their own creation.\n\nYeah that was a bizarre thing to say. Like “this is good now everyone can reckon with what Kenya actually is”, like wtf? \n\nIt’s not about a “culture war” to me, it’s about not taking one horrific murder and using that to condemn an entire nation as evil.\n\nYeah I don’t get why you’re downvoted. This terrible event by a single person doesn’t define Kenya and it’s absurd to imply that it does. Violence against women by their spouses/ex-spouses is a problem in every country.\n\nCase in point, here’s one from good ol’ Texas in April of this year: [Man Sets Wife on Fire - Murder Suicide](https://abc13.com/amp/harris-county-murder-suicide-husband-sents-wife-on-fire-couple-found-dead-in-burning-home-desert-rose-lane/14742005/)\n\nI hope everyone downvoting me has actually been to Kenya and doesn’t just form their biased worldview based on the small bubble they live in! New York City has a higher murder rate than Nairobi, for starters.\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nShe didn’t « die » like it was an accident\nShe was murdered\nIt is important to use the right word and to stop downplaying the violence of men towards women\n\nIt's very important that the BBC doesn't use words like murdered until after a criminal trial has taken place. Incredibly strong standards for press stops the BBC becoming like fox news. Ofcom is very clear on this\n\nThey also make it very very clear in the article what has been reported to have happened so I can't see why you think it's down playing anything.\n\nStrong standards and the fact that a criminal trial hasn't taken place is not the reason BBC used the word \"dies\" rather than \"murder\". \n\nIt's because she was still alive at the time the story broke a few days ago. This is an update headline to inform that she has now passed.\n\nIt’s an update that she has now died of her injuries, she’s been in hospital since Sunday. The wording is fine\n\nTo be fair to the shit BBC Eds for once, this is an update. They had other stories about the attack and her condition so this is a very factual update on where we’re up to.\n\nWill retract my defence if a follow up story with your wording doesn’t appear, however.\n\nAre we at the point where people can't even read entire post *titles* anymore?\n\nI would imagine this is just a quirk of the BBC trying to be 'balanced'. If her boyfriend is only a suspected murderer as of yet and to label her murdered may prejudice the case.\n\nTherefore they try and pussyfoot around it. Would be stronger if they used 'in a suspected murder' or something.\n\nStrongly agree with this.\n\nWho is downplaying it?  Yes she was murdered, but it's not like the headline or article obfuscates that fact.  An attempted murder became an actual murder.\n\nYeah I agree. It even says ”after being set alight”. What other interpretation is there other than ”she was murdered”? The title is unambiguous.\n\nIf anything, the additional detail makes the facts even starker.  She died days later, in agony.  Just saying \"she was murdered\" doesn't capture the horrible truth of it, but I guess it makes random internet people happy for some reason.  The article uses the word \"murder.\"  I find nothing wrong with the staging or phrasing of this headline/article.\n\nIf we want to talk about ambiguity, we can talk about the term \"men's violence against women\". It is a term that invites generalizations and \"painting with the broad brush\".  It is obviously true that most violence is committed by men. It is however equally true that *very* few men commit violence. The term is perfect for stupid ideologues who want something or someone to hate or pin their anger on.\n\nI dunno, I think there's a worthwhile distinction to be made.  This type of violence (by men, against women) can have very complex societal roots.  Not always, but very often.  Enough that it warrants targeted discussion, study, and intervention.  I don't know what this guy's motive was.  Maybe this was some type of honor killing.   Or maybe it was the senseless act of a lunatic.  I'm no anthropologist, and I haven't seen any info about motive.\n\nI don't disagree. I was just pointing out that the term is bad.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is a weird problem in this sub in particular. Not sure if it's flooded with bots or just people who aren't socially well adjusted, but these massive downvote bombardments on seemingly innocuous comments can make this sub intolerable at times.\n\nFor the most part, this sub is not a place for discussion, it's a place of dogma where the same answers are given to the same questions over and over again.  The top-level comment I replied to only read the first 5 words of the title to hop up on a soap box and start trashing a perfectly fine article, expecting updoots and 15 replies of \"THIS!\"\n\nWho am I to question the ritual handwringing of strangers?\n\nThank you because this right here. I've been seeing passive headlines exactly like the one that is linked here and for fucks sake, she did not up and \"die\" all of the sudden. She was MURDERED in one of the most horrific ways imaginable by her former boyfriend.\n\nShe did not \"die,\" she was burned alive and killed by a former intimate partner. These headlines have been driving me crazy.\n\nOf course she died otherwise she would still be alive. Was it murder I think the article makes it very clear what happened and people can rightly come to the conclusion it was murder BUT it can’t be officially called murder until there has been a trial. Even murders have the right to remain innocent until proven otherwise.\n\nIf we start jumping the gun and allowing news outlets to ‘convict’ someone before there has been a court case it will not end well.\n\nFucking despicable. RIP.\n\nThe world is terrible at raising boys to be good men. Holy shit\n\nNot every man… but always a man\n\nFuck I have no words\n\nSo many things horribly wrong about this. How terrible for her daughters. She seemed to be a good mom. And why is everyone just saying she was supporting them financially? Like you have nothing else to say about her? Is this a cultural thing?\n\nSo is this guy being charged with murder or what? The article is weirdly quiet about it.\n\n&gt; \"Police say an investigation is under way.\"\n\nShe died today people don't tend to be charged with murder that quickly.\n\nThis is next level crazy! I can’t even fathom someone wanting to do that to someone they loved. wtf.\n\nMy god, this is just devastating.\n\nHe probably saw her as his meal ticket... and when she set boundaries.... he decided no one else will have her if I can't\n\nWeird way to say she was another victim of DV and was murdered by her “boyfriend”"

    "all_comment_text": "That poor woman. What a disgusting thing to do to someone\n\nWhat the everliving fuck\n\nIt takes a lot for me to be surprised on the Internet these days, this was one of them like what on earth. Her poor family must be distraught\n\nThis is just horrible. Regardless if an Olympian or not, no one should have to endure this pain.\n\nMy moms ex bf attempted to set her on fire 6 years ago. Soon as I got that call I drove 3 hours to get her and she has lived with me ever since. Fortunately the burns were minor and she is okay today\n\nMy ex did too. He is schizophrenic, and wrote all the plans in a jumbled mess in his diary. I woke up to my curtains and my cat burning (she was ultimately ok) \n\nScary as hell. I cannot fathom the pain she is enduring right now.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm glad you're okay now. My mom has lots of issues - she actually asked me if that man could come visit about 6 months later. Oh hell no lady, you're insane if you think I am letting him in my house, and you're even more insane for wanting him to.\n\nI think I might have done something to him that would get me a very long term in prison.\n\n&gt; Regardless if an Olympian or not, no one should have to endure this pain.\n\nWell, yeah...\n\nWait, what? Regardless if an Olympian? What does that have to do with being set on fire?\n\nI think it’s meant to point out how we are hearing about this because she is an Olympian, but there are countless women who suffer similar attacks daily and we don’t hear about all of them because they aren’t known or famous. No one should have to endure such an attack, regardless if you’re famous or not.\n\nThis is exactly what I was getting at. My apologies for not making it clear. It was an impulse response.\n\nThank you for clarifying.\n\n\"No one should have to endure this pain - not even an Olympian.\"\n\nthat sounds like it’s saying being an olympian is a bad thing \n\nWhy does that make it clearer? The Olympian aspect has zero relevance to whether she should have to endure abuse or pain.\n\nI was actually making fun of the original comment because it's nonsense. I think Reddit is just bots now.\n\nYou're probably right. The (perfectly reasonable) comment is currently at minus 74!!\n\n[deleted]\n\nI had the same response. It is a very strange way to respond. I don't even know what they are trying to say. No human should have to endure such abuse. Being an Olympian has zero relevance. It might make sense if she were a criminal or a terrible person, then the contrast would make some sense. But an Olympian? Makes zero sense whatsoever.\n\nIt shows that violence against women crosses all boundaries including against olympians who are regarded as national champions and representatives, but hey keep seeing the world through your ignorant view of “it doesn’t correlate”\n\nNo, that's not what the grammar says at all (unless you don't understand English). This is a question of grammar and meaning.\n\nBut saying that it doesn’t have relevance is an attempt to reduce the visibility of the crime\n\nI’m with you, Doc. What in the world does this mean?  “No one should have to endure this pain - not even an Olympian.” Like what? Why specify Olympian?\n\nfuuuuuuuck this shit.\n\nSetting people on fire is unfortunately an often occurrence in some part of Africa. It is usually a form of punishment by mob..\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nAccording to the Barrons report on the incident\n\n&gt; Latest figures by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics published in January 2023 found that 34 percent of women in the country have experienced physical violence since the age of 15.\n\n&gt; It said women who had \"been married are much more likely to have experienced violence\", noting that 41 percent of such women reported incidents compared to 20 percent of unmarried women.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/news/ugandan-olympian-in-intensive-care-after-partner-set-her-on-fire-527438a3\n\nAgnes Tirop (a successful up-and-coming Kenyan runner) was murdered by her husband in 2022 in same area. Another Kenyan runner was strangled to death too. Those are the ones that make the news because they are famous - imagine how many are out there that did not die in the process or died and no coverage? \n\nA foundation was started in Agnes Tirop's honor by other runners to bring awareness to femicide and domestic violence and the abuse/manipulation that a lot of young Kenyan runners face by sponsors, etc. \n\nIt's called Tirop's Angels: [https://www.tirops-angels.org/](https://www.tirops-angels.org/)\n\n[deleted]\n\nMen are the worst hazard faced by women\n\nAnd men still have the nerve to claim that misogyny doesn't exist and that women have it better than men smh. I hate it here.\n\nMen are always the worst hazard for women, period.\n\nTIL ~~Kenyan~~ men are ~~probably~~ the worst hazard faced by ~~Kenyan~~ women.\n\nI think about her so often. What an awful loss.\n\nJust a correction, she was killed in 2021\n\nI immediately thought of her, I thought I had heard basically the same story before. So sad.\n\nI genuinely can’t fathom thinking through and following through the steps to do this to someone.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBeing an Olympian doesn't necessarily mean you have the resources to just walk away from your old life and start a new one in a new place. \n\nEven the old tradition of seeking asylum only works for so many people.\n\nIt's also super easy to let domestic strife stew a lot longer than is safe or sane when you're up to your eyeballs in dealing with other life situations like work, family, the kids, being an Olympian...\n\nWTF.\n\nomg, i remember watching her compete &amp; thinking what an incredible athlete &amp; race. hope she has a speedy recovery &amp; surrounded by love/protection/the best care. hope her bf suffers in every possible way.\n\nNothing about that will be speedy. She’ll be at a very high risk for infection and depending on how bad the burns are, she may not be able to compete again because of scarring. It’s just incredible that someone would do that to another person, no matter what else happened.\n\nYeah. I’m nowhere an expert in this field but it sounds like a third degree burn, which the underlying tissues (maybe tendons as well) are damaged. If at some time she’s able to running at a mid-low recreational level, that’s already a speedy recovery. \n\nIt’s so sad, and I’m honestly baffled why someone would do this to another person.\n\nik. we can only hope. it’s devastating\n\nAt 80% burns she’ll be lucky to live 😢\n\nUnfortunately you’re right. I’d be extremely surprised if she ever competes again, what sort of fucking monster could do this to someone?\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf it’s not setting women on fire, it is burning and disfiguring them with acid attacks.\n\n        ,what sort of fucking monster could do this to someone? \n\n\n\nA man.\n\nBurns are one of the most painful injuries you can experience. Burning more than half of your body… I don’t wish it on anyone. She can very much die from this. I hope she has a good team of healthcare providers taking care of her right now.\n\nabsolutely it’s not a minor thing at all. we can only hope she’ll get the best care &amp; hope she has everything possible to hopefully get better.\n\nThey didn't say what degree the burns were, did they? I don't think I want to make a second go at reading that.\n\nThe Barrons report said muscle involvement so third degree.\n\nEdit to add some classifications use fourth degree for this type of burn which is deep to the skin.\n\nYou know what I didn't see anywhere in the whole article...?  That the mofo who did this has been arrested.   \n**WHY** is there no mention of his arrest?    \nThey need to charge him. The sooner the better.\n\nThe BBC article mentioned that he also sustained burns and was hospitalised.\n\nOh no. That’s too bad. Anyways…\n\ntreat him first, then set the other 75% of his body on fire. How's that for equality?\n\nIn the same hospital as her….\n\nIn the article says that he got burned too and is hospitalized. I hope he's guarded by the police and will be taken in when he recovers.\n\nFuck DV\n\n[removed]\n\nThat is still domestic violence.\n\nThat's still consider domestic violence, though?\n\nThere should be a hell for men throwing acid or petrol and flame on their (ex-)partners. The deep vicious hate against women, the deeply rooted feeling of ownership over a female partner to bring a person to the point of trying to destroy them, nullify who they are because they cannot have them.\n\nGutwrenching.\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis man deserves worse than what he did to her\n\n[removed]\n\nNot the time, dude\n\nDude, I'm just trying to relax and get some sleep, and then I read this. What the heck is wrong with the world!\n\nWhat the fuck!! This is so awful and disturbing to read. The article says the reason is because they were having an argument about the house, what kind of piece of shit is her boyfriend to set someone on fire over a housing disagreement?!\n\nHow sad.\n\nHow awful. Wishing her a good recovery and eventual happiness and peace.\n\nI read an article about the violence against female runners in Kenya, published in the lead up to the Paris games. Such a travesty. A lot of shady dudes offer coaching and housing to young women training at one of the famous towns. A lot are victims of domestic violence and some stop running altogether. However it ended on a high note of many of the women in the community started running as a group, all ages and abilities.\n\nI read that same article and it immediately came to mind upon seeing this story.\n\nHorrific. Poor woman. I hope she recovers.\n\nI used to work in a Level I Trauma Centre, and the Burn Unit was adjacent/down the hall. That was one of the places I’ve had to block from my memory because it’s one thing to read descriptions of severe burns. It’s another to hear people screaming in pain. It’s even worse to smell burned flesh and hair. It makes you sick to know that these people are probably going to die. The sight of a burn that severe is something you’re never prepared to see, no matter how many movies you’ve seen. Those aren’t real life.  It’s something you’ll never forget. \n\nI also didn’t see this part but where was Rebecca brought to? Some of these regions don’t have the same levels of care as we do; again…the infection potential at 75% is so high…\n\nAbsolutely disgusting that anyone would do that to another human being. I pray she gets the best medical care in the world and all the support she needs from friends and family to get her through this.\n\nFuck! As someone who has been burned, self inflicted accident, I don't wish this on anyone\n\nI hope she can recover physically and mentally from that horrible day, also that man needs to face his penal system\n\nThe kind of story nobody ever wants to read, but that we all really need to read.\n\nAbsolutely horrific.\n\nBest wishes to her\n\nJust read an article and I’m gutted. This has happened to multiple women in the same city and all from their partners. I hope she finds peace and her and her kids heal from this 💔\n\nUgh the kids. I. Am sick for them. Witnessing their mom go thru such pain.  \n\nThe world is just wrong on every level\n\nSickening.\n\nWtf why would someone do this? It's horrible\n\nHow awful. I hope Turia Pitt can connect with her. I imagine she’d been a great source of hope.\n\nI’d be surprised if she even survives. 75% is close to death\n\nShe has a strong heart and a lot of physical reserves. She may make it but I worry if she'll ever run again. Scar tissue likes neither direct sunlight nor wide ranges of motion.\n\nThere’s no way she will. I hope she still has her eyesight and the use of her hands, but 75% is so high that I’m not sure if any quality of life exists at that level of burn. This is gut wrenching.\n\nGiven it’s a gas fire I’m worried that we are past 2nd and third degree burns into more dire territory. Just awful.   And I imagine there won’t be updates for days as the surgeons do what they can.\n\nThere really are some horrible people in this world. How can you do that to someone? 😢\n\nWhat the fuck\n\nWhat the fuck! Not even successful women are safe. I am sooooo angry. This is 100% motivated by misogyny and you can’t change my mind.\n\nShe's listed as critical in the article, with that percentage, is this even survivable?\n\nPoor woman 😢 cannot even imagine \n\nHe was probably jealous of her success. Just awful 😞\n\nOmg! This is terrible! 😢\n\nHow awful, she is such an amazing athlete. I hope she gets through this and can recover. 75% is horrific. This man needs to burn in hell after rotting away in prison.\n\nReminder to self, domestic violence can happen to the best of us.\n\nGarbage human...not even human in my eyes. Drop him in a deep hole.\n\nThis is mortifying.\n\nThis breaks my heart\n\ngosh I have chills man, she almost died burned alive. 75%?!! what is left?! \nI wish she didn't experience this.  \n\n🐻 without exaggeration. My god that is absolutely horrific\n\nIt has just been confirmed that she has died. Awful news.\n\nhow is this even a possibility of something that could happen.  unfathomable how garbage humans can be\n\nHer two kids were with her when it happened as well, so horrifying\n\nThat's utterly horrifying. Poor woman. \n\n75% is basically a death sentence. I pray for a miracle...\n\nOlympic athlete Rebecca Cheptegei dies after petrol attack https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vx0kq2xr2o\n\nRIP\n\nStatistically speaking, even in major burn centers, odds of surviving 75 TBSA 2nd degree or worse burns are very low. Very unfortunate, hopefully someone returns the favor.\n\nThis is so sad\n\nJesus Christ.\n\n75%!  Fuk sakes…that’s awful.\n\na sad update, she has passed :c\n\nMen are such dicks.\n\n[deleted]\n\nComparing male violence against women, a widespread and well known phenomenon, with a dislike of a brassica?\n\nGood grief.\n\nWhat did I just read\n\nHate to be the one to say it, but she would have been better off dying from her injuries.  Poor soul, she will suffer so badly.\n\nYou know that you DON’T actually have to say it, right? Sometimes it’s okay to just not say something.\n\nMaybe let her decide how she feels about her own survival, eh? Plenty of people fight for their lives despite having horrifying injuries."

    "all_comment_text": "The guy is suffering from main character syndrome.  What a douche and these stunts are not the first time.\n\nI watched his video with the click bait title “I ran this major marathon without a bib” and turned out he was acting as an official guide to this autistic girl doing her first marathon, which credit to him, but the whole video was basically just all about him, she was mostly just a prop in the background and he even seemed to end up pushing her at a pace beyond what she was comfortable with but tried to brush it off at the end at him pushing her to be greater vs him just not paying attention to her needs cause he was too busy making it all about him.\n\nReally turned me off to him and he hasn’t done anything since to change my mind.\n\nProbably best to stop watching him\n\nIt was my first time made it easily my last\n\nI saw him with a posse of dipshits waiting for selfies with him outside the entrance to his corral for wave 1.\n\nMatt Chode is full of himself\n\n[removed]\n\nAmazing 👏\n\nI liked him early last year, he seemed genuine and obviously is a very good runner but as time has gone on and he turned to full time “influencing” he’s become quite annoying. There’s only so much influencing you can do with respect to running, so it’s just the same crap over and over and he makes his brother follow him on a bike\n\n[deleted]\n\nThere is a tipping point, isn't there?  I watch a lot of bravo, and a similar thing happens to housewives. Something tips in a housewife's later season and they just *bloop! Through the looking glass they go. \n\nNothing a swift body check can’t fix during the next race.\n\nUnder the guise of promoting the sport. Bullshit dude\n\nHope they crack down hard on this, I really don't want to see other influencers start pulling this shit because they don't have any consequences.\n\nNYRR banned him this morning from all future races and invalidated his results from Sunday. Runna also dropped their sponsorship, too.\n\nI'm not fan of lawyers in general, but this sounds like a great chance for a civil suit for anyone he ran into.\n\nI hope he get banned from marathons. I wouldn’t feel safe in the same race with him\n\nAbsolute cringe. I normally don’t give a flying what people want to do, but when you’ve got bikes and multiple cameras on a running course - that’s simply insane. The organisers need to crack down and eliminate this entirely. \n\nThe bike was blocking people off from getting to aid stations and they kept telling other runners to move out of shot. He’s getting nothing but abuse on instagram\n\nHe needs to be banned from future NYC marathons. That sort of behavior needs to be put into the spotlight in a bad way. There are plenty of other races, but that sets an example.\n\nHe is now, thankfully!\n\nI think it's not the first time the guy has some angry runners because of this. I remember reading a very similar situation (bike crews bothering everybody) like a year ago.\n\n“running influencer”\n\nget the fuck out of here\n\nCan't wait for \"influencer\" to be a distant memory.\n\nYou’re going to wait a long time mate\n\nSadly, you're correct.\n\nNot really, AI will replace them in the near future finally.\n\nInfluencer: Fake cosmopolitan lifestyle based off mooching.\n\nWhat a stupid title, like there are running YouTubers that I watch but they are pro athletes and their camera crews are on the sidelines (Like Philly Bowden).\n\nIf I was running a big marathon like NY and this was around me I'd be livid.\n\ni ran Dublin last month and there was a bit of a circus around Colin Farrell, which was fair, but importantly his crew were also running.\n\nif encountering someone like this put a PB at risk though, my rage would know no bounds.\n\nI guess the other difference was that the crew around Colin consisted of four police officers who were going to run the marathon anyway and volunteered to run with him so he would have some space.\n\nfair, and at least these ones didn’t hop on the luas, like the one from the *anti-corruption unit* two years ago\n\nI don’t think you can compare the two Collin was literally doing it to raise awareness for his friend who was in the wheelchair and she has a rare condition that if anyone bumped her, fell on her etc. it could have serious impacts on her health - hence the entourage not for clout \n\ni left another comment clarifying - i’ve got huge respect for his marathon and how he did it and his cause, and even more for the crews who push push wheelchairs or guide blind runners through marathons.\n\nif an influencer got in my way, i’d be raging.\n\nI have been at races where Colin is running in the U.S. and it seems like no one has a clue who he is. I have seen him and visited with at post race gatherings and no one has come up to him or said anything. Probably more well know  in his home country. I will add that in my short visit with him, seemed like a nice guy.\n\nHe ran in an Australian marathon when he was out here filming about 5 years ago, I was a spectator and I know a lot of runners who were out there about his pace. None of us recognised him, read about it in the newspaper the next day.\n\nLast month makes it sound like ages ago haha. I’m still here recovering\n\nsorry, should have asked - how’d you get on? and most importantly, did you enjoy it?\n\nI loved it! Was my favorite marathon yet. Granted I’ve only done the LA marathon but the support and atmosphere was unmatched! Wish I got proper training in, but didn’t do so bad. Considering doing it again next year if I can’t get lucky with any of the majors. Hope you had a great time too\n\nfingers crossed for the majors for you! this was my seventh in dublin, but the first time that i’ve ever trained with a club, so it was a very different atmosphere at the end for me, checking other people’s times and going for a debrief in the pub. loved every second of it!\n\ni took the week after it off work to recover, and i still have no idea what day it is. feels like two days, two weeks and two months ago!\n\nHe ran with a human in a wheelchair. That was fucking awesome and I loved it. He was also running in like 4:15-4:30 minutes. If your PB is at risk running 6:20 kms because of a film crew, I don’t know what to tell you. It also wasn’t a major.\n\noh yeah, it was a great cause. her condition meant she could only be pushed for the last few kms, but his crew was around him for the whole thing.\n\ni absolutely admire that he did it, but more importantly he did it within the rules of the event.\n\nalso, to be clear, i mean if an influencer put my PB at risk i’d be enraged. i praise and give fist bumps to the groups pushing wheelchairs for marathons. their strength, stamina and cause is amazing.\n\nIt is true that no race can be just about one runner but are slower runners or those at non majors supposed to feel less proud of their pb?\n\nSomeone drove a petrol scooter onto the Berlin Marathon course this year trying to cross a closed road, nearly hitting lots of runners\n\nThat's bonkers.  I went out to spectate the Chicago Marathon and the amount of people that do weird shit to cross the course is quite astounding.\n\nI adore Philly! Honestly I enjoy watching a lot of run influencers (threw up in my mouth a bt admitting that) but there’s a huge problem when their content creation is harming the community they’re claiming to support.\n\nIt's ok to like influencers of any variety.  I tend to watch a lot of running videos before races to get amped or learn the course or maybe weird things that happen to look out for or also during training for some motivation (Jog On was great for this early on in my running journey).  \n\n  \nBut if I knew an influencer was doing something like this I would avoid them.  I will say, outside Philly and Jog On, every run video/vlog I've watched is a person filming themselves with a 360 camera or go pro or whatever.\n\nYeah, The Running Channel (which Phily's been on!) it's usually them carrying GoPros and also people on the sidelines.\n\nTo me Harry from Jog On is much more motivating and really brings the message across. His whole journey via the media, the efforts, the suffering and the changes he went through- that’s truly positive influencing. No ebikes or runners were harmed. 😂\n\nYeah Jog On was huge early on for me because the message was so positive, I still watch the videos now too!  I actually found Philly through them too.\n\nOr folks like Wes Plate who do their own filming with GoPros and selfie sticks, not getting in anyone’s way\n\nYep for sure!\n\nI would make sure I stay in their shot as long as possible lol. I can be very petty when someone is acting like an asshole.\n\nPhily and Daniel def embody pro energy, loads of respect and humility. This is how you influence and race. Her content is great too, without mile updates, without bikes capturing every minute. It's been awesome watching her rise. \n\nFor real. It’s runfluencer.\n\ngood grief\n\nHappy Cake Day!\n\naha thanks!\n\nliterally chasing likes\n\nBan from all TCS organized races please. What a jerk off.\n\nBan from WMM races. Sponsors won't want to pay someone who can't run the most prestigious events\n\nTCS is the title sponsor, not the race organizer. Unfortunately a sweeping ban would be harder to implement.\n\nDidn't this same dickhead bandit races I'm the past for content?\n\nYeah in Houston IIRC\n\nI think it's time that the platforms and sponsors are also made to take responsibility. He keeps at this nonsense because he gets sponsorship and revenue from Youtube and Tiktok. \n \nIf a TV presenter did this with a TV crew for a show that was broadcast then there would be consequences. Because it's an 'influencer' there is a limit to what can be done.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo a unicycle would be fine?\n\nGood on you for getting away!\n\nUnicycles still have cranks so I don’t think so\n\nAh, missed that.\n\nWhat an absolute knob.\n\nWhat a douchebag. Thinks hes the main character\n\nA world major ban feels like an appropriate response..\n\nNo way London lets him pull that shit\n\nIt’s too bad that he is so ENTITLED under the guise of bringing the experience to non-runners.  There are certainly better ways to do it.  I really hope that the NYC Marathon organizers will take some action.\n\nEvery time I see a thread about some bad influence by a running \"influencer\" I find out it's just this same dumbass who manages to do something terrible at seemingly every race he does.\n\nIsn't this the same douche nozzle who ran under someone else's name in Houston so that person would BQ?\n\nI had the “pleasure” of witnessing him and his entourage in Chicago last year. They did bring some wild energy to the surrounding runners and supporters as we ran along. The constant shouting at their phones and cameras was bizarre to me. I didn’t see anyone on any bikes though\n\nI wonder if he has some training program he could share with other potential influencers:\n\n\"Be sure that your long runs include yelling out your splits every mile. You can also try this on tempo runs, so it comes easily on race day.  Sometime I even do repeats - one mile at race pace yelling pace every minute, then a mile steady with no yelling. Repeat five or six times depending on your race goals.\n\nCross-training your delts and triceps is really important too - make sure your arms are strong enough to hold your phone out recording content even in those tough last few miles of a full or half marathon.\"\n\nYeah I saw him at Chicago last year and don’t remember anywhere.\n\nNYC Marathon should fine him for bringing in the bikes. I know when I race there is a section forbidding dogs, bikes, and strollers that you have to agree to when signing up.\n\nthey should have thrown this moron off the bridge - verrazano-ed koch \nthird ave - take your pick \n\ni freaking can’t stand these morons \n\npeople have trained and worked so hard for this race \n\nfuck this asshat\n\nWhy didn't the runners just knock them over?\n\nThere were complaints about him doing the same thing at the last two Austin Marathons. Seems like race directors care more about getting social media exposure than they do about the actual race experience of their runners \n\nPersonally I've had his cameraman pull into lane 1 and park sideways right in front of me while I was doing a track workout\n\nHis Austin crowd has some of the poorest trail etiquette. And that's saying a lot given the state of Austin trail running these years.\n\nGlad people coming around to this pov finally. He’s a pox.\n\nIf r/RunningCirclejerk was a person\n\nUgh influencers are ruining everything. My wife and I have been training for our first marathon, amidst this we have done a few local 5k’a and 10k’s and there are always people with their phones out talking to the camera while running. \n\nJust.. why? Why can’t you influence during training time and then give a post-race recap or something. Why do we have to have a phone out to record EVERYTHING? I feel the same way about Disney and Universal, those “influencers” are the worst and suck the magic out of the parks.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMaybe try not to catch battery charges over something as simple as running...\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssaulting someone that is constantly recording their life isn't a sound idea, just keep moving on with your life.\n\nThat is almost what I did at Chicago this year when someone stopped to take a selfie. My forearm definitely touched some part of her arm to prevent myself from getting smacked in the face, lol\n\nReally? I run a lot of races and have literally never seen this happening.\n\nI've seen it a few times but also don't care about someone filming themselves with their phone, doesn't affect me at all and if it makes them money,  cool. It's a world away from having a whole crew on bikes though, that's fucked up\n\nTell you what if I train for months for a big race like this and I got run into by an idiot on an e-bike with a camera they are getting 'accidentally' forcefully removed from the bike.\n\nso in the 3 hours he was on the 26 mile course, no race official was able to stop the guy on the bike and get him off the course?\n\nthe guy is an asshole for sure, but how was this allowed to even happen?\n\nThere are like thousands of cops on the course, why the fuck couldn't any organizations have him removed?\n\nNot a police matter. The last thing we want is cops enforcing rules by private organizations.\n\nI wish he'd keep his shirt on\n\nIt’s the camera crew AND running shirtless for me. You notice he was one of maybe two people total without a shirt. Nothing inherently wrong with running shirtless, I get that it may be more comfortable for some, but it is very much “look at me” behavior in this context.\n\nYea, running in Houston I have seen many people running shirtless. Depends on conditions. Personally I like the wicking provided by a dri-fit shirt. But wow at this tool.\n\nIs this the same guy who was accused of cheating in Houston?\n\nYikes, this freaking Choi with his Runna crew is announced to be in the Honululu Marathon there next month  with me, what can I do? I am seriously worry about the course safety since I heard there will be a lot first timer as well.\n\n(I just address my concern to the Honululu Marathon committee, I guess that's all I can do to help, finger cross they will do something at least not allowing him to bring his little biker)\n\nSacrifice any attempts at your own race, and just run between him and his crew waving your arms and making extremely unpleasant welching sounds\n\nWhich bands give the most copyright strikes on YouTube? Make a playlist. Run with a speaker. Unusable footage.\n\nDisney soundtrack\n\nNintendo soundtracks\n\nLet It Go on repeat for three hours, let’s do this.\n\nThe Eagles and Don Henley's stuff are among the harshest.\n\nLIFE IN THE FAST LANE! 😂😂😂\n\nDarude Sandstorm on repeat\n\nWhile that is a great option for the question, it has an undesirable side effect: anyone listening to Sandstorm is compelled to run at their vo2 max pace.\n\nOne time I put on Darude. Ended up wining a bronze medal.\n\nDon’t worry too much about it. I’m not defending him, his behavior was absolutely unacceptable and I’d like to see him banned from all USATF sanctioned events, but most people at NYC marathon were completely unaffected. You might not even see him at your marathon and if you do, just keep your distance and don’t lose your focus. He needs to see consequences for his actions but I hope you don’t let this stress you out or take the joy out of your upcoming marathon.\n\nThanks for the advice. I am going to take extra care and enjoy the beautiful course for sure.\n\nThis is the ticket!  He’s sponsored by Runna?  They need to take the heat for their athlete then.  Let’s come down on them if this is true.\n\nTheir cofounder was running with him the entire race\n\nDamn I was thinking about trying Runna in the spring when I’m back in training for races. But I don’t wanna support a company that’s doing / actively supporting shit like this\n\nThey don't!  Dropped him\n\nRunna has since dropped him!\n\nHe's an annoying douchebag and races shouldn't allow this, but the chances of your safety being negatively affected by him and his bike entourage are effectively zero in a race of tens of thousands of people. In general in a race, if someone is being a moron or erratic or something, just don't be literally right next to them and you'll be absolutely fine. \n\nGet him on a watchlist so he can't fly?\n\nShit your dacks in front of his cameras\n\nGonna guess after all this blow back Runna is gonna step back from him for Honolulu and the race will nip his behavior in the bud.\n\nJust ban him from the race like anyone else would have been. It’s just one participant in one race. Simple. Life will go on for everyone and the lesson will be learned.\n\nI saw him twice in a week. Once in Austin as he and his team were using a hotel bathroom and then in Chicago at the end of a Believe in the Run shakeout event. He rolled up to the shakeout with his brother in E-Bikes. \n\nHe seemed like a total tool.\n\nI just saw an article from Runner’s World that he got a DQ and banned from future NYRR 😬\n\nhttps://www.runnersworld.com/news/a62810736/matt-choi-dq-nyc-marathon/\n\nOf course it was matt choi and not kofuzi or someone more self aware and humble\n\nInfluencers vlogging on their Go Pros and cameras are such a pain in the ass.\n\nBikes is another level.\n\nFuck off with that\n\ni urge you all to please send emails on this matter\n\nI always wondered if these ass hat types of influencers would run faster if they just actually ran instead of shouting at cameras and cellphones for 3 hours.\n\nFuck this clown\n\nNYRR just posted that he is now banned from future NYRR Races and has been disqualified. \n\nNEW YORK ROAD RUNNER STATEMENT--MATT CHOI DISQUALIFIED  \nAfter a review and due to violations of World Athletics rules, and New York Road Runners’ Code of Conduct and Rules of Competition, NYRR has disqualified Matt Choi from the 2024 TCS New York City Marathon and removed him from the results. He has been banned from any future NYRR races.\n\n[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunNYC/comments/1gk5hl0/comment/lvinjiu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) for the reddit comment.\n\nUsed to like this guy. Too much fame got in his head\n\nIsn’t this the guy that got in trouble for running a race under someone’s else name because he wanted to run some race so badly that he took someone’s else spot in the rece.\n\nExcept if he wanted to run so badly, he would have just signed up on time like everyone else or found another race and not try to defend why it is ok for him to run for someone else.\n\nIf a bike got in my way mid marathon, I would literally just push them over.\n\nWhy don’t they simply ban him for life from these events?\n\nWhy don’t stewards/security stop the bike?\n\nI was incredibly lucky to get into the NYC Marathon years ago on my first attempt. Many people have to try for years. It is so difficult to get into.\n\nYou train for months. Many, many 4AM runs. And for 99%, it is a once in a lifetime experience. \n\nI would be incredibly pissed if I was just trying to hit my pace and there was some asshole covering the blue line with an entire crew of people not even running. \n\nScrew this guy.\n\ni read the title and immediately knew it was matt choi…\n\nSeriously fck this guy\n\nI didn’t even have to open the link to know who this was lol\n\nNever wanted to be a hater, but I always found his content to be so cringe. Glad people are calling him out on his BS now. Dude really does think he’s the main character.\n\nSame guy ran under another’s name/bib at the Houston marathon so I don’t think he really cares what the rules are.\n\nI saw him last yr running as a guide for a gal that had a visual impairment. He made it about himself more than about the person he was supposed to guide. He seems nice but is kind of a frat goon at heart\n\nHe does not seem nice lol\n\nAt some point that gal had to have thought. “This is starting to feel like it’s about him.”\n\nI knew who it was before I even clicked.\n\nDid this asshole get dropped as a child? How does one end up like a self entitled tool?\n\nThere is not one single \"influencer\" on the planet that shouldn't be yeeted into the sun.\n\nI am so glad I don't know who this \"influencer\" is. I don't understand how our culture has become so riddled with this garbage. This a-hole thinks he's \"spreading awareness about running\"... people were well aware of running before he and his idiot camera crew came along. Get a real job, FFS.\n\nFuck this tool and every other influencer. They’re all out there in their own echo chambers posting stupid shit like “Electric energy! Contagious bro! LFG! I got that DAWG in me! We out here!”\n\nMeanwhile, Truett Hanes, while wearing jeans, quietly smokes soyboy Choi with a 2:50 and no e-bike escort.\n\nWhat a self-centred jerk.\n\nThis guy fucking sucks and this ain’t his first time doing this. Should be banned for life.\n\nWhy didnt people just push them over , I think thats the only way he could have understood.\n\nThe entitlement of this despicable man is insane. How was this allowed??\n\nI can’t believe he was allowed on the course with an e-bike.  How does this happen//\n\nBeing an influencer looks like its own kind of hell imo so I'd say the punishment precedes the crime here. It is pretty funny that he claims to be \"bringing awareness to running,\" an activity humans have been doing for 2 million years.\n\nlots of races already sell out in less than a day, sometimes a couple of hours. he doesn't need to bring awareness to running.\n\nFuck that dude. Any sort of filming should be banned at races just like every sort of music listening.\n\nI was thinking of doing a half marathon in a pretty scenic location but the idea of being part of a backdrop for a bunch of influencers who might hit me with their e-bikes and plaster me on their page absolutely ruins this for me. Can’t I reach for my dreams in peace?\n\nwas he at least wearing his own bib for NYC? dude has a history of disrespect.\n\nDid the race itself allow him to have a crew on bikes? That's the craziest thing about this imo\n\nWish enough people would see this and unfollowed this clown.\nWhat a terrible human being…\n\nI knew this guy was an asshole\n\nBoth him and his other influencer buddy Chris Chungy need to be banned from these events.\n\nStick + spoke = profit\n\nShould be banned for breaching the rules. It is busy enough already no need for a circus.\n\nSadly, banning won't do much. The views and race are done. What would be nice is if this could be pushed up to Abbott so this clown is never allowed into another Major.\n\nReally need people to stop paying attention to this clown and don’t give him any exposure and then money will dry up. He will use any publicity to advertise. Hate these so call influencers…\n\nMeh, I don't mind 'em as long as they respect everyone else around them. This guy just seemed to go over the top. I don't even know how NYRR would allow e-bikes on the course or if their insurance contract would even cover this. It's nuts.\n\nWell looks like he is barred from future races by NYRR and Runna had dropped him\n\nWhat a douche-nozzle. \n\nThere was shitty behavior in many spots of that race. I didn’t run this year, but have in the past. I was there with a squad cheering on our running group, so I can mostly speak to fans where we were within the last 3 miles. We were generally disappointed in a lot of behavior. Crowd creep into the course was horrendous to the point where it was impeding and slowing down runners at a critical juncture. We saw someone on a BIKE accompanying a runner drawing attention to the fact that the runner was pregnant? There were dogs that got onto the course. Crowds were getting onto the course to take selfies with the runners. (Not specific family/friends, which I get and support as long as it happens on the edges of the course. People were just taking pictures to prove that they were there.) There seems to be a prevailing thought that “after the first 100 runners, nobody cares!” That is obviously wrong and disrespectful to participants who have been training for MONTHS. some of this stuff can’t be stopped, but hopefully the Matt Choi drama spurs some change. It’s needed.\n\nUnacceptable!!! This is why dogs should be allowed in marathons in a controlled number. Natural enemies of cyclists, they will destroy the enemies quickly, without any legal consequences to the owners.\n\nRunning into other runners is totally unacceptable! Why is this guy even “cool” or “influential” when he doesn’t even show respect to the sports and others who trained hard for it?\n\nThis is a far cry away from just having a selfy stick.\n\nHe was DQ'd and Banned from the NYC marathon :)\n\nGive him and his crew the Kathrine Switzer treatment!\n\nI’m looking forward to when people stop giving recognition to “influencers” and start making their own decisions instead of allowing a 10 second video to take what little money they have.\n\nHe bandited a bib at Houston Marathon and had ebikes on course there as well. He’s a multiple time offender and a straight up dbag\n\nIt should be banned once and forever.\n\nLooks like he just posted an apology to his ig!\n\nWell, thank god we have 3 hours of footage of some dillhole running shirtless when it's a high of 55 degrees and annoying the crap out of every person around him. Definitely worth disrupting the experience and months of training of countless others to have that. As this universe winks out of existence many, many years from now, there will be loads of people thanking a higher power in their final moments that they at least got to be around to see this. How lucky we are. Thank you for the content, sir. You've improved not only the sport of running, but also the human spirit. Content is king. Hail content."

    "all_comment_text": "I think one small reason that may contribute is a shift towards the idea that anyone can run. There’s a run club near me that has paces from 6:00/miles all the way down to walking and it creates a really great positive atmosphere where anyone is welcome. Running can be daunting, but with couch to 5ks and a presence on social media of ‘slow’ runners (12:00/miles) I think more people are giving it a shot. Myself included!\n\nThis is what allowed me to get to where I am 7-8ish months in of running consistently! The concept of zone 2 running made things much more appealing since my previous view of running was just going as fast as I could and try to sustain it\n\nI’m always in zone 4 or 5 🥲\n\nZone 3 and 4 for me. I don’t mind though because I rarely feel like I’m depleted of energy when I finish\n\nIt’s so good to see someone else say this. The only way I can be in Zone 2 is to maintain a slow walk. My heart rate jumps up immediately with activity but I’m also usually pleasantly refreshed after I run in a higher zone. I feel like I’m broken. Lol\n\nYou can train to improve this!   Takes a bit of effort but after a few weeks, you'll notice a huge change.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on what I could do? Or could you point me in the direction of what to google? I am using the NRC app right now and I do TRY to keep it super slow on my easy days but my heart rate jumps up immediately. I’m a super slow runner and I’m fine with that. I’d love to figure this out though because I DO want to get better the right way.\n\nHere's a thing with zones - many people base them on heart rate. HR zones are less reliable than power data, because HR data reflects all stress (exercise, overheating, poor nutrition/hydration, stress at work, poor sleep or other fatigue etc.), but exercise stress is what will make you stronger+faster.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get better is by increasing volume. But big jumps in running volume (or high running volume period) have a higher risk of bone or connective tissue injury. \n\nBone injuries like shin splints often occur a month after an increase in volume, because it takes that long for your bone to \"fatigue\". It's not fatigue per se, but bone is actively removed by osteocytes to be rebuilt stronger. It takes another 2 months (3 months total) for that bone to be replaced, and up to a year for full strength to be built (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8316280/).\n\nYou can safely increase volume very rapidly by walking or biking a lot on the side. Maybe a 1h walk is equivalent to 15 minutes of running and 1h of Z2 biking is equivalent to 20-30 minutes of running, but without the impact stress. \n\n-----------------\n\nWith that out of the way, there are lots of training plans that are tailored to various levels of fitness, goals, and time constraints. Pick one you like.\n\nA pet peeve of mine is when people have to choose plans based on a desired \"race pace\", then having workouts prescribed based on that, but that's a different comment.\n\nEdit: minor cleanup\n\nI was almost completely inactive 4 months ago and on same boat as you (heart rate goes very high very fast when running)\n\nI have been using Jeff Galloway’s “Run Walk Run” method and it has been working well for me. I started with 5 seconds run -&gt; 30 seconds walk -&gt; repeat, and gradually increase the running time from 5-&gt;10-&gt;15-&gt;20-&gt;30 while the walking time is always 30 seconds. Even within the running time, you don’t have to push hard — you can jog as slow as you want. \n\nNow I can maintain 80% of the time in zone 2 with 20/30 run/walk ratio (IMO it’s perfectly fine to drift into zone 3 sometimes). I’m still worse than “beginner runners” but better than couch people, and it’s great to see myself to improve in measurable ways.\n\nJust to piggy-back on this comment, I did something similar but more based on monitoring HR.\n\nI would run until my HR tipped over into Zone 3, then walk until my HR dipped below Zone 1. Rinse and repeat. Eventually I was jogging in Z2!\n\n[deleted]\n\nCouch to 5K taught me how to run slow. More accurately it helped me adapt to a point that I could do zone 2 runs.  It's a great entry point for non-runners with a format that meets people where they are and remains perfectly viable after you finish the initial program, or allows you to progress to a point where you can start using more advanced training programs.\n\nGood point. I only recently started paying attention to heart rate and could run in zone 2 straight away, but as I’d been doing “most of your runs should be at an easy pace” for a few years I guess was pretty much doing zone 2 training already without realising.\n\nThere are Couch to 10k/Bridge to 10k programs that keep the Couch to 5k pattern going! I'm working on one now, and my run today is 20 minute run, 3 minute walk, 20 minute run.\n\nCommenting so I remember to come back to this, I’d also like to know\n\nWhen I was researching this the other day what I got was “don’t worry too much about your heart rate” instead the key was “can you have a conversation without gasping for breath?” If you can then you’re going slow enough. A few mentioned that if you struggle to maintain the ability to talk then take many walking breaks to bring yourself back down. Some others suggested you’re going too fast if you start breathing with your mouth- my lung capacity might as well not exist so I’m ignoring that. Maybe in a month I’ll be at a place where I can breathe through my nose the whole time.\n\nI’ve only done 2 runs as Z2 and I’m forcing myself to basically do a run that’s too fast to be a walk but also could be considered a walk by someone with long legs (about 4.5 mph when I checked my speed with MapMyRun) \n\nSo, shuffle run and then take a lot of brisk walking breaks. Don’t focus too much on your HR right now but you can check it as the weeks go by to see if it’s finally starting to settle down.\n\nThis is what I was at when I first started. I actually work with an s&amp;c coach and he brought me up to where I am. I walked 90% of the time with one running day building up from 3k adding 1k a week to 5k then added a second day of running starting with 2k on the second day and repeating the process. During this, avoiding zone 4-5 was virtually impossible for me. Then i incorporated walk + runs where i would start walking when i hit the top end of zone 3. \n\nId say a big difference for me was when we calculated my zones based on %HRR vs max heart rate method. Felt like my zones were more accurate after that.\n\nI’m the same. I use training peaks though for an app so then i can send runs to my watch and it tells me when to run/ walk etc based on my scheduled run for that day and itll notify me if my heart rate is too high which is very common for me so then i walk for a little bit to let my heart relax and then get back to it\n\nHey I’m in this position too, what sort of training would help here ?\n\nI love you guys! I try to stay in zone 3 for 1/2 to 2/3 of my long runs, otherwise zone 4 is my happy place. Colleagues talk about feeling like their hearts are going to explode at 20-30 BPM lower than my comfort zone and I think I'm some kind of malfunctioning equipment.\n\nI started out there. I'd run until my HR hit the top end of Zone 2 then walk until it went back down again, then start over. Over time I got to where I could (slowly) run for seemingly forever without my HR going over Zone 2. It took a few months IIRC.\n\nHow long have you been running like that?\n\nI ran zone 4 and 5 for about a year until I realized that I absolutely hated running. It wasn't until I figured out that I was allowed to run in 2 and 3, that I really started to enjoy running and found a maintain my regime over a period of years.\n\nI still do a 4 or 5 about once a week or so, but everything else is more enjoyable.\n\nI just ran 1:47 Half Marathon and 47min 10k, also did a 45 mile trail run last year. I can run really fast, but the only way I became fast was doing 90% of my weekly runs in Z2. As they say, slow is smooth and smooth is fast.\n\nThis is a big factor in people being comfortable both with running and with posting/talking about running.\n\nOur group has runners who BQ every marathon they run, ultra runners with 50 hundred milers on their resume who will happily come to a group run where there are people who run walk 5k's. I am tertiarily affiliated with 5 or 6 groups and all of them have the same dynamic. Everyone supports each other. I feel like that allows someone who isn't fast or can't go far to be comfortable in saying \"I run\" where they may have hidden in the past\n\nBQ?\n\nBoston Qualify\n\nI'm basically just starting and I'm Jeffing like 13 minute miles lol. I want to do a half marathon in the fall.\n\nJust did a half marathon running 12 min miles. Was a great experience and would highly recommend it.\n\nHey, you are getting more bang for the buck than these faster folks.\n\nThe course was two laps for the full marathon, and the amount of elite marathon runners that passed me and said “keep going!” And stuff was so unexpected and so awesome.\n\nI just did a half on basically no training (just regular 3-4mi runs and a couple of 10ks) and averaged about 14:00/mile. Had a blast.\n\nJust did the my first half at 13+ minutes took almost 3 hours. I’ve been obese and have been shedding weight since I got into running\n\nI finished a half running at 11 minute pace, which was actually a bit faster than I planned. I think that the positive environment during the race really contributed to this. I've only been running for about ten months, so I'm really surprised by the amount of progress I've been able to make!\n\nI started running in September and recently ran my fastest mile in 13:05... But I remember when I started and physically couldn't run more than 2 minutes at a time. Progress happens, but sometimes we can only see it in hindsight!\n\nI never knew my name Jeff could be a verb haha\n\nHalf marathon is a great distance \n\nIt’s a challenge, but feels easily achievable, and you don’t have to devote your entire life training for it\n\nThe club thing really hit the nail on the head. People are looking for new social groups, and run clubs are one of the most welcoming groups! \n\nThere's also obviously beer leagues and clubs for other sports too. Running is just one anybody can really do knowing their pace.\n\nI thought slow was 17:00/mile. I'm just trying to break into the 12's so count me less than slow! 🤪\n\nMe and two friends who never ran got into it through couch to 5k haha\n\nYep, I’m in the 12 min mile group at the moment because whenever I try to drop below about 10 one or another of my joints or muscles blows up and I can’t run at all for months. Recovering from my tensor fasciae latae flipping me the bird right now.\n\nWe made our own run club after a year of running. We got some elites that run 18 minute 5ks, to newbies with 8:30/km paces. It’s all about having fun wile running with your friends. We started with 25 original members from our town and neighboring towns and we’re now at 50+ members. I just hit em up on our group chat 30 minutes before my run and almost every time somebody’s gonna join me for a quick 10k.\n\nExactly this, my run club has a front group that starts at 630 pace and accelerates through the 8 mile run through a 1.5 mile walk option\n\nThis is so true, so much free information out there on the Internet and GPS watches can act as a solid coach so there is very little barriers to entry now. I think running had a lot of bad stigma to it, ' running is bad for your knees', 'cardio burns muscle' etc so a lot of those things are being put to bed.\n\nThe running community is so awesome too. Generally speaking runners are super encouraging to people that are new to running. No judgement for going slow, everyone is on their own journey.\n\nThat’s amazing!\n\nStruggling over here to get to the low 7 minute mile pace. I’m also 230 lbs which isn’t helping my situation\n\nI think running picked up a lot of steam during covid when gyms and group sports were paused. Marathon sign ups shattering records kind of tracks with this.\n\nThis is exactly what happened for me. I started running in the morning in what used to be my commute time when we switched to at-home during Covid, and I just kept it up. My office decided to stay hybrid, so I can still run 3 weekdays each week plus weekend times. Since I started, I've run three half marathons and I'm now training for my first full in November. I can never get over the fact that I have trained for all these runs in an amount of time I used to spend just sitting in traffic every day.\n\nI'm hoping to stay hybrid as long as I can, it's done wonders for my running! Pre-covid, I completed 2 half marathons with one after-work midweek run, a spin class, and a long run on weekends. Now I have time to run 4x/week, still go to spin, and at least tell myself I'll work in strength training too. Completed my second marathon a month ago, already have a handful of 10ks, 3 halfs, and a full coming up in the next 7 months.\n\nThat's me.  Started trail running when the lockdowns hit, and now i can't imagine stopping.\n\nYeah I agree, same with hiking. Since lockdowns it seems everyone is a hiker/runner 🤣\n\nUnfortunately not everyone knows how to treat nature.  Some of my favorite hiking trails became absolute dumping grounds over the lockdowns.  Very frustrating.\n\nYeah it blows my mind when I see rubbish &amp; left over BBQ/fires out in the trails. Can never quite get my head round why someone would litter at all, let alone in a place like that.\n\nCan confirm this. I’ve always have been an active person however, I never was really a runner. More of a swimmer. But when my college went online, the endless mundanity of it made me go crazy and I picked up running and have now fallen in love with it. I’ve ran a handful of races in the past 2 years.\n\nThis was me. Running had always been something I did to be a better hockey player in highschool/college, but I hated it. Over COVID I got “good” at it, at least good enough that I enjoyed it. And now I’ve dropped hockey because I’d honestly rather just run.\n\nJust look at the applications for marathons and other races. Races that have never sold out are now selling out half a year ahead of time.\n\n\n[More than 840,000 runners entered the ballot for the 2025 London Marathon](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/news/a60646626/2025-london-marathon-record-applicants/)\n\nThe previous record, set in 2023 for people applying for the 2024 event, was 578,304\n\nThat's an increase of 261,696 or 45% over the previous year\n\nThat's incredible numbers wow\n\nI was going to cite this number but you beat me to it. I’m a casual runner here in London (ie sports top, shorts and running shoes then I’m ready to go) but the amount of people I see in Battersea park prepped like they’re running an ultra astounds me.\n\nIt’s becoming a bit of a cult, at least here in London, so I’m wondering how long it’ll last for those lot.\n\nMaybe they are running an ultra. Just because you see them in Battersea Park doesn’t mean they started in and will end in Battersea Park. I’ve been seeing a lot of talk recently from people seemingly judging others on their “prepped” kit, and it baffles me. You don’t know where they’ve been or where they’ll going, or what they need to carry. For example, my long run takes me through Victoria Park. But by the time I get there, I’ve already got 16 miles behind me. So you better believe I’m prepped for it.\n\n&gt; but the amount of people I see in Battersea park prepped like they’re running an ultra astounds me.\n\nPlenty of people who run HM distance or longer will wear a hydration vest with a water bladder plus gels etc. and maybe they want to carry stuff \"just in case\"\n\nI did it myself when marathon training because i didn't have to carry anything in my hands. And as I was going to wear it for the race * it was better to wear it in training.\n\n*My water bladder had electrolytes which I sipped every km, rather than getting plain water at a water station every 5km or so. Kept me better hydrated and also reduced plastic waste on the day. Plus it carried my gels and other fuel etc. yes it was overkill and the weight no doubt slowed me a little, but I wasn't going for a BQ or anything.\n\nCould it also be that there are a fewer races? I feel like a few big races in my city haven’t restarted since their first pandemic cancellation.\n\nETA: I was thinking more about longer races (10 miles/16km or more).\n\nDoesn't feel like that in the UK - it seems they're putting on more to make up for it.\n\nSame here in the US, at least in my city. There's a race almost every other week where i live.  Then again I live in LA where it's pretty much the same cool weather all year.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYep I went to sign up for the Melbourne marathon half marathon in jan and it was sold out🙃\n\n[deleted]\n\nhahah yep it is, sucks for you as well. Tbf maybe I’m part of the problem I started running late last year\n\nCould also be a little bit of Baader Meinhof phenomon which is basically once you have recently learned or focused on something, it appears that you start noticing it everywhere. I also agree with the other comments that it has definitely increased a ton since Covid and in the spring/warm weather it always gets more busy.\n\nExactly what I came to say... yes, Def increased since COVID, but confirmation bias plays a role too.\n\nWith social media algorithms, it's probably more likely that they genuinely are seeing more posts/articles/ads about it.\n\nIn terms of the theoretical uptick in runners on the streets, it's probably what you're saying. OP wasn't paying attention to runners until they themselves started running again, at which point they noticed other runners and thought they were \"new.\"\n\nMaybe but also I think social media played a big part. \n\nI live in a heavily ethnic town that leans conservative and I remember running with biker shorts and a sweater and being followed. \n\nNow I see some chick running with a bra and short in the same town post pandemic like a couple of days ago. I've also seen hs students (male) running with small running shorts with no t shirt. \n\nThat never really happened around here at all but it did in neighboring college towns. \n\nSo I've seen an uptick of people working out in My town a little before the pandemic maybe around 2017. I think social media plays a big role because I've seen so many people and people.who never cared to workout , workout.\n\n&gt;Baader Meinhof phenomon\n\nIt's more widely known as the \"frequency Illusion\" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency\\_illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion)  \n\nAs long-time runner I always notice how many runners I see at place I visit, but I think there's some data that Covid has caused an increase in many activities, not only running but hiking, camping, etc.  I'm just too lazt to look it up now\n\nYou can clearly track the increase in popularity from ballot registrations. Look at London year by year and notice post 2020\n\nYeah, this happened to me with the brand Gym Shark\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw some video on Instagram about its founder, and ever since then I notice people everywhere wearing the brand\n\nI think we’re in a fitness boom rather than a running-specific one. Instagram, the cost of nights out, and a general increase of the visibility of the importance of healthy lifestyle choices all have a part to play I think.\n\nThis is probably more accurate. The gym I go to is packed these days like it never was before.\n\nThis is just my opinion, but I feel like it has a lot to do with a combination of \"runfluencing\" on TikTok and Instagram, and the running community as a whole becoming more open and accessible to people of all paces and sizes. \n\nRunning influencers have been around for a while on Instagram, YouTube, etc. but I feel like within the past couple of years there's really been a boom of them. The short-form Reel/TikTok style of video is the driving factor for this IMO... rather than having to make a 10 or 15-minute \"training vlog\" they can do quick videos that are a minute or 2 long. It's easier to make and easier to watch. With more running influencers comes more influencers from different backgrounds- slow runners, plus sized runners, etc. I've seen so many of them come across my FYP and explore page, and I feel like a lot of folks who had never tried running before see them and think \"This is something I could try too.\"\n\nThis really goes along with my other thought, which is that running as a whole has become a lot more inclusive. I started running in 2016, and I definitely remember being put off by some of the comments I would see here and in other running communities that were along the lines of \"Race cutoffs should be anything slower than a 10:00/mile\" and \"you aren't really running if you walk any part of a race,\" etc. I went to running groups in my area that were advertised as \"everyone is welcome!\" but they set off at an 8:30 pace and I was left by myself. Now, in my local area, there are specific groups for slower runners that go at about 10:00/mile pace or 12:00/mile pace, or have run/walk options. There's plus sized groups, women's groups, queer groups, sober groups (since a lot of run groups are based around running and then going to a brewery or bar), you name it, there's probably a group for it (if you live in a bigger city). And maybe there's always been these groups, they just weren't advertised as much or were as big.\n\nFunniest thing is that suddenly the gym bros who always feared cardio due to „gain-loss“ are now „hybrid athletes“.\n\nMy hairdresser said: \"I saw on TikTok that you bring throwaway clothes for the Boston Marathon.. is that true?\" I explained that it was true for most marathons. It was funny. Learning about it on social is definitely real.\n\nI second this for sure. I used to be into weight lifting a few years ago and always heard that running was discouraged. Then I saw a bunch of hybrid influencers saying you could run slow and stay in zone 2 and overall build your endurance while still building muscle. I started really slow runs and now I’m training for a half marathon and lifting a lot less. Maybe three times a week, but my overall health feels a lot better. The TikTok influencers are really good at getting you into it these days lol\n\nIt definitely has to do with the runfluencing. The current crop of teens/young adults see it as a social thing as much as a fitness trend. (Source: I have three teens) My adult son prefers to go run clubbing rather than night clubbing.\n\nI saw an article awhile back that said something like half of all runners just started running since Covid. A good way to exercise when the gyms where closed or people wanted to avoid close contact. \n\nI'll see if I can find that article.\n\nEdit well, I may have misremembered.\n This one said it's closer to 28% started running since Covid\n[https://runrepeat.com/new-pandemic-runners](https://runrepeat.com/new-pandemic-runners)\n\nThat's a 4 year interval though. I wonder if previously it was pretty typical for \\~1/4 of runners to have started in the last 4 years.\n\nZone 2 really changed the game and accessibility\n\nWhen I first got into running it was just, get out and see how fast I can run a 5k.. Thank god for zone 2s 🤣\n\nIt definitely changed my life.\n\nHow? Genuine question so please let me hear your experience\n\nUse to feel like I need to give a 110 % on every run. Would only be able to run a mile or two before body craps out. Thought something was wrong with me. Learned about conversational pace running and all the sudden I can run 5+ miles.\n\nYup and eventually your easy run pace becomes so much faster, sometimes faster than when you first started and was giving your 110% (at that time).\n\nCost of living crisis (in the UK at least) = less disposable income to spend on the gym. Running is free (ish!)\n\nEmphasis on the ish. Cause I’ve been spending on running lately. Supplements, snacks, socks, sunglasses, headphones, lights, vests.\n\nHah exactly! Added the ish as I've currently got a new pair of Brooks in my basket online and debating if I really do need them or not....\n\nI don't want to know how much I've spent on running kit. Thankfully I know it's not near as much as cycling, but still a lot has been spent.\n\n&gt;  how much I've spent on running kit.\n\nYou're not spending.\n\nYou're investing!\n\nThis is very true. I do my research and buy kit that will last, and by getting quality stuff it makes the run more enjoyable.\n\nWell short of shoes you really don’t NEED most of that stuff, especially as a beginner.\n\nYou don't really even need [shoes](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=healthy+barefoot+running&amp;i=stripbooks&amp;crid=2O2XP6C0037IW&amp;sprefix=healthy+barefoot+running%2Cstripbooks%2C185&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss):\n\nI have none of the things you listed, except headphones which are the same i use for commuting.\n\nI'l agree faster plated shoes can be very expensive, but then you can just opt for cheap daily trainers like Puma Velocity Nitro 2\n\nI recently shifted to training for ultramarathons and  the longer training sessions and time on my feet led to me investing in proper gear but I do agree that generally speaking running has a very low barrier to entry and all you need is a somewhat decent pair of trainers.\n\nMy running costs about 10x what my gym membership costs :D\n\nAlso work from home. The biggest thing about running for me (mid 30s with a kid) is the time. I just do not have the time to properly train at an office job. But since I work from home I can easily get an hour or two hour session in when it's low. \n\nSomething else (and this is a total hypothesis) is that alcohol is becoming less popular in social gatherings. It used to be every social thing involved booze, and now people are looking more into active life.\n\nI’ve learnt to never skimp on running shoes. Especially when road running. I religiously change shoes every 400 miles, which is 6 months for me.\n\nI've run two road marathons barefoot. (Naked feet.)\n\nI'm not Kenyan or 125 lbs, or biomechanically perfect - the opposite.\n\nSomeone did a really good job of rebranding \"jogging\" as \"zone 2\" and now it's cool again.\n\nWhat's the difference and why should anyone care whatever some gatekeepers call your sport ?\n\nUsername doesn't check out. I was just making a joke that no-one uses the term jogging anymore. Fashions come and go\n\nI though you were poking at how some of the people on this sub call anything under certain pace jogging and not running. Some people are just elitist like that.\n\nIs there much training/fitness/weight loss value in this? Generally think of zone 2 for recovery runs and not much else. Even your base runs are gonna be like 80%+ in zone 3, right? \n\nGenuinely curious cause I haven't seen this trend going around.\n\nThere's a running club near me that's really taking off and I love it. \n\nTo be honest though I feel were just in an active life boom. Alcohol is less popular and people are looking for new ways to socialize.\n\nIsn't this normal every year around this time due to the marathon season and weather improving? People get inspired by seeing people run Marathons and they think about doing the same\n\nRecord numbers applying for London Marathon for example means there is more to it though\n\nYeah that was my question as I’m new to running, is this like a regular yearly occurrence where the hype picks up every year &amp; drops off? For some reason I’ve never noticed so many people running &amp; creating running content as much as they have this year - but I’m not sure if it’s just because I’m now running &amp; more aware 🤣\n\nSocial media is pretty powerful these days so on Instagram, Reddit and Youtube if you consume a little bit of running content then you'll get force fed it. I experienced the same a few months back mainly with IG reels.\n\nI'm unsure on the statistics around marathon season and how long hype/interest stays but I feel like atleast for me with family it lasts a month and then they forget all about it haha\n\nRecord numbers of people are alive now\n\nBut last year something like 500,000 applied, whereas this year it was 800,000 - the world population hasn't jumped 40% in a year.\n\nRemote work allowed for a lot of people to pick up running.  I’d assume this also convinced a lot of friends to start running, and it’s been a snowballing effect.  \n\nThere’s also been a push to train “healthier”.  As someone who started running back in 2015, I felt there was pressure to train fast, run fast, all the time or else you’re not a real runner. Now I feel the culture has changed a lot to encourage everyone to give it a chance. There’s no need to run a 5k under some arbitrary number, it’s awesome just to try it out and finish a race!\n\n&gt;There’s no need to run a 5k under some arbitrary number\n\nYet.\n\nI will get that under 20 one day !\n\nBesides sports, running is also becoming more of a fashionable and instagrammable lifestyle option for some people: [https://www.ft.com/content/b63eb47a-1602-4fc3-8c3b-42f8427ac507](https://www.ft.com/content/b63eb47a-1602-4fc3-8c3b-42f8427ac507)\n\nI was just talking about this over the weekend - I think yes a bit - there’s some data to support it (record entries for races, etc). Thoughts behind it are that trends with exercise shift - running is viewed as “cheap” compared to boutique fitness classes where you need to pay to attend a class weekly or multiple times per week. With running “all you need” are shoes and a lot of people already have some sort of fitness wearable (apple watch, etc) that will help them track it. \n\nA lot of people got back into running during the pandemic since it could be done alone and/or outdoors - and are now entering races or entering races more regularly. \n\nPlus yes, your social media gives you what you’re interested in. It’s biased toward you. You hear and see what you want to.\n\nAccording to Google Trends interest levels are currently around ~85/100 and in 2004 they were ~60/100 based on google search volume.\n\n[Chart I made with a trend line showing the increase over time](https://postimg.cc/dLz7jkZp)\n\nI lost all my weight on a bike from the beginning of covid, recently switched to running since I won’t blow out my knees with all that extra weight. I just love cardio\n\nEarly 2000s. 2010.  2017.  Those were peak years in my area.  We are on an upswing again.\n\nI have been running since 2010 I would say there waves here &amp; there. There was an upswing around 2012-2014, I remember how big the Nike Women’s Marathon and Disneyland races were then where they utilized lotteries because they were selling out. Seemed like popularity tapered off with some of those popular races getting discontinued. Then in 2018 I saw a lot more races again, rock n roll in particular was rapidly expanding their locations, but halted during the start of covid. \n\nI will state I do think running groups have been increasing in popularity over the last few years though. Running definitely seems to be switching from a solo activity mindset to a social opportunity. I think last year (2023) my running group was doubled the size the summer before (2022).\n\nIt’s a social media trend. While cool, makes it annoying for lottery races.\n\nGarmin stock price is up 70% from October. Some of that is probably running.\n\nI feel like running has become less popular since I started 20+ years ago.  Marathon training groups that once had 200 runners now have 40.  Exception: EVERYONE wants to run a world majors marathon and it’s almost impossible to get in!!\n\nAs a Gen Xer, I've particularly noticed a huge uptick in people my age taking up or returning to running. Virtually everyone who was an athlete in some sport in high school in my class is now also a runner, especially half marathoners. I recently had a reunion of sorts with my college wrestling team and about 80% of us now run marathons.\n\nWhen running 5k races lately, only the 15-19 age group is more competitive than the 50-59 AG, with placers in 50-59 often being fast enough to *win* 20-29 and 30-39. (40-49 is pretty competitive too, but 50-59 more so now.) And regardless, 50-59 almost always has the closest spread in medalist finishers.\n\n40-49 is usually the most competitive age group in my area, with the exception being the huge races with sub-elite finishers who are young. \n\nHere in Poland it does seem people run more than in recent past. But only when the weather is good. The moment weather becomes less than perfect all those runners vanish and I only see few, repeating faces.\n\nIt also looks like most runners do not know how to run (which probably describes me when I was starting, I get it). They run with comically slow cadence, slumped, doing some strange moves. I hope that popularity of running will be followed with some more knowledge of how to run properly so that it is fun and enjoyable and not just a physical exercise you have to force yourself into.\n\nI personally love running when it’s cold/raining, hardly anyone around &amp; when you do come across another runner, you give that ‘we are cut from a different cloth😎’ nod of approval 🤣\n\nYeah I try not to focus on anyone else’s form, as when I got first got into running it took me weeks of research &amp; practise to get that dialled in. I know everyone is on different stages of their journey. Good thing is there’s now tonnes of advice/tutorials on how to correctly run 😃✌🏽\n\nAnd they don‘t greet you!!! I always greet everyone. When the weather is good you see new faces and it‘s always them who don‘t greet back.\n\nI think a lot of millennials are also starting to get into it (myself included) because the majority of us are now in our 30’s. For myself, it’s a good physical challenge where I want to continue to challenge myself to prove that I can still do “difficult” things. \n\nI ran my first half marathon 2 weekends ago and now I’m already planning on how I can run a full marathon. This feels like a life long sport so it’s something I think a lot of people are starting to lean into.\n\nYeah fellow millennial here, definitely agree. I tried to get into running a few times in my twenties but I never quite stuck longer than a month.. I can’t imagine myself not running now 😍🙌🏽\n\nI’m in my mid 30’s. What I would give to go back to my twenties and be into running the way I am now.\n\nI think it’s a mix of influencers gaining traction in social media. I’ve seen friends that never ran start using Strava and posting runs there. Also a lot of sneakerheads like myself are moving towards buying functional shoes rather than J1s for the same price.\n\nNot sure about overall boom, but with regards to Instagram specifically, I think a combo of things is happening:\n\nA. Yes you’re more interested in running so they’re sending you more running stuff\n\nBUT ALSO    \nB. Instagram is getting better and better at targeting advertising, in general\n\nAND    \nC. There is more and more Instagram running-content\n\nThat’s my take as someone who’s been into running and an Instagram user for a number of years.\n\nSo I have recently heard that the singer Jellyroll is running his first 5k and reshaping his life to be healthier. Seeing as he was a relatively larger man and he is doing this I think that might influence running activity, but who knows.\n\nI was just talking about this with my bestfriend (who isn’t a runner and started this year as well) earlier while we were running! It was nothing like this last year 😆 there has been sooooo many running groups emerging here in my country. I think it’s awesome because people are becoming active!\n\nJust kinda funny tho cause it seems like there is an era — post-covid, a lot of people got into cycling. This year, a lot of people got into running. Wonder what it will be in the coming years\n\nI've been seeing a big uptick in powerlifting! Tons of new people joining as of late. Lots of fitness communities seem to be blowing up and I'm loving it\n\nI have been a runner for 15yrs now, honestly the best way for me to keep my mental health up. I get to escape it is like being in a world of my own, I ❤️ it!\n\n1000% I got into running in late 2018 and I never saw it wasn’t that easy to find YouTube content on running and any that did were small channels and now there’s tonnes of them. Insta is loaded with running people as we’ll\n\nIt's summer 🌞🏃\n\nThank you for all the info in the comments!  I’m a fat-assed, out of shape former fit guy trying to get back into running shape.   I\nI’m commenting so I keep up with this thread and appreciate everyone’s advice, research, and experiences!\n\nGood luck man you got this 🙌🏽💪🏽\n\nThat’s and people want to post shit on Tik Tok about finishing 5k UltraMarathons\n\nI did see a post where someone was running a 5k with their running vest which had 2 flasks, and 2 energy gels 😳 each to their own 🤣\n\nAs long as it gets people running, I love it! I can't personally justify the expense until I start running longer distances but if they have the money, why not lol\n\nNothing on runs under 1 hours. One bottle for 1-2 hours and two bottles and snack for runs in the 2-4 hour range. Seems to work perfectly this way for me. And by snack I mean Blackfriars flapjack bar that has 600kcal.\n\nI decided to start running this year after Jasmin Paris finished the Barkley. I’m seeing it as something I can control that’s probably healthier for me than other things, and it’s nice to have goals for me, that I can accomplish independent of other things in my life.\n\nWhat an achievement that was! She’s an amazing human 🙌🏽\n\nOh absolutely. I saw this woman do something women had never done before, and I started reading about ultramarathons and trail running and thought to myself “if she can do it, so can I.” I’m about the same age she was when she started running, and I’ve also been walking in a very hilly area for years, so I’m going to try it. Probably never going to run the Barkley, but I can definitely work my way up to a marathon and it’s a good, healthy habit that I don’t need other people to do, has a low cost barrier to entry (I got the couch to 5k app and paid an entrance fee for a local charity 5k) and now have a goal to finish my first marathon (official or unofficial) before my wedding next year.\n\nI've only been running for about a year, but I did notice that people I know, who are around my age (mid 20s), have started to pick up running as well. Even just looking on social media, seems like many people around that age are also starting to run. Not sure if it's always been a thing to start running at this age, but I do see it more on social media and stuff.\n\nLoving the idea of the running boom so far\n\nWe're in a influencer-fueled, post-covid WMM boom.\n\nAnd group runs seem to have gotten way more popular\n\nI'm not yet convinced that trickles down to depth in smaller/shorter races.\n\nThe original running boom was in the late 80’s and 1990’s.\n\nJudging by race class participation, it looks more like a walking boom.\n\nI dunno but I haven’t run a marathon in 10years and I haven’t run consistently in 8 or 9 years. \nThis year I just decided to Forest Gump it “one day, I just started runninG”. \n\nNow I’m marathon training for an October race.\n\nDefinitely a little bit of frequency illusion going on, but also noticed the same thing. Now that you’re back into running, you pick up on other runners everywhere even though they were probably there before. You’re also placing yourself in more running situations, going to places runners usually go, talk about it with people you know who run, etc. \n\nBut I agree. I also believe it’s becoming more popular these last few years.\n\nI've been running since the 90s and definitely a HUGE increase, like others said, due to positivity regarding running.  I did my first marathon in 2007, and repeated it again for my 50th bday in 2013 and I was stunned at the increase of participants!  In the 80s (and well the 70s esp for women) it seemed like it was the sport of 'athletes' who were running fast paces.  Today, again as others said, most ppl DGAF about how fast they're running, they're running!  My mantra has always been \"I'm still faster than the dude that's still asleep\" :)\n\nYes, every podcast is touting the benefit of zone 2 and high threshold, pointing to vo2 as a longevity measurement. Expect the trend to grow.\n\nYes!! The average marathon finish time has actually increased over the years and I see that as an overwhelming positive. It means more and more people from all walks of life believe they can run a marathon and actually follow through!\n\nYeah and it has led to a boom in people thinking they need a running vest to do anything more than 5k. My one pet peeve which I have absolutely zero right to be bugged about 😂.\n\nI’ve recently gotten back into it after taking a 1 1/2 years off. Just ran the Pittsburgh half marathon and I think there was a record turn out!\n\nIts the hybrid thing\n\nI think the millennial generation is more focused on health than any previous generation.\n\nA group of my friends are getting into running. I love to see it because they're taking their health more seriously now. More runners, the better. \n\nMost definitely 🙌🏽💪🏽🏃🏽‍♂️\n\nI personally think it’s due to influencers on social media, and that’s coming from someone who doesn’t have social media. I’m all for it though, anything that gets people out and active is great news, and I’m definitely noticing more people running while I’m out, seems like a big increase in women too which is great to see\n\nI don't know. Ask Jimmy Carter in the seventies.\n\nPost Covid shutdowns, the more recreational folk stopped lounging and started getting back to a place where they can train well enough to race, and/or feel safe enough to race.\n\nI don’t think so. It was much larger around 2010-2012. Marathons were filling quickly and lots of those stupid “mud runner” obstacle courses were around.\n\nThis is called the frequency bias. Once you notice something, you start seeing it more “frequently” even though nothing has actually changed! You just have a new hobby and are now noticing other people with the same hobby.\n\nRunning is a relatively cheap hobby. Something to do\n\nI have run five full marathons and too many to count 13.1, 5k and 10k. I recently discovered Strava and love that it’s like social media but you actually have to earn your post! Loving the accountability and how it records my progress weekly progress! Definitely getting back at it myself!\n\nRunning in the new Supreme.\n\nBig organizations are selling out the races In 10-15 minutes! 😂\n\nPersonally, I decided to get back into running because the technology and access to information has never been better. Because of all this, it's more doable for people to get into, do it the right way, and without injuries. In a world where we are surrounded by people a good portion of the day, it's a great way to escape and get back into our own heads in a relatively cheap way. Not to mention the health benefits.\n\nYeah I agree I love keeping track of all my data like heart rates, VO2 max etc. It’s so rewarding to see your hard work pay off overtime\n\nEconomy crashing and interest in running are highly correlated. Running is a great way to relieve stress and cheaper than a gym membership.\n\nFWIW I think it's not unique to running. I've noticed open water swimming and MTB events and locales expanding also. It seems like it's more of an outdoor endurance trend in general.\n\nI’ve even seen it in other countries. Just got recommended a video on YouTube of a runner doing a race in Kazakhstan and it was really interesting to see the running culture so big there.\n\nI started running this year to get in my shape before my wedding at the end of Dec,\n\nAnd i think ive felt this too- especially when i tried and missed to register for the Kuala Lumpur marathon 10k - cuz slots were sold out within a day😂\n\n100000% yes, I have friends who have always DESPISED running and called me insane for doing it who are now signing up for races\n\nYes we are. I have been running since 2011 and it’s definitely a boom right now\n\nYes and I’m here for it! I think it’s because of like the idea everyone can be a runner. Don’t matter if your slow, your still a runner. I know for me it helped me have a lot of confidence in my abilities even tho I am a “slow runner”. There’s also a lot more run clubs.\n\nThe everyday running shoes or \"daily trainers\" are now having more fun/soft/bouncy foams so running is just a much better experience lately. Imagine 10 years ago when every running shoe was the equivalent of a gel nimbus 19...kinda boring....also gear and tech is just super cool. 👌   \n\nHoka clifton, novablast, nimbus,  invincible, speed 3 , velocity nitro....all these shoes are great and an awesome introduction for a new runner.\n\nI’ll also add “community” aspects - it’s fun to run with a group of people and be part of a local club. Pair it with drinks after a weekly 5k and it’s going to attract more people that just want to hang with others or meet people on an otherwise boring Tues night. A lot of these folks in these groups are talking about the races they did over the weekend or the training they are doing for upcoming races in major cities, paired with cool travel (Berlin marathon, Napa Valley half, etc anyone?) Once you start, next thing ya know you are doing more organized races like 10ks and then half’s It just snowballs from there and it’s now a hobby/passion. At least that’s how I got into it.\n\nThat part about discussing races is interesting. I've literally found *all* my marathons, even my very first one, based on recommendations from my run groups. That's pretty much how I pick all my 5k/10k races now too. The fact I run marathons at all now is due to a run club. I had just trained for and run my first 5k on my own, and posted in a local run club asking about what I should do next: move up to a 10k or work on 5k speed.\n\n*Someone* replied and said I should do half marathon training; that someone turned out to be the run club coach who had way too much faith in me... she ended up coaching me to a 1:36 half six months later, and a 3:30 full 6 months after that. If she had not replied to me, it probably would have been years until I even worked up to a half marathon.\n\nParkrun changed it all over here, and then Covid also gave a boost and got people out - much more participation it seems now from recreational runners.  The latest London Marathon ballot has a massive increase this year over previous years (up 260,000 on last year's entries).  Local small village running club has 90 odd members, one of many clubs in a small radius (England Athletics has 48 running clubs within 20 miles filtered for \"road running\") - it all seems pretty damn popular right now.\n\nIt’s cyclical. \n\nThe recent wave has been spurred on by corporations pushing super shoes.\n\nIt STARTED during COVID…. When all the Gyms were closed - not New…\n\nYeah I got into hiking primarily due to covid, I guess I was late to the party when it comes to running 🤣\n\nAnecdotally, I have seen no evidence of a running boom.\n\nThanks to David Goggin"

    "title": "5.5 years ago I relearned how to walk..this week, I got my Abbott Six Star Medal. ",
    "body": "People associate the unicorn mascot in Boston as something unattainable to catch, but we keep trying to get it and it makes us better in the endless pursuit. I completed Boston Monday for my final World Major, after 5.5 years from relearning to walk. \n\nI used to see running as a way to escape my hangovers and clear my body of those toxins with friends and solo, but over the last 5 plus years my relationship with running has changed. \n\nStatistically our relationship should have ended 9/14/2018 when I was running and struck by a car sustaining a severe traumatic brain injury and coma. I awoke out of my coma two weeks later and for a long time…I hated the world I was in. Humans are creatures of habits. I had lost everything. My friends, my girlfriend, my apartment, my license, my smell, my memory, my ability to walk and talk without whispering, no freedom - chained to this invisible injury. \n\nI don’t remember much from my first year, but I remember one night post my first brain surgery that I had to pee.  I decided to try to get up and go to the bathroom. The funny thing is I had a catheter in me, and I of course got it out and tried to walk to a bathroom that probably wasn’t even there. I fell and a handful of nurses came running to me…what were they training for? Definitely not for this. I had to get a scan and make sure my head was ok and more.  But I just remember being on the ground the beeping noises, the bright lights, so hopeless, so disabled, so scared, so depressed, so weak…I wanted to jump out of my own skin - I hated who I was. Was this going to be the rest of my life? \n\nThere are two ways to confront a major life obstacle. You can avoid it or push it to the curb like a lot of people  do….or you can see it as a wake up call - an alarm ingrained in your head - wake up - wake up - you only got this many years on this earth - how do you want this story to go or better yet end? What imprint do you want to leave? Just a piece of sand, a faceless name, someone who just came and left, or someone that changed his life for the better and the lives of others around him for years on end? Well I personally hate sob stories.\n\nRunning gave me a regimented life - \nOne of discipline, desire and dedication. Days when I was down, I’d lace up my shoes, put on the tunes, and forget the noise. I made plans and goals every week and months and I followed them.  No more alcohol or drugs for this guy. The runners high was the only “buzz” I wanted. \n\nI know most of this beast well, hell I have trained and run on most of the course religiously for years for all my races and Boston running groups. The idea is to run the first 20 miles with my head as this is not my first rodeo, but then I’m going to run the final six with my heart as this isn’t just a race. This has been my life. \n\nRunning has given me a chance to challenge my being. All of my life I was scared of doing something major on my own for fear of failure. I wasted so much time trying to please others than to make myself stronger and set goals and tackle them. \n\nRunning has made me a better person. It has shown me sides of human nature I never knew existed. camaraderie, mental toughness, physical toughness, legit blood, sweat and tears; Many lost toenails and even more ruined shoes. \n\nRunning has made me see we are all here on this earth to make a story - one may have some bad parts (hell I know a lot about that), but overall it’s all about progress. One foot in front of the other. Kick push. \n\nAfter my TBI and relearning to walk almost two months, then up to my first run 1/20/19 being watched on a baby monitor, I decided to run the 2019 NYC Marathon - a little over a year after having life turned upside down hit by a car training for it in 2018. We miraculously finished it 11/3/19 in a sluggish pace of 6:08:48 (14:04 pace). But this started my comeback. \n\nThe pandemic came right when I made my first attempt to “chase the unicorn,” but it went virtual. We did it anyways for the first hospital that saved my life, and alongside my little sister and pt whom were my aid runners NYC. We trained through the early pandemic, and on the two year anniversary of my TBI, we made the trek from Hopkinton to my accident site in Cambridge, MA (definitely more like 28 miles). I appreciated the medal, but wanted the real Boston, and it jump started this urge to really want to challenge myself to run the Abbott Six. \n\nI took on Chicago 2021 through a brain injury charity (4:56:39 11.3 pace), then contacted a charity to attempt to chase the unicorn again after…even started doing my first long run; and then wham! My recovery and life came to a halt - I got an infection of my 3d printed chranioplasty skull piece after 3 years and it was removed, along with the probably vascularized dura too bit later (12/2021). The road to the Six Star wasn’t gonna be easy. \n\nHundreds of seizures followed, more inpatient rehab, some outpatient, and I went 352 days of no running, only walking wearing a helmet. I didn’t give up on the Abbotts. \n\nI went hospital to hospital to put my skull and head back together, and I had my 6th and hopefully last brain surgery on 10/14/22. I had gotten in the Berlin Marathon through lottery for 2022, and they gave me the “goodwill offer” to postpone to 2023. My first run came again 11.20.23 for a 1 mile race dressed as a chicken.\n\nIn the mean time, I signed up charity, did the London Marathon April 23, 2023\n5:18:59 (12:15 pace) - anemia was an issue from all of my brain surgeries. \n\nI Finally did the Berlin Marathon September 29, 2023 4:40 (10:34 pace) alongside my brother who ripped out his bib the morning of, surprising me after he had lingered into all my long training runs. \n\nI did Tokyo Marathon March 3rd, 2024 \n4:13:52 (9:41 pace) for charity - my all time PR beating my pre TBI self’s 2016 first marathon (Bay State 4:20). \n\n2024 Boston Marathon Race Report April 15, 2024 - April 15, 2024 04:38:53 (10:38 pace)\nThis weekend was something else. “The Blessing of the Athletes at the Church of the Finish Line”, followed by a shakeout run the day before with hundreds of runners and a dozen of groups on the esplanade all trying to get a last go in before a magical Patriot’s day yesterday. I ran my 6th star in Boston. I witnessed so much inspirational acts of gratitude and perseverance from aids and runners alike in that sauna of a race. Saw a blind six star runner with his wife guiding him, people with one leg, so much pain and so much happiness. All of the majors have their own quirks and cultures, but being from MA and running for one of the hospitals that majorly attributed to effects of the bombing made this my favorite I’ll ever run. The crowd at Boston College was incredible and the final 1.5 miles…my watch had died and I had anger, frustration, obviously loss of breath, but the crowd made me realize why I had devoted my life to running the Abbott 6 after my own trauma and life upheaval/injury I went through in 2018 and Boston hospitals saved my life. \n\nCost and qualifying obviously a major factor in deciding to run Boston, but the feeling I felt the final mile with the loud Boston crowd to holding my sister’s hand (also was going for 6) after the right turn on Hereford, left on Boylston will always be my proudest moment of my life. No better feeling than feeling Boston Strong. \n\nAt the end, we got Six Star medal and went to get photos at Abbott majors and I started seeing flashing lights and almost fainted. Then my sister felt horrible too. They gave us ice packs and we resurrected. Overall my favorite marathon I’ve run due to the crowd, it’s my city, and the challenges of it all. I want to run it again!\n\nMy first Six Star journey has ended, but this was more than just running and medals. This experience shaped me into a stronger person who is willing to put in the work to tackle any obstacle or life event, however many “miles” it takes.  I hope my journey can add some extra pep into your next run without just a carbon plate. I almost died while running, but running also gave me a new life, and I wouldn’t change a thing.\n\nPhoto collage journey - https://imgur.com/a/hV3yOLf",

Message me back if you have any questions. Congrats on all your hard work, keep at it!\n\nNot OP, but I couldn't help but look up your story. Absolutely wild! Congrats on your miraculous recovery and your ensuing Boston Marathon. \n\nI think I'm going to spend my next marathon making up incredible life stories for all the people around me in the race to help pass the time.\n\nWow-I just read your story too. That's absolutely incredible. Congratulations on making it back and running Boston! When I'm having a hard time on my long runs going forward, I'm going to think of you and everything you went through (as well as OP)\n\nI'll do the same. These people are so inspiring!! Just wow\n\nY’all are awesome. I also had a brain bleed and stroke in 2021 and told the nurses in the ICU I’d run my first marathon as soon as I got cleared to. It was NYC 2022 and I’m also chasing six stars. Chicago is next.\n\nI had a TBI and it messed my life up nice and good, but nothing like you two. I am humbled and counting my blessings.\n\nDMed you! Saw your story now, so incredible.\n\nWow, you're a medical miracle and OP is too! I am so inspired and will continue to push helmets 🪖 on my sons. Thank you for sharing\n\nI had a helmet and still suffered severe TBI... Granted, I'd probably be dead without the helmet haha but it cracked. \n\nNot discouraging helmets, but a distracted driver can fuck it up for the most cautious! Fuck them.\n\nI didn’t know your story but as a fellow Boston runner, thank you for sharing!! 💙💛 hope you continue to heal and kick ass!!\n\n... And you ran a small business through this all!? Talk about blood, sweat, and tears. If I could accomplish half as much in life as you and OP, I'd be very content. Truly inspirational. Side point, but I used to eat at your restaurant when I lived nearby. Loved it there. Had no idea about this story.\n\nHey! youre amazing , youre all amazing 🙏 this is now my favouritr thread on reddit\n\nAmazing!! I am 1 month out of the hospital after severe TBI and looking up marathons in the winter/spring. 😁\n\ndiuuuuude!!!! keep fighting my friend. i wanna know if you find a marathon to run😉\n\nOh wow! As a nurse and runner....just wow to your story! Incredible feat. I teared up reading this! \n\n\nSide note: I work in the ICU and rarely here about people after the ICU. I would send this collage to any unit (or rehab) you spent time in. When we get these pictures and stories, we are so incredibly grateful. t is so awesome to see success stories and see what our patients IRL doing well after all those obstacles. \n\n\nCongratulations and keep it up! \n\nThanks to your comment, I emailed my first neurosurgeon who saved my life the first night and I hope he will send to the hospital and it gets around. Thank you for your work. This isn’t a one person job, it is many, and it starts with people like you in the ICU who give us a shot to even have a chance to start a “next step” whatever it may be. I want to stop by my old rehabs when I get a chance, in the next week/s probably.\n\nAw it was mostly you pushing through! We are your support system 💕 \n\nDidn't expect to cry this morning. Amazing story.\n\nHuge congrats!!! Reading your story reminded me of a guy I met at a run club years ago and then said hello to at athletes village this year… turns out it’s you! \nSo happy to see you thriving and knocking out goals!\n\n🎶Don’t call it a comeback.🎶\n\nCongratulations on the epic journey and thanks for sharing. \n\nWhat are your plans now that you’ve completed the world majors?\n\nHi! Your story is amazing. I had an ABI (stroke) two years ago that had initially left me hemiplegic. I fell out of my wheelchair in the hospital the first day I got it trying to stand up unsupervised. Your story about the nurses scrambling to get you sent me through a flash back! \n\nI got back to walking over ~6 months then running over ~9 months, then ran my first marathon post ABI a few months ago! It was hard as hell but it was always about just getting back to running. I always wondered if I could keep running over the long haul post brain injury, and your story lit a fuse! Thank you for sharing \n\nThat is amazing. The first marathon in general is the hardest but ESPECIALLY post brain injury. Props to you. It does get easier, but mainly because you learn what works and doesn’t for your body and brain. Like most things in life and was ingrained in my head first weeks of inpatient rehab post coma, I find repetition, repetition, repetition, helps me. Only positive things though - routine is a friend..but can be an enemy.\n\nThis is beautiful. Sincere congratulations on your ability to battle adversity. Good luck with whatever next goal you set your mind to, I’m sure you’ll surpass it.\n\nDude I have no words expect you are fu@*ing amazing! I’m in tears reading ur story and ashamed for my petty complaining! God bless you! Keep it up!! ⭐️👏👏🙌🙌\n\nYou're an amazing individual and your accomplishments are inspiring.  Congratulations on achieving your goals, and I hope you continue to set and achieve the goals you set your mind to.\n\nI am humbled and in awe of what you have been able to accomplish.   I can't imagine having the courage to face the world as you have.\n\nI got ran over at a crossing and was so lucky compared to you! I escaped with lots of stitches and deep tissue injuries that were ultimately superficial, so I was able to run again after 6 months. You are built different, well done on coming back from that.\n\nYou are a phenomenal storyteller. What an incredible read. Please keep us updated on your journey. You’re amazing!\n\nCongratulations!!!! What an inspiration. I’m sorry you had to go through all of this but making it to the finish line is such an amazing achievement! \n💙💛🦄\n\nThank you SO MUCH for sharing your incredible story and congratulations on such an enormous achievement. Truly incredible.\n\nIncredible. I’m so glad you shared! Congratulations on everything you’ve accomplished and will accomplish!\n\nAbsolutely amazing story. Congratulations!\n\nThis is great. I get emotional thinking how running has helped me. Reading this provides more strength. Thanks!\n\nThat is inspiring brother, amazing story. \n\nYou should be incredibly proud of yourself for how far you’ve come.\n\nAbsolutely amazing. I will think of you and your strength on my next run; I may be just a stranger online, but I’ve never felt more proud of someone I do not know. \nThank you for sharing your story, I wish you many more years of happy running 🤍\n\nWow. Incredible read. Thank you for sharing your story.\n\ncongrats\n\n Thank you for sharing! I’m so happy for you to be thriving the way you are after such an awful accident.\n\nThank you for sharing. You are an absolute inspiration. Congratulations!!!\n\nYour story as well as other commenters is so inspiring - thank you for sharing. I just got into a serious accident just recently (not as serious as a TBI) and started to go down a very dark turn. I truly needed to see this.  I may even try to do my marathon after surgery if my doc says it's OK.\n\nIn total awe at the resilience and strength throughout your journey. Congratulations and thanks so much for sharing your inspiring story!! 🥰\n\nThank you for sharing OP. I am crying reading through it. I guess we all see our pain as the BIG BAD and reading your account made me realise that oh my mother fucking God, I can male a serious play at it. \n\nI have no injuries - just a obese washed up college sportswoman who never got her grip on food thanks to mental health. I thought I will die obese.\n\n3 weeks My senior dog fell sick and just carrying him up and down 2 flights of stairs in my arms made me fall back in love with my body. His passing taught me maybe the most valuable lesson of my life. We move till we live. \n\nI have signed up for Paris 2025 in his honour and now I'm inching and aching towards being able to run after 18 odd years. \n\nThanks to reading your account, I feel humbled and grateful. I'm blabbering ,thank you for sharing and I hope to all the smashing best to you ❤️🙌\n\nNo problem. It takes time, patience, trial and error (especially shoes, gear etc), but the benefit running gives you mentally and physically is incredible. Make it a routine and just set weekly goals (can be as small as you want) and just hit them and they will get bigger. The pain is temporary and you get stronger each day if you put in the work. \n\nI am sorry about your dog. I’m not kidding that for Tokyo and even Boston, I sometimes thought about our cockapoo who died last week of December and would think of her chasing tennis balls and running when I was down. \n\nGood luck in Sydney..would love to hear how that goes. I went to run that someday too. Would give me a reason to take the like 18-22 hour flight from Boston, USA!\n\nI’m late to this post but thank you for the inspiring words and showing that the human mind can persevere through any physical ailments our bodies incur. \n\nI recently tore my left Achilles tendon playing  tennis, and it’s been one of the most depressing experiences of my life thus far. I can’t relate to all the issues you had with your TBI, but going from an active lifestyle to being disabled so suddenly gives an overwhelming sense of impending doom. That the life you were living is over and nothing will be the same. While it’s true that nothing is the same, that doesn’t equate to a diminished life entirely. You are so right about how life continues no matter what mindset you have in any given situation. It’s easier to relish in your own misery than to adopt a newfound perspective directly attributed from personal trauma. I have more gratitude for the ability to walk and run than I’ve ever had in my life (and I’m currently still immobile, so I can’t do either yet). \n\nThis is all to say that, this injury has changed me as it did you. I do not plan to return to playing tennis in the capacity I was before being injured. I will still play for fun, but not in a competitive league anymore. However, I have a regained goal of running a marathon. It has been on my mind for years since I ran a half marathon in 2019. I took a break from running after that race and never got back on the wagon due to other interests like biking, weightlifting, and tennis. But now, this injury has made me realize that if I don’t challenge myself to go after this goal now, I may never get another chance. \n\nSo again, thank you for your heartfelt and brave story on overcoming all odds to reach your dreams.   You’ve motivated me to reach for mine!\n\nHey thanks for your reply. I’m sorry about your injury and hope you have a relatively stable recovery. I had to go to outpatient rehab 9 months with speech, pt and occupational therapy. I personally found the other people that didn’t really want to be there or put in work to I guess “graduate” from rehab, had a worse outcome. The first month of my injury, a neurologist told me to “return to things that I love/d doing prior injury that are safe to do and realistic, it will help my recovery. So that’s my advice to you. Also yeah the running goal is great as it will include many small goals to get in shape/figure out gear, then it will have bigger goals like the training with dates etc. the key is don’t be too hard on yourself and don’t rush to be 100% (whatever that even is) or you’ll never get there. \n\nThis quote really helped my recovery:\n\n“And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.” - Haruki Murakami\n\nIf you ever do a marathon, etc write me a chat! id love to hear about it.\n\nWow. First of all, I appreciate the condolences but know that my road is not as rocky as yours was. I don’t like comparing struggles, yet 9 months of all that rehab really puts into perspective how relatively easy my path is. As of today, I should be walking in shoes in 2 months. I’m very motivated to tackle PT like a regimented workout and get back to where I was and beyond. \n\nI also appreciate the advice and love the quote. I have never been one for patience. Most challenges in my life need to be addressed and acted upon immediately. This injury in a way has completely changed that aspect of myself. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work and progress no matter how slow it may be. It’s not just about healing and returning to be stronger. It’s growing and becoming wiser as well. \n\nI told my friend the other day. I’m not one to fully believe in fate, but I do think there are a few choices and situations that are brought about in life to shape our character. How we respond to them is how we rise or fall. \n\nI’ll definitely DM you about the marathon! Thank you for the support and reach out for anything!\n\nThis is so awesome! Congratulations!!!\n\nFucking awesome dude!! Inspirational!! Keep it up\n\nI have full body chills. Thank you for sharing your story, your journey, and your continued evolution. Strength to strength ✨\n\nAmazing!!!\n\nWoohoo!!!\n\nCongratulations! This is so inspiring and you should be so proud.\n\nThat's crazy you did this all alone too after losing everything\n\nYour post appears to be a request for medical advice.

    "all_comment_text": "How many bibs did the caterpillar get? Is this the answer to increasingly competitive applications!?\n\nI just cross referenced the names from the article with the official results, mostly because I was curious if they all got the same time or had a 1-2 second variation. They all logged an identical time, and they had six bibs.\n\nTurned sideways (in caterpillar terms?) so they all finished at the same time??\n\nIf they went over the starting pad at the same separation distance between them they finished at, their finishing times would be the same\n\nBut it’s more fun to picture a caterpillar shuffling sideways across the line. Perhaps doing 6 synchronized cariocas.\n\nAssuming they were running at the same pace over the finishing pad as the start pad.\n\nTrue\n\n[A clip I saw of the finish on Instagram of them crossing. ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5v2yptMjhw/?igsh=cGpzMnh2aGpndGZ2)\n\nStarted near them and they put in a lot work that is normally natural during a race. Front guy calling out potholes, speed ramps etc .. so someone in the back doesn't get tripped. And they can't suddenly change direction either so have to negotiate the large crowd starting off. Also good motivation to push on as I couldn't face being beaten by the caterpillar. \n\nI was beaten by a Toronto streetcar during my race last fall!\n\n\nhttps://runningmagazine.ca/the-scene/toronto-running-quintet-sets-guinness-world-record-in-ttc-streetcar-costume/\n\nI see lots of signs like 'faster than the ttc' during races.... you were not faster than the ttc 😔\n\nFinish time?\n\nThey finished in 2:57.  Overtook me at mile two... Could not believe what I was seeing 😅😅😅\n\nThen a guy pushing a wheelbarrow overtook me at mile 21 FML 😅😅\n\nI got overtaken by a racewalker during my first marathon, though in my defense she was FLYING and looked super serious about it.\n\nAt my first 24 hour race a race walker *won* the dang thing.  Like 113 miles in 24 hours.  It was really impressive.\n\nThat was me pushing the wheelbarrow, well done at Manchester \n\nI was 2:54, they were 2:57. \n\nWow, that’s amazingly fast, congratulations\n\nAmazing.  The pressure from being on this team would be my nightmare.\n\nI bet they’re all NYQ-level runners so sub three isn’t crazy for them.\n\nYea you don’t run a 2:57 marathon as a 6 person team in a costume unless you can all reasonably run it way faster 😂\n\nThese guys overtook me at the Bournemouth half. They were absolutely flying! Fair play to them\n\nWell that is very sweet and amazing.\n\nThat moment when a team costume is still faster than you. \n\nAt the Philadelphia Marathon I saw a guy in an inflatable TRex costume.\n\nHe finished over an hour faster than I did.\n\nI’m running a 15k in an inflatable 😂😂not sure how well I will do but I think it will be fun.\n\nHaha, my marathon is a few minutes faster but I do fondly remember getting absolutely obliterated in a fell race a few years ago by a dude wearing a full body Santa Claus morph suit and sunglasses 😎 \n\nHe was pretty aero though I guess!\n\nSaw a video of a dude running a marathon in crocs  a bit over 3 hours. Some people are crazy.\n\nI saw them (Manchester has out and back sections so they passed on the opposite side as I was crossing over at the start line) and it was amazing, couldn't believe they managed to run at that speed in that costume.  Absolutely incredible.\n\nOverheard another runner ask why the fuck they were in the white (1st) wave.\n\nI guess it was odd to see, amazing the pacing and coordination required to pull that off even if it isn’t a heavy costume they still had to all be on it for the race, incredible.\n\nI guess so. Kinda crazy that to find enough people to run the time, finish well on the day, and not get injured training for it. They said the record for a caterpillar is 2hr 50 mins which is insane.\n\nthis human centipede just qualified for Boston 2025!\n\nUnfair advantage, only the person up front has to worry about fueling\n\nPlease not the cuttlefish!\n\nI'm sorryyyyyy!\n\nIm guessing they went with caterpillars because of that movie.\n\nAre they going to run as a butterfly next year? \n\nNo. Next year they will run as gu. They will run as butterfly a year after that\n\n[deleted]\n\nI ran alongside them for part of the race. A synchronised piss into a hedge definitely featured 😂\n\nCrazy fast time ! \n\npeople are wild (in a great way).\n\nwell fair play that's incredible.\n\nHuman centipede for the win! Go GU!\n\nThat would be an interesting costume.\n\nThat is epic. Awesome idea and well executed.\n\nI love people like this 😂\n\nWhat an achievement!\n\nI love this so much!  What a great story!\n\nI got beaten by a guy in a full Chewbacca suit (head on the entire time) at the Twin Cities marathon.\n\nIt’s a marathonarch!!!  🦋🦋🦋"

    "all_comment_text": "My wife can’t wait to get her yearly rejection email.\n\nDo they still do the thing where if you get rejected x (5?) times you’re guaranteed a spot the following year?\n\nNope. With 500k applicants between 20k places, come year five there would be no places for the ballot and still a good 480k missing out! \n\nShame. To an extent it awards the lucky rather than the committed.\n\nThis makes it all the more frustrating that running influencer tools like Matt Choi get gifted bibs and runs Boston and London the same week. SMH.\n\nSeems like they could at least do pots with increasing probability, so year 1 you're up against hundreds of thousands but by year 10 it's you and a few thousand with a 50% chance or something?\n\nEdit: this may only kick the can down the road because you may need a probability of progressing to the next pot to avoid too many people in each pot. \n\nAnyway, I don't know. I'm not a mathematician but it seems like there must be a way of avoiding so many people trying for decades and some people getting in first try?\n\nNot quite the same genre here but this is what they do with the western states 100 mile. Each year your odds increase.\n\nAlso the start of the Abbott World Marathon majors and the subsequent increase in people trying to complete them has taken away even more spots. There’s a certain number of bibs reserved for people trying to complete them while the rest of us take our 2% chance in the lottery. Covid/social media/reserved bibs have made getting into any of these a nightmare. And don’t even get me started on the corporatization of trail races…\n\nIt’s really frustrating. Especially seeing Matt Choi gifted bibs to run Boston and London because he….quit his full time job to make stupid fucking reels full time? He’s going to complete the world majors in less than 2 years because of IG? While people who have kids and work full time have been trying for years….\n\nAbsolutely infuriating.\n\nLotta hate on the Matt Choi train but historically theres been bibs gifted out to anyone whos an ambassador to running. Why is Matt Choi taking heat for propelling the sport forward, giving access and inspiration to those who thought running was never for them?\n\nHow does the likes of Choi 'propel the sport forward'? He runs around with his top off and drinks beer during them. \n\n  \nPeople have forgotten its a race that takes months of training.\n\nRunning is natural part of our being that isn't meant to be taken seriously like your life depends on it. Choi and many others, not sure why Choi is singled out as the only Runfluencer here, has shown you can train but have fun at the same time. \n\nWho said racing can't be enjoyed too? Your criteria for not having someone propel a sport forward can't be in the form of running with your top off and having a quick sip of beer during the run?\n\nIt's an activity, the opposing perspective screams envy from the gatekeeping running community. It's why running was considered   monotonous and boring for so many decades among the general population.\n\n\nI agree there should be a qualifier for those who have been applying for years and kept up their training to participate in London and other majors but Choi and the Runfluencers aren't the issue.\n\nYeah running doesnt have to be taken seriously. But racing usually is. Not singling out Choi, can bring them all in. But there are people going for PBs and these Inst-folks at times run in the wrong waves, they set people up to run with no training, they can block roads etc etc.   \nAnything that gets people out is of course good but for races, it should be left alone IMO. \n\nOrganize their own runs for their content. Its as bad as the people who film everything in gyms these days.\n\nTo be fair it's just business\n\nI entered every year right up until they stopped with the whole you’ll have a better chance next year deal. I then just decided to do Brighton in 2012 and again in 2014. My running skills pretty much disappeared after that as I moved to weight training instead.. For whatever reason the other day I entered the ballot for London 2025 and signed up to Brighton 2025. Knowing my luck I’ll get in for London and have to do 2 in 3 weeks. Lol! (I probably won’t..) There’s always the option to take a charity place but having to raise x amount or it comes out of your back pocket is too stressful for me.\n\n&gt; Knowing my luck I’ll get in for London and have to do 2 in 3 weeks\n\nI've done that - was flying until the half of the second one. Blew up somewhere in the teens and was almost crawling by the finish line....\n\nWhy aren’t they simply just making the London marathon a 2 day event. 2 days of races instead of one? Allows double the amount. Of people to get involved and becomes more of an event feeling.. get people traveling in that are staying in hotels get to maybe run day 1, have there party that evening and wake up for day 2 and cheer on others.. so many want to run it. Just make a now 2 day event.\n\nClosing London in the way that it does is a too big of an ask for whole weekend. It makes getting around a lot of the city a nightmare due to crossing pointa\n\nPeople get super pissy about streets being closed for 1 day a year let alone more.\n\nSeems like they’d need to make it a week long event to make a dent in the number of applicants\n\nNothing wrong with turning into the first sort of festival of running so to speak. Can’t see a harm in making it a 3 day event to be honest. With 3 race days. It’s quickly becoming a world wide famous event so why not simply indulge it. Running is catching on like wild fire so before it settles down ride the wave London.. one day isn’t enough and that’s pretty clear, not sure why this hasn’t already happened extending the event.. but I presume it will or some. Other event will (eg. Boston marathon)\n\nBecause these events are a nightmare on public infrastructure and traffic and they suck in resources like crazy. Doing it for a week straight would be hard to manage.\n\nYeah man, I think that’d be awesome. Imagine tracking hotel prices during that week 😂\n\nI do get why people have issues with the ballot (I've applied every year since 2013. Never got in) but tbh all the alternative proposals I've seen also have problems, just in different ways, so not really sure what alternative they could come up with that would satisfy people. May as well stick with the current method.\n\nThat said, I've entered the ballot every year without success for 10+ years and it would be nice if there was some kind of loyalty scheme whereby if you enter unsuccessfully for 5 years or so then your chances of getting your number drawn improve. Not guaranteed, but just increased chances.\n\nAlso, I have met people who are under the impression that the London marathon is the *only* marathon in the UK which is why they enter the ballot. I do politely point them in the direction of Manchester, Brighton, Edinburgh, Newport, Southampton etc which also take place in Spring. I know it's not quite London but other options are available!\n\nI would love some type of loyalty scheme too. Personally I live in Chicago and it’s a huge bummer to repeatedly get rejected to run the marathon in my own city. Meanwhile, some other people do seem to get in via the lottery year after year. It’s just frustrating\n\nWhat's even more annoying is Chicago is about 50/50 and I went 0-3 on it. Decided to add qualifying for it as another running goa to achieve. Took me a couple years but I'll finally be running in 2025.\n\nThe current system also results in cases like my sister, who lives in London and has applied for the lottery places at least 5 times without success, but has managed to get a place in the Chicago marathon via their lottery system.\n\nSo she can't run the marathon in her home city but she can run it in yours... the joys of a lottery system!\n\nI think it is so frustrating to not have that opportunity! I do think the NY has the best system in allowing people to race. I don't think Boston's is awful is either by giving bibs to the towns that the marathon goes through, but I know that's not as popular as an opinion\n\n9+1?  \n\nNow all Central Park races are closed out for the rest of the year.  I used to be able to sign up the morning of a race.\n\nDoes Chicago still have the quasi-loyalty entry, with doing the shamrock shuffle 4+ times?\n\nNope they removed it right as I one more shamrock away from a guaranteed entry🥲\n\nNow you have to run all the BoA races: shamrock, Chicago half and *the Chicago marathon.* Makes no sense that running the previous year’s marathon is part of the entry requirements for next year’s entry\n\nI live in Chicago and will be doing the marathon this year and hope just keep doing the distance series every year for all eternity to keep that marathon spot. Truly not the best system.\n\nthats how they get you. they make more money off people by having you do all 3 races as opposed to just the shamrock shuffle. plus, the distance series is still only allotted a certain number of bibs so that’s not even a “guaranteed” method, especially the more popular it gets.\n\nThe idea of having run at least a few marathons prior to entering a major seems like a good easy fix. In this way, you eliminate the bucket list people that don't necessarily love running. Also, limit the Marathon Majors to 1 per year. My sense is a lot of people rush to get the six stars rather than embracing the sport of running. Is it really fair that one runner takes spots in 3 majors in a year?\n\nI ran Manchester last year and had an amazing time. Very well organized and great crowd support!\n\nIt was great this year, too!\n\nWhat are your thoughts on just a straight up waitlist? As you said, there’s plenty of other marathons to run in the mean time\n\nI think it's worth exploring and I think that may have worked in the past, but I'm concerned that now the wait list would be just insanely long if there are 800,000+ people on it. It would have to be carefully thought out.\n\nI think people know the other ones exist (I do) but I want London because it’ll count toward the world marathon majors. And I plan to make a trip out of my travel to these international marathons. I’m not rich enough for multiple trips.\n\nAh yea I live in the UK and that part was more aimed at people in the UK who seem to be under the impression that the London Marathon is the only marathon here. I can understand why they might think this if they don't follow running at all. It gets 6 hours of live TV coverage on the BBC and countless news stories and articles. No other marathon even comes close to getting that kind of coverage here.\n\nIf they really want to run the London Marathon then that's fair enough (I know I do!), but if they just want to run *any* marathon then there are plenty of other options that don't have a ballot. They probably just haven't heard of them.\n\nI am going to sound pretty selfish here, but it annoys me that you get people who do not bother training and just walk it taking up ballots.\n\nI'm not against people going slowly or doing it for charity, but those who don't train or put in any effort are total space-wasters.   \n\n\nI would implement some sort of minimum cut-off that's not time based. For example you must have completed/volunteered at at least 4 5km events (incl. parkrun) or 2x 10k or a HM in the previous year. That should be enough to cut down spam entries, but doesn't discriminate against those who aren't speed-demons. \n\nI think the nyc marathon is nice like that - you can get guaranteed entry if you do 9 races and a volunteer event I think - so serious runners in the area have a way to qualify more easily. To make it less local it could be just a specific number of races that are times, so at least the lottery goes to people who have races a bit.\n\nThis sounds like a great system that London could learn from! \n\nShould have a cut off to discourage those who haven't trained.\n\nThere is a cut off but because some of the 8/9/10 milers got moved onto the pavement they’ve been a lot more ‘accessible’ to people that ‘run’ slower. But having seen the discussion in more toxic running circles, they lie on their entry anyway so they don’t end up in the last wave.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPeople that were ‘running’ the marathon in 8/9/10 hours\n\nOr release crocodiles or tigers after a certain time to discourage people from dawdling!\n\nI ran this year and there were clearly so many who very obviously would never have stood a chance of finishing in the alloted time. Kudos to them if they did, but some of them weren't exactly small people (I say this having lost 7 stone before attempting this year).\n\nI don't know what the solution is though. London will always be oversubscribed just because it's London, and there will always be people who enter who don't understand the toll it will take on their body.\n\nYou could have a qualifying time like Boston, or based on your time you’re given more tickets, so if you needed more then 6 hours or it’s the first marathon you get 1 ticket, if under 6 hours 2 tickets, under 5 hours 4 tickets, under 4 hours 8 tickets.\n\nI think you should absolutely have prior marathon experience before getting to run one of the World Majors\n\nThink the number of people doing that is increasing though. \n\nSame people who walk up Ben Nevis in flip flops\n\nI fully agree with this. Not everyone needs to do a marathon. Maybe this is more of a comment for a circlejerk sub but it does annoy me. Yes, running has a social component. But it’s not just social.\n\nEveryone should be able to do a marathon, but that should not include world majors. \n\n  \nMakes it all the more frustration that tools like Matt Choi get gifted bibs for these races and almost has all the world major stars within like 2 years. SMH.\n\nYeah fair. You rephrased it better. I guess what I mean is more of if a certain run is more popular, it should have a higher bar for entry because you’re also representing the sport.\n\nIt’s bad enough, but understandable for Disney runs, but not for a major.\n\nPreach\n\nWhat do you think of people that qualify under a specific time, but decide to take it easy. Say a 2:45 BQ that runs with a family member at 3:20. What was the point of limiting the field vis qualification time?\n\nI do agree with you. I’m just curious\n\n3:20 is running pace though, and even for someone who is very good that is still a sufficient effort. They’re talking about people who don’t train sufficiently getting spots over someone who would have\n\nI get that. I’m just asking what the point of these time qualifiers is when people don’t have to run anywhere near their qualifying time. If I get into Boston 2025 it’ll be to run with my dad. And someone who can run a 2:45 will find a 3:20 more or less easy.\n\nYeah but we’re not talking people that run 3:20 vs their qualifier of 2:45, it’s people that have literally never run before, have no intention of running the event and are signing up to walk or walk/run in 6+ hours. They do need cutting down significantly. \n\nHalf the instagram videos of London 24 are people walking\n\nThere are indeed, many, many 6+ hour finishers. 1,500 or so, just in the men. I dont really see the appeal in a 6:30 hour walk but then again I’m sure there are those that don’t see the appeal in a 4:00 marathon when they’re running it in 2:20\n\nIt depends on what the marathon is \"for\". \n\nIf it's exclusively an event to showcase athleticism, then yes, limit the field - keep it about athletic skill.\n\nThe thing is though that London is the world's biggest fundraising event, and by inviting anyone to take part, the marathon becomes an inclusive event that caters to both the elite, amateurs, and plodders alike. \n\nI'm in the plod group, and I'd argue that the £15,000 I raised for charity is more important than Gary wanting to humblebrag to his running group about how he \"smashed\" the London marathon by running a sub-4, but that's just my opinion. \n\nThe London marathon has prestige, and that prestige brings in the money. There's a balance, and I think they manage it well.\n\nI think there should be charity places where people can raise money and I’m not necessarily suggesting cutting them. \n\nBut with how few actual runners can get into GFA and then there’s a ballot, the balance is clearly pretty skewed. LME make bank off of charging for ballot entry applications with nowhere near enough places. The race is over inclusive and the cut off probably does need to be brought down so those running for charity actually run. 6 hours or so is more than reasonable for that and used at loads of events. Anything later medal/t shirt support should be packed up. \n\nRunning is about achievement. You’re humble bragging raising money for charity but it’s a running race and yeah if Gary spent 4 months training he’s achieved his running goal at a running race.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI do get the frustration, I have a bit of a utilitarianist lens on it, but personal achievement is still legitimately important, and that shouldn't be downplayed.\n\nI think to a large extent it hinges on what could be a reasonable time to finish a marathon. With the exception of specific incidents on the day (injury, illness etc.), it’s honestly not fair that people can show up after not having committed to appropriate levels of training. Finishing in large excess of 6 hours, to speak frankly and not to be unkind, is an abuse of volunteers’ time, and as a walking pace fails to engage with the spirit of the event (athleticism). Not having ran anywhere near the distance before/training well roundedly (as is normally the case) is also needlessly putting yourself at risk of injury/medical incident on the day, which simply isn’t sensible. On the other hand, a 2:45 marathoner running a 3:20 marathon is not really posing any of these issues, they’re simply running it slower than they usually would. \n\nThere is definitely scope to include slower runners, and I’m not campaigning for qualifying times à la Boston, but there’s a fine line between inclusivity and encouraging swathes of people to underprepare in a way that impacts other people.\n\nYeah, like for major events like london...I would support needing to also submit like, a 10K+ race result at under...whatever time corresponds to a 5:30 marathon. It's not a super high bar, but should weed out *some* of the field. Like marathons should be for everyone, but for major events, there needs to be *some* evidence of distance training.\n\nI qualified for London this year and took it easy. I get where you're coming from but on the other hand I think that anyone who took the time and effort to qualify should get to do whatever they want with that spot (as long as they still run it of course).\n\nTo be honest I will do the same with Boston. Hoping to run it with my dad, who is a good 30 minutes slower but has an easy qualifying time (for good reason, he’s 27 years older than me).\n\nA 3:20 marathon time is an incredible achievement lol\n\nYeah I personally think you shouldn’t be allowed to apply for the ballot if you haven’t previously already ran a marathon. London shouldn’t be used as a first marathon just because they want to tick a marathon off of their bucket list\n\nI think this is a step too far: running has overcome a lot of representation shortfalls, and by having a restricted ballot, you’d risk turning into a pay-to-play event for inexperienced runners.\n\nThere’re plenty of runners - myself included - who had LM as their first and have gone on to run plenty more marathons.\n\nYou are right, I'm not against people having their first marathon here. I'm not even talking about people who take 5/6 hours. I'm really just talking about those you see on TV getting interviewed who are like in a walkers group telling us how they're walking the whole thing.\n\nIt's like those people who never even had the intention of running.\n\nYes, I agree that the cut-off is too generous. I support appropriate exceptions for disability and attempts in things like full EOD suits etc., but for a ‘normal’ race taking 8h+, I’m not sure London is appropriate (nor a reasonable risk for the runner). I haven’t fact checked this, but I think LM has the latest cutoff for all majors?\n\nNYC has no cutoff.  The finish stays open until the last runner crosses the line.  There’s a published course time limit, but you can continue and you’ll be counted as a finisher (assuming you do finish eventually).\n\nThey don’t have the intention of running, there’s whole weird subcultures built around jeffing and walking in races. London is a major event in the UK and people want to tick it off. But if you’re not going to train for 3/4 months before it I think it’s pretty pathetic to claim to have ‘done’ a marathon.\n\nIn my opinion, walking races is totally fine. Everyone does their own thing. Compared to the average population, walking 26.2 miles is no small feat. It seems easy to us runners, but to the average person, that's a lot.\n\nI also think that if you've gotten to the point where there's 840,000 applicants, it's okay to step back and say that London cannot be someone's first marathon that they finish. Requiring someone to do one marathon or even a half marathon previously, no matter the pace, is an acceptable form of gatekeeping that keeps it open for the average person to join. If so many people really want to do London, finding a local race to participate in should not be that big of a barrier. You still will probably get a few hundred thousand applicants, but it will cut down on the numbers.\n\nThere's plenty of other events to entertain walkers. A marathon is for runners.\n\nGo do a trail race. I raced a half-marathon that had the same cutoff as the 100k  (24 hours).\n\nYeah it isn’t perfect in fairness, but something seriously needs to be done about the numbers at this point, and I wouldn’t like it to turn into a marathon where you can only qualify through times, at least this way a recreational runner only has to run another marathon in any time before they can enter the London ballot. \n\nI do hope they find a solution though, even though it doesn’t affect me (I’m fortunate to qualify for a championship place but i know i'm in the small minority), having ~50/1 odds of getting a ballot place is outrageous\n\nTrue - the ballot numbers are getting crazy. A few people in my club were talking about restricting the ballot so that you can only be successful once every n years. Not sure how effective that would be, but could be interesting.\n\nThey could take a page from popular hunting/fishing draws.  Each year you apply you get a “ticket” in the lotto and it rolls over. You lose all your tickets when you get a successful entry.\n\nThat way someone who has been trying to get in for 10 years, has 10x the chance of being selected vs a first time entry, or someone who ran it the previous year.\n\nI was successful this year and wouldn't complain if I was asked to step back from next year's ballot.\n\nBut I think those places should go to the running clubs who have had their places reduced or missed out entirely as a result of the recent rule changes.\n\nMy club used to get 1 place per year, but the rules were changed to make it that all the clubs of our size are entered into a ballot and there's only enough places for 50% of the clubs.\n\nIt doesn't feel right having a running race that excludes dedicated runners.\n\nI think requiring a POT for any sort of distance would help eliminate a lot of the ballot entries right off the bat. Or at least help weed out those who aren’t going to train appropriately. There doesn’t even need to be a pace requirement, just proof that you have done some sort of race in the past. \n\nI am all for inclusivity in running and races, but over 800k people want in a race and you can easily cause bad experiences for everyone if you don’t thin this out correctly.\n\nPersonally, I think you'd still want a POT under a certain (very generous) time limit within the past 2 years for nothing shorter than a 10k.\n\n *\"Here's my proof of a 5k Turkey Trot I ran in 45 minutes, 8 years ago\"* doesn't exactly instill confidence that you're even remotely prepared for a marathon.\n\nHere’s how you fix it, but no one will like it: go the Boston Marathon route of having entry based solely on qualifying times, with a limited number of charity entries. Make the qualifying times age and gender-graded, but stringent enough that walkers and half-assers need not apply.\n\nSet a hard time limit on the event itself of 6 hours.\n\nIncrease the application cost considerably, and or make it (partially) non-refundable.\n\nIt is getting way out of hand. I’m a semi-competitive amateur masters runner with two of the six WMM stars. I’m loathing the idea of having to apply for the lottery for the remaining races, despite the fact that I’d be in the top quarter of runners easily in any of them.\n\nReddit has seemed to be pretty stacked against people who advocate for more competitive/gate-keeping in these events, but it’s absurd to have 800,000 people apply for an event where the entry is basically random, and there’s no way of ensuring that people who actually want and are able to run the damned thing seriously have a better than chance shot at getting in. In the case of London, the problem is that GFA entry isn’t accepted for non-UK entrants—which is a parochial and silly restriction for a _World_ Marathon Major.\n\nIf you want to run it as an overseas person I have good news. You can just register via one of the many tour operators. No ballot involved. Many of the tour operators also offer a ‘entry only’ option which isn’t much more than the bin itself.\n\nWait… seriously? How are they able to do this? Does it cost considerably more? I’m super-intrigued now… (if you have the name or a link to one of these offhand, I’d be grateful!—but I’ll look into it myself at some point, too…)\n\nEdit: never mind, found the details. That is a plausible way in, but first-come-first-serve for a limited number of entries and a fairly pricey restricted hotel list is a bit of a downer. But I guess it does fit with my suggestion of making it more expensive to get in…\n\nYeah. These options are available for pretty much all the majors I think. I could have signed up for Berlin last August if I wanted to as a UK runner.\n\nYeah I run half marathons but want to run a singular marathon one day and LM is on my shortlist… I’d love to run one with great crowds for the whole thing so that list isn’t enormous!\n\nI think someone who *trains* should be able to have London as their first marathon, but like, they should be able to show proof of distance training..I'd support requiring a race result from a 10K+ event at a certain pace given that the ballot opens like what, a year out? That means that the person has at least been running enough to complete 10K successfully, which knocks out *some* bucket-listers at least.\n\nI think that they should require people to put their credit cards in like almost all the other majors (Tokyo also does it the \"pay after you get in\" way). I think that would deter a ton of people who apply on a whim. As for walkers, IMO, as long as you make the cut (set at the discretion of the race) you're good in my book. (and all the majors have different versions of this, some much harsher than others).\n\nDoesn’t seem like a terrible idea to me as long as they accept other races distances as qualification. Like you could race a half marathon to qualify and still have London be your first marathon.  \nI recently did Cooper River Bridge 10k as my first 10k. The fastest groups need qualification, but they accepted my 20 min 5k to be put in the 40-50 min 10k group. At the same time though I think that sort of validation should only be in place to keep too many people from dnfing because they couldn’t keep up with hard cutoff time, but not sure if that’s even an issue. Often it’s something like 6:30 which most people end up doing anyway so why not give everyone a free chance. Up to organizers I suppose and it’s all about the money. DNFers pay just the same.\n\nFor the Seoul Marathon applicants needed to post an achievable time to be qualified.  If memory serves it was a 1 hour 10k, 2:10 half, or 5:00 full.  All within the last year.  It could be automated for certain races (ie select Jinju Marathon and input bib number) or upload a screenshot from whatever race website of your official time.  It seemed to work, I didn't see any obviously unsuited people (except maybe me, but I'd had covid 10 days before).  My point is, these big races don't have to be open to all if total numbers have to be restricted.\n\nI would totally agree with this approach, if you have not trained for a 10k or half there is no reason to enter a marathon. This could be done for all majors or important races, without a qualifier there are other marathons to enter.\n\nSeems like the obvious way to do it if there’s this much demand. If it’s not a clout thing and you just want to do a marathon you can certainly find a smaller one that will let you run without a qualifying time\n\nThat sounds like a great idea honestly\n\nSeoul Marathon 2024 was the first marathon I've ever run, and I think this is definitely the best way to do it. \nWhen I applied for the London Marathon this month, i was shocked that it was a lottery style. Such a stupid system.\n\nI ran Chicago Marathon last year, there was tons of people who started walking literally 100 meters after the start line. If this is the level of training/fitness you have committed to a marathon, someone else deserves your spot.\n\nThere is no way that I will get a ballot place, more than 800,000 application.\n\nI said that last year (and several before) but ran with a ballot place last Sunday.\n\nJust because the odds are very low, doesn't mean it won't happen.\n\ni’ve crunched the numbers and i’ll either get in or i won’t so 50-50, and since i donated my entry to double the chances this year i’ll definitely get a ballot\n\nIt's about a 1 in 16 chance. Not horrific. \n\n1 in 8 if you donate your entry fee in advance\n\nI think you are assuming the entire field is ballot entry? As Gear4days says, it’s only 17,000 ballot places out the entire field with the other spots being allocated to charity, good for age, sponsors and elites. \n\nSo with this, the ballot has odds of about 50/1.\n\nIIRC the ballot pool is further split into UK vs Intl and the odds for intl are vastly worse than UK.\n\nThanks, I didn’t realise this! Don’t suppose the give the details of split between intl entires and UK? Would be nice to know if I’ve got a slightly better chance!\n\nYour calculations are based on the assumption that all 50,000 places are ballot places. But that's not correct.\n\nIt's believed that around 17,000 of starters * are \"true\" ballot places, around 1/3 of the total number of runners.\n\nThe rest are \"good for age\" qualifiers, running clubs who get assigned places, or charity places\n\nSo 17,000 / 840,000 = 2% or 1 in 50\n\n*I don't think they give actual numbers, but that's the number most sources quote\n\nWasn’t the odds around 35/1 last year? 580,000 applicants for 17,000 places?\n\nAre you sure that's right? I think they give out 20,000 max via the ballot so it's more like 1 in 42?\n\nYeah you're right I was looking at total runner numbers not just ballot ones\n\nLuckily I’ve signed up to Manchester (on the same day) to guarantee myself a large UK-based marathon.\n\nBrighton is run by London Marathon Events. They have an entry that enters you into the LM and if unsuccessful you get a place at Brighton a few weeks earlier. Perhaps of interest?\n\nI’ve done the exact same thing as they will refund the Manchester entry if you get into London, I’m honestly not that fussed as the chance is so low but it’d be nice to do my home marathon once\n\nMight be a controversial opinion, but I think you should have had to have run at least a half marathon somewhere before you can apply for London. It’s such a big race and there’s always people walking it. \n\nI also think that you should have extra ballots for every consecutive year you’ve applied - eg. 5 unsuccessful years = 5 ballots.\n\nAny reason demanded has spiked so high in recent years? \nThe lack of time requirement and upfront payment obviously helps, but the coverage/ publicity seems the same as I can ever remember. \nHas running really become that much more popular? \nCould it be a bit of a positive feedback cycle where the less likely you are to get a place, the more people it appeals to to enter? I certainly know people who don't run and don't really want to run a marathon, but enter under the knowledge that it's such a tiny chance they'll get in and if they somehow do get in they owe it to others to train and complete it.\n\nI feel like recently social media like tiktok and these social run clubs/puresport thing where you meet for a coffee, go for a stop start 5k equip with all the gear like running vest, gels and sunglasses then once finished have a coffee and pastry (and post loads of videos on social media) have caused a massive surge in people getting into running lately. Which is absolutely great that people want to get into fitness and training but I do find it a bit weird that it seems to be a trendy thing to do. \n\nSo unfortunately I'm sadly not surprised London has so many ballot entries. I will have to start looking into charity places I guess.\n\nIt’s definitely social media and the rise of run clubs. I have been running since covid lockdown, sporadically but even back then it was more of a trend in the sense of ‘we have nothing else better to do but run’. It definitely died down for a few years after 2020/1 as things opened up again.\n\nNowadays, my Insta / TikTok feed is full of runfluencers, hybrid athletes who run, runner accounts and in general I have friends and family who never used to run entering marathons / half marathons / park runs everywhere… as some others have already said it’s not a bad thing but unfortunately it’s leading to a proliferation of applications for the big marathons.\n\nI might even say I’m guilty of following the trends, I’ve always liked running / fitness having a sports background, but only decided to enter a marathon last year once I saw that others on social media were. I’d say the difference for me is that I really committed to the training and pushed myself, therefore found myself getting a BQ / GFA time in my first cycle in two races (Paris and London). \n\nI will say I only got London with a charity place but I made the decision long ago that it would be the one and only time I enter a major through charity. I want to complete all the majors (again, something I wouldn’t have known about if not for the growth of running in general) but I am determined to only enter for them all with a qualifying time, because I know I’m capable of it and I like to challenge myself. Otherwise, I’m not interested in running the race if I haven’t ‘earned it’ per se. So I do get people’s issue with those who just enter on a whim and don’t really commit to training / decide to walk on race day, compared with those who put in the effort to train but can never get in to these races. It’s just a tricky one really!\n\nDefinitely. I started during lockdown in may 2020 and there was definitely not much content on tiktok/instagram at that time. It Now feels like everyone and their mom is running, which is Great. I fully support. I do believe that’s what contributing to these huge ballot Numbers. \n\nI was in the LM ballot and I am in the LM ballot this year again, tho I doubt I will be selected. I qualified for Chicago, hoping to BQ and then hopefully I will collect rest of the WMM stars in years to come lol\n\nI know you’re generalising but as someone who has regularly attended a Puresport Run Club for 2 years, there’s no gels or vests present, we run at whatever pace with the fastest about a 22-min 5k up to about 28 min - slow enough to be social on the run. Good marketing? Sure, but not as pose-y as you make out\n\nYou sound really bitter that people that taking up and enjoying running. Perhaps try and be happy that people are getting involved in your hobby and working towards a healthier lifestyle. \n\nCoffee and pastry after a run is better than just coffee and pastry.\n\nAbsolutely not. Nothing I've said is bitter I'm just commenting what I've noticed on social media. Very similar style videos of people getting into running as if it's like a trend/the thing for people to do. Running being more trendy and social media influence could be leading to more London Marathon ballot entries imo. \n\nAnyone can go and run it's not a big deal lol\n\nMillennials and Gen Z are getting into running. The Atlantic had an article called \"the new quarter life crisis\" in which it cites both the LA marathon and NYC marathon that 20-29 YO participation is up \\~33% over the last few years. Also add that (at least in the US) we are entering a population spike of millennials who are entering their mid 30's which is historically the most populated age bracket for marathons.\n\nMaybe social media has something to do with it but hard to say since anyone commenting g on this thread already has the algorithm pumping running content to you. Not sure if that’s hitting non runners feed.\n\nCan you share the article please?\n\nAs a millennial, it has been on my bucket list to run a marathon before I turn 40 (summer 2025). I've been a hobby runner for the last 10 years or so and I ran a half marathon 5 years ago -- I've done a smattering of 5Ks, 10Ks, and some other races as well over the years. \n\nThis year, I'm finally running another half in June and I have plans to run my first marathon in December (a local one) so I can tick it off my bucket list before turning the big 4-0.\n\nI did apply for the London ballot but I am fully prepared not to get in and that's totally fine. There's another marathon around that same time that's only a few hours from me that I can do instead. \n\nI wonder if other millennials are also thinking of ticking off a marathon before 40. I see a lot of running content on my social media, but I also go out looking for it as I love running and follow a lot of runners.\n\nI think it’s social media and these kinds of ‘hit lists’ of things to do and post even if they never run again.. I’ve noticed it a ton now in the mountains where my in-laws live, there’s a huge spike in people trying dangerous mountains just to instagram them, even though they’ve obviously never done serious mountaineering\n\nAnyone know how many places are allocated to the ballot?\n\n17k for the 2024 marathon.\n\nDo you happen to know the proportion of local vs international?\n\nI don't, but as it is a random draw, it should be the same as the proportion of entries. \n\n&gt;The total number of UK ballot entries for 2024 was 457,105 of which 242,119 were from men (52.9%) and 212,179 from women (46.4%) with 2,807 (0.6%) non-binary applications. There were a further 121,269 applications in the international ballot for non-UK residents.\n\n[https://runabc.co.uk/tcs-london-marathon-ballot-results-for-2024](https://runabc.co.uk/tcs-london-marathon-ballot-results-for-2024)\n\nSo that looks like about 26% were international entries.\n\nThanks!\n\nFWIW: This thread pretty much mirrors the annual Glastonbury Festival ticket debate.\n\nThe Abbott World Majors Money grab is driving this to a great extent. So many people now want the 6-Stars and they go one after another after another. I got the 6-Stars over 22 years. The WMM is a cash grab and they are pushing people to tour groups where I am sure it creates another mass revenue grab. They also charge you to run to get extra marathon Lottery spaces for a WMM special lottery pool.\n\n+1. I’m starting to give up on the “major” marathons. \n\nI could do 6 other large-city marathons all over the world and be just as accomplished— I don’t need a large piece of metal or my name on a wall in a tiny font, for the stress and tens of thousands of dollars it would take to just get into NYC/London.\n\nYup, my next 2, Valencia in December, Rio next year.\n\nI’m feeling the same way. Having run Chicago and Boston I thought I would inevitably aim for the 6 stars but honestly I started to question what it even means? Some of these races are so hard to get into now it definitely feels like a play toy for rich older folks and it’s actually devaluing the series. \nValencia has really become a top class marathon that seems to be as good as a major but much easier to get into. I think 2025 I’m going to aim for it.\n\nMy first ever marathon was Vienna and I had a lovely old time! And it definitely felt \"big\" (I've also done some smaller marathons so feel like I've done them at both ends of the spectrum).\n\nIt's currently a trend on TikTok to enter the ballot so this doesn't surprise me at all\n\nThere should be a tier system. If you’ve run London already your entry is worth one entry. If you’ve entered 1-5 times and never gotten it your entry is worth two. 6-10 is worth 3 etc. Or something along those lines\n\nAlso. If age/time cut offs. If you’ve never ran a race in your life 1. If you’ve ran a race at a 5+ hour equivalent in the last year you get 2. Sub 5 hours, 3. Sub 4, 4. Sub 3, 5. \n\nI’m tired of getting rejected by these lotteries for major races I’ve been training years for while someone who just signed up for shits and because it’s the “cool” thing now gets in. \n\nA marathon is a race. There should always be a time goal. If you can’t beat a certain time, you shouldn’t be mad about it. You should see it as a goal. They’ve gotta stop being so inclusive with these.\n\nSo I'm definitely getting in, right?\n\nI think if you get to do it , you can't enter the ballot for another 2 years (or a year?) . It's a joke people get it every year then others never get it at all\n\nWell, there goes that dream.\n\nI ran London last weekend. Had a ballot spot. It was a magical experience. I wish I could do it again and again. Never have I wanted a marathon to not be over! I didn’t apply this year, let’s give other people a chance. \n\nThat being said I do feel like running influencers are causing these races to be over-run. It used to be at least semi serious runners doing these races but it’s become people who don’t really give two craps about running but just want to do the race for sh*ts and giggles.\n\nI wonder how many people are already booking their flights.\n\nSurely if Sydney and Capetown are added to the majors it would take some of the pressure off the existing ones. It would still be cooked, but surely better than it is now\n\nAren’t they only adding one new major? It’s definitely going to be Sydney…and 100% the first couple years of it being a major will be insanely popular…and then it’ll just get more and more popular\n\nThey should have a separate draw for London residents, I see New York does something similar. It’s ridiculous that Londoners are unable to run their local race because of tourists who want a full set of “majors”.\n\nIt's not exactly the same but running clubs affiliated with British Athletics get entries and can give them to members. Considering a lot of club members will have good for age times anyway it's a way to potentially boost your chances.\n\nI’ve been meaning to join one for a while (not in order to secure a race bib), but keep putting it off, I guess due to some degree of social anxiety.\nFrom what I’ve seen, most require you to be a member for at least a year first, which seems fair enough.\nI think I should be able to run a GFA time in the next year to secure a place for 2026 anyway (unless the cutoff time gets crazy low). I would try for a 2025 GFA place but there aren’t a lot of good races to do so before the end of September.\n\nEven with a separate draw it would still be hard for London residents. UK ballots alone this year were greater than all ballots for last year. NY is still very hard to get into via lottery/ballots for local residents. \n\nPerhaps an option for London locals is something similar to NY 9+1 where one runs 9 events and volunteers for 1 to get a guaranteed bib. Maybe that’s something that could be replicated with UKs parkruns. Although that has its own problem where many NYRR races are quickly sold out very quickly.\n\nthis sub tries so hard to be inclusive but as soon as a major marathon is oversubscribed, then it becomes a gatekeeping fest.\n\nI'm sure there are plenty of 4 hour marathon runners here complaining about people walking London Marathon. You'd soon kick off if they just got rid off the ballot and only gave places based on qualifying times, and you suddenly realised YOU were too slow to be taken seriously. - and I say this as someone who would almost certainly not get near in those circumstances.\n\nThe sub is called running not walking. That's not really gatekeeping, just categorizing. \n\nI've accidentally walked a marathon at a long day at Disney World. It's not really that big of an accomplishment. You can literally walk a marathon in London any day of the week, wait at crosswalks and stop at shops for water and food without sacrificing timing.\n\nSomething being an achievement or not for other people isn't really down to you. Walking a marathon is more than a typical day for most people, and it is probably fun to experience the marathon atmosphere.\n\nSo we should select the most out of shape applicants because it’ll be the biggest achievement for them? That doesn’t make sense. We shouldn’t be punishing people who already are actively training/working out because it’s not as big of an achievement for them. \n\nAnd the “marathon atmosphere” is related to the fact that there is a running race going on. If you’re not going to do that, why not be part of the ‘atmosphere’ cheering on the runners?\n\nI just finished London for my 6th star! I ran with Team Whizz Kidz, which raises for wheelchairs for children.  My fundraising goal was 1900 pounds (about 2200).  I met it (even exceeded it a little) by March.  It helped a little that it was my last star and the only one I've had to fundraise for. I highly recommend them and I loved London! The crowds were on par to NYC!  Never a dull moment! I even got a small BQ but I have a better one much more likely to make the cut. I had a blast in London!\n\nThose number are insane! You know the minimum charity sponsorship is going up now. \n\nI had to defer my place from this year due to injury so should be able to run next year thankfully (constant fear that they change the policy) but that was still 8 ballots before I got in. \n\nBe great is London could let other smaller races capitalise on the current boom of popularity of marathons. \n\n&gt;Looks like I'm going doing the charity route.\n\nYeah that's their plan!\n\nSome of these comments are quite disheartening in all honesty! \n\nI ran the marathon for the first time, my first ever marathon, in 2018 with my dad. we worked through our programe properly and we were on for a 4 hour 45 marathon. On the day itself it was the hottest day of the year and we had to walk a bit each mile agter the halfway point, and stop for regular shade and water breaks, which pushed our final finish time to 5.55. Based on what some gatekeepers in this group think to changing the rules to avoid a large ballot, I'd have been denied a medal and cut off simply because my 5 months of hard graft solo training wasn't done in the Sahara desert. \n\nAlso how would you account for injuries or ailments on the day that force walking (not withdrawal) with a cut off time? It's a slippery slope for all of it to be honest and I think we just have accept the london attracts a lot more people than your regular, what i would call committed, runners.\n\nHonestly, I'm at the very softest end because I don't think people with your luck are the issue. I want to weed out like, drunk people daring each other to run a marathon despite having not run since their last mile in high school. Like, submit a 10k race result at under a 14:00 pace as proof that you have some recent experience in distance (at a pace corresponding to a ~6-6:30 marathon.) Hell, maybe stipulate that the race result has to be no older than 18 months and no fresher than the day the ballot opens. Just...anything to get rid of people doing it on a whim because like, it is a major event and should be reserved for people who take it seriously, even if they won't do it *fast*.\n\nAll the “big” charities generally have great experience extras. They’ll have stands at the expo with free stuff, some of them offer massages, food and drink parties before and after. Not to mention a nice community to train with and to cheer you on. I ran for Refuge (a fairly small charity compared to ones like altziemers soc, macmillan, Samaritans etc) in 2021 and it’s definitely a fun experience!\n\nReally needs a 6 hour cut off to stop walkers.\n\nA lot of charities would lose out on a lot of sponsorship money there.\n\nAnd [this runner](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cer3z9kw3d8o) who is one of the \"ever presents\" and is guaranteed a place, would not be allowed to take part\n\n&gt; And this runner who is one of the \"ever presents\" and is guaranteed a place, would not be allowed to take part\n\nI know he's only taking up one spot, but would that really be so bad? He's run over 40 London Marathons. I'd say he's had his time, good run, etc., but let other people enjoy it too.\n\nI think he's had his fair share of London marathons 😀\n\nThe charities would still have their places that Im sure would get filled by runners, just no walkers.\n\nUnpopular opinion but I think all the world majors they should prioritize first time runners and limit the number of repeat, non-elite runners. If you qualify and never run that race, you get priority over someone who has run it more than once.\n\nTo be fair this is the first time I've entered the ballot having sworn I'd never do another Marathon ever 😂 just hope the rejection doesn't come on my birthday! I'll see how I feel then as to whether I go down the charity route, I would love to do London as the atmosphere looks incredible.\n\nSince London Marathon is part of the Abbott World Marathon Majors (WMM), I believe they should make it easier for international runners who can’t use the UK Good For Age (GFA) entry to be able to get selected in the ballot after 5+ years of putting their name in the ballot and should add a qualifying time for international runners as well. Keep the charity options as they are and reduce the amount of international “influencer” spots. \n\nI get the UK runners want and deserve to be able to run their local race. Keep more spots for them, but also remember all the international runners trying to join the event. It already costs them a lot of money to make the trip to London (flights, hotel, meals), so to force them to have no other option than running with a charity is very unfair. We are not getting any younger, and many women want to plan to have children, and not getting selected in the London ballot for multiple years in a row is disheartening for people wanting to complete all the WMM.\n\nStill much better than western states odds\n\nWait is there not qualifying times for the \nLondon Marathon? It's the easiest solution to the problem. Enforce a qualifying standard\n\nThey do - 6k of the 20k places are reserved for Good for age qualifiers, which works pretty much the same as the Boston qualifying. Above that there's championship (sub 2:40 for men and 3:15 for women) which is just guaranteed entry if you've got a time faster than that\n\nI hate to say it, but these major marathons should limit lottery applicants by age group/time. Obviously people with disabilities can have a different option. Generally-speaking if you’re not fit for a marathon (can’t complete it in 5 hours or less let’s say) you’re not really dedicated to training for it like many others are. Cut off times shouldn’t be viewed as being exclusive. It should be viewed as a goal. And the point of a RACE is time. Not distance. \n\nIn addition, they need to give folks that live in the local higher odds of getting picked than non-local and international people. Lastly, don’t allow repeat applicants who succeeded in getting picked for at least 1 year. Obviously robust systems need to be put in place to confirm the info needed to meet the criteria but what else can be done?\n\nCan’t wait to see all the celebrities and influencers getting their spaces…\n\nI don’t have a problem with “non-runners” trying out. We all started somewhere. And we all run for different reasons. But I think I there should be a time cutoff. Do it in 5 or 6 hours or you don’t get a medal nor a finish certificate. That way it preserves the element of challenge and achievement.\n\ni don’t know why anyone should start by signing up for the london marathon. i think your proposition is solid but i also think people signing up for the london marathon to walk it are selfish.\n\nIn the organizer’s view, this number of applications is a feature and not a big. They have no incentive to increase the lottery odds. They already have a GFA entry pool for qualifying standards. If you want to get better odds, run faster. If not, slum it out with the rest of us peasants.\n\nIs GFA for everyone or just UK residents?\n\nNo, only UK…I guess that makes my initial point moot…Kinda feel like an ass now haha\n\nGenuine question, should the cut off time be stricter to allow people actually wanting to actually run it have a higher chance of entering, so many people enter and walk when you could enter the night event to walk round instead\n\nRan London 2024 Marathon under MDUK. Aaron Fernandez is the organizer and he runs a top notch organization. You have to raise 1750 pounds. MDUK is a charity that raises money for muscular dystrophy causes. Muscular dystrophy is a progressive illness that is often fatal. The MDUK people were amazing. They sent me a jersey w/ my first name logo so I could iron it on. Then on race expo, Aaron and his team gave me and my family shirts with MDUK logos. On the race course, MDUK was out in three different stations and cheering the runners on. After you finish and get to the finish line, the MDUK organizers will walk you to the post race reception and give you a heroes welcome. And then you get a post race photos and massages. It was the best run marathon I have ever been part of. Sure you have to raise 1750 pounds but if I run London, I would do it with them everytime.\n\nFor anyone that wants to run London, do the charity route. I tried for the lottery 12 years in a row. After my twelveth rejection, I ran London last week with MDUK as a charity runner. London is a special marathon. They hold most of the spots for charity organizations and want to fundraiser for as many charities as possible. It will be close to impossible getting in under lottery. Run for a charity and raise money for a good cause. It’s win win for everyone.\n\nI'd make places conditional that you couldn't mention your participation on social media. Would soon thin out the herd.\n\nWell, there’s always 2026…\n\nFor 2026 I think there will be a million applications 😂\n\nI’ve heard 2027 looks even better! 😂\n\nFuck sake I was hoping to get in this year\n\nNot having to put up money first like Berlin is an issue, that would weed out people that are not really interested.\nAlso a 6 hour cut off /req would be fine.\n\nWhy should London be your first Marathon? Start local and then move international. 6 hours allows 7 km/h that is actually still walking just brisk.\n\nI think it is fair to expect people to train for a marathon and show the distance a little respect\n\nI’m looking forward to missing out on the ballot again!\n\nWhen do we typically hear back from charities about getting a bib?\n\nAh the most overhyped running jacket I’ll ever buy ………\n\nIs there a difference in odds for UK Residents vs lnternational entrants or is everyone in one big pot?\n\nI love the idea that a few people have raised, why not make it so you have to have rune 2-3 marathons before you can apply for a Major. And how about if you are an non-elite runner, you can only run in one major. With so much demand, there needs to be a way to manage it.\n\nHaving just run London this year. I’d suggest it’s already well oversubscribed with 50k people on the route. \nCan’t see how increasing the ballot to 840k from 520k for 20k places is in anyone’s interest. \nUnless they have plans to increase the size of the field. \nOtherwise Just a money grab?\n\nThat seems like they have a broken system full of bots or something.\n\nIt’s an interesting debate and one that doesn’t seem to have any right or wrong answers.\n\nWhat I think people forget with saying it should be limited to people who are only capable of running under a certain time, is that a hell of a lot of money is raised for charities at London Marathon. 2 years in a row now it’s broken the record for the single biggest day of charity fundraising in the U.K. A lot of those places will be people running their first and only marathon and likely to be “slow” (in comparison to others), but you can’t say what they’re doing isn’t a positive thing?\n\nAdditionally those who want to go for the WMM, if that’s your jam then I don’t really understand others who are downbeat on them. Yeh it’s a lot of money but if people want to do that it’s not harming anyone else?\n\nManchester Marathon as a comparison, I first entered in 2018 and you could still buy places until a few days beforehand with the event not being sold out. This year, it was sold out months in advance and they’ve already had record sign ups for 2025. \n\nI’ve entered the ballot every year since 2007, got in once in 2019 and it was my 3rd marathon. I’ve since ran twice for charity in 2021 and 2024 and was over an hour quicker this year compared to my first time (4:44 down to 3:42). However those charity places have also raised best part of £6000 as well. It’s a big ask to train and raise an amount for charity (usually £1500+) but it’s certainly not difficult. Boston starting fundraising spots at $8000 is another thing…\n\nI think running overall is just becoming more popular. Whilst there’s likely been a covid effect, I think in general it’s entered the public awareness more with world records being broken and people like The Hardest Geezer gaining attention.\n\nManchester it is!"

Off topic comments will be removed.\n\nEDIT:  Since this comment wasn't enough of a warning, we're moving onto bans.\n\nOh god. The fact that her smartwatch captures all the data including the time her heart stopped. I don’t know if I can read any more about this case.\n\nI run every morning on relatively rural trails, though I’m never the only one there. Haven’t gone without my dog in years now. And I’m scared to wear headphones.\n\nThe smartwatch part just hit differently. We use wearables to track our activity, health, progress…never thought it would register death too.\n\nThis is a tragic story.  You can remind everyone to “stay safe” or “be careful” all you want, but Laken Riley was not being unsafe.\n\nHow am I as a runner even supposed to be careful or stay safe? What am I supposed to do different from her? I don't get this advice.\n\nExactly. Run with weapons, in groups, more populated areas or indoors? Sometimes those things aren’t feasible but we use situational awareness. I’m not in a stabby mood while I run.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThen people think you're a lunatic for running with a gun if you ever mention it. As if you bring it with you as some kind of hobby you expect to engage in. I also have car insurance and keep the trunk / pantry appropriately stocked for earth quakes and such.\n\nMy husband thought I was being a bit much making sure I have a knife when going for a run between 4-6am. A woman one town over had been assaulted in a busy park at 5pm. Never any leads on the assailant.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWorst experiences I've had with people on a run were dog owners after their dog chased and tried to bite me. Had one guy try to run me over after his dog (who had chased me several times) caught a swift kick in the head when he got brave enough to take a bite.  That was the incident that inspired me to carry a pocket rocket while I run.\n\nAnother lady tried to bump me with her car and force me off the road after I gassed her dog that came after me. She followed me for several minutes until she rolled down her window to yell and I gave her a good spicy shower.\n\nHow do you carry your gun on a run? I have my cc but it feels awkward, I’m a small woman, with a slim build. Anything I have tried feels cumbersome and giant on me. Do you have any recommendations or brands you like for how to carry safely with style and it not being obvious or cumbersome? How do you carry?\n\nA stiff nylon gun belt and kydex holster under running shorts keeps things from bouncing. It's not perfectly comfortable but running isn't comfortable either. At least with typical men's shorts and a Tshirt that works perfectly fine. I would like to vastly stress the importance of protecting the trigger with a kydex holster over something that might be more comfortable though.\n\nNot OP, I got a smaller gun (1911 defender) to carry  and a spandex waste holster. I’m investing in a different one I saw a few women on TikTok use during runs: https://aliengearholsters.com/products/cloak-chest-holster-for-1911\n\ni'm about to invest in some salted watermelon flavored clif bloks.  and i just added a new pair of hokas to my portfolio.\n\nAnd there was this 2022 murder of a woman running in the morning in Memphis. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eliza-fletcher-murder-cleotha-abston-pleads-guilty-memphis-teacher-jogging/\n\nTalk about crazy to need a gun and pepper spray for a run.  Anyone tries to rob me will get myvearpods and a garmin watch...if they can catch me.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBeing a Canadian,  I wouldn't know how or where to buy a gun and bear spray is illegal 😉\n\nI always carry when I run, even though I run in the morning, in the daylight, with plenty of cars driving by. \n\nOf course I carry everywhere else too, but still.\n\nYou run with pepper spray *&amp;* a gun? Why not just one?\n\n[deleted]\n\nGotcha. I think pepper spray would work well on humans as well, but I'm all for your right to carry. \n\nI've been meaning to get some form of self-defense weapon for night runs, myself, but i don't even carry my phone with me due to the weight/bulk so I've largely ruled out carrying a gun. But I'm also afraid of wildlife, so pepper spray or even a taser have been my main considerations.\n\nHumans know better than to attack someone. They get lethal force if they want to make a stupid decision. I would personally also use lethal force on an animal, but can at least see the argument against it.\n\nHow are you able to run with a gun on your hip? Are you carrying in a special holster? Genuinely looking for products as I’m wanting to run while carrying.\n\nOpen carry, or concealed?\n\nHow do you carry to keep it from bouncing yet being (I assume) easily accessible?\n\nWhat do you use to keep the gun secure (and im presuming hidden?) while running?\n\nLets start our own running phalanx. Shields provided but BYOS(Bring Your Own Spear.) Gladius optional but highly recommended.\n\nI actually do run with a dog, but it isn't for safety, it's because she is my running coach. I don't think she'd be that helpful defending me from a gun.  She would definitely leap in to protect me from a sandwich though.\n\nYou absolutely can run with a belly band holster. Does it make you feel like you're insane? Yes. Does it make you safer? Also yes. I guess it's an option\n\nThe hard truth is that no matter what you do, there is a tiny statistical chance that you will get murdered. Riley did call the police, she did use GPS tracking, and she went to a nearby park and not some remote area... but all of this wasn't enough to save her life.\n\nThere was another murder case I can't forget about, it happened in 2013 when a 30 year old woman went out for a jog, in a residential suburb, with 0 crime rate, during broad daylight, yet she was captured by a random unhinged person who strangled her in one of the nearby bushes. Her husband was waiting for her to return from her usual jog, so when she didn't he called the police and they found her like 30 mins after she was dead.\n\nThe best thing you can do is not worry about these things. It's very, very unlikely that you'll get in trouble if you take the usual precautions.\n\nExactly, same thing when driving a car (with a much higher % chance  statistically). Sometimes you just roll bad dice for the day, that’s life\n\nThe only difference is violence against women is much more preventable than car wrecks. Car wrecks can literally be bad luck, like a traffic light going out, a tire going out, etc. Being r@ped and unalived as a woman, by a man, even in broad daylight, is something that happens much too often for it to be the equivalent to bad luck. Our society doesn’t care about women like it should. Much of the world doesn’t, and therefore too many men think it’s within their rights to use us and dispose of us as they see fit. Our safety is no one’s concern but our own because of the priorities they have engrained in us all (patriarchy), and there’s no dialogue about resolving the issue besides us carrying a million weapons. Because no one wants to talk about figuring out why men do this to us, and solving THAT problem. Yes we should weapon up, but we all know the reason why we should. It’s not about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It’s about being a woman.\n\nExcept this problem is against women. It's a targeted offense. It's insulting to compare the general risk of driving a car to getting raped and murdered as a woman...\n\nOne thing I know is to not wear ear buds or headphones while running, since you lose any auditory indicator of approaching threats, whether it's a fast moving car, aggressive dogs, or sick bucks who want to do you harm\n\nThat being said, I'd never want to run if I couldn't listen to music or a podcast or something\n\n[removed]\n\nAlso LIFE-SAVING for more mundane ambient sounds such as oncoming traffic!!!\n\nYeah a tragic story like this will make national news, but cars have got to be by far the biggest danger to runners.\n\nMy husband got those for me when I started running. They are excellent for hearing; weirdos approaching, traffic, loose dogs, toddlers demanding snacks, etc.\n\nI have hearing damage from past jobs and ear infections so I like the volume pretty high, are the open ear headphones super conspicuous if the volume is cranked? I don’t want to be cluelessly annoying anyone waiting at a crosswalk with me, unless they love old school techno mixed in with bag pipe music.\n\nIf it's bone conduction, you may not have to crank it as high as your earbuds because it's accessing a different part of the ear.\n\nThe bone conduction ones (shokz open move/open run) are interesting in that, as I understand, they work similar to how some of the implants for deaf people work. From what I'm seeing with a quick Google, bone conduction headphones can work really well for people with certain types of hearing loss. I'd suggest giving them a try and seeing if they work for you.\n\nThis case traumatized me. One of many sadly. I did not go running for a whole week after it happened which is a long time for me. I did not run with music in my ear for a month after which is wild for a 1 hour jog. I became suspicious of every passing car or person. I now am in the city and will only run in an indoor gym. I hate how common violence against women is. I’m so heart brokenhearted.\n\nTurn around and look behind you every 5 seconds or 2 strides. \n\n\nRun on a treadmill at home. \n\n\nInvite a friend to run with you. \n\n\nCarry a gun. \n\n\nThere's things you can do to prevent being murdered, but who wants to live in a world like that? If someone wants you dead, you're dead. Not much you can do. \n\nNot necessarily giving advice here. The news just reminded me a lot of myself and that even if perfect precautions are taken, it can still not be enough.\n\nRealistically, run with a buddy or guard dog, and carry pepper spray in hand. Run only in heavily trafficked areas with no isolated or hidden sections. Train with and carry a firearm with a proper holster if you're comfortable.\n\nThose are really your only options if you're not rich.\n\nI don't know the specifics of how exactly she was attacked (and I'm definitely not saying she did anything wrong), but in general being able to GTFO as quickly as possible is the best method of self defense. As a distance runner you're probably gonna be ok if you get over 100m away but that's a hard 100m to get. Keeping some baseline level of speed year round is useful (both for this and just in general training). Help isn't always close and carrying weapons all the time isn't practical, but your running abilities can be a huge asset if you get into a dangerous situation\n\nHer watch showed she fought for 17 minutes... come on now. Telling women we need to sprint faster?\n\nYou expect that runner to outsprint some assailant who has the jump on them?  Just because you can run a half marathon doesn't mean you can run a 12 second 100m, especially if you're on tired legs.\n\nYou rarely even get a chance to run away if a much stronger person decides to attack you. As a woman who runs and does martial arts I know running away is always the safest option but realitically, in most of these situations, this option just isn't even on the table.\n\n\nThis reminds me of the guy who told women to roll under a car when being attacked because \"you've never heard of a woman being assaulted under a car.\"\n\nthis is absolutely ridiculous. it doesn’t matter how fast your 100m pb is when a man who is bigger and stronger than you is holding you down.\n\nWhat a bizarre insensitive uninformed comment. I’m an excellent runner weightlifter and running/weights have not done shit for me but keep me slender and petite. My 200 lb bf lifts three times a week and the moment he plops on top of me when we are playing around I literally annoy just wiggle out unless he gets himself up. She would not have been able to just wiggle out and sprint. She was stuck there fighting for her life for 17 whole minutes and he basically stayed on her until she couldn’t fight anymore from exhaustion and killed her.\n\nBreaks my heart. I once was being followed by a car on my run early in the morning and had to literally break into someone’s backyard to get away. Was afraid I was gonna get shot for trespassing too. Always thought I was a “safe” runner, but on that day I learned being “safe” doesn’t mean you can’t be a victim.\n\nExactly. It's my understanding she did pretty much everything they recommend. During the day, populated area, told friends/family where she was going/when she should be back, etc.\n\nAlso, because it happened during a run, doesn't mean it happened \\*because\\* of the run. \n\nCould've been taken a stroll and the same thing might've happened.\n\nExactly, it's impossible to be 100% safe when there is someone actively hunting you. There's no indication she did anything wrong in terms of safety, although honestly one reason I don't wear earbuds when I'm running is to maintain better situational awareness. Apparently she was wearing air pods at the time, which I'm sure helped this guy sneak up on her easier, but I don't think I'd go so far as to call that being unsafe, even if personally I prefer not to use them for safety reasons.\n\nI wish more of the story was that a woman was attacked. \n\nNot that an  \"illegal alien\" did it. \n\nReally takes the focus off of the actual crime and victim.\n\nI was running in broad daylight on a trail chock full of families and other runners and I STILL had a creep follow me on his bike for a quarter mile despite yelling at him as loudly as possible!\n\nDon’t run outdoors with noise canceling headphones.  That may not have been something that would have saved her, but it is unsafe.\n\nI live in Athens and have run at the IM fields. \n\nShe was not in the woods in the middle of nowhere like the articles make it seem. It was a trail around the lake on the University of Georgia’s campus. It’s rare not to see someone else on the trail, and one of the University’s parking decks is right beside it. \n\nSo, not only in broad daylight, but in an area that is well-known and usually well-populated. \n\nShe literally did everything right, and this man was just sick and evil.\n\n[deleted]\n\n🙏\n\nI’m a man and even I open carry my pistol when I run, i’m tired and vulnerable when running so I can’t imagine how a woman would feel.\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nMan with it getting so dark so early these days and I’m training for a marathon and needing those long runs and working fulltime this absolutely fucking sucks. Fuck that guy\n\nThis is quite frankly insulting as a post. Stay safe and be careful? She did everything right... what more would you want from us women?\n\nI had the same thought. She shared her location with roommates, she talked to her mom while on runs, she was running during morning hours, etc. The only thing she could have done differently is not be a woman. I feel so bad for her and her family.\n\nI am a guy but I've thought about running with pepper spray because if somebody caught me at the end of a run, I'm tired and weak and wouldn't put up much of a fight. I just don't know how to carry it with me (I hate having things in my hands when I run). I like to run at the track at my local park, and I think that's *probably* one of the safest outdoor places you can run because there are always quite a few runners and visibility is high.\n\nThey make pepper spray with a thing that wraps around your hand so it’s always ready. \n\nUse a vest. Then you can carry all sorts of stuff.\n\nPeople don’t like accepting a lack of control over our lives. If someone wants to murder you, they will probably succeed. Men are bigger and stronger than women. And what can pepper spray or a gun do if they sneak up behind you or lie in wait, hidden?\n\nWhy is it always telling women to stay safe and be alert and carry weapons and know how to fight and never “hey men get therapy and talk to your friends”. I’m tired of the onus being put on the victims.\n\nHere are some ideas that an individual (man) could do! Hopefully this could help prevent future rapes:\n\nIf you’re feeling like you might rape someone if you go out at night, just stay home instead. If you do have to go out, never go alone. Instead, travel in a group so your friends can prevent you from raping someone. Don’t drink or do drugs, it lowers inhibitions and you may be more inclined to rape. Don’t talk to strange women, that way you won’t even think about raping them. You could even wear headphones, that way you look unapproachable and you’re less likely to notice a woman nearby. If you meet someone and you’re worried about raping them, call a trusted friend so they can remind you of the consequences of your actions. If you see a woman walking alone, immediately walk in the other direction before you’re tempted to follow her. If you see a woman wearing revealing clothes, simply cover your eyes.\n\nIt's reminding people that anyone has the potential to be a victim. Also that you cannot control what other people do and there are dangerous people out there who intend to do others harm. We could try and focus on telling people to try therapy or talk to friends, but almost all murderers know killing someone is wrong and know if they get caught there is a high chance they'll never see the outside of a prison again. It seems impossible to reason with someone willing to do something so horrible. I've even read that if you're dealing with a psychopath it can actually be more dangerous to send to therapy because all it does is give them an opportunity to practice and hone their manipulation skills against a professional. Sadly it just seems like some people are hellbent on killing and I'm not sure there is anything we can do to prevent at least some murderers from killing.\n\nBecause one an individual can do and the other requires a societal overhaul that unfortunately won’t happen within the next several decades\n\nI’ve done everything right and the only times I’ve been attacked have been in broad daylight on a busy street with people *visibly* around- about 10 people within 100 feet and no one did anything at any point. The question is always “what did you to to prevent it and defend yourself” as if enough precautions would do anything against someone determined to assault. The blame on a survivor is rarely placed on the attacker in my experience. I do think that change will take a while but it has to start somewhere.\n\nBecause \n\n&gt; Jose Ibarra, who entered the U.S. illegally two years ago, is charged with murder and other crimes\n\nThe article doesn’t even mention this. He’s a perennial criminal  \n\nYou don’t get therapy for this guy. You lock him up behind bars. Nice try to try to make it a problem all men have though \n\nTalking about why you want to brutally murder women isn’t going to do anything. We as a society need to be able to say “this guy has fucked up x times, let’s put him away so the rest of us can enjoy life”\n\nSuggesting that men are prone to being murdery because they lack therapy is also kind of insulting. Therapy doesn't help people that do things like this.\n\nWhy do men keep killing us then\n\nOne does not preclude the other.\n\nI read the post as “hey, just reminding you that there is evil out there! Don’t be careless!” Not as an insult.\n\nAbsolutely, I'm sort of surprised that not everyone here is having this reaction. \"Stay safe\"??? Really? When are we going to get over this victim-blaming BS?\n\nI do find it surprising that this post is interpreted as insulting or as talking to a specific group of runners. To me, it serves as a reminder (to everyone) that bad things can and do happen anywhere, at any time.\n\nIf this results in even one person leaving this thread being slightly more vigilant, or checking in on the welfare of another, perhaps it’s worth it. 💙\n\nDidn’t mean to be insulting! Just wanted to bring some attention to the situation.\n\nIt's victim blaming. She was careful. She did try to stay safe.  Your whole post acts in bad faith that she wasnt\n\nOne more thing... Please, please don't wear earbuds while running (men and women). It absolutely limits situational awareness and a bad actor will use it against you.\n\nNot sure why you're being down voted for this. It really is good advice for staying safe that I'm assuming people just don't want to hear. At the very least, bone conducting headphones are a great option that allow you to still hear things around you.\n\nIs it just me, or is this a terribly written headline?\n\nI completely agree!\n\n&gt;Laken Riley went for a morning jog. Less than 30 minutes later, she was dead. What we know about her final moments\n\nI mean... Come on. What a crap way to get clicks and essentially reframe the spotlight away from the rapist/murderer, and dishonour the victim.\n\n  \nNot to mention it reads terribly from grammatical standpoint.\n\nI’m not sure why it just hit me, but I find it wild that in our society we are civil enough that the family and friends could sit in a court room with the man that brutally sexually assaulted and murdered their loved one in a heinous attack like that.\n\nI don’t mean that as a personal attack against the family and friends, just that the totality of it all is insane. To be in the same room with him and be able to restrain yourself from seeing if your thumbs can make his eyeballs touch the back of his skull is quite the self discipline.\n\nMy cousin was violently murdered in 2002, and it's still hard for me to read the court documents that describe the murder.\n\nI had to watch my aunt and uncle not only sit through it but also testify. \n\nNow as a parent myself, I don't think it's something they really thought about or could even process.  Just something they had to endure with no other real choice.\n\nDuring one of the serial killer murder trials (I believe Dahmer) one of the victims’ sister was taken out of court for (rightfully) being enraged at the man. \n\nThere is a time when showing emotion is important—it’s a reminder that there are some crimes so heinous that being too civil diminishes the impact.\n\nThis is why vigilante stories have always been popular.\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;Alternatively, you can keep quiet and do something about it yourself which has a much higher chance of resulting in the perpetrator being punished.\n\nWe don't live in a movie bud.\n\nme personally i would like to be involved in every single aspect and detail if a loved one of mine was killed, from every word in court, to the day of sentencing, till his death in prison. thats just me.\n\nYou don’t torture him in front of witnesses silly.\n\nI wish the message was “violence against women must be stopped” and not “women must be careful” and “he was an immigrant”. \n\nJose Ibarra has been arrested and sentenced for life. The act was widely condemned as all acts of its kind are. \n\nWhat else do you propose that we do to send the message that violence against women isn’t alright?\n\nObviously there are people like Ibarra, legal and illegal, who don’t care about that message. So one has to be careful, no matter what. \n\nThe fact that there are a wide range of items marketed as “safety item for women running/alone” and this is still an ongoing issue makes it very clear that this perpetrator and others like him are not unique nor uncommon. That is the travesty - that at this moment in time, women are still targeted and preyed upon with regularity. \n\nIt’s exhausting. Women deserve to let down their defenses, but that can’t happen as offenders are widespread.\n\nSure, I agree and I sympathise. It’s not fair. \n\nHowever, the reality is that people like Ibarra exist and they are a threat to women. Despite what you believe, evidence shows that most men who do these types of actions are usually social outcasts. They tend to have some type of anti-social disorder that manifests in impulsivity and violent actions. \n\nBy and large they aren’t involved in the social debate about gender rights nor do they care about the unfairness that genders face. This makes them unreachable when it comes to morality lessons. \n\nReality is that there are men who prey on women and others who are weaker than them. Telling women to keep their defences up when in vulnerable positions isn’t fair, but it is the most effective immediate measure to preventing another case like this. \n\nOff the top of my head, more women in positions of leadership and law enforcement, better education for men and boys around gendered violence of all types, making the VAWA act permanent and not have to be passed every 5 years ( last time Trump was in office it lapsed and I’m sure will again in 2027 during his presidency), hold social media and internet companies accountable for those who spread gendered hate on their platforms (such as Nick Fuentes rape threats on X/Twitter). There is a lot more society could do to address the problem of violence against women to the men who are the perpetuators and not the victims.\n\nOk but should we just ignore reality of dangers women face while we wait for those actions to be implemented? \n\nEven at best, if we implemented all of that right now, all of those solutions require a long-term social change. We’re probably talking years, if not decades for those actions to bear fruit.\n\nIt seems prudent to advise anyone vulnerable to take measures to prevent this occurrence. Especially since you don’t have a single immediate solution that will guarantee that safety. \n\nI didn’t say people should ignore dangers. I wished it was different. I did not say I could solve it. You are putting those claims on me. \n\nWhile I’m all for men not raping and murdering women instead of women having to stay safe it’s an utopia. What I can advice is something like a Nathan safety alarm. You need to pull a rope to let it go off or to turn it off and it has buttons on it to distract a possible rapist into thinking that’s the way to turn it off. The noise is as loud as an ambulance sirene. I bought it after an attempted rape 15 kilometres from where I normally run. Thank goodness for that girl another runner passed and heard her scream and interrupted, filming the potential rapist as he walked away so they could arrest him later.\n\nA Nathan branded alarm is probably more expensive than all the other personal alarms sold for decades. \n\nI think the scary part is that running with phones is not as safe as you might think. Her phone went into sos mode but the police were unable to find her location in time and send someone to help. I’m not advocating to carry no phone with you, but it’s not the best line of self defense.\n\nI struggle with this story. I once was almost kidnapped when I was out on a run near campus. I got very lucky but know others don’t. It’s one of the reasons I continue to try to run to stay active.\n\nthis is passive victim blaming and it’s disgusting.\n\nI want to say that this is absolutely horrific. Hate hearing stories like this. \n\nI’d also like to give my 2 cents.\n\nI think that while it’s smart to have some level of preparedness for something like this, I also think people shouldn’t be living in fear of something like this occurring to them.\n\nFor example, someone’s suggestion of carrying a gun seems quite extreme. \n\nFrom what I understand, you are FAR more likely to be hit by a vehicle while running. You are much more likely to be affected by heat-related complications. And if we look at assault statistics, incidents are far more likely to involve someone you know rather than a stranger.\n\nI’m not trying to downplay anyone’s worries, and everyone has a different level of comfort with safety measures. I think it’s just important to try and keep things in perspective. While something like this is absolutely tragic and horrifying, these types of incidents are not common by any means.\n\nWe should be aware and take reasonable precautions, but we shouldn’t let fear stop us from living our lives.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\neven though this happened a few months ago i’m glad people are still getting the word out. yall stay safe out here on the roads and trails.\n\nThe attack was a few months ago but I think the trial just concluded yesterday or the day before\n\nahh ok makes sense it’s making it rounds again. i’m\ncool with that. shouldn’t be a death sentence to go out for a run in 2024.\n\nIt happened in February\n\n“a few months” for me could mean anything over 6 months. i know reddit can opinionated and pedantic af so my bad i didn’t say “almost a year”\n\nHey! I didn’t mean that in a rude way. Was just saying it was even further back than a few months ago and to your point it’s great they’re getting the word out.\n\nit’s all good, have a great weekend.\n\nYou as well\n\nIt’s sad but I literally just don’t run outside unless my husband can come with me. I bought a peloton tread to run inside. It disgusts me that this is how I live but my anxiety is so high running alone outside I don’t even enjoy it.\n\nwhat a disgusting piece of shit. i hope him and everyone like him one day get what they deserve, to be murdered brutally and violently, without dignity, with as much suffering the world can muster for them. so so revolting and disgusting that we actually have people in this world who somehow think rape and murder are ok. i cannot think of any way this man could ever be subject to enough suffering in comparison to what he did to that girl. we should ALL speak out and condemn these heinous and disgusting acts of violence against women.\n\nHow are you getting downvoted? Makes me question who is in this thread.\n\nI’m always reminded of the adage, “a lock will only deter a honest thief” when it comes to personal safety and running. \n\nWhistles, lights, pepper spray, sirens, even the go guarded plastic ring knives. They can only do so much to deter crimes of convenience/opportunity.\n\nBut this exceeds that. If a person is committed enough to rape and murder, there is only one tool you can run with, that I very rarely bring with me anymore. A small, concealed handgun. \n\nBoth my sisters run extensively. I worry for them. As a man, I am privileged to worry almost exclusively about aggressive dogs. They do not share that privilege. \n\nI’ve been mocked about carrying a gun, about being afraid of dogs, of people.\n\nI want to tell you- if you opt to run with a gun: \n\nYou are not afraid. \n\nYou are prepared. \n\nAnd as one runner to another- I hope you never need to use it and I wish it didn’t have to be this way.\n\nI’ve been seriously considering starting to carry. I’ve been running a LOT and because it’s been getting dark lately, often having to run in the dark too.\n\nI’m from Memphis. Going home for the holidays. Will be jogging with my gun. Might consider even running inside with a gym membership. I hate this world.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWas your teammate okay?\n\n\"Don't get murdered\" isn't very helpful advice. \"Remember not to murder anyone\" everybody.\n\nTragic and heartbreaking. Not sure why, but this is the first post I've seen regarding this. Safety, whether its from cars, bikes, or psychos can't be taken for granted, and needs to be broadcast. Pretty much why I don't run with music anymore. None of the news subs seem to allow posts on this?\n\nI will never again run outside unless my husband is with me. No way. I can’t outfight a predator being a small woman. It sucks but it is my reality\n\nI get that these stories are scary, but they are so uncommon. You are way more likely to die in a car crash.\n\nAgreed. Please don’t let it deter you from running outside as hundreds of people still do.\n\nYes, I won’t take the risk but kudos to those that are braver. My respect\n\nOPs focus was on safety, which is why im sad at how many dogwhistling racist would come out of shadows to chime in.\n\nI think the mods must have done a good job deleting, I didn't see any racist comments just a ton of deleted ones\n\nPart of safety is situational awareness, which involves identifying potential threats. The base rate of any such attack is extremely low. Still, people have biases and stereotypes that play into their safety responses. Talking about things like base rates and race/ethnicity/gender is really important for moderating and correcting biases, stereotypes, and generalizations.\n\nHow would situational awareness have saved her?\n\nIn her case? No one knows.\n\nMen are by far the biggest danger women face.\n\nYet what are we to do about it?\n\nThis is the question. Men are the perpetrators. When will we stand up as a society and say no more of this garbage?\n\nDo? On a personal level, legal level, community engagement and prevention level? There's so much we can do (google it). What we cannot do is ensure 100% safety all the time.\n\nThis is so scary. I hope more women will carry. I wish they didn't need to.\n\nI'm not sure why this case has bothered me so. The medical community really needs to list existing as a female, as Health Risk of the highest order. ..\nSo.so.Sad.\n\nI'm not trying to invalidate or excuse violent behavior from men against women, but what's the point of sharing this? It's an absolute tragedy, but posting an article about a random murder on a running subreddit heightens fear for no reason, akin to sharing an article about a school shooting to the teenagers subreddit. There was absolutely nothing she could have done to be safer, no way for us to \"stay safe\", there's no lesson to be learned here. You're more likely to die in a car accident than be a murder victim.\n\n[removed]\n\n[deleted]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nIt was on campus, but out in the woods. There were probably very few people around at the time.\n\nNo I’ve run this trail it’s very busy\n\n[removed]"

At this rate we'll need a World Major for all the World Major rejects 😅\n\nyou applied to all 7 in one year and didn't get in any? you get a medal!\n\nOr you get to punch Matt Choi\n\nI ran Berlin in 2001 before Abbott was formed in 2006\n\nAnother marathon for major rejects to get rejected from.\n\nYep. My first thought exactly \n\nNot with that attitude you won’t!\n\nMaybe expanding the number of majors will decrease demand for the current ones as it gets harder to \"achieve\" them all. It's just a wealth flex at this point.\n\nMarathoning has become so popular that small races are selling out early. I’m happy our sport is growing, but I’m not sure it will help much.\n\nYOU THINK I WANT TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE WORLD FOR A MARATHON THAT'S... oh wait, I live 2 hours away!\n\nExactly how I feel haha. Nice to see a lot more positivity here than over at advancedrunning. I usually prefer that sub, but the equivalent post was full of grumpy and entitled comments from Americans. I'm excited to have a major that's actually accessible from Aus/NZ. I think it's fair that we get one!\n\nI have mixed feelings on them adding more majors. Sounds like Cape Town and Shanghai might be getting in as well in the next few years. On the one hand, good for those localities and good to spread the love out around the globe. \n\nOn the other, idk, 6 just kinda felt like a good number? If all three end up added we'll be at 9 to complete them, which is quite the task with all the lotteries and travel. 6 was already a lot. I recognize most of the Abbot Major Series is just marketing and it isn't \"real\", but I guess it just seems like adding more really brings the marketing aspect to the forefront in some way?\n\nI can understand that perspective, but the vast majority of people who want to run a major are never going to actually go for all 6 anyway. For people who aren't in Europe/America/Japan, currently completing even ONE major is \"quite a task with all the travel\". Tokyo is the closest to where I live, and that's still at least 14 hours each way. The Americans ones more like 20-25 hours, and the European ones 30 hours. And those are the fastest (so certainly not the cheapest!) flights I could find.\n\nNew majors don't stop you from enjoying the original 6, but they do give people in other parts of the world the opportunity to run in a race with some serious backing. It's obvious Sydney has already improved a lot as a race in the last few years.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou don't get in to most of those anyway :)\n\nHad to go to Melbourne for business a few years back. That’s a STUPID long flight (LAX-&gt;SYD). And even worse, I started in ATL.\n\nWhy are you getting downvoted?\n\nProbably because it reads as an entitled American not liking Sydney being added because it is far away. Meanwhile Australians have to travel 8 hours+ to go to any of the 6 majors. I don’t think that was savejeebus’ intent but people are quick to up and downvote.\n\nHonest apologies for my words coming across that way. I meant only that the flight from LAX was super long. I love the fact Sydney is now a major. And I would love to run it, though I’d have to get a lottery or charity entry. My original comment was intended to be taken only as commentary on the flight time.\n\nAll good! I didn’t think you meant it that way. Flying almost anywhere from Australia is super long (and expensive). Still could be worse, could be New Zealand.\n\nI mean I get it. I do. But if you follow population, it really makes sense where they are. Heck, Australia has what? 27 million people? Tokyo itself has 14. I bet Sydney puts on a helluva a marathon but having one that far out of the way does nothing to democratize the sport. If anything it makes it even more elusive than it already is to run all of the majors. I don’t mind being called an entitled American, it is what it is, but the fact is, we have 350 some odd million American and are one of the bigger drivers of the global running movement.\n\nWhat’s your actual point? Running all the majors has no inherent value. People can decide to attach meaning to it if they so wish but no one is making anyone run the Sydney marathon. Personally, I can’t justify the cost of running any of the majors so I haven’t run one. Others are free to think differently.\n\nOf course it has value. It has as much value as someone places on it\n\nGoing by your logic all majors should be in China and India. 4 billion &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 350 million 🤡\n\nDid you miss the part about being a driver for the global running movement? Don’t forget organization. Does India have well organized marathons?\n\nI think Beijing or Shanghai would be great additions.\n\nYou do realise that Australia is close to Asia and is a more accessible location for runners than anything in the US or Europe? Keep your US-centric attitude though, it's what he US is best at after all, thinking the world revolves around them\n\nHave a wonderful day\n\nWhere are your running shoes and clothes made? \n\nNow tell me that China, India and Southeast Asia aren't driving running.....\n\nBut hey, we simply have a disagreement in opinion and that’s all good. I’m not interested in arguing further. I simply wish you all the best in your running journey. Enjoy the miles my friend\n\nlol the major brands are driving running. The supply chain and economics merely dictate where they’re made. That has nothing to do with anything other than economics. Try again\n\nProbably because OP already has *three* majors in his country but apparently feels entitled to have all other global races be selected based on whether or not they're convenient for him.\n\nNot sure it’s all about entitlement. I’d rather have the majors accessible to largest number of people. To that end, I’d love to see Beijing included as well.\n\nCheers, let's demote NYC and Chicago then, since Boston's already covering the US. We can move those to Africa and South America.\n\nIt’s all about organization. Chicago and NYC do a great job. I don’t know enough about the South American marathons to make a judgement call. I’m not about removing any. Let’s be clear. I’m about adding marathons to the majors list that create the most accessibility\n\nIt’s like a 2h flight\n\nSydney to LA is negative five hours and LA to Sydney is 33 hours. (Accounting for time zones of course since the actual flight is about 14 hours and there’s a 19 hour time zone difference).\n\nYeah yeah. I missed the airport code and thought he meant Sydney to Melbourne\n\nI saw that but wanted to make a timezone joke about flying backwards in time.\n\nYour getting from LAX to SYD in 2 hours?\n\nlol didn’t notice LAX. Read much more like he was flying from Sydney to Melbourne lol\n\nYep.\n\nI guess I worded it poorly?\n\n🤷‍♂️\n\n&gt;Sydney will form part of the journey towards the next Major milestone, the new Nine Star medal, which will begin when two more races are added to the series; however Sydney finishers can start counting the race toward their Nine Star in 2025.  \n   \nSanlam Cape Town Marathon and Shanghai Marathon, which are currently in the candidacy process, could join the series in as early as 2026 and 2027 respectively should they pass two years of assessments.  \n   \nThe current Six Star program will remain in place for runners striving to complete the original six Abbott World Marathon Major races. AbbottWMM has committed to keeping the Six Star medal which will continue to be awarded for this amazing achievement even when the Nine Star medal becomes available.  \n   \nTo help commemorate every runner’s journey and race achievements, AbbottWMM also introduced a commemorative coin for each race and Sydney now has one. Custom displays can be purchased to showcase the runner’s achievements from two races to all seven. The full range is available here.  \n  \n***Source:*** [https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/content-hub/sydney-marathon-joins-the-majors](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/content-hub/sydney-marathon-joins-the-majors)\n\nReally glad they are keeping the six star. For financial and practical reasons, it can take a lot of us a long time to get all six. I’m glad they aren’t moving the goalposts.\n\nI wasn’t sure what this meant for the Cape Town marathon. So glad to know it’s still in the candidacy process.\n\nThe first major in the southern hemisphere. Was expecting they chose Perth instead :)\n\nPerth doesn't have the infrastructure to host a major or the major landmarks that Sydney has.\n\nWhat landmarks are in Chicago lol.\n\nThe beeeeaaaan 🫘\n\nThe legacy of the Chicago marathon\n\nTell me it’s not super awesome to be running alongside trains going above and around you, the elevated in chicago is awesome. \n\nWe run through Lincoln park, next to the zoo and chicago history museum, across bridges over the river, sears tower, lower Wacker, starting and ending in grant park - the bean and sculpture gardens. \n\nAll the neighborhoods are amazing, especially pilsen, Chinatown and boystown. It’s one of the best races.\n\nI know. I meant that landmarks aren’t relevant. Chicago is not a landmark-filled city. \n\nIt’s a great city and a good race\n\nAustralian here, never been to the US. I couldn't tell you a single thing about Chicago and would struggle to locate it on a map (I know it's on the lake).\n\nIt's not a world city. Large city, definitely. World city, definitely not\n\nI mean, 3/4 of the USA couldn’t find Australia on the map. Not sure that’s a good test \n\nThe U.S. has a few world cities. NYC, LA, Washington maybe. Perhaps Miami?\n\nNot sure Australia has any either.\n\nWillis tower is an iconic landmark. At least if you played microsoft flight simulator and spent your childhood trying to fly between the antennas without crashing.\n\n~~Sears~~ Willis Tower\n\nSydney is a global city and Perth isn’t\n\nThat's what Sydney people think. But it really isn't an important city.\n\n[deleted]\n\nFour laps of Riverside Drive let's goooo\n\nGreat news for Sydney but...is it going to be hard for a local resident to get in? :(\n\nApparently if you've done it before you'll get priority next year.\n\nYou will get priority for next 3 years if you ran it during the candidacy years of 2023/2024.\n\nI've run it the last be 2 years so that's good to hear. \n\nI’m hoping it won’t be! I’ll be throwing my hand in the ballet :)\n\nLol have u seen london? 🤣\n\nWell, I guess that means that the Melbourne Marathon isn't Australia's biggest marathon anymore...\n\nThis makes my laugh. Melbourne was a much bigger event for so long and Sydney just came through and beat them. \n\nI'm not sure what 'beat them' means in this context given the major distinction is completely arbitrary. Valencia is still a far better race than Sydney for instance\n\nGold Coast wouldn't be far behind Melbourne would it?\n\nWohooO! Not unexpected, but good choice!\n\nThis is great news.  First major in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nI don’t mind Cape Town going in - you need one in Africa.  But I worry about South Africa long term as it’s a basket case of a country.  I went there on a rugby tour years ago and it felt a little unsafe.   \n\nI’d also love to see a South American race get added in preference to China but $$$ talks.\n\nChina makes sense with population and the growing popularity. I'm not sure I'd like to visit China for a marathon though. Air quality there is not that great.\n\nI understand you having that perception, but you’ll be perfectly fine if you just avoid the troublesome areas in Cape Town. I live in Cape Town and have run the previous two events, great race even though I think the Two Oceans ultra has a MUCH better route.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf a Chinese race gets added it will be a bigger city like Shanghai.  To be honest I’ve never heard of Chongqing.\n\nAnyone who’s run Sydney can explain it? I see it’s end of August race, how’s the weather, track, crowd support? Also if you know if it’s lottery and how difficult to win the lottery and if there’s any time qualifiers? I’m sure things might change but tbh never considered running Sydney before.\n\nI ran it this year, crowd support and organisation was incredible. Weather was perfect (high of 16 degrees) although weather the year before was in the 30s by 9am (Sydney weather is extremely variable, can be very hot one day and then need your jacket the next).\n\nI'm unsure about the lottery side of things as I'm a local here but I didn't hear about any time requirements. The course itself is quite undulating with plenty of smooth uphills and downhills and very scenic in some areas, particularly when running across the harbour bridge. \n\nThere were heaps of bands and performers throughout the course adding to the atmosphere. Heaps of water stations, hydralyte stations and a few energy gel points.\n\nI don’t think there has previously been any time/lottery requirements to enter because demand has not previously exceeded capacity. That might change now, though.\n\nThe weather can be a bit unpredictable. This year it was lovely but last year was savagely hot and runners had a really rough time of it.\n\nRunning across the Harbour Bridge at the start is an absolute highlight, that’s one of the world’s great running experiences imho.\n\nHistorically, very easy to get in. Maybe this will change, but I expect it won't be too hard.\n\n\nWeather was unseasonably hot in 2023, but normally when the race was in mid September it was great conditions. Race is now 2 weeks earlier so weather will be fine.\n\n\nCourse has enough hills that it's not a flat out pr course, but it's not a hilly course by any means. The worst section IMO is the climb in the last 2km, it's brutal if you're at your limit. There used to be lots of hairpins but they fixed that this year. \n\n\nCourse vibe in 2023 was ok but not amazing. Again, maybe this improves now that the race is a major and running is enjoying a renaissance in Australia.\n\nWeather: usually warm but has been prone to a couple years of being hot (I think last years was pretty brutal) \nTrack: Hilly, the start is an immediate climb down but you’ll spend a lot of the time either coming up or coming down, Sydney is a very hilly city. \nCrowd: really good actually, there’s some quiet spots like over the harbour bridge or through highway tunnels but where there can be a crowd there is and they’re all cheering. \nFinish: my only complaint really is the finish, although finishing at the opera house is amazing - you have to walk about 1km to get out the back and try to get back to finish if you’re meeting people there. It’s super busy so you also have to take moments to cut across the track as instructed on small bursts (all organised passing where the organisers send the runners into a right or left lane so the crowd filters into the middle then they switch the lane and you pass) \nGetting in: not sure now, it was a sell out last year but so were the other majors in Australia (Gold Coast &amp; Melbourne) I ran all 3 this year and didn’t need a time or lottery but I’m sure that will change now it’s a major or at least will sell out instantly and put more pressure on the spots for GC and Melb\n\nOn a good day, the weather can be great, but there was a brutally hot race a year or so ago, and there’s lots of turns. It’s definitely not in our top two marathons - but the good thing about Sydney getting the ‘major’ status  over GC and Melbourne, is that entries for those shouldn’t become a circus.\n\nI ran it this year. It will probably change but there aren't any entry requirements yet. Crowds are good. Running across the bridge and finishing in front of the opera house is pretty special. \n\nI hope its a difficult course. we already have 3 track meet majors (london, chicago, Berlin), It would be nice to have a major that's more challenging.\n\nMost elevation gain of all the majors, over 1000 ft\n\ngood\n\nSydney is pretty hilly, almost Boston-like with all the rolling hills, fast downhill start, and the course being net downhill.\n\nIt's pretty hilly. I think it's a good course. \n\nRelative to the other majors, Sydney is the most challenging.\n\nSo what now for people who have the medal for finishing all 6 World Marathon Majors?\n\nDo they hand it back? Do they get a new \"7\" medal if they finish Sydney in the future? What if they've done Sydney already?\n\n6 star stay for now. No new medal until they add tow more race then if you finish them you'll get 9 star medal. It's in the FAQ\n\nAah, I see. Thank you. I hadn't seen the FAQ\n\nNow that there will be new locations added to the list of marathon majors, will the 6 stars be specific to those who conplete the original 6 locations? Will we be eligible for 6 stars if we do Sydney instead of say, Chicago?\n\nYea, specific to original 6\n\nWow, I guess they are getting rid of the half then?\n\nThey already did this year. Was a mess last year with the half and full running together, having the marathon start last on a hot day was a bad decision. No other majors have another race the same day, so having 2 other race events that same day is interesting.\n\nAUD $250 entry for candidacy club early access is a VERY sharp increase. It was $170 and the course for 2025 is exactly the same.\n\nI have read the FAQ. Is it not refundable and not transferable. Basically aiming for the FOMO. \n\nOh look, another one!\n\nIS there a ballot entry?\n\nYes\n\nIts awesome!\n\nWas hoping to do this next year, worried that it will now be insanely hard to get into\n\nThere's the general lottery that you can apply to\n\nI think it's great news, just seen you can already pre-register for a Sydney bib for next year here:  \n[https://marathontours.com/en-gb/events/sydney-marathon/](https://marathontours.com/en-gb/events/sydney-marathon/)  \nI anticipate a quick sell out, as with the others...\n\nHow hard do you all think it'll be to get in next year?\n\n[deleted]\n\nDoubt he will come back to Sydney. Let's move on from him\n\nThis is getting ridiculous. \n\nThe prestige of having run a ‘major’ is lost when you start adding so many cities to the list. It feels more like an Abbott money grab.\n\nWill one still be able to get a six star medal if they run Sidney with any combination of the OG six?\n\nNo, 6 star is for the OG6\n\nWill this not count towards the 6 star medal? I wish I knew this before applying.\n\nBreakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, anytime.\n\nHoly shit now that's gonna be expensive from Europe! :(\n\nOn NYCM day 🤦‍♀️\n\nSo are they retiring the 6 star medal or can we still get it? Really hope they keep it.\n\nThey're keeping it. They said the new medal will be 9 stars when they add the next two (which they say will probably be Cape Town and Shanghai) but until then you still just work towards getting 6 of them for the big medal\n\n*edit this is the article\n\nhttps://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/content-hub/sydney-marathon-joins-the-majors\n\nAwesome, it says they will still keep the 6 star medal even after they release the 9 star medal.\n\nCan't put the participation medals too far out of reach.\n\nWhy stop at 9? This is nuts.\n\nWhat happens when you get the medal?\n\nYou win\n\nA big sign appears saying “Level Up”\n\nNothing, it's just a lifetime goal of mine"

    "title": "PSA: How your heart rate zone 2 might be lying to you.",
    "body": "I see posts in a number of different running subs that ask something along these lines:\n\n&gt; I'm trying to run slow in zone 2, but my heart rate as 200 beats per minute! I'm running 16:00/mile (10:00/km)!\n\nBasically, the concern is that OP feels they are running slow trying to target zone 2, but their heart rate monitor (HRM) is reading something in zone 4 or zone 5. They don't feel like they can run any slower and want to know what's up.\n\nThere is a lot of reasons why your HR is reporting as high as it is, so let's unpack everything. If you don't want to read the post, here's the TL;DR:\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n1. Get a chest strap.\n1. Heart rate is influenced by many daily life factors.\n1. Do a field test to find your aerobic threshold.\n1. Consistency, consistency, consistency.\n1. Ultimately, RPE trumps monitoring your HR.\n\nHere's the lengthy breakdown:\n\n# Get a chest strap\nWatch HRMs are *notorious* for being inaccurate. First off, the top of the wrist is a bad place to optically read your pulse. The wrist is filled with tendons making the optical view difficult for the HRM. Further, most GPS watches aren't placing high priority on their optical HRM accuracy. There is a lot of optical noise in the wrist the firmware must eliminate to ensure it's getting a clear, clean pulse reading. The bottom of the wrist really isn't much better.\n\nSecond, your wrist is swinging while you run. Unless the watch is really strapped down tightly, your arm swing is likely introducing noise for the optical reader to filter, thus making it more difficult to get accurate readings.\n\nHowever, a chest strap only needs to read the electrical signal your heart produces while beating. Unlike optical HRMs, there is very little to noise that the chest strap HRM needs to filter out. Movement isn't a concern either. As such, it's much easier to read your actual heart rate. Even cheap chest straps will likely give more reliable readings than your expensive GPS watch HRM.\n\nIf chest straps are uncomfortable for you, consider a dedicated optical armband HRM. These fit on the forearm or upper arm and optically read your pulse from a more visible position under the skin, away from tendons. Because they're dedicated to one job only, they are usually just as reliable as chest straps.\n\n# Heart rate can by highly variable\nYour heart rate is susceptible to a number different factors that create as much as 15-20% variance from day-to-day. Caffeine, sleep habits, personal stress, your daily circadian rhythm, heat and humidity, illness, etc. I personally have gone out for a very light, very easy zone 2 run, only to see my chest strap reporting that my heart rate is beating 20 beats per minute higher than what I would normally expect.\n\nSome tips:\n\n1. Try to reduce your caffeine intake, especially at night.\n1. Get good quality, deep, full sleep.\n1. Find ways to manage stress during the day (easier said than done).\n1. Run in the cooler mornings if possible.\n\nThe more you can put yourself into a predictable physical state each day and train at the same time each day, the more reliable your heart rate readings will be.\n\n# Find true zone 2 with a field test\nYou might also have your heart rate training zones set incorrectly. Did you do some math based on your max heart rate, or using your resting heart rate to find your heart rate reserve? Then you are using some arbitrary percentage boundaries which really don't align with our physiology.\n\nIf you want to find your true zone 2 boundary, the best way is to do a simple field test, [as explained by Evoke Endurance](https://evokeendurance.com/our-latest-thinking-on-aerobic-assessment-for-the-mountain-athlete/):\n\n1. Run a very flat route (&lt; 1% grade) or on a treadmill. This test cannot be executed on hills.\n1. Warm up getting your heart rate up to where you think the top of your zone 2 boundary is.\n1. Keep this pace for 1 hour.\n1. Cool down.\n\nTake the average heart rate for the last thirty minutes of your test and divide it by the average heart rate of the first thirty minutes of your test. If your heart rate drifted:\n\n1. Less than 3.5%, you could have run harder.\n2. Between 3.5% and 5%, you found your zone 2.\n3. More than 5%, you ran too hard.\n\nFor example, if the average HR for the first 30 minutes of your test was 145 bpm and it averaged 152 bpm for the last 30 minutes, then 152/145 ~= 1.048275862. Your HR drifted about 4.8% during that test. 145 is the top of your zone 2.\n\nExecute this test every 6-8 weeks to keep an eye on your aerobic development.\n\n# Consistently run week-over-week\nIf you've ever taken a break from running, perhaps due to an injury, burn out, or some other reason, you may have noticed that when you get back into it, your HR is higher than you normally have seen in past training. This is due to losing mitochondria in your muscles and the capillaries receding back out of deep muscle tissue.\n\nThe same is true for new runners or those who are not training consistently. The key to a low heart rate is an efficient aerobic system, which requires getting as much oxygenated blood into the working muscle as possible. The more mitochondria you have, the more efficient this process becomes. The deeper the capillaries, the more efficient also. Mitochondria and capillary density are increased through regular, consistent training.\n\nThis means pound the pavement (or dirt if you prefer) on a regular, consistent schedule, day-after-day, week-after-week, month-after-month. Only after a couple weeks will you notice your HR dropping, and only after several weeks to months will you notice your easy pace increasing without your HR increasing with it.\n\nBut the key is consistency. Break up that consistency, take breaks, or don't stick with it, and you won't see those aerobic gains.\n\n# Rating of perceived exertion is your best friend\nReally though, when all is said and done, *how you feel* trumps what your HRM is saying. Going back to heart rate variability day-to-day, your HRM might say your HR is a little high, but you feel great! Should you keep the effort or pull back to drop the HR? I'd say keep the effort, but really, if you're listening to your body, you'll know the right decision in that moment.\n\nThe following is a good guideline for running in \"zone 2\" without using an HRM:\n\n| Zone | Breathing | Speaking | Sweating |\n| :---: | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Nose | Can sing | None |\n| 2 | Nose/mouth | Full sentences | Light |\n| 3 | Mouth | Short phrases | Medium |\n| 4 | Audible | Single words | Hard |\n| 5 | Grunting | Speechless | Heavy |\n\nObviously, this won't be true for everyone. You might be able to run hard efforts breathing through your nose, or it might be difficult to breathe through your nose during a walk. The above isn't prescriptive. It's descriptive. It's meant as a way to pay attention to what is happening to you while you're running.\n\nOnce you start getting your RPE calibrated, you'll find yourself looking less and less at your watch and find yourself more and more paying attention to what is around you—nature, animals, other people, city, sights, etc. You'll get to the point where you completely stop looking at your watch in your run. When you get home, and someone asks \"Did you have fun on your run?\" you could honestly answer \"Yes!\".\n\n# Conclusion\nA high heart rate for what you think is an easy zone 2 pace could be due to a number of different factors:\n\n1. An innacurate HRM.\n1. Caffeine, poor sleep, work stress, illness, etc.\n1. Incorrectly set training zones.\n1. Inconsistent running or new to running.\n1. Ignoring how you actually feel in the run.\n\nDigging into some of these reasons might help you identify why your HR is so high and how you can handle it in your training.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions are find anything that needs correcting.",

    "all_comment_text": "Great post!  I've added it to the Heart Rate/Zone 2 Training section of the wiki.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/heart_rate_training\n\nI ditched my heart rate monitor after about a year and just run on feel and I find it just as rewarding and without frustration.\n\nAnecdotally I wear it every run and it’s both rewarding and without frustration\n\nSame, I'm wearing a Polar H10 and it syncs to my Garmin 955 and my Wahoo Roam V2 every single time without me having to do anything besides the initial pair.\n\nSame!\n\nAND I feel a slight tinge of anger when I talk about my heartrate but then people butt in with \"try running by feeeeeeling\". Like, \"no\" my chest strap and my thresholds are what I feel the best with.\n\nSame here.  I was in my best running shape back when I never even looked at my HR.   When I started trying to do zone 2 training I just got slower because I could never run slow enough to stay in Zone 2.\n\nI don’t really like having extra data to obsess over so I’m with you there. Every time I try going back to heart rate it just takes the joy out of running for me. I also run faster race times when I don’t train by heart rate and go by feel and pace.\n\nHeart rate is just a proxy for lactate anyway which is the true physiological metric you’re looking for, but of course is expensive for the average person to test and unnecessary. It actually boggles my mind that some people race by heart rate instead of by pace and feel. If I raced by heart rate then my times would all be slower because my heart rate is always high in races compared to the same pace in training.\n\nIs racing by heart rate something that people are ever coached to do? I am a self trained runner so I have never heard of that/never dealt with a running coach in general. \n\nWhat is your experience with race results when you have and have not trained with HR? Just curious especially with the prominent rise of the \"run slower to run faster\" aka Z2 training mantra.\n\nSome die hard HR people will race by heart rate for an “expected zone” that they are going to race in.\n\nMy race results for a half marathon were about 3 minutes slower when training by heart rate vs training by feel. I’ve also completely bombed a 5k before that I ran with heart rate training because I hadn’t done ENOUGH harder training.\n\nZone 2 training is great but it should be something you can feel. It should feel sustainable for a very long time. And one shouldn’t ignore speed work or threshold runs to only do slow running.\n\nGotcha thanks for the response! That all makes a lot of sense.\n\n5k specifically, the threshold/speed work made a HUGE difference when I added that in.\n\nYeah I mean I still follow the principles of easy runs easy and hard runs hard, but I don’t sweat it if my run happens to drift into “zone 3” heart rate because I’ve found that sometimes that actually prepares me for races.\n\nPlus I’m in running for enjoyment and not to be a pro so the little details don’t matter that much to me.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI can pretty much tell my zone 2 by my breathing.\n\nI love being low maintenance\n\nBroadly, I think this is a great post. \n\nSpecifically I thought newer watches were considered pretty decent for Hr now though. I’ve struggled with zone 2 and wondered if it was cadence lock but in reality I think I just wasn’t fit enough. As I’ve done more running my cadence has gone up and my HR has gone down…closer to zone 2 for some of my runs. What my watch track feels consistent run to run versus the effort I’m putting in\n\nI've tested my Garmin FR245 against a chest strap (I forget the brand) on a treadmill. The chest strap was linked to the treadmill and every time I compared the watch to the treadmill, they were within two beats. So, at least in my observation, optical is pretty accurate if your watch is sufficiently snug\n\nEven the Galaxy Watch 4 that I have seems to be within 5 beats of a chest strap. Over an entire run the average is actually bang on. \n\nObviously it ain't perfect but to call them \"notoriously bad as HRMs\" is a bit much. They're fine for this purpose.\n\nThey used to be inaccurate, but that hasn’t actually been the case for quite some time.\n\nAre they as accurate as a chest strap? No. But they’ve gotten so much better that, if worn properly, they are more than accurate enough to be useful for most runners.\n\nIt might depend on the person. My Apple watch gives me the same reading as a pulse oximeter at hospital, but I'm super pale. A Polar chest strap matched very closely to my watch the one time I compared them during a rowing workout. \n\nMy friend with a much older Apple watch also gets the same reading as in hospital (during a cardiac event, so not average conditions), but she's also very pale. People with darker skin, hairier wrists or looser bands probably get less accuracy. I've seen people complaining that their Apple watch loses their heart rate measuring altogether during rowing sometimes, presumably due to a looser band.\n\nYup, I think a chest strap is most helpful if you want to dig more closely into data. For example I cycle much more than run these days, and I use heart rate to guide in real time, and evaluate later, VO2 intervals. For that type of arrangement, the far quicker response of a chest strap is meaningful. But on my long steady rides, the optical sensor does just fine, and produces essentially the same number.\n\nThey are ok for steady efforts, next to useless for interval work\n\nMaybe some people have better luck than others. I was walking on a treadmill yesterday and my heart rate spiked up to 180. It wasn’t a cadence lock, and my bpm were really in the 80s. I get crap like that all the time.\n\nMaybe it depends on wrist anatomy, skin color, or other factors that differ from person to person.\n\nAlso tattoos.  I can’t use a wrist-based sensor bc the mostly black tattooed area on both wrists causes havoc with readings.  Chest straps are so much better overall - you also just get used to the feel over time and forget they’re there.\n\nI find the big difference is delay time if you’re doing any sort of intervals. That and occasionally the HR gets way off for no reason at all. But 95% of the time I agree, my watch is usually good enough, but I still wear a chest strap for peace of mind.\n\nI have a Garmin Viviactive 5 (which is one of their cheaper smartwatches), and have found it similarly accurate to my Polar chest strap when doing hard rides on the Peloton, track workouts outside, and easy runs outside (I’d say +- 5bpm, which is much closer than I expected them to be)\n\nI found that my watch and chest strap were just about the same except for a few rare times around 140BPM (similar HR and cadence) and the watch was clearly in cadence lock where the watch HR stayed the same but I was running up a hill and my actual HR was definitely climbing. I started to just use the watch and accept that sometimes it'll be off.\n\nI ran the same workout with a garmin 245 on one wrist, and a watch using a Polar Verity Sense on the other. The Garmin 245 was about 10bpm higher for me than the Polar HRM, and the Polar HRM had much smoother data. The wrist data would show spikes all over.\n\nI find that the optical sensor is very accurate when you are out running at a fairly consistent pace, but as soon as you do intervals or shorter bursts of high activity it quickly starts to lag or just fall apart. I've done hill repeats with just the watch when I've forgotten my strap and my chest strap and you can tell from just looking at the graph which is the watch and which is the strap from running up the same hill. Plus the occasional cadence lock issues, and no LTHR/automatic zone adjustments and more data makes the strap a better choice in my opinion overall, but is it necessary? Absolutely not, it's just another upgrade.\n\nCommenting to agree based on my experience with the Garmin Fenix 6 and the HRM Pro strap. The HR strap shines when you are doing training that requires detection of rapid HR changes, e.g. sprints, intervals, hills. Steady state/consistent pace running/hiking/whatever, the optical sensor is plenty fine.\n\nI think you're right that optical HR sensors are a lot better than they used to be and chest straps aren't necessarily better. I think, though, that optical HR sensors are not very reliable yet reading through darker skin including tattoos. I have super dark wrist tattoos on both wrists and my optical HR sensor struggles.\n\nMy Garmin 265 is incredibly accurate, I've never seen any wild numbers that some old or cheap watches have. I borrowed a chest strap just to be sure, and they were the same numbers.\n\ni notice a distinct decline in my watch’s hr measurement in the cold; i assume as a byproduct of vasoconstriction. but in warmer weather like the northern hemisphere has now, my watch hasn’t had any problems.\n\nMy 945 lte versus my hrm is pretty close. Generally it misses peaks from hard short efforts and overall is a bit \"smoother\". It's maybe moving the average over the course of a run by a couple bpm if that.\n\nYep. I’ve tested my Coros and Apple Watch 9 against Wahoo Kickr and Polar chest straps, and they’re within a couple of beats. The watches do register elevations slightly later than the chest strap, which makes sense given that the watch is measuring further away from the heart, but the lag was a matter of seconds.\n\nOne caveat to chests straps, they don’t work well when cold and dry, electrode gel works well, or just some kinda moisture.\n\nJust lick it. 😜\n\nGive it the ol hawk tuah\n\nSpit on that thang!\n\nI worked at a place where we used heart rate monitors to help monitor heat exhaustion. The advice was literally to spit on it\n\noh spitting on that thang is tight!\n\nThe other thing is heat - expect RPE to be higher in the summer and of course if you’re out long enough you’ll be sweating no matter what HR zone you’re in\n\nAre wrist watches THAT inacurate tho? When i was training for army, one of exercises was how much Watts you did on bycicle on 170 BPM max for 2 minutes and my conclusion was basicaly the same with Apple watch and their chest monitor. Idk how in running tho\n\nI think it varies from person to person.  I have a Garmin chest strap and my heart rate measures basically the same with the strap as on my watch (was a 245, now a 265).  The key for me is to snug my watch down a couple of extra notches when running.  I guess if people are worried about a couple of beats worth of error, going with a chest strap is probably the best device.  I am not worried about that kind of accuracy, and it is easy to see if your watch is cadence locked as opposed to reading heart rate, so I don't use my chest strap much these days.\n\nDepends. Mines very accurate but I have a higher end model and I'm thin and pale with no tattoos. Darker skin tones or tattoos can affect the accuracy of the readings\n\nI also think some people don’t have good foundational understanding of what is easy running. The amount of people that do “easy runs” near their marathon pace is astounding. Unfortunately the slower you are the harder it becomes to understand that your “easy pace” should be a very very slow number\n\nI had a hard time figuring out my zones, got stuck trying to keep my heart rate below 150. Then I looked at HR data from multiple long races and realized that my Lactate threshold heart rate must be at least 186, and my max HR was at least 204. \n\nJust a PSA that having a much higher heart rate than the default values can be normal.\n\nAgree, HR zone training isn't valuable until you know your resting and max HR. You can get in the ballpark of where you zone 2 might be by using your MAF number, but at some point new runners need to do a max HR trial and/or a 5k time trial to get LTHR.\n\nI have no clue…\n\nMy resting heart rate is 55-56. Max I’ve seen on my heart rate monitor is 174. (Apple Watch 9) Which tracks for someone who is 44. \n\nI do an easy 4 mile run, my heart run gets between 149-154. Which would be zone 4/5. The thing is, I am literally having a conversation with my running partner during these runs. Complete sentences and everything.\n\nUsing the karvonen method, 149-154 is top of zone 3 and bottom of zone 4. Your zone 2 is 126-138\n\nHowever, that is assuming 174 is your true max HR, which it might not be. Have you done a max HR trial? Mine is 10 bpm higher than the 220-age formula.\n\nI've had full conversations with people, full sentences, while I'm in a zone 3 tempo run, too. This is what I think the weakness of the RPE system is -- it takes experience to calibrate it properly, and new runners underestimate what RPE they're in during easy runs. The talk test isn't perfect, the nose breathing test isn't perfect, and everything is on a continuum. It's not like your HR ticks from 138 to 139 and suddenly you can't talk in full sentences anymore.\n\n[deleted]\n\nCheck it against your cadence. The sample times can be slightly off, so don't expect to see it match perfectly, but if HR is tracking to cadence within a few BPM it's likely just cadence lock. \nAnother sign of cadence lock is if you have periods where HR suddenly drops, holds for a while, then returns to cadence. \nSource: worked for a medical device company providing research equipment such as chest-worn ECG for HR and core temperature tracking.\n\nIs there a way to see your heart rate on both the watch and the heart strap at the sane time?\n\n&gt;check it against a treadmill \n\nThis is what I did, and confirmed that my Apple Watch was within 1 beat per minute, both at the low end (110 bpm) and at a more moderate pace (155 bpm). It’s still saying my heart rate is high compared to what RPE tells me, though, so for the time being I’m going to listen to the latter.\n\nETA: I’m thin and fairly pale (and the opposite of those statistically often mean less accurate readings), but I’m also pretty hairy, which is sometimes given as a reason for inaccurate readings but wasn’t a problem for me.\n\nOr just stop, count your pulse for 15 seconds, and multiply by 4. HR won't drop in that time. That's too annoying to do every run but fine as an occasional equipment check.\n\nYou will want to buy the chest strap eventually anyway if you keep on running (During winter runs i can have my watch on top of my jacket and still read my HR). Or if you pick up cycling.\n\n100% agree on your points, doesn’t help bloody IG runfluencers are shoving Z2 down everybody’s throats and got all these new runners treating it like gospel, like ffs just go run and make it easy, and run more that’s how you will improve\n\nDisagree, the average runner (myself included) runs their hard runs too easy and their easy runs too hard. Monitoring my heart rate on my garmin helped me calibrate\n\nGreat PSA! Thank you! I noticed my HR was wildly inaccurate and jumped around a lot - this stopped once I got a chest strap! Certainly a good investment in my opinion\n\nDoing the lord’s work with this post. Especially appreciate the emphasis for RPE. 🙌\n\nI was talking to my partner about RPE and I wasn’t doing a very good job at explaining it and he was like- so you’re just running on vibes? Lol\n\nYes. It has worked for many many years before these devices were widely available\n\nI feel like RPE vs MAF vs Zones vs whatever... it's like a religious debate.\n\nOne belief system makes me run more another belief system makes someone else run more. Why should I try to convert others to **my** running religion if theirs is already motivating them to run?\n\nMy biggest issue with zone training is that it is often targeted to new runners who have no business using heart rate as a metric yet. Every day there are questions in here about new runners who are trying to \"run in zone 2\" and having xyz issue with it, mostly that they have to walk to stay in zone 2. Like, yeah you're having issues with it, your heart is still making huge adaptations because you just started running so your heart rate is gonna be high. You haven't done a max HR test and if you did one it won't be useful anyway so just run by feel for now. Once someone has been training for a while, then they can test for mx HR, set zones, etc etc. but for new runners, it is almost to the point of disinformation. Even the treadmills at the gym have a \"zone chart\" with the max HR formula as 220-age, wtf. No wonder so many folks are confused.\n\nZone 2 running is basically easy running with a lot more metrics to keep track of and your heart rate is only ever one piece of the puzzle anyway, no matter how long you've been running.\n\n&gt;Every day there are questions in here about new runners who are trying to \"run in zone 2\" and having xyz issue with it\n\nSo shouldn't we answer their question instead of telling them to spend years to learn RPE instead?\n\n&gt; you're having issues with it, your heart is still making huge adaptations because you just started running\n\nThis is true about RPE.\n\nHow did we gage our feeling if we've never actually felt running truly fast? Or in my case I was able to hold a conversation at a pace that turned out to actually be in my zone 3.  I didn't know how slow my slow runs actually should have been. I did that mistake for YEARS. Which would have been avoided if I had started with heartrate instead. \n\n Now that I started zones instead I run slower most of the time AND I'm running longer and my intervals are faster than I did in years. I'm 41. I wish I had started running with zones and I'm glad these new runners are entering the sport with such good advances in sports science at their disposal.\n\nIt's not really appropriate to ask a new runner to run for an hour to do a field test or spend a lot of money on lab tests to determine their max HR. Without a max HR, there are no zones to go by. And if most new runners are doing something like 220-age to set their zones and find they have to walk to stay in that zone 2 most of the time, it's not really an effective method of training. You don't get better at running by walking. Again, my issue is primarily with this type of training for new runners. It is more effective to offer following conversational pace/similar and learning some sort of running by feel until they can build enough cardio base to do the tests, etc. if they want to do zone training.\n\n&gt; It's not really appropriate to ask a new runner to run for an hour to do a field test or spend a lot of money on lab tests to determine their max HR. Without a max HR, there are no zones to go by.\n\nA threshold test takes about 20 minutes of running, plus a warm up.\n\nI wouldn't suggest that to someone at a coach to 5k level obviously, but after you can run for 40 minutes or so, why not?  \n\nEven if you never use the data to manage your runs, all the other metrics your watch or app is working on is dependent on having roughly correct zones set up.\n\nI found RPE intuitive and easy when I first started, in high school (before fitness watches were “a thing”) — it definitely didn’t take years to learn, maybe weeks — but I suspect that’s because I was young and relatively fit/in tune with my body already. Honestly, I think people starting to run for the first time after years of not doing so really would benefit a lot from in-person coaching, more than high-level recreational athletes benefit from it, but the latter is who actually gets coached.\n\nI was fortunate to have a cross country coach who could say “OK, technically you’re talking in full sentences, but looking at you, I can see that you’re still going too fast” as well as “speed up, you’re not running this 400 repeat fast enough.” (He also argued with the football coach when he overheard that old-school drill sergeant type tell players they “don’t need water, just want it.” Truly a blessing.( That isn’t a privilege most beginners in this sub have, but I think my advice would be to run with someone experienced if at all possible — running club, friend, etc. — and get their help assessing your exertion level.\n\nThese new runners aren't coming into the sport with coaches. They're coming in with fitness watches.\n\nThe questions they would have asked their coach are instead being posed to us. Right here! We're not answering them. Instead we're re-routing these new runners to ignore the very thing that got them running in the first place. We're doing a disservice to new runners by telling them to ignore the marvelous advance in sports science on their wrists and instead to suffer with the same inaccurate and subjective system from the 1960s that we grew up with.\n\nAlso, \"intuitive? Let's be honest. There are multiple ways to rate RPE... heck, even multiple scales.  Is an RPE of 6 walking and an RPE of 20 is you just raced as fast as Ingenrigtsen? Or is it 1 is walking and then is 8 your race pace for this distance and 9 is for another distance... but then another manual will tell you that it's actually 7 for that distance and 8 for the other. Which manual do you believe? How do you know what those race paces are until you've run those races?\n\nThere's nothing INHERENTLY intuitive about RPE. It's intuitive for YOU because you're used to it and you should keep doing it. But for new people coming into running, I don't think we're helping them by preaching this religion of RPE.\n\nThere are multiple ways to the same end.\n\nI used my MAF number to start, until I was running long enough to safely do a max HR trial. % of max HR zones didn't agree with my MAF or RPE, but %HRR did. So it took some triangulation to figure out what the best representation of my zone 2 was. Admittedly this is really confusing for the average beginner who wouldn't put in as much time into researching as I did.\n\nI think there's value in HR training but there are drawbacks to it, namely if you're overweight and never ran before, a max HR trial or a 5k best effort to get an accurate calculation might be medically risky.\n\nI think there's value in RPE but it also has drawbacks, because lots of people think \"well I can still talk in full sentences\" but they're really at RPE 5 (out of 10) and zone 3 (out of 5). HR gives those runners a dose of reality earlier on before they hit speed sessions to really feel out the 1-10 RPE scale and tune into their body.\n\n&gt;lots of people think \"well I can still talk in full sentences\" but they're really at RPE 5 (out of 10) and zone 3 (out of 5). HR gives those runners a dose of reality \n\nThis was me.\n\nIt was worse than what you said. I could hold a conversation well into zone 3. Then when I did speed work I did like a 7 minute mile. Turns out I can go faster than that but I was fatigued because my slow runs were too fast.\n\nI really think this idea that RPE is somehow better for new runners is total trash. And the guidance about holding a conversation is misleading people who could be helped by a simple HR monitor.\n\nHow are you calculating your zones?\n\nI had a VO2Max test that measured my zones by both HR and pace.\n\nIt also told me my VO2Max score... which is a great data point about my health and longevity. But the gold value of that test is getting my ventilatory thresholds and my zones.\n\n&gt; Why should I try to convert others to my running religion if theirs is already motivating them to run?\n\nI try to convert people out of MAF because it's just straight up terrible.\n\nRPE vs HR is more chocolate vs vanilla and basically the same thing measured differently and there are plenty of times to use one or the other or both.\n\nLoL. MAF is like licorice flavor.\n\nMy problem with MAF is that at its core it's just \"Run easy with heart rate as your guide\", which is *fine*. But then, in the year 2024, it still advocates for using a stupid age based formula for your heart rate when a field test costs zero dollars and takes a half hour.\n\nIt's just a straight up worse, branded, version of \"run easy a bunch\". I will die on this hill.\n\nI’ve been downvoted so many times telling people that their watch likely isn’t that accurate and they should check a manual pulse reading to compare. I’ve even had someone accuse me of being a terrible nurse who disregards her patients due to my suggestion. :(\n\nThe tech has gotten a lot sharper and more accurate in recent years but it never hurts to double check it!! And manual hr is a useful skill. For me, tho, I have dark tattoos all the way around both wrists so I’ve pretty much never gotten an accurate optical HR reading lol. Definitely some gaps in capability\n\nThat’s exactly what I was saying too, like why not check a manual? If it matches, cool.\n\nThis is a very excellent post!\n\nI actually run with two watches - a Huawei GT Runner, and a Suunto Spartan Sport. In testing, the Huawei watches tend to be right up at the top of the lists of accurate HRM watches.\n\nThe watches are almost always in sync (within 0-2 bpm) when I'm running. The exception is when I start running - they don't always stay in sync as my heart rate rises in the first couple of minutes. The other exception is that the Suunto, in cold weather, drastically overreads for the first 3-7 minutes, typically registering 160 to 200bpm when the Huawei is going from 100 to 120. The Suunto will then settle down and match the Huawei.\n\nGo by Rate of Perceived Effort and run at a conversational pace.\n\nHeart rate training is really for intermediate runners.\n\nMentioned in the post. Thanks!\n\nI don't see what level has to do with it. A method is either better or worse, no matter the level.\n\nNew runners are making too many cardio adaptations as they start running for heart rate to be an effective metric. Their heart rate is going to be high regardless because they're new. To stay in \"zone 2,\" they'd probably be walking most of the time. They should get started using something like RPE until they have a solid base from which a max HR can be tested, zones set, etc. But zone training is really not a useful training method for newbies.\n\nYour comment doesn't make sense. Their heart rate will be high regardless, so their RPE will be high regardless. In the end of the day it doesn't matter what you use cause it all boils down to the same. \n\nI think it's fine to say \"don't use a wrist HR, use RPE instead\" but this counts for all levels of runners.\n\nRespectfully, my comment does make sense and there are a lot of other replies in this thread saying the same thing. RPE and heart rate are not perfectly correlated and it's not fair or appropriate to ask new runners coming in with little to no fitness to run for an hour or pay a lot of money for lab tests to find their max HR. Without a true max HR, there are no zones to go by. If they're using an arbitrary zone calculator like 220-age then they're getting wrong information and also likely having to walk a lot to \"stay in zone 2\" even though they usually feel like they could keep running. You get better at running by running, not walking. New runners need to develop some sense of how they feel while running and understand what a conversational pace is and then once they build up their cardio base they can do the tests etc to find their zones if they want. People coming in with some cardio base from other sports might be different but a lot of couch to 5k'ers coming in from the bottom of the fitness spectrum are doing themselves a disservice by trying to use heart rate zones right out of the gate.\n\nWhen I first started I was regularly in zone 4 even at 6:15/km. Now that I'm intermediate I am regularly in 145-150 for a 6:00/km.\n\nI tried a chest heart rate monitor and it kept sliding down and was a pain to put on. Switching to a forearm heart rate monitor was an amazing decision and I 10/10 recommend it to anyone: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078GRMFSN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\n\nEasy to put on, incredibly accurate, doesn't move around, pairs to my watch seamlessly.\n\nDo you have any experience using the forearm heart rate monitor while swimming?\n\nRegarding chest straps, do they have to lay completely flat? \n\nI have pectus excavatum, so there is a cavernous hole right where that chest strap needs to lay, and I have flared ribs as a result. Bra straps, for example, aren't able to lay flat over the space.\n\nNo. It just needs good contact with the skin. The better the contact, the more accurate of course.\n\nThanks for your insights!\n\nThe only parts of the chest strap that matters are the electrodes, which generally make contact right below your pectorals or on the side of your chest on the ribs. Often they're a rubberized plastic polymer. Honestly it probably means you might get less chafing which is a common problem for most people. https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2012/08/how-to-fix-heart-rate-strap-chaffing.html\n\nSee here for h10 \n\nhttps://support.polar.com/e_manuals/h10-heart-rate-sensor/polar-h10-user-manual-english/heart-rate-sensor-parts.htm\n\nhttps://support.polar.com/e_manuals/h10-heart-rate-sensor/polar-h10-user-manual-english/wear-the-heart-rate-sensor.htm\n\nor garmin:\nhttps://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/GUID-8918512F-8099-433F-86CC-3E8249295E07/EN-US/GUID-5F6823C6-06BB-425B-806D-E3DC5B38E212.html\n\nI'm lucky, my heartrate readings from my watch are usually pretty accurate.\n\n* New watches are pretty accurate at monitoring HR from the wrist. Straps are nice for HRV though, which can't be done at the wrist accurately. \n\n* No field test should last an hour. That introduces too much error including cardiac drift. Most field tests for running are brief and can be concluded in 20 mins depending on the test. \n\n* There's nothing wrong with newer runners using HR zones to train. \n\n* The talk test is the easiest way to gauge effort.\n\nI am a data guy and my first coach swore by HR measurement. It was a bad combo and led me to a very bad place with running. My current coach _finally_ (it took him almost a year working with me for me to get it through my thick skull) got me to stop obsessing over HR (and, frankly, even over workout pace). As OP said, I’ve never looked at my watch less (I do still sometimes check, but then there are runs where I don’t even have HR or pace showing) or enjoyed running more.\n\nThanks for the post. As a newbie runner im so obsessed with my HR before. getting worried that I might be over-training myself to the point that I stop and just walk to keep my HR at z2 even though im doing and feeling great.\n\n  \nTwo weeks ago I started not looking on my watch during runs and not care about the data. Runs are now more enjoyable now.\n\nDoes anyone have a rec for a chest strap that's good enough but still in impulse-buy-ish territory?\n\nI've been using the $30 Coospo H6 from Amazon for almost 8 years and have never had a problem, battery lasts forever and is replaceable unlike a lot of the more expensive ones\n\nI have had the coospo as well. Accurate, but mine crapped out after about 1.5 years\n\nI have a wahoo it's good!\n\nDecathlon HR chest strap is extremely cheap and works perfectly fine, I have mine since almost a year without any issue, 30€-ish\n\nIf you can afford to shell out alittle more the recommendation is the Polar H10. It is the most accurate HR chest strap on the market and the only one that is accurate enough to be used in medical and clinical settings. [It also has been backed by research papers confirming its validity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9459793/) And another study [here](https://actavia.e-coretvasa.cz/en/artkey/cor-202204-0006_feasibility-of-evaluation-of-polar-h10-chest-belt-ecg-in-patients-with-a-broad-range-of-heart-conditions.php).\n\nThe Polar H9 is $65. It's as accurate as they come without breaking the bank IMO.\n\nAlso the garmin one is $50-70 \nI’ve seen it those for those prices \nI bought mine for $60 at REI\n\nAlso I will add to this asthma! I firmly believe my asthma heightens my heart rate even though I’m able to breathe perfectly fine, and talk in full sentences my Garmin will say I’m a zone 4\n\nI was wondering this myself, as an asthmatic person. Reading through the comments to see if anybody would mention this.\n\nI am saving for heart rate monitor now , because I feel like it can improve my running .\nYes ,taken time off running though I was injured ( really not) . \nSleep is poor at the minute. \nDiet is not as good as it has been , currently cooking for one ( don’t cook every night ) . \nDo have a coach ( haven’t talked in two weeks ) . \nSo take your point , it a guide .\nYou can monitor it for a few months just to see what up .\n\nDo you have any scientific sources for the fact that RPE is superior to HR or is this just an opinion based on your anecdotal experience?\n\n[This 2018 paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29288436) from a group of UK scientists published a meta-analysis of team-sport studies including 295 athletes and over 10,000 training sessions. They found that using a session-RPE training load score was superior to tracking performance when compared to traditional heart-rate scoring metrics, like TRIMP.\n\nSession-RPE training was also found to be [strongly-correlated with actual race finish times](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24104194) following 15 weeks of training.\n\n[Another systematic review of 56 original studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26423706) found that subjective self-reported measures reflected current fatigue and accumulated fitness with superior sensitivity and consistency when compared to objective measures, which included heart rate, lactate, VO2 max, performance tests, and other blood test markers.\n\nI've found heart rate training to be useful for me. It is based on %LTHR which is 181bpm. My zone 2 ends at 161bpm which is quite accurate for me, as my breathing changes once I pass this point. \n\nI've tried running by RPE but I usually end up running too fast.\n\nThat was my experience, too. \n\nI'm glad RPE works for other people. They should stick with it. For me, I started running more when I discovered zones. By keeping my HR low for most runs and doing some percentage of runs faster I made progress.  I cannot understand why RPE proponents want to take that away from me.\n\nHow does a heart rate monitor work for ppl with boobies?\n\nSame as everyone else, considering it's meant to be worn just below the chest.\n\nGarmin also make one designed to attach to the bottom of sports bras: [https://www.garmin.com/en-AU/blog/garmin-unveils-the-hrm-fit-heart-rate-monitor-for-women/](https://www.garmin.com/en-AU/blog/garmin-unveils-the-hrm-fit-heart-rate-monitor-for-women/)\n\n  \nBut as OP mentioned, there are armband options.\n\nOk cool! I’m doing fine with my Apple Watch for now. But I know running watches and chest straps are better…\n\nI have a strap and I still use my watch HR for 90% of my runs and it's fine. I usually only use the strap when I'm doing things such as intervals or tempo as I find it responds much quicker to changes in heart rate.\n\nThey vary from person to person, but my Apple Watch gives me the same HR data as my chest strap does in like 90% of the situations I run in. I sometime wear my strap in the cold (near or below freezing), but most of the time I can't be assed to dig it out of the closet honestly.\n\nI will say the watch HR data is pretty trash for cycling, which is a common issue, so I use a strap on rides if I want HR data.\n\nExactly the same ? You wear HRM below your sternum so there is no difference between male and female wearing it.\n\nNot exactly true. Larger boobs are a thing, and they take up decent chest real estate. The scaffolding required to support them mean wide bands that take up additional space on the torso. Also, the shape of the torso is different, putting a strap somewhere on the chest doesn’t mean it’ll stay there.\n\nIt should be tight enough that it will not move. At least it has never moved for me and i have been using 3 different straps in the last 6 years. Obviously no idea how other people have it.\n\nAnd yeah, you are right that having larger boobs will be a bit more problematic with HRM. I can't really help there as i have no experience in that area.\n\nIn my case, I’m tiny. The smallest sized polar didn’t go tight enough, it slipped down to my waist. I could wedge it under the bra band, but that caused pain and chafing. Glad to see there’s more options available these days!\n\nThat is true, you will be able to find one that will stay in place i am sure.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078GRMFSN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\n\nThis forearm HRM works fantastic for me, highly recommend.\n\nMy wife happily used her Garmin HRM Pro+ for a year or so - it sits just under the bottom band of your bra.\n\nShe's now using the version targetted at women that specifically clips to the bra's band rather than looping around the chest.  She finds it more comfortable.\n\nAmazing post! Thank you for putting the effort in!\n\nIve struggling with this lately. This helps me so much. Thank you!\n\nGreat post, thanks!\n\nI like this! Great stuff!!!\n\nThat's really interesting. I have seen some improvement at last after 3 months of not feeling any improvement persisting with sticking in zone 2. I looked back and while my pace hasn't changed over my 7k route near home my average hr is now 3bpm lower doing that pace.\n\nUnfortunately on Polar Flow I can't easily split up the average as it doesn't seem like you can download the data.  I guess best idea is to do two sessions starting the second half way along.\n\nBut why are you sticking to zone 2? That's the real question new runners should be asking. It's advantage is it allows you to stack mileage while executing hard workouts. If that's not your goal zone 2 focus is counter productive for most people.\n\nJust adding to the conversation. My chest strap seems to sync with my stride rate. I'm told it's tech fabrics causing static. Seems plausible.  But wetting it, using electro gel. Adjusting position.  Nothing has worked. \n\n Wearing a tight under shirt is one thing I haven't tried, but  I've since switched to the Verity Sense and had no issues. Only thing it doesn't has that the chest strap did is instantaneous hr changes.\n\nI also have the Polar Verity Sense. Just wore it on my run this morning actually. I love that HRM.\n\nOne thing that I think may revolutionize zone 2 training is utilizing DFA-alpha1 to figure out your Aerobic Threshold (LT1) based on analyzing HRV RR intervals. It's built into Runalyze for post run analysis, but it's not super intuitive how to use it https://blog.runalyze.com/features/aerobic-threshold-estimation-based-on-hrv/. \n\nIf you want to know more I would recommend checking out this guys info (Bruce Rodgers):\n\nhttp://www.muscleoxygentraining.com/2021/01/dfa-a1-and-exercise-intensity-faq.html. \n\nThere's a few apps that can be integrated into your watch or phone for realtime metrics to see if you're getting to the magical 0.75 reading (but at the expense of battery life). Obviously this only works with chest HRM that track HRV as minor variance in HRV will screw up the readings.\n\nSo I hadn't heard about this before and started reading. It's promising research, but it turns out that the DFA alpha-1 value of 0.75 cannot be universally applied to everyone for finding their aerobic threshold.\n\nhttps://www.marcoaltini.com/blog/updated-view-on-hrv-analysis-during-exercise-and-dfa-alpha-1\n\nYeah seems the 0.75 is just an arbitrary they've been ballparking as it's the midpoint between 1.0 and 0.5. I do think those are some valid criticisms though. A lot of data needs to be tossed out if you are outside and only the Polar H10 has a close enough accuracy to get meaningful results. But I do think there's a useful metric to be gained by analyzing the distribution of HRV timings, just may not be a silver bullet to replace lab tests but can be used to track fatigue accumulation in post run analysis. On the other hand if it's a close enough estimate without needing to do intensive testing, it can still be useful to track. Especially if you want to track fitness improvements but don't want to do a lactate threshold test every time. \n\nMore recent article from Rogers. \nhttp://www.muscleoxygentraining.com/2024/02/\n\n    DFA a1 is a dimensionless number representative of the fractal complexity, correlation of the cardiac beat series and is primarily determined by autonomic nervous system balance. After reviewing past studies concerning DFA a1 decline with increasing work rates, it was observed that index values were well above 1.0 at very low intensities, moved through a “partially” correlated zone at moderate intensities, passed the “uncorrelated” value of 0.5 near the heavy/severe intensity boundary, and finally reaching values below 0.5, signifying an “anticorrelated” pattern at severe intensities (15).  It was originally theorized that at the GET/LT1, the cardiac beat pattern would be found in an intermediate zone between well correlated (DFA a1 &gt; 1) and uncorrelated (DFA a1 = 0.5) behavior, which was set to 0.75 (17). Since the HRVT1 was based on a hypothetical midpoint, it can be argued that some individuals may have higher baselines and hence altered midpoints from the fixed 0.75. \n\nSummary at bottom of page.\n\n    This reports adds to the existing evidence that the HRVT2 is a valid proxy for the RCP/LT2 at least on a group basis.  Additionally, adding EDRT and/or NIRS O2 desaturation breakpoints should get you even closer to individual gold standards.\n    There needs to be further thought on the HRVT1 concept since this report along with what we cited above (and recently this) indicate over estimation compared to the GET/LT1/VT1.  We are currently working on that topic.....😁\n    Day to day repeatability of HRVT1/2 is quite good as noted in the current study and the new report in Frontiers. Therefore, even is the HRV threshold is biased, at least it will be repeatable, making it useful for following fitness, illness, stress and fatigue. This repeatability is also independent of ramp slope (15 to 45 w/min).\n\nHR is weird. I can have a full on convo at about 175BPM. Guess I’m a squirrel.\n\nCrazy this pops up as I’m looking at my heart rate on garmin connect app.\n\nVery interesting write up, thanks!\n\nI actually have the reverse: my HR tends to be very _low_ for most runs, and exceedingly low for races. I did a half marathon two weeks ago with a reported average HR of 133, peaking at 153, all in my zone 2. This is indicative of a regular race, whether it’s a sub-40 10k or a sub-1:30 half marathon.\n\nCardiovascular wise during these runs I feel pretty relaxed, while targeting a pace that I feel is sustainable for me. I probably wouldn’t want to have a conversation but I can squeeze out a few words when meeting people on the road.\n\nI’m using a sports watch (Garmin Fenix 5), no chest band, and your post made me consider measuring with a chest band. \n\nFTR I’m a 50 year old male and I run on average about 6 times per week, on average 40 km per week, and commonly interval training.\n\nEdit: i should probably mention that I do see a strong correlation between my HR and how I feel I’m performing. If I’m having a bad day, due to lack of sleep, too much alcohol the night before, etc, I will invariably see that my HR is jumping to 160/170 whereas on a good day it would be around 130.\n\nHow do you know what your HR zones are? How did you determine them?\n\nInteresting. Perhaps exceptionally fit?\n\nI had one HRM always reading low when i exercised. Would run 5 mins hard, walk one minute and manually take my pulse during the walk. It would be 150 slowing to 140, watch said 115.\n\nChanged watches recently, same thing, generally reads a lot more accurate, but often hangs up on the high end and doesn't come down for a few minutes.\n\nTo OPs point, heat and weather could be further emphasized as a significant factor. I can see a 20 bpm swing when the Temps are up near 30C than 16C whe. Just doing routine outside chores (I farm).\n\n&gt; I did a half marathon two weeks ago with a reported average HR of 133, peaking at 153, all in my zone 2. This is indicative of a regular race, whether it’s a sub-40 10k or a sub-1:30 half marathon.\n\nI don't see how this could mean anything other than A) data is wrong, B) zones are wrong or C) you're not running at race effort.  More or less by definition, HM and 10k race efforts are not zone 2, assuming you're talking about the common 5 zone system.\n\nI found that my watch (if I wear it tight) can be quite accurate for my heart rate.\n\nHowever, as an experienced runner and coach, a big thing I notice is people letting their heart rate rule them instead of using it as a tool. \n\nHeart rate during a run can let you know how recovered you are but don’t be over reliant on it. Just run to feel!\n\nExcellent post. Couple of things would love to get your take on. \n\nWhen are you rating your RPE?\n\nI found out during the training I may rank on 8 (1-10 scale) but a couple of hours later I think nah that was 6.\n\nAlso I suffer from low dopamine and lot motivation, ADD and when I drink caffeine everything feels much mxuh easier cause it's all mental. So I may rank the same run at 4 when caffeineted and as 6-7 when not.\n\nI hate the summer with a  passion.\n\nits 104 Fahrenheit (40 degrees celcius) and 80% humidity where I live.. I sweat like a pig even just walking outside. \n\nI did a 5km (3 mi) walk at 135 BPM and felt absolutely miserable so RPE I find would be a very bad metric cause it wouldn't measure my cardiovascular capacity or mitochondrial efficiency but rather my brain, mental functioning which is already trash with my ADD.\n\nI find that therefore RPE may be more valid for the average person perhaps when gauged bases on real physical fatigue and not mental fatigue due to norepinephrine/dopamine dysfunction.\n\n&gt; When are you rating your RPE?\n\nThis post is specifically addressing slow, easy, \"zone 2\" running. So the rating is done in the run. On a 1-10 scale, it should be a 3-4, and you should agree it was a 3-4 an hour later also.\n\n&gt; I suffer from low dopamine and lot motivation, ADD and when I drink caffeine everything feels much mxuh easier\n\nYeah, that's fair. I drink 4 cups of coffee every day. I get it. But if you're struggling to get your HR under control during the run, this might be a variable worth looking into.\n\n&gt; I hate the summer with a passion.\n\nSummer miles bring fall smiles.\n\n&gt; I sweat like a pig even just walking outside.\n\nReminder, the RPE table is just a guideline. It's a rough sketch to get you think about effort. In high heat and high humidity, the sweat rate isn't going to be a great guide for running by RPE. So look at other variables? Can you carry a conversation? Are you breathing comfortably?\n\nThanks\n\n\n&gt;Reminder, the RPE table is just a guideline. It's a rough sketch to get you think about effort. In high heat and high humidity, the sweat rate isn't going to be a great guide for running by RPE. So look at other variables? Can you carry a conversation? Are you breathing comfortably?\n\nI think I thought about RPE more of perceived effort that perceived exertion, maybe that's why I was thinking that. Because yeah I can definitely carry a conversation.\n\nIt's just thay the effort to run for 1 hour in the heat and humidity in the summer makes a 5km (3 mi) brisk walking takes 3 times the effort I can run 10 miles. I can run half a marathon in the winter feels easier mentally than a walk lol\n\nAnyone who cares about some kind of heart rate zones should be well past the point where any of this is new information to them.\n\nIt's like giving advice on which running spikes 'Couch to 5k' runners should buy.\n\nJust look at the daily thread and you'll see this is very much not the case. Most have never even done a field test.\n\nI think HR zones can be helpful for newish runners. Lots people don't have any sense of calibration for RPE. Maybe it's no good for people coming from absolutely zero fitness, but for lots of people coming in from other athletic endeavors, it can really help to know what easy is, and keep from overdoing it.\n\nI have a h10 strap but don't really know how to make the most out of it. When I first got it, I tried to slow down and get in that z2 or z3 area, which made running very easy and also helped me run longer distances. But this also meant my speed dropped away significantly. Now I mostly ignore it and wear it to track my fitness / effort.\n\nZone 2 is slow. The goal is to build your aerobic base, but also get your legs recovered between speed work sessions. Which if you want to get faster, you need to be executing.\n\n\\*cries in florida\\*\n\n30 minutes of running had me looking like I left a swimming pool with my clothes on. (95% humidity)\n\nI can vouch that watch HRM are very inaccurate. I measured 2 brands against just taking my pulse myself or one a pulse oximeter. \n\n\nWhen I warm up on my spin bike I noticed that my Fitbit will report a resting heart rate when I am over my max. My belief is their algorithm ignores my heart rate going up just in case it's a false reading and it also can't get a good read. After ten minutes it finally goes up on the watch. \n\n\nI ran the same tests on a Samsung and it sort of does the same thing and jumps all over.\n\n\nFor running it goes up a lot sooner because it can feel me running. But I really think it's half kind of guessing the numbers are off when I take my pulse myself. It's also often off by ten bpm. Chest straps are the way to go. \n\nI think the last point is the most relevant. You really don't need any sort of heart rate monitoring at all to figure out how hard your run is. You're the one running, you ought to be able to tell.\n\nExcellent write up. Bold of you to assume I’m able to keep any sort of consistent pace on an hour long run to test my zone 2 though 😂. \n\nI have noticed though now 8 weeks into more formal training post c25k that I’m finally starting to be able to jog (at a very slow pace) and stay in Z2. Previously I had to walk jog intervals if I wanted to stand any chance. So the consistency and slow running is slowly paying off!\n\nI went for a VO2 Max test recently and it was the most beneficial thing I’ve done for my training. Broke down my max heart rate and the range for each of my zones, aerobic vs anaerobic thresholds, etc.\n\nBiggest takeaway: formula based approach to heart rate zones just can’t fit everyone. The guy who went through my results told me of a 17 year old male he had in doing the same test, who had been going to high intensity work out classes which pushed everyone to their max heart rate zones (formula-based). By all accounts, the 17M ‘should’ have had a max heart rate around 200, but he’d passed out multiple times during these classes. After doing the test discovered he’d a max heart rate of 163. Super dangerous! And not necessarily anything wrong with having a low MHR, the chap was fit and healthy, we’re all just built differently.\n\nSo yes, wholeheartedly agree with field testing for heart rate zones rather than relying on formulae. Or, if you can of course, getting a VO2 max test done. \n\nGreat post btw, thank you!\n\nNew watches are accurate, no need for hrm chest strap. I bought one last year to compare my HR on different efforts compared to my Apple Watch SE. Literally the same.\n\nI purchased a polar H10 and it shows exactly the same result as my Apple Watch. Like +- 1 beat..\n\ngave you a happy poop award because it's what I've got in the locker for free.  Great post.\n\n  \nwill +1000 the heart rate strap.  When I got the strap I found my wrist watch numbers were so far off it was laughable.\n\nFor me, it just took two months of running (now 170 miles) and everything worked out… now I can run 10:30 pace and be in zone 2 for 4+ miles as long as I’m on level ground and it’s cool outside. Started at a 13:30 pace and it would still go into zone 3 which forced me to walk multiple times during a run.\n\nDidn’t change anything about approach/lifestyle or equipment, just my Apple Watch and some Hoka Mach 6s. Following an 80/20 plan with zone 5 intervals on the hard days. Lately been running daily averaging close to 4 miles.\n\nPlus without chest strap sometimes my cadence becomes beats per minute..got chest strap never looked back!\n\nAlso important to note that if you live in a high humidity area during the summer, your HR can be significantly higher for the same amount of effort as a cool low humidity day. Dew point is really the percentage you want to go off of. If you’re going out when the dew point is in the 70%-75% which has been every day where live, it’ll significantly reduce your sweat from evaporating and can really jack up your body temperature fast. Learning to accept you probably aren’t going to be getting any PRs and really need to slow down from your usual pace is important \n\nThis is a great article for tips and info on running in high humidity https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20787918/tips-for-running-in-humidity/\n\nI try to run early in the summer but man do I sweat a lot in high humidity. So much a drop seems to fall off my fingers every few steps. It might not evaporate but it’s still taking heat off my body.\n\n200bpm is still pretty high regardless right?\n\nI got one of those Coros arm band HR monitors. It's more comfortable than the chest monitors and just as accurate.\n\nThis is a fantastic post. Thank you very much.\n\nPoor hydration can also lead to high heart rate as well as contribute to cardiac drift right?\n\nI’ve been big on trying to run in Zone 2 and struggling at the same time with RPE because I want to keep my Hr under 160 but I feel SO good and I make myself slow down… I wonder if my zone 2 is really higher than I think\n\nAs someone who’s just started running this is very useful, thanks OP!!\n\nNowadays, the watch heart rate monitor is on par with chest.\n\nI think the garmin heart rate in watches is very accurate, and most importantly predictable.\n\nDc rainmaker has done matching tests with chest strap and watch and shown them to be following the same plot line maybe 2-3 bpm off.\n\nThe only real disadvantage they show was from a slight delay in the pickup at the wrist.  So it’s accurate but 30 seconds behind the chest strap\n\nThat doesn’t really matter unless your running intervals and need to exact timing as to when your heart rate started increasing with interval for example.\n\nhttps://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2015/05/image6.png\n\nHere is the image comparing the midrange forerunner to a strap.\n\nStrap just not necessary for almost everyone.\n\nCan I ask a dumb question? I have been doing Z2 HR training consistently (and wearing chest strap monitor) for a year now. Is this correct that my Z2 ceiling is going UP? I thought that with Z2 work, my HR would be trending DOWN during Z2 work. When I first started Z2 training my ceiling for Z2 was 145is, and it's steadily increased to 147, 150, and now 156. My lactate threshold has also increased over time and is now sitting at 170.\n\nYes, to a degree. Your aerobic threshold (zone 2 ceiling) will increase as you consistently train (your resting HR will also drop), but from 145 to 156 seems like a bit much. I guess that seems reasonable for someone in their teens, but I would question it for anyone older than mid-20s.\n\nJust curious, but your anaerobic (lactate) threshold is 170 bpm, what is your max HR, and how was it determined?\n\nThanks for responding! Max HR is 198 so I’m using HR formula that uses RHR (59) and MHR. I’ve been using my Garmin watch and chest strap for about a year — Garmin prompts me ever so often to update my MHR based on workout performances — but also not sure how accurate that is.\n\nOkay. In that case, your zones might be misaligned. Here's what I would do if you want to dial in your HR zones.\n\nTo find your aerobic threshold (zone 2 ceiling), as my post mentions, [do a field test](https://evokeendurance.com/our-latest-thinking-on-aerobic-assessment-for-the-mountain-athlete/). If you think the top of your Z2 is 156 bpm, warm up for 15-20 minutes to that HR, then hold that effort for 1 hour on a flat route (or treadmill with 0% incline), then do your cool down. Compare your average HR for the last 30 minutes of that hour to the first 30 minutes. If your HR drifted upward by more than 5%, 156 bpm is too high and you should test again at a lower HR. If it drifted less than 3.5%, 156 bpm is too low and you should test again at a higher HR. But if it drifted between 3.5% and 5%, 156 bpm is indeed your aerobic threshold. Take off 10% as your zone 1 ceiling.\n\nTo find your anaerobic threshold (zone 3 ceiling), again, warm up for 15-20 minutes, then run as hard as you can for 30 minutes on a flat route (or treadmill with 0% incline) without blowing up, followed by a cool down. The average HR of the last 20 minutes of that 30 minute run is your anaerobic threshold.\n\n[To find your max HR](https://www.polar.com/blog/calculate-maximum-heart-rate-running/) (zone 5 ceiling), warm up for 15-20 minutes on a flat route. Run hard up a hill with a 10-12% grade at your 5K pace for 2 minutes, then slowly shuffle back down. Immediately turn around, and run hard up the hill at your 3K pace for 90 seconds, then slowly shuffle back down. Do it again, this time running as hard as you can for 60 seconds. Try to make it at least half-way up the hill. Note your HR at the end of the sprint. That reading is very close to your max HR.\n\nAwesome, thank you so much for your responses!! I’ll do these field tests soon and see what’s up!\n\nJust a comment, the aerobic field test should feel like an easy run. You should be able to converse easily with another runner the full hour. The risk to injury for easy runs on flat routes should be very low.\n\nThe anaerobic field test however is a hard test. You'll probably be feeling good for the first 10 minutes, then you'll notice your fatigue. The last 10 minutes should really be testing your mental resolve to finish strong. The risk to injury is increased compared to an easy run if you haven't done sustained tempos before. You'll probably have some DOMS for a few days after, which is expected.\n\nThe hill test is also hard but brief. Unfortunately, because you're running at considerably faster paces, and uphill at that, the risk to injury is high. You need good form to execute this test safely. Try to avoid leaning into the hill, stay relaxed, and keep your feet popping, as if you were running on hot coals. Think \"hot! hot! hot!\" on each stride. Definitely expect DOMS after this test.\n\nGreat, that is super helpful!! I do feel confident about my running form, having worked with PT and running coach. In your experience, is there a calculation that is *most* accurate? I understand the inherent issues with the calculations - but just curious in the meantime before I can do my field tests.\n\nThe problem with calculations is that they're either arbitrary (EG, 60% max HR) or they apply to a group's average but not individually (such as is common in studies). Your physiology is different from another runner, so trying to fit formulas into your training might not work.\n\nPersonally, I would learn how to dial in your RPE for zone 2 runs, and ignore your HRM. Try singing the alphabet or \"Happy Birthday\". You should be able to sing those songs comfortably. If you're in the northern hemisphere, we're coming into cooler temps with the fall, so you should barely be sweating in zone 2. You could even try nose breathing (doesn't work for everyone, but can for many).\n\nZone 2 runs should feel easy. You're not working. It's a light, casual, slow run where you can enjoy the pace, surroundings, and company without ever worrying about how much time is left, or how much farther until the finish. If you're counting streets until you can stop at your house, you're running too hard.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense! I am a trail runner so I do a lot of walking or power hiking - the trail and terrain are what “check” me from too hard an effort. I’m gaining a sense of my Z2 and RPE - but still glancing at my watch as a reference point. I’m beginning to better sense when I’m about to go out of Z2 (according to HR) and walk or PH before my HR gets too high. I do incorporate some speed work on flat surfaces but this is 10% of my training plan. Last question… how often do you recommend doing these tests? I’ll let you know when I’ve done them and follow up!\n\nI would probably recommend:\n\n- Aerobic test: Once every 6-8 weeks.\n- Anaerobic test: Once every 3-4 months.\n- Max HR test: Twice per year.\n\nYour HR isn't going to change all that much, but it's also vulnerable to stress, heat, humidity, diet, caffeine, hormones, etc. So having multiple data points can help identify outliers and get you closer to the truth.\n\nIn reality, I check my cardiac drift (aerobic threshold) fairly frequently on my easy 1-hour runs, just out of curiosity. It felt easy when I was out, but does the data agree? Yesterday, I was out for 67 minutes and my HR drifted 2%. So I don't do dedicated aerobic threshold tests any longer. My easy hour runs are good enough.\n\nI also check my anaerobic threshold when doing midweek intervals. I'm a marathon runner, so my midweek speed work session regularly consists of 30-60 minute tempos (it varies depending on where I am in the training schedule). I'll just use that as my \"test\". I usually will hit the 30 minute tempo a couple times in my training block.\n\nI've only ever done one max HR test though in the past 4 years. I'm 47 years old. My max HR isn't getting any higher, and honestly, I've never needed that metric in any of my training. With that said, I am planning on doing a Bruce protocol ramp test on a treadmill soon, which should push me up near my max HR, so that'll be interesting. But yeah, I don't find a lot of value personally in my max HR. I just don't use it anywhere in my training.\n\nCool!! Yes this totally makes sense. Thanks so much for taking the time to reply and help me better understand!!\n\nThose people will just ignore this article and keep posting their concern about the HR. I am tired of it.\n\nNow you have something to share with them.\n\nMany advanced runners aren't able to calibrate their effort levels well in races. It would be even harder in training runs, considering that you're not just aiming to empty the tank. There's nothing wrong with using HR as a more objective measure - in fact, if you aren't, you should be much less sure that you're *not* running too hard or easy. If you don't care about that, that's fine. \n\nI suspect a lot of the hate for HR monitors comes from the fact that it forces people to slow down on easy runs, which is tough on the ego. If you don't want to slow down, that's OK,  but you won't be able to run more because you'll be too exhausted after easy runs. It's as it states in OP - you'll get better by running more and running consistently. If you think you can do that when your HR monitor is telling you that you're going too hard, you will probably come face-to-face with sobering reality (there's a small chance you could be right, in which case you could simply adjust your HR zones). I personally don't think HR should be gospel (you can let it drift up a bit a few bpm sometimes, NBD), but it's a good reality check. Don't kid yourself by going hard thinking it's Z2, whether that's measured by RPE or HR.\n\n“The key is consistency” - what if you’re injured? My mileage is like rollercoaster and has been for nearly a year since I’ve started running. Surely it’s better to take a step back than to continue running?\n\nSure, but you can't expect your HR to be accurate as a zone 2 effort, which was the point. You definitely need to step back if you're injured.\n\nYep makes sense! I’m now going off on perceived effort now!\n\nThis post would be useful if zone 2 training wasn't just an overrated fad.\n\nFor the field test, what is the point of dividing the average heart rates? I don’t see that number used anywhere\n\nTo see how much your heart drifted during the run. Your average heart rate for the second half of the run will be higher than the first half. Dividing the second half by the first will show you how much it drifted."

Those guys are usually fast too.\n\nI’ve tried so many running socks but always go back to my everyday black cotton socks\n\nI find cotton better to be honest. I've tried the wicking/breathable socks, but for ultra distances I find they cause blisters. \n\nI like these:\n\nOrrinSports Toe Socks for Women Men Ankle/Crew Running Socks Cotton Breathable Five Finger Socks https://amzn.eu/d/0doWK6Dt\n\nHahhaah i always rock my cotton socks upto my shins 🤣\n\nA guy at a local 10k recently finished 2nd in 30mins dead (which was a PB for him), spoke to him afterwards and he wasn't wearing a watch at all.

Thats how he judged how well he was doing. Absolutely crazy\n\nI mean. The best female ultra runner in history just recently started running with a watch (because of sponsor). Not even a training program. Just go and do by feels every day. Hrv is pointless to track for everyone in here. Screw our addiction to watches 😂\n\nYeah it's great. I'm Irish and last year the ladies winner of the Dublin half marathon was a lady who only started a fee years and had big huge headphones on etc. no fancy running gear or anything. Just need to get out and do the work.\n\nYeah. I've been thinking of cutting all that as well. I've been addicted to sports watches for years now. I should just cut it. Or learn to deal with addiction. Hard how ever.\n\nDo I need the data from my $700 watch for my level of racing? No\n\nDo I like the data from my $700 watch? Yes\n\nYou'd be surprised how unnecessary a watch is for high level racing. It helps for fine tuning the pace, especially in hot weather. But for having fun at a road race?\n\nOnce you're in 30 minute 10K shape (or even slower, like 32-33 minute shape), you have more than enough practice to know with reasonable confidence how fast you're going. At that speed, you've been racing for years and have logged hundreds/thousands of miles at or around 10K effort, so your body has a lot of cues for \"this is a 10K effort\".\n\nUmm, how exactly are you going to put the race on Strava if you don't have a watch?  And how exactly are you any kind of high level runner if you don't have Strava?\n\nI know you're joking but I just have strava on my phone like the simpleton that I am\n\nNot a fast runner at all, but I like wearing a fitness tracker watch only to record and document my run for later. I may only look at it a few times during a 10k to check my heart rate.\n\nsame! my favorite thing to do while cooling down after a run is to sit and look at all the pretty charts and numbers lol\n\nMy partner and I have both been running since high school (tho at drastically different abilities and levels), we’re mid 30’s, this is an ongoing convo about how we measured distance pre-watch. Even now with a watch I usually have it set to the time screen (so I can’t see pace/distance) but I generally “know” when I’m at 1 mi/2mi etc. I’m a little worse with gauging pace\n\nThis guy is my 60yo dad and I can confirm he always sends it.\n\nI did the Iceland midnight sun half last month and talked my dad into doing the 5k.  He was an elite runner when I was a kid (20+ years ago) but this was his first run since then.   He was in some shity steakers Casio watch and some off brand running pants he bought in a souvenir store (as he forgot his shorts)   \n\n\nDude smoked it.   And was like \"well it wasn't my best time.\n\nStature is like 80% stringy venison legs, split shorts, and some variety of cut-off tshirt (likely a race from the 80s, 90s). \n\nYou've given me a great help here. These are always the guys I see running super steady and consistently. They know their game, they know the pace. These are the guys I need to look for when I (a 24 year old cyclist who runs at max effort the whole way) blow up after 1.5km and need to hang on for dear life until I can blow up the last 1km in aggony!\n\nIf it makes you feel better, those old timers with Casio watches have blown up in the past too. Probably not in centuries, but they have\n\nBlowing up isn't the problem for me, it's the strategy.

His shuffle is about an 8min/mi and is faster fueled on Metamucil that I'll ever be on carbs.\n\nI ran a 12K in May and there was a guy like this just in front of me for miles. He barely seemed to be moving. And in the final two miles, that barely moving man pulled farther and farther away, until I lost sight of him completely. I swear he was levitating.\n\nI know this guy. I’ve seen him too…\n\nThe front leaning stoop! My God that's accurate.\n\nWhy did I immediately picture him? He's always about 105 lbs soaking wet too. \n\nCompletely sunburnt wrinkled skin,\n\nThis guy always crushes me.\n\nI saw this guy at the first Jersey City Half Marathon last year.

I used to work at the same company he did and he'd just run loops in the little gym running circuit they had which was like running laps around half a basketball court.

He cooked once we were out running though.\n\nHe's like \"I've been running Boston for 175 consecutive years\"\n\nwhat\n\nThere's a man in his 80's who has beaten me at parkrun multiple times who looks exactly like this\n\nThe opposite perspective: while waiting before the start of a HM, I overheard two people behind me talking about my massive calves and (wrongly) assuming I was going to crush it.\n\nI finished, but boy did I struggle on that one.\n\nGenetically big calves are the athlete's curse. Lugging around heavy meat anchors everywhere you go. Anything you do makes them bigger. There is no escape.\n\nI am one of those genetically cursed. I also took ballet for a few weeks as a kid and have walked on my toes ever since. \nThis comment hurt me 😅\n\nAnd and on the flipside, I read part of the reason East African distance runners have so much success is they tend have unusually thin lower leg/ankle bones, so have less weight to lift and swing with every step.\n\nFinally I have an excuse for my slow pace!\n\n“Lugging around heavy meat anchors everywhere you go” lol\n\nA+\n\nUgh yep.  Played receiver in college and was so jealous of all the other guys with ankles so thin they looked like they may snap.  I'm dragging ankle weights, trying to run by someone.\n\nThe high school CC kiddos were at my race yesterday, too, and I swear that their casual warm up was roughly my running-from-a-bear pace. \n\nIf someone shows up in a banana costume, I just assume they'll crush it.\n\nI spent a large portion of Boston this year chasing a ridiculously fast banana - he ended up finishing in 2:35 and breaking the world record for a banana\n\nTo be fair if you asked me how fast the world's fastest banana could run, I'd have guessed \"zero\".\n\nWow! That's bananas!\n\nI'll show myself out.\n\nLOL--\"running from a bear pace\"! There is a guy in his 60s in my area who also seems to float across the ground, just warming up for 5Ks.\n\nMy kids’ “easy” runs are so fast. They’ve been running for years now, but I’ll never get used to them saying I’m going out for an easy 8 in brutally hot weather and they’re back in an hour.\n\nCan confirm. I was overtaken by a sprinting banana in the last km of the London Marathon.\n\nHahahah! I was that guy in the Banana costume at one point in life. I was a pacer at the Jamba Juice 10k while in college. The one mile fun run started just after the finish of the 10k and the local HS kids and a few of the super dads pushing strollers were there. The three 10k bananas jumped in and we proceeded to grab 3 of the top 5 places. HS phenom won it in a blistering time, sub 5 in a banana suit chafes the neck...\n\nAfter 40+ years of bringing home race t-shirts I (M66) have become the guy who “smokes” his age category almost every time. And if I’m REALLY lucky, there will be at least one other person in the M60+ age group so I can brag at least a little bit.\n\nLol, as someone firmly in the middle of my age/gender group I'm looking forward to the day I can finally advance.  Even if it's just because the group shrinks!\n\nBad news. That day will never come because there we always be that former college athlete (45 years ago) that crushes everything. Welcome to the club, we're forever assigned to the middle ;-)\n\nI am in my 60's, and I found that hitting a new age group was no benefit at all until my 50's. As we get older, things we can't control can happen to our bodies. I lost much of age 58 and 60 to back injuries, and I have very fast friends who had to back off for heart ailments and cancer treatment. I'm fortunate that my back healed and I'm running well at 61 (my worst AG finish this year has been a single 2nd place) but I'll never take running for granted again. I feel fortunate that I can do it at all.\n\nYou rock!! I’m a little surprised you say you’re alone, though. We often have 1 in the 80+ category for both men and women. The 60-69 is still remarkably competitive.\n\nThanks!\n\nI have been shocked by the lack of ANY participants in my most recent race—a 16k that is a pretty big deal in my community with lots of vendors, street closures, and hundreds of runners. I was the ONLY person older than 59 this year, and one of only three last year. The oldest category is 60+, which surprises me. Oh well. I got the $25 gift certificate for the local running store anyway. I was glad there was no awards ceremony, though. It’s a bit embarrassing when they announce “the winner—and only competitor in this age group was…” and I have walk up while everyone laughs. ‘-)\n\nHowever, there are always LOTS of younger runners coming in after me, which restores SOME of my self respect. 😇\n\nThe only drawback to all those miles is that, ironically, it hasn’t been as “heart healthy” as I always imagined it would be. But I wouldn’t trade the sport for anything—it gave me a kind of life that non-runners will never understand.\n\nCan you elaborate on your last paragraph?\n\nYes. I started having “odd” heart rhythms a couple of years ago that came and went. Then, it got to where I would suddenly run out of energy—as though I was having my first run. After a few visits to the doctor and cardio people—and lots of monitoring, tests, etc. I was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB). And according to the cardiologist, “This is your fault for being a runner.” \n\nAs it turns out, long-distance athletes are the second-most likely group to develop AFIB—second only to the folks who think cheese doodles and donuts are essential nutrients.\n\nAnyway, I had several cardioversion procedures (a heart shock that restores normal sinus rhythm) but they were a temporary fix. Then, three week ago I had a catheter ablation, in which the surface of the heart is “burned” to create scars which are supposed to correct the misdirected electrical systems which control rhythm. The doc who performed the procedure says he’s confident that he corrected the pathways, but it’s possible I’ll need additional ablations. And of course, I’m on several meds like beta-blockers, blood thinners, and such—all for the first time in my life.\n\nI’ve been starting to run EASY again, and feeling slow—but it could be the 95+ degree heat and humidity here in North Carolina. It’s actually the worst season to run in this part of the world, and the main reason I gave up trying to train for a fall marathon when I moved here in 1996.\n\nAnyway, the cardiologist is a runner, and she is in support of my returning to the sport—but no more than 30 miles a week. Well, I don’t expect that to be a problem. ;-)\n\nI did some research about this and, yes, it has been a problem for a lot of extreme distance athletes (a group of which I am no a member!) \n\nI’m grateful for the support I have received from /afib, and am thankful that it didn’t hit me years ago. Lots of young people have to deal with it.\n\nThanks for all the nice comments and questions. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions outside of this thread.\n\nCiao\n\nAt ultra races it’s the people that toe the line without a hydration vest.\n\nAbsolutely no fear, no need between aid stations.\n\nJust raw doggin it\n\n\"if I can't make it to the water stations, I don't deserve water\"\n\nNo vest, no headlamp, just handhelds.. Meanwhile my vest feels like I packed for a 4-day vacation. It's a different ball game for them lol.\n\nNo shirt or wearing some sort of short-sleeve button-down. Either they have no idea what they're doing, or know exactly what they are doing.\n\nI feel like this is key. Sometimes it's the ones who look \"unprepared\" or do things different or weird are either best there, or are actually unprepared. \n\n\nOn the flip side, it's easy to spot those new and excited for the sport by the hydration vests at the the 5 and 10ks, with full gear and Gu and branded socks and expensive shoes. I love the enthusiasm for something new and just going full boar, as much as I love the years of slowly dropping gear, honing in on preferences. It's all part of the game and fun. \n\nHavent really done a lot of races because i dont like big groups of people but people actually wear vests for 5k races???\n\nOn really hot days i can sort of understand some people wanting it for a 10k, it can be a 1hr+ race and as a heavier person i understand the want/need for water even during a 10k if its one of your first ones. I struggled a lot on my first few 10k's as a 100kg+ guy in summer.\n\nHand bottle brother\n\nAnyone who run commutes TO the race.\n\nHah, I did this when I ran the race for the local animal shelter, I didn’t crush the race but I did pet a lot of dogs, so who’s the real winner\n\nReal talk, I keep track of my PR for “most dogs petted during a race.” My current PR is 2 (or 5 if you count dogs befriended in the start corrals and finish areas) but there’s a 5k in my area in August called “dog days of summer” where dogs are invited to participate, and I expect that race to be my crowning achievement.\n\nI went to a Woofstock themed race so I have a pretty high dog petted PR\n\nI got 12 during a marathon where I was colossally undertrained and jet lagged. Just stopped and asked people to pet their dogs \n\nThis. Especially for point to point races, anyone who parks at the finish and runs to the start (or vice versa) is insane.\n\nShoutout to you mad lads who did the \"double\" Peachtree road race yesterday.\n\nAfter the finish I joked about turning around and running the course again yesterday. Is that actually an option? Seems like it would be too crowded to run back in the opposite direction.\n\nI did this for a half marathon because it was a little over a mile and it’s impossible to get back into my neighborhood once the race (including a marathon) starts and it was fine, but I did not crush it and I asked my family to meet me on the way home because I was done! I’m debating doing this again, but will just prepare for a slow, long walk home. Maybe grab an ice coffee for the walk. 🤣\n\nI do this for my town's annual 5k because the start is exactly a mile from my house. I think I was 5th last year.\n\nGotta get that warmup in!\n\nPeople doing those jump-and-kick-your-butt things just behind the start line as a warmup. \n\nMen wearing shorts so short that it looks like their junk will fall out if they take too long a step. \n\nHigh schoolers. Period. Those stinkers are fast and it’s not fair. \n\nNew one from yesterday’s race: a track team of grown-ups that shows up with 20 people all wearing matching team singlets. Holy moly, those people were fast. At least 3 of their women ran sub-19 in the 5k yesterday.\n\nI had the last one at a 10k in April. Was feeling spicy at the start and tried to follow their pace for the first 1-2km. DO NOT recommend if you want the final km to feel better than \"deepest circle of Hell\".\n\nLOL sounds like they helped you run a good race!\n\nIMO if you're racing a 10k and the list 1-2km are anything other than deepest circle of hell then you haven't raced it hard enough!\n\nThe shorter the shorts, the faster the runner. It's just science.\n\nThe local track teams are insane around me. I want to join a run club for the social aspect, but I’ve looked at their schedules, and their “easy runs” do not go slower than 10:00/mi, which is pushing up against my 5k race pace at the moment. \n\nDid a 5k yesterday with some of those crazies in it. Top 5 were all sub-16, and the overall winner was sub-15.\n\nI've got the Nike elite kids to contend with at events, although lucky for me, none of them live around me so I don't have to see them when I'm out training.  \n\nYou know who will win when you see the red shirt Nike kids show up.\n\nI’ll answer for the complete opposite. Usually when I see someone in brand new Vaporflys/ Alphaflys I know that they won’t be competing with me. 9 times out of 10 the runners who beat me are wearing worn shoes because they race regularly, those turning up in brand new super shoes generally have all the gear and no idea. I also used to look at people who wore compression arm sleeves as people who are absolutely going to blitz the race, but I don’t think I’ve ever come across one that has competed for a podium finish\n\nThis is more my experience.  SOmebody showing up totally kitted out just signals this race is a big deal to them.  Could be their first 5k, could be they think they've got a real chance of winning, either really, but a lot more people will fall into the first category.\n\nThere was a dude in full George Washington outfit and it was already really hot. I knew he had it, no one is gonna commit to that costume in this weather unless they’re about to go beast mode.\n\nThat is Crossing the Delaware Beast Mode.\n\n&gt;-High school girl in a sports bra, short shorts, with hair all up in Philly Bowden-style butterfly clips, compression socks\n\nThe higher the ponytail, the stronger she gets. They are a ton a girl like this in my local park and they are SCARY.\n\nWhen it's a pineapple-style bun that doesn't move when she runs and adds another 3 inches to her height, I am terrified.\n\nYesterday's 5K had one of these girls with KT tape on her calves.  I knew she meant BUSINESS.\n\n- Guys in 4 inch shorts where you can almost see their ass\n\n- Wrap-around sunglasses. Bonus points if the lens are colorful and looks like they belong for snowboarding\n\n- Prerace, having your Race shoe laces tied up together and hanging around your neck. Can't be wearing race shoes while commuting there \n\n- Any dude wearing running singlets will absolutely destroy me\n\n&gt; 4 inch shorts\n\nMy brother in Christ, that’s basically full coverage.\n\nThose are basically pants\n\n&gt;Guys in 4 inch shorts where you can almost see their ass\n\nIt's always this guy.\n\nI want to be this guy, but every time a pair of shorts less than 5” find their way into my shopping cart, my wife clicks her tongue disapprovingly and vetoes.\n\nShe's sabotaging you. She knows there's a PR in those shorts. \n\nYour wife is wise and loving to do that for you. 🤣 She knows what's up.\n\nYup, the people who bring MULTIPLE pairs of shoes for a local 5K always get me worried.\n\nThe sinewy person with T-rex arms and Brontosaurus legs.\n\nAnyone who wears Boston marathon merch to their local 5k\n\nThe bigger problem is the guy in Boston socks because they were the only clean ones they had, and otherwise nondescript gear.  It’s the people who don’t care about advertising that they’ve been to Boston who are trouble.  If they’re wearing a cotton T-shirt and no watch, god help you.\n\nDad with a jogging stroller won my hometown 5k three years in a row, once with TWO kids in it. I also got passed by a women with a jogging stroller when I thought I was crushing my 1/2 marathon. \n\nI used to have a jogging stroller when my kids were tots, but I could never get used to running with it, it was just too much extra effort.\n\nBeware the stroller pushers, they can be super human.\n\nJogging stroller parents are a force of nature.\n\nI found the stroller pulls you, I was always surprised at my paces with the kids in it. The lean and the momentum meant that I'd be doing 15-20s per km faster than my normal pace when running easy. But then there are inclines. And wind.\n\nI assume if you've got kids at stroller age you're also working with a sleep deficit and not exactly an ideal training regimen!\n\nConservation of angular momentum is my guess. There’s both the momentum of the stroller moving forward and the momentum of the spin of the wheels, and wheels are super efficient at storing momentum, it’s why bikes work so well. You created that energy when you pushed the stroller and that energy doesn’t go away easily so you can borrow it back for a bit of a pull when you need it.\n\nI’ve done short runs with nieces and nephews in strollers a few times over the years and my fucking god the respect I have for people who do it.\n\nRemember a few years ago when there was that fad of wearing a little parachute while running intervals?\n\nI thought it would slow me down, but it actually stabilized me and could make me faster, except up hills. I still don’t fully understand the physics, but it would give a sensation of being towed when the road seemed flat.\n\nThe first 18 -24 months after having given birth, I honestly felt like I had some sort of energy boost happening when I would go run. I have never felt so fast or like free in my range of motion. So maybe something to do with hormones going back to normal or ligaments and joints still being loose from pregnancy? I don’t know but it was awesome. My kid is 4 years old now so that feeling has passed but it was neat while it lasted (now just back to my normal plodding pace).\n\nRunning with a stroller is so minimally more enjoyable than not running at all I gave up on it. Great respect for anyone willing to race with one.\n\nAny male 16-26yrs old who looks like a runner. If you're getting up early to race at that age you must likely compete or have competed in the recent past and will think nothing of throwing down some 5:xx miles in a 5k. On the other hand, they might struggle to pace themselves on longer races. I passed some fit guys half my age on the back half of a 50mi race and it was glorious.\n\nAs an older woman, I admit to take particular delight in passing buff CrossFit-style dudes at the half distance and longer. (Especially in very hot races, where sometimes all that bulk can be a detriment, even if it's all muscle.)\n\nSame, these guys always sprint past me in the beginning, but I'm plodding along at an even tempo like some kind of movie monster and I will catch up if they didn't pace themselves well or can't handle the heat.\n\nI had a guy like that in front of me in my local marathon last fall. It's a small enough race that I had a decent chance of winning my age range so I was sizing up the guys in front of me and he immediately stood out as someone who was likely overestimating himself based on his other fitness persuits. Well, however any miles later that dude finished at the pace he'd been running all day and I came in dehydrated and barely hanging on to my sub-3 PR goal. I kind of wanted to tell him the story on Strava, but I can't imagine \"I thought you were dumb, but you weren't dumb.\" going over too well 😆\n\nThe only time I beat this category of runner is when they make strategic mistakes.  Outran a whole group of them at a half marathon but overhead them at mile 6 complaining about how they shouldn't have stayed out so late, drank so much, etc.  Still counts, lol!\n\nI ran a 5k yesterday and got obliterated by a high school XC team. As a 40 year old dude I was stoked with my 22:29 but some 16 year old won with a 15:01 and a whole pack of kids finished in the 16-19:00 range.\n\nBay Area CA goes hard when it comes to local 5K’s.\n\nAt Parkrun in the UK, some of the events have people running sub 16 every Saturday. I did one in Glasgow recently which had 14 people finish under 18mins out of 350ish total, which is fairly normal for the bigger events on fast courses\n\nWas this at Strathclyde Park by any chance? It attracts a lot of those speedy types cause it’s pancake flat! I would know, it’s my home course!\n\nYeah, I went there with a couple of people from my club specifically for that reason. First time under 16mins for me, and 2 other guys got under 17 for the first time, and definitely felt like the fastest 5k course I've ever done\n\nA few turkey trots I’ve run have had local collegiate runners on break, just finishing their cross seasons, come in and lay under 14:00. It’s brutal and beautiful to watch. Our course is out &amp; back and I see them coming back at me when I’ve barely started my 10K.\n\nMy first marathon I did was exactly that. Marathon was the first September after graduating high school and I was just running without a plan or anything throughout the summer. \n\nFirst half was great, felt great, going 6:45-6:50 a mile and crossed the half way feeling really good. Then I hit the 14 mile marker and wham, hit the wall hard and my pace went to 9:30-10:00 a mile.\n\n\"He ran in the first NYC marathon in tennis shoes\" XD\n\nAt our last local 5k the gals who showed up in matching club kit and bunhuggers looked dangerous (and all ran in the 17s).\n\nHigh schoolers are a mixed bag, some are really fast but some have no sense of pace and blow up really hard early, but anyone with a college singlet is fast, even moreso if it's a big school.\n\nYou can tell a lot from seeing how people warm up. Doing strides with obvious, easy power? Yep. Not lining up in front of him.\n\nThose HS track kids are the yearly reminder that I am not getting any younger.  Very humbling.\n\nMatthew McConaughey’s character in Dazed and Confused is meant to be an object lesson in immaturity to the rest of us. \n\nEvery year *I* get older and the teenagers look younger. Babies!\n\nSkinny dude in early 30s with mustache, a few tats, wearing a running hat, and doing overly intense warmups\n\n[deleted]\n\nHa yeah, sometimes the overly intense warmup dude is an imposter.\n\nThere is some subtle chill in the truly fast guys. The toooo intense people are trying too hard to look fast.\n\nIf I can hear a dude pass by me during warm-ups my imposter alarm goes off. It's the silent ones with perfect form that I don't notice until they're shoulder to shoulder with me that I give notice to.\n\nI have jumped when a stealthy runner flies by me with perfect light feet. Never even hear them.\n\nSuper skinny guy with long hair and beard, sun-damaged skin, and calf muscles that look like he's smuggling cantaloupes.\n\nYup, and he’s sinewy in short shorts and a random top, neither of which are really running gear brands.  But he does have some quality shoes with MILES on them.  Probably has a few cheap, son beaten tattoos. Might be on a low dose of mushrooms.\n\n&gt;Might be on a low dose of mushrooms.\n\nThis^\n\nAnyone with calf striations.\n\nLiterally anyone lining up for a race in Boulder, CO. Everyone is faster than you.\n\nI'm usually a line up in the front guy and man was that a terrible idea at the Bolder Boulder. Getting passed by 600+ people in the first mile is enough to make anyone feel like they're now dead last (despite the 40k other people in the race).\n\nI look for the guy who is most inappropriately dressed.  I know he will kick my butt.  I got smoked in the last half I did by a dude wearing blue jeans and cowboy boots.  I have no clue how he did it.  I don't even understand why he did it.\n\nThe dad in jeans pushing a stroller damn near had me quitting one time.\n\nThe person with the look on their face of “this is my warm-up run before I do my real training later today.”\n\nThe overall winner of the race I was in ran three miles before and after the 5-mile race (I follow him on Strava, he's in my running club).\n\nHad this happen in a local two-day \"not a race\" bikerace last summer (back-to-back 180km days through rolling hills). As our group of 10 were getting ready to head out on Day 1, these three dudes in their 50s rolled up to join us. About 10km in, they mentioned that this was their final prep ride before World Gran Fondo Championships (basically amateur world champs).\n\nWe were *flying* - we finished the course in around 5hr15min. But those three were were absolute animals. At around 130kms in, they looked at us, said \"see you at the finish\" and proceeded to ride us off their wheels like we were standing still.\n\nIt’s the mom pushing the running stroller that always crushes me. Every. Time. \nKilling it, pushing not only her kid but packed stroller too! \nI need to start running with the running stroller again, it was excellent strength training.\n\nMy first 10k I got smoked by a tiny woman pushing a baby and a toddler and what looked like their entire toy collection. I swear her rig weighed more than she did.\nI caught her a few times during the race, the last time because she had to stop to change the dvd in the player for the toddler.\nShe then caught and passed me for the last time &amp; disappeared off into the distance.\nRespect.\n\nThe other day I was running up a steep hill with the kid in a stroller and thinking that this is the best training I'll ever have.\n\nCan confirm. Being passed by pregnant women pushing stroller with kid in it almost killed me.\n\nI remember a 5K I was running a few years ago...   I run around a 9 to 10 minute pace for 5Ks. I was (at the time) 6'2\" and 270lbs.    I saw this guy that was 5 inches shorter than me and had at least 50 pounds more on his frame that I did.  \nI thought \"Well, there's at least one guy I'll beat\".   \nSpeedy Gonzalez ran around a 7 minute pace and SMOKED me.  \nSomething about a book and it's cover, amirite?\n\nI was at a high school cross country event as a coach a few years ago and there was a girl with bright pink knee high compression socks that you could see from a mile away. She was also really into the warmups and very exaggerated in her motions. I wondered if it was all show…\n\nShe won in her category, almost 60 seconds ahead of second place!\n\nShirtless Man variant:  man with HRM chest strap\n\nI was watching an advice video the other day with three runners I think I was meant to recognize and the woman in the group announced her life goal was to get a tanline from her arm HRM.\n\nShirtless man variant: there was one of those at my last 5k who was also barefoot. He did indeed smoke me.\n\nThe ones you need to fear are the old guys wearing a cotton race shirt that is 8 years older than you are.  I know, I'm one of those.  I may not be as fast as I used to be, but if we are neck and neck with 200 meters to go, you are toast.\n\nWhen it’s so cold and wet you’re worried it’ll be icy, the people who show up in super short shorts and tank tops, nothing else. 🥶🥶🥶\n\nWhen I was super fit I loved a 50° days. Go like hell and don’t sweat. \n\nNow unless I’m doing yard work it’s too fucking cold.\n\nThe couple that are at least 70+ years old and wearing their old Boston shirts.\n\nMost neon = fastest\n\nI have always believed that the brighter the shoes, the faster the run.  It's why I'm so pissed I have a wide foot and they only make like 3 colors for us- black, gray and navy, lol!\n\nHmm. I got a neon shirt on sale a few weeks ago. I’ve worn it once, and set some new PRs since I bought it. \n\nIt’s possible I was wearing it that day… time for science.\n\nThe high school kid - my last 5k there was this kid there, 14 years old, skinny as a toothpick. The shorts he was wearing would fit my toddler. He was with his cross country friends. I figured this dude was either going to pass out after a mile, or win the whole thing.\n\nHe came in 2nd out of 600 runners, lost by only 8 seconds.\n\nI said to my friends as we lined up for the 5k yesterday, “How many girls with bubble braids are going to pass me today?”\n\nThe answer? Quite a few.\n\nThey guy doing practice starts before the race\n\nIt's -10 but they are there in singlet  and 5in shorts\n\nI come from the land of the ice and snow \n\nFrom the midnight sun where the hot springs flow\n\nI've been to races where it's snowing and this guy is there.\n\nThe 26-30 year old skinny dudes who show up alone and shake hands with each other at the front of the starting line crowd. Also the 50ish women who are lean and tan and look like they’ve had some work done.\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed reading through these\n\nHa, me too!\n\nDoing my first ever 5k next weekend. Now I know what to look for. Thanks everyone!\n\nomg, good luck! You will have a blast!\n\nThe person who looks like he’s wearing an 80s running outfit.\n\nThe shorter the shorts the faster the runner.\n\nIf you run fast enough nobody can see your weiner.\n\nAny chick wearing those bathing suit bottoms\n\nEver since I turned 30 it has been a sad tradition that I will get walked down in every race by a man so old his balls are dragging on the pavement and also by a child in basketball shoes.  A useful dose of humility.\n\nI got cooked by a middle aged Indian lady running in a full sari. She looked obviously incredible but also like she was barely trying?\n\nGlasses, green alpha flys 3 and a bright running singlet\n\nFast people enter the corral from the front.\n\nI was at a trail race once where two people at the start line were talking about plans to bike to brunch afterwards…\n\nThin 45 yr old guy at the front of the pack in knee length running shorts and a tech-material shirt with sleeves sizing everyone up silently.\n\nHe runs every day to stay sane, does not care how he looks, and will absolutely smoke you.\n\n🤣 First and last describe my kids at many local community runs when they put up with running them with me. And yes, they always win their age division and often overall. My son is morphing into shirtless guy as he ages.\n\nWhen I used to race competitively it’s funny because I would look at a person in all the bright colors with fancy tech and whatnot and think, crap, I got my work cut out for me. 9 times out of 10 they were far behind me, lol. It’s true about the person who said it’s the people in old clothes with simple gear you really need to look out for.\n\nAnyone who does a stride out/sprint out/acceleration before a race \n\nYou know they’re about to light the course on fire\n\nif they are wearing headband, skin tight under armor pants/leggings, a shirt thats completely torn from arm to waist on both sides, lime green or neon shoes, look like they havnt eaten anything in the past 2 years, showing off insane flexibility with stretches, and most importantly not talking to anyone else around them lol\n\nFor real....\n\nRacing flats and a team kit, either school or one of the fast local clubs.\n\nAt a local race without prize money, the fastest people also tend to look more relaxed than most people, as they're typically out to get a workout between important races. They're not fidgeting with their electronics or looking around at other runners.\n\nThe geriatric in Alphaflys. You know they're not fooling around.\n\nskinny but veiny\n\nI've run only one marathon. \n\nThe guy that left everyone in the dust looked like he was uncomfortable standing still, he had a loose fitting tank top that saw more miles than my shoes I was wearing at the time, and his shoes cost as much as everything I was wearing including my hr tracker and phone at the time.\n\nCollege kid who looks hungover\n\nTo me it's always those people who have a quietness about them that almost comes off as aggressive. They line up in the chute, and everyone around them is chatting, looking around, doing some warm up bounces or whatever but they're just silently standing there, staring straight ahead. It makes me want to quote Jaws: \"lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a dolls eyes.\"\n\nThat's actually why so many people talking about the cross country runners is throwing me off. It might just be me, but in my experience when a team of cross country runners show up to a race together one or maybe two of them is out for blood (and you can spot those ones immediately), the rest just seem to be there for a good time. They know they can't beat that one dude/dudette that they came with so they're just hanging out cracking jokes and stuff, and when the race starts all the rest of em just kinda fast-mosey out there as group, which can be frustrating because everyone sees their jerseys, and shuffles them to the front before the race, so a bunch of us have to work our way back around them (which is never easy cause they almost always run together, spread out across the entire road/path/whatever)... And I've gotten off topic. Anyway, yeah it's the quiet and still ones. They act like predators before the race... and I guess during it too.\n\nIt’s always the person who rocks up in a beat up shirt and a hat that’s been to hell and back 4.5 times.\n\nThe guys with the tinted glasses, singlet, road runners, they are reliably 19min 5km people. They always look the fastest, athletic build, warming up thoroughly etc. but never are.\n\nOld guy wearing basketball shorts from the 70s. Watch out!!\n\nWay back when we had a neighbor who coached the local HS cross country team; that is soooo true!\n\nIf it looks like they’re wearing underwear for bottoms\n\nThis young guy (I estimated 18 at the time and was correct) was on a video call with his parents/friends at the front of the start line of a recent 5k. He took off while still video chatting with them and kept it up for about 400m and would periodically pull it out and vlog or talk to them.\n\nI knew he was going to cook upon sight but this was ridiculous.  He turned out to be a kid who ran cross country/track in high school. This was a fun race for him.  Fun for me too but another level 😂"

They’re literally signalling each other to not run so fast as to go past him, with the one guy holding out his hand.\n\nMy favorite is after they cross the finish line, the Chinese runner is doubled over and wheezing while the African dudes look like they’re feeling warmed up.\n\nTheir form looked uncoordinated and uncomfortable having to “slow” down to what was probably in the low 3 minutes per km.\n\nI mean, they get more money this way than to win it themselves.\n\nMaybe not anymore lol\n\nHow?\n\n“I have never participated in a half marathon before, so this time I wanted to set a personal best [performance]”\n\nUh, yeah. I set a personal best on my first half marathon too.\n\nThe Africans could’ve made it less obvious by running slower or faking a cramp lol\n\nAll three get cramps meters from the finish line?\n\nChance in a million\n\nCramps, stitches, muscle tears, the list goes on.\n\nThey should stop and have a couple rounds of rock paper scissors\n\nThe winner gets to fake cramp and punches the loser on the gut.\n\nChina is so weird man. I’m guessing this is all for internal propaganda? Like, the rest of the world sees right through this, they’re not even really trying to hide it.\n\nEh if this race was anywhere else I'd be like dang but it's a half marathon in Beijing so..\n\nRight? Probably didn't have a choice lol\n\nI like that he (the \"winner\") stated that he was fully prepped for the Olympics in Paris. I think that dude is about to come to the second part of FAFO when he gets there. Unless the Chinese officials manage to pay off everyone else I guess.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPerhaps but according to BBC and other outlets he's even being investigated by his own sponsor which is also the sponsor of the race. If he was allowed pacers, no ones seems to know about it and give a comment.\n\n[Beijing half marathon: Organisers investigating controversial finish](https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/68815592.amp)\n\nLol... You can't investigate China.\n\nThey already told you what happened so the story is settled... that's it... case closed.\n\n&gt;“Now I am fully preparing for the Paris Olympics; please believe in Chinese athletes. I hope to showcase Chinese speed in Paris and let the world see the Chinese speed,” He said.\n\nEverything is political. Probably so China keeps investing money into Africa\n\nOr they’re just paid to let the Chinese guy win.  I don’t think they’re political envoys working a trade deal\n\nThis was my immediate thought as well.\n\nThey’re doing it so openly and obviously they’re not hiding what they’re doing at all. I wonder if they received a flat fee for the race and realising a home talent they just thought- screw this, we’ll win bigger and better than this, let’s allow this home favourite running the race of his life have his moment? Certainly, if it was due to betting or something you don’t wave them through and gesture to your compatriots to hold back openly, surely? Or did they agree to pace for him? I doubt this is as cynical as it’s being g made out to be, but what do I know.\n\nPacers?\n\nTypical CCP corruption?\n\nMy experience is that pacers don't cross the finish line.\n\nNo, pacers can and often finish the race. \n\nIn some instances, pacers have gone on to win the race: https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a30152339/pacer-wins-abu-dhabi-marathon/\n\nNot 3 pacers, finishing 2nd together. These guys are top athletes and this absolutely stinks.\n\nOhh I don't know \n\n[https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/news/a36262971/jake-smith-wins-cheshire-marathon/](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/news/a36262971/jake-smith-wins-cheshire-marathon/)\n\nEverything in China is a setup or a mirage.\n\nLol. Not just China.\n\nWelcome to to China.  Do what we say. You don't win.\n\nIs there a better source for this than nypost?\n\nThere is a video in the comments section.\n\nHurr ny post bad durr\n\nYes, it is bad\n\nReminiscent of Clayton Young and Connor Mantz, no?\n\nThe purse was $5,500. Who cares. Let China have their national hero. \n\nMaybe the Chinese fall in love with running like they have Basketball. There are worse things.\n\nHelluva run there from Xi Jinping\n\nPretty appalling that some of the comments here immediately jump to \"They had no choice, otherwise the CCP would kil them!\" rather than just, \"Oh, He fixed the race.\"\n\n\nOfficial line from one of the Kenyan runners is that he did it because they're friends: https://amp.scmp.com/sport/other-sport/article/3259055/kenyan-runner-willy-mnangat-admits-he-let-chinas-he-jie-win-beijing-half-marathon-because-he-my\n\nA lot of people in sports are friends outside of the ring/field/road/etc.\n\nBeing friend does not mean destroying the Spirit of Sport, which is about competing in legit and respectful manner.\n\nThat justification is simply stupid and they are trying to offend our intelligence by saying those idiocies.\n\nLmfao this isn’t a high school race, when did you last see 3 people give up that much first place prize money cause “we are friends!” And there is nothing appalling about callling out the CCP. If you think they aren’t involved somehow you don’t understand how the CCP operates in China\n\nI'm not saying I believe the excuse, just adding context. Any further speculation on the cause is just that: speculation.\n\nIf you actually read the article you'll see it quotes an actual expert on Chinese sport: “\\[The\\] most obvious explanation here is that race fees for the Africans were guaranteed and/or a bonus was offered for letting the local runner win,” he added.\n\n“Otherwise, competing for prize \\[money\\] among themselves on the Chinese circuit can be a cruel game, with barely enough on offer to pay their costs.”\n\nNo shit they're trying to give an excuse because it's so obvious what happened.\n\nCCP is a totalitarian party that deserves no respect.\n\nI don't know if I buy the guy's excuse, but at the same time, what do I know? Who's to say they're not friends, and agreed to split the prize money?\n\nImmediately assuming that this has something to do with the CCP is pure speculation. The idea that every wrongdoing in China is caused by CCP meddling is not based in reality. He Jie could just be a shady dude.\n\nLol well they could also just win all the prize money and then give part of it to whoever they wanted. You're jumping through massive mental gymnastics to.create an alternative explanation for something very obvious, especially in an Olympic year.\n\nSurely your explanation contains just as much mental gymnastics. The CCP coerced these three guys to lose in the most blindingly obvious way possible, making waves in domestic and global media, so that the whole world knows their star runner won an obviously rigged race.\n\nIf the CCP wanted a propaganda piece, surely you'd think they would do it slightly more tactfully, no?\n\nCheating at races in China is nothing new. Hundreds of runners were disqualified for cheating at a Shenzhen marathon. State sponsored cheating is nothing new.\n\nThe whole thing was incompetently done and I'm sure they werent expected.to be so blatant about losing.\n\nBut keep trying to justify other ridiculous assumptions\n\n“African runners”. NYPost always doing the most. 🙁\n\nFor sure it should be investigated and action taken but we also don’t know if runners were in any physical danger had they not done what they did.\n\nBoth Ethiopian and Kenyan runners were involed and I guess that title would be a bit long and not so snappy\n\nDon’t see anyone referring to “European runners” anywhere in any context.\n\nWhats wrong with calling them African runners lol\n\n&gt;if runners were in any physical danger had they not done what they did\n\nOr at least in the \"Arrested for possession of something in your bag you've never seen before in an autocratic country\" type of danger.\n\nWhich in some asian countries (including china unless they stopped doing so very recently) is very much equivalent to 'being executed' danger. Though I doubt they'd go so far just to temporarily prop up one of their athletes.\n\nWhat's wrong with this? Can't anyone choose to lose on purpose in a race if they want to? Not trying to joke I actually don't know\n\nThen why start in a competition? Run on your own.\n\nCuz Bejing paid them to enter and lose?\n\nWhats wrong with Chinese officials paying off the East African runners to lose?\n\n[removed]\n\nI don't like the NY Post more than anyone, but we also have a video we're seeing with our eyes. It's not sinophobic to watch that video and be like \"weird!\"\n\nIt was reported on Chinese news sites first... and almost every other news website has a mention of it now.\n\n🤣🤣🤣 blame the media for reporting this bizarre finish."

    "title": "What's your running epiphany after decades of running?",
    "body": "My epiphany has been lazy glutes (see context below). What's yours?\n\nI've been running for about a decade (marathon in 2015, tons of half marathons and 10ks before and after). I consider myself a decent runner, PR pace for half \\~7:50/mile and PR pace for 10K \\~7:40/mile.  \nBUT, I just learned something significant. I've had lazy glutes all this time. When running or doing strength work, my glute muscles basically only ever engage when they have to. Which causes excess strain on quads, hams, knees, calves, low back....basically everything. And I've just started to more mindfully engage the glutes both while running, dynamic warm ups, and strength training. It's night and day. It'll require a little training up, but I'm sure it'll help me speed up a bit as well as avoid unnecessary injuries and tightness.\n\nEDIT:  \nSince a lot of questions have been asked how to engage glutes, [Here's a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNwDEZTFx7o&amp;t=28s).  \nAs for me personally, I've benefited from flexing squeezing glute muscles when I'm running, walking, stairs, etc. And during dynamic warmup movements. And, especially, during strength training. And I go slower in strength training and really focus mindfully on glute engagement/squeezing - sometimes placing my hands there so I can feel it engage (both glute maximus and, especially, glute medius)  \nYou'll know it's working because your glutes will get a lot more sore. And your other muscles will feel better because they arent working as hard.",

    "all_comment_text": "Running is a gift.  After 50 years of running, 35 marathons and 2 ultras, the arthritis in my (M73) knees has developed to the point where more than 8 or 10 miles is too painful to continue.  My racing days are now behind me and I am having trouble maintaining 50 mile weeks.  In my future I can see more walking and less running.  The problem is, I hate walking.  I love this sport and honestly thought it would last forever.  Be advised, it may not.\n\n[removed]\n\nIt manifests itself as pain in the joint, in my case, the knees.  As I continue to run, the pain builds.  I'm at the point where 12 miles is about all I can handle, pain-wise.  It also tends to accumulate over time.  If I run two or three days in a row, it reaches the pain level sooner on succeeding days.  This results in me often running 2 days and taking a day off.  When not running, the joint stiffens after inaction.  You should see me try to take the first few steps after sitting for 10 or 20 minutes.  I walk like an old man.  🤣.  I have less stiffness when I rest more, but again, there is always some.\n\nThe irony in all of this is, my knee doc tells me movement is beneficial in retarding the progression of the arthritis.  It won't stop it from getting worse, but it will slow it down.  In my case, walking is better than running in that it hurts much less, but still retards the progression.\n\nYour knees have had a hell of a run.. literally!\n\nKudos\n\nMy dad is exactly your same age, and arthritis completly messed mainly his ankles &amp; feet , to the point where walking more than 1km\\~ without some rest (and using canes to support himself) is already pushing it big time\n\nHe also keeps walking everyday because he knows the moment he fully stops, he's not getting back up again. Shitty thing to have for sure (and I probably inherited it, considering it runs in the whole family 😑)\n\nKeep on going man, you got a internet stranger cheering for you - and don't let the decay get to your head too much in the bad days, that's probably the worst part of it all\n\nPlease tell your dad, one old guy to another, I admire his pluck.  He sounds exactly like the kind of guy I'd like to know.  I wish him well and you good luck in the future.\n\nIt really sounds like a damned if you damned if you don't scenario. Also sounds like symptoms of overuse for a younger person, which after some light days would self-resolve, except that this doesn't and won't. Damn.\n\nWhen do you get new knees and run into your 90s pain free?\n\ngod I feel this so much. I was running over 80km per week on a good week, maintaining fitness. Then I developed Ulcerative Colitis and, long story short, can't run for more than 15 minutes before pooping myself. I'm 31 and running was the only excercise i ever enjoyed consistently. What i'd give to go on a long run again.\n\nIm moving into hiking. The hills and technical terrain mean even if i COULD run if probably walk those anyway as the risks of a face plant or snake bite are just too high 😂\n\nA post I can relate to. 75m been running 50 years and finally facing reality about the restrictions that come with age. I love running but marathons are too hard on my body. For now I can still enjoy a half and there is no need to  run over 10 miles training.\n\nIm sure you already know this, but you are blessed and your work has put you in **much** better health than the vast majority of people your age. I regularly see patients 10-20 years younger than you that can barely walk due to excess weight and lack of exercise.\n\nMy love of running has allowed me to deal with all the maintenance it takes to stay in good health. The last 5 years have been a struggle but I'm finally running without restriction having had a radical prostatectomy and a phlebolith fixed in my leg last year. I've been able to run 2 10k's and a half this year and feeling as strong as ever.\n\nCan you bike with your knee? Cycling will keep you fit and is less wearing and impact on the joints.\n\nI try to be stoic in life, and my general mantra for running is to be greatful that I *can* run, remember all the people who can no longer run, remember times I was injured,  and that one day I too will be forced to join them, just be greatful that today is not that day.\n\nBy extension, every race is a celebration of fitness. \n\nGratitude is a nice way to frame it, I think.\n\nNo matter how experienced you are, some days are just tougher than others, and that's OK.\n\nAlso, never risk your physical health to run, I know it can be somewhat of an addiction, and for some, a gauge of how ready for action they are. If anything feels off, if there is pain, stop and rest. Don't push yourself, or you will set yourself back way further than the 1 or 2 days of extra rest you would have taken.\n\nYES. This is my biggest lesson learned over my past two years running. Made lots of progress, 9 weeks into a marathon training block, and started to feel some knee/leg pain. Ignored it for the next few runs as it got progressively worse. That was 9 weeks ago and am now slowly rehabbing a hamstring injury and volunteering at the marathon this Sunday that I was supposed to race 🙃\n\nThis is exactly it, I've thought \"oh it's nothing,\" \"it'll stop hurting once im warmed up and stretched out,\" or \"I'll just push through the pain.\"\n\nIf these are thoughts even crossing your mind, you probably should take an extra day and see how it feels tomorrow. Keep doing that until it feels good.\n\nThank you. I needed to read this today.\n\nThe pain in my ankle is thanking you.\n\nThis advice is real.\n\nI ran with a virus over Thanksgiving last year, the signs were all there that I should have been resting... ended up having my immune system attack my peripheral nervous system, which turned into GBS.  1 week in hospital and lots of PT and recovery, finally back...\n\nDon’t blame yourself for the GBS! That shit just happens and resting probably wouldn’t have helped you avoid it.\n\nDon't beat yourself up over this. The run probably contributed little if anything at all to the situation.\n\nYes so true. I ended up getting shingles a few weeks before my first half marathon. I was out for a week or so. I thought it was going to set my progress back. But when I felt well enough to get back on it, I felt just as good if not better.\n\nI had this issue when I first started. I ran until I physically couldn’t. Then it would make me depressed and feel sluggish. \n\nThen I learned to take care of my self and my injuries and never run when I’m in pain. \n\nAlthough I did run 8 miles with a blister. And now I have a blister on top of a blister lol.\n\nThat last paragraph it’s important but unfortunately seems to come with experience. The difference between being ‘sore’ or being in ‘pain’. Not a huge runner but do a lot of strength training which is where I picked it up. The difference between for want of a better term, the burn and “that hurt, I’m not warmed up enough and need to stop” can take time to learn\n\nMy calves were dead from a hike over the weekend, and I tried to run last night because I couldn't quite the \"need to run\" voice. Guess who strained a muscle 5 minutes in. 😣\n\nGreat life advice in general is if you have to force something you'll probably break it.\n\nUgh. I was just in total denial about a sore ankle. Ran anyway and made things so much worse. I should have reminded myself of this first. I heard this on a running podcast- your heart and lungs can ramp up so much faster than your joints. Pay attention to nagging pain.\n\nListen to this person folks. I went from 30 miles a week to 55 miles a week within a month. Ended up tearing my hamstring playing a sport because everything was so tight. Haven’t run seriously since then, and that was 11 months ago\n\nOnce you've got some experience, run your races by feel. Belatedly realized that I held back too much because I worried about going out too hard. Once I stopped checking my watch, I started hitting PRs again.\n\nI didn't check my heart rate my entire first marathon and was doing great. Mile 22 I folded tho.\n\nMile 20-22 tends to be right where people run out of muscle glycogen and bonk. Proper fueling helps avoid that.\n\nI was pacing a friend to a sub-20 5K the other day. I'm not much faster but maybe like 18:30-18:45 fitness level, and I just dialed it back and cruised a bit to hit a 19:20 by feel. Most enjoyable run I've ever done. It was a huge race with 10,000 people right before the Boston Marathon and just being able to enjoy the crowds was so fun.\n\nAgree 100% Best races the ones where I don't/barely look the watch\n\nSame is true for me even in workouts. If I'm looking at my watch a lot, it probably means I'm either struggling, not mentally into it, or my pacing needs work. If I'm hardly looking at my watch, usually none of those things are true.\n\nI like to come out a bit faster than target pace and then adjust from there depending on how I would feel. It's fast enough that I can pursue a PR if feeling good, but not fast enough that I'll bonk should I realize I need to slow things down a tad thereafter.\n\nAlso, when you've done enough race-specific workouts (or simply races at that distance), it's easier to realize if and when you would feel good enough to pursue a better time relative to how those efforts felt. All those little experience points help.\n\nI'm so much happier when I'm only competing against my own goals and expectations. I only share my pace/distance when asked, and I don't care if the other person is or isn't impressed by it.\n\nI am American but track pace in Metric units for simplicity and find that telling colleagues I ran a 5:00/km pace is basically equivalent to saying I matched the air-speed velocity of an unladen Swallow\n\nEnglish or African Swallow?\n\nI don’t know that.\n\nAAAAHHHHhhhhhh……\n\nKilometres go by faster than miles! \n\nThat running slow is okay. Aka jogging, the dirty word.\n\nEffing Strava!\n\nFor the strava conscious,  set your strava to show \"only me\" and then share the runs you want to share. Then keep your, warm ups, cool downs, easy runs, strength work, yoga private. \n\nYou don't need to tell the world everything you do. \n\nI'm looking at you, guy who shares their 500m jog to the start of parkrun.\n\nHonestly, deleting it entirely was such a relief and felt like taking back running as a \"me\" thing. If I'm only gonna share the good days, it's no better than the highlight reel bullshit people post on the rest of social media. But like you said, the world doesn't need to know everything you do and it's not good for your mental health to share it all. Besides, nobody's actually paying attention to all your statistics on Strava, so it's kinda pointless from the start. I don't miss it.\n\nThere's some good things about it. I'm heading on a brewery run tonight because I saw someone did it last month and commented. \n\nBut it doesn't need to control how you run.\n\nYeah, I mean there's some good things about it, but I personally think it's a net negative like all social media (I realize the irony of posting that on social media). I have a long rant about Strava in particular, but it's not the thread for that one lol.\n\nI’m just sharing an alternative pov: I don’t use Strava as social media at all. To me it’s basically a personal running log.\n\nThat's what my Garmin connect is for, so all I really got out of Strava was the downsides. Much happier back in my own little bubble of statistics and self comparison.\n\nMakes sense. I just started using a Garmin and Garmin Connect does make Strava mostly redundant to me as well.\n\nI feel exactly the same way. I started running for me and somewhere along the way, I was running so I could make a witty title, “performing” when I should have been “training”, keeping up with jones type behavior that ultimately led to some injuries. I realize this isn’t everyone, but after I deleted it I found out I missed just running for me. There some things I miss about it, but yeah, overall it’s a net negative for me.\n\nTo each their own.  I'm very happy posting my slow runs and recovery runs.  With me and my friends we're mostly just trying to get out there.  Everyone has different abilities, but we encourage ourselves and one another to try to be active as much as possible.  We've got busy jobs and kids.  Even a 20 minute jog is an accomplishment sometimes.  \n\nSeeing my buddies sneak a workout in or get fitter is super motivating to me.  Or seeing them fight back into a routine after a long break.  I've fallen out of the running game a few times the last decade, but Strava has helped me find my way back\n\nI kind of love it when I post a bunch of 10:00/mile pace runs on strava and then in my races I beat the times of people who post a bunch of sub 8:00/mile pace runs. I actually enjoy my recovery run days and those other people are just running hard and in pain all the time. Then when it comes to race day I'm faster. It feels great.\n\nI’ll be running what I think is a 6min pace. Then look on Strava to find out I’m running a 8:30. I hate Strava 😔\n\nIs jogging hated?\n\nI dislike it because it’s often used to dunk on slower runners. IMO there’s no reason to put someone down who is doing the same mileage at a slower pace by insinuating they’re not a runner yet. \n\nalso joggers seem to find the most dead bodies.\n\nI’m at a loss as to the difference between running and jogging lol.\n\nIt's just gatekeeping. It'd be like the elite 4-5 min mile runners telling 8 min mile runners they aren't running. Pace is relevant to experience and your own body's capability. Some people just get off on being faster than other people I guess?\n\nJogging is a form/type of running. Such as sprinting.\n\nexactly.  There's no difference.  So there's really no such thing as \"jogging.\"\n\nJoggers and dog walkers!\n\nI’m both and am yet to find a single dead body. Not sure if I feel lucky or ripped off tbh\n\nMinus the dead body bit, i am definitely a jogger then\n\nI run slowly - with a dog.\nI’m amazed I have never found a single dead body.\n\nHaven’t found a dead body yet. Must not be jogging slow enough\n\nI think it’s more that people mentally struggle that they don’t have to be going full blast every run in order to progress.\n\nMy friend was going for a zone 2 run recently and some old guy yelled at her as she passed something like ‘you’re slow, surely you can go faster, even I could’ . \n\nWhat a fuck\n\nlol - what a jerk - anyhow I’m 53 only been running 6-7 years- I steadily run 9 1/2 minute miles - have done plenty of 8 minute miles - I was obsessed for awhile with not letting younger runners pass me - I’ve gotten over that - don’t want to get hurt - any pace is good as long as you are moving\n\n\"come on then, only another 10 miles to go!\" Is the obvious answer.\n\nLol I feel more people these days just mindlessly repeat the opposite today. Everything is \"zone 2\". No, you're not going to magically become faster if you only run in zone 2\n\nI believe it's a soft \"j\"\n\nAgreed! I spent the first 5 yrs. trying everything I could to get faster and never could. Now I've just changed my perspective and don't even care about how fast I am anymore. I'm just proud of myself for doing it at any speed. I do hate it when the app puts a turtle next to my run time though.\n\n[removed]\n\nI use Runtastic, which is now Adidas Running. I only ever wanted an app to tell me when I hit mile markers, so that one worked fine for me.\n\nStairmaster helps me cut time off my mile time pretty consistently\n\nSo true. When I first started, I couldn’t even jog a city block. As I developed, I was focused on how fast I could run a mile for whatever reason so I would be gassed at one mile. My friend said he never worries about pace and only goes for distance. I then tried just going slow and was able to go 4 miles. Hard to imagine not having that mindset, but as a beginner, I hadn’t really thought about it initially lol.\n\nNot only is it “okay”, it is highly recommended and necessary.\n\nGetting fit to run instead of running to get fit especially as I age and into my fourth decade of running\n\nThe ultimate truth for me\n\nAs a running coach I’m convinced that around 95% of runners that end up needing to go to a physio (not necessarily injured) have weak glutes. All strength work is not created equally and most people do not have dominant glutes over quads without really training glutes. I’d go so far to say that every lower body compound lift (lunges, squats and deadlifts for example) should be glute focused otherwise the already dominant muscle groups will continue to pick up the slack.\nInjuries happen when there are muscle dysfunctions.\n\nMakes perfect sense. Hence the ephiphany for me, ha. With all those moves, the quads and hamstrings are forced to work, but the glutes can get by with low/moderate effort. But if we really focus on the glutes (squeeze them throughout the whole range of motion) it’s really noticeable how much less work the quads and hams are doing.\n\nHow do I engage my glutes more when running?  I'm primarily a lifter just getting into running, and my glutes are glorious\n\nAlways stay clenched.\n\nAn easy change to make (if you’re not doing it already) is in the swing phase, drive with your heel coming up towards the sky and your toes facing the ground in plantarflexion, as opposed to your toes facing forwards in dorsiflexion. Pulling your foot up behind you will engage your hamstrings and glutes. A large percentage of runners just shuffle and barely pick their feet up, which is all in the quads and calves.\n\nThis is a good explanation \nhttps://youtu.be/Mu0ZwKKL4dI?si=pW8VunVdFU_JrHZd\n\nthanks for this - I'm definitely a shuffle runner.\n\nPretend that you're holding a credit card in your butt crack. It's a funny visual, but it works.\n\nI just started running and self-learning. I mean, the whole run?\n\n[Principles of Natural Running with Dr. Mark Cucuzzella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIDRHUWlVo)\n\n+1 and will add Split Squats, Reverse Nordics, and Reverse Hypers if you have access\n\nThoughts on tibialis training?\n\n Tabialis I got you.\n tap your toes to songs thinking about bass drum kicking the beat. And pulling your toes up as high as you can between beats. They will burn in 20 sec. and you will not be able to get through any rock song, gareenteed\n\nWhat at home glute exercises do you recommend? I do a lot of banded hip walks for my weak hips but I don't do much for glutes. I assume squats help a lot but I don't get to an actual gym very often.\n\nGlute dominant lunges are great. On YouTube there are a few demonstrations. A glute dominant lunge is more of a hinge in the hips and keeping your knee from going over your toe vs a regular lunge where your torso would be more upright and you drive your knee over the direction of your toe.\nGlute bridges/hip thrusts in all variations are great for building glute strength, as are glute hyper extensions.\n\nThe way a physio or sports therapist would test for underactive glutes is to get you to go through a range of movements and see if your surrounding muscle groups like your lower back and hamstrings switch on first. In a lot of people glutes just don’t switch on at all, so very simple exercises can and should feel really challenging at first.\n\nIMO way too many people focus on going heavy with weights but aren’t thinking about what muscles are actually working. Sure, you can squat 1.5 bodyweight, but are you reinforcing existing imbalances or are you correcting them? \nI tend to peel everything back so to speak and really get down to the fine details in small movements and that’s where the biggest improvements are. Then we go heavier and more powerful.\n\nNot decades. Running sucks. Not being able to run sucks more.\n\n“I hate running, but I hate not running more”\n\nIt’s weird to think a lot of you run but hate it lol. That really sucks. I absolutely love running and will for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm new to running but I absolutely love it. I go at my own pace, though. I think that's the most important part. I'm not competing, or training for anything special. I just want to feel good, and running is helping me achieve that, but if my knees feel off, or if I'm sick, I'm staying home. No sense risking a long-term complication over it.\n\nYep.  Had months being laid up with back injuries.  That gets me out of bed on days I don’t want to run.  \n\nSitting in pain in a recliner wishing I could walk much less run gives me a new perspective.\n\nNoooo! Running is awesome, learn to slow run, it completely changed my view on running.\n\nThis is the answer 👍\n\nBeing able to run is better than being able to run fast.\n\nSpeaking as someone who has been on crutches several times.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMy favorite marathon I've ever run was a year that I was signed up for the Chicago marathon but got injured in the spring. I was back to pain free running by mid summer and I did do the training long runs, but I had a very bad/low mileage training block due to the injury recovery.\n\nSo my goal for the marathon was just to run slow and try not to re-injure myself. I did the whole marathon at my regular long run pace and I crossed the finish line feeling great. It's the only time in a marathon where I've crossed the finish line thinking I could probably run a few more miles if I needed to. It was such a fun race.\n\nStrength training is essential if you want to keep running as you get older. \n\nJust running is not enough to keep you running.\n\nThat's facts. 53yo male ultra runner here, and I can attest. My endurance and injury resistance has improved as I've deliberately focused on strength training.\n\nWhat exercises are helping?\n\nDaily routine - even at the office - is just doing body weight exercises like push ups, flutter kicks, clam shells, air squats. I do have a set of dumbbells at work for curls. A few minutes everyday. I also love,love,love dead lifts. I have a bar and plates at home. I don't lift heavy like I used to, just heavy enough to remain strong and maintain muscle. It's a great exercise. I'm using a weight vest once or twice a week now as well, incorporating rucks into my weekly routine. Oh, and protein. Lots of protein :)\n\nYeah I mix in 2 CrossFit workouts and a yoga class per week into my regular running routine.   Injuries drastically down and flexibility way way up! 43M\n\nDon’t be a slave to the watch.\n\nI fall into this trap when I’m trying to hit a goal. Takes me out of my body and my experience. I think part of it is it’s the one thing for my mind to think on; I don’t run with music or audiobooks or podcasts. But I know you’re right! Thanks for the reminder.\n\nGetting out the door is the hardest and worst part. If I would just put the gear on and get out the door, my body just kind of does the rest. And I’m always, always, glad I went for a run.\n\nAs someone who is currently dressed to run, just had a cup of coffee and oatmeal, and is now sitting on the couch reading Reddit instead of going on the (relatively easy) run I have planned, I feel so validated that I'm not the only one who feels this way. Like you, once I'm out there it's fine, and I'm always happy I went for a run afterwards.\n\nI'm going to put my shoes on now and go, this has motivated me.  🤘🤘🤘\n\nDon’t ever trust a fart after mile 11.\n\nDon’t ignore an injury or pain because you are afraid to lose gains.  If you don’t take care of it now you will need to take a lot more time off later because you will have made things worse. \n\nStrength training is the foundation of everything\n\nIn October '22 I did my version of the \"[10,000 Kettlebell Swing Challenge](https://forums.t-nation.com/t/the-10-000-swing-kettlebell-workout/283408)\" where you do 500 swings a day, 2 days on, 1 day off, for a month for a total of ... oh ... 10,000 kettlebell swings (I used a 24kg bell).\n\nManaged it, didn't see the miraculous transformations that others have reported (dropping waist size, massive forearm growth, search for the term and you'll find plenty of reports of people trying it), but I did notice my running times for the 6 months that followed were a good 5% faster than the same months the previous year... and now this year I appear to be a little slower again.\n\nMaybe time for me to hit those glutes again and fire up the spreadsheet to do another 10k swings...\n\nBridges, chair squats and leg lifts or straight up leg day at the gym?\n\nAll the things. I do core, upper body, lower body... muscle mass goes fast when you get older. Then the running is almost nice/extra/bonus on top\n\nPreach.\n\nHow’d you realize that your glutes weren’t engaged ? What did warm up do you do to engage the glutes? I try to engage my glutes when running but I’m not sure if they are engaged or not.\n\nI have a left glute activation issue which presented as sciatic nerve pain in my outer right thigh. Found out what was causing it from going to a sports therapist. They gave me (amongst other things including strength training, which I think is the most important thing) some activations to do before a run which have helped me engage my glutes more:\n\nReverse lunges\n\nClamshells\n\nBanded crab walks\n\nI started off doing sets of 3x8-10 of each of them before every run but that is quite a time commitment 6 times a week, so now I usually just try and do one set of each before easy runs and a bit more if I'm doing speedwork or a long run.\n\nEdit to add: You really need to focus on impeccable form for these activations or it's just a waste of time.  You probably ought to get someone who knows what they're doing watch you and critique your form.\n\nThis all sounds too tricky for me. I just like running. \n\nIf you have an actual injury, the exercises prescribed by the physio will help. \n\n\n\n\nOtherwise no need to overcomplicate things but basic strength training is always a good idea. I just do the basic compounds to build full body strength, nothing \"for runners.\"\n\n[deleted]\n\nFitness that takes months to build leaves you in days to weeks.\n\nTrue, but it also seems to come back a lot quicker than it took initially to build up.\n\nThis. For different reasons, I've had to stop running for a few months this year and in 2022. And both of those times, I've been able to get back into it in a few weeks, as opposed to when I initially began running. \n\nWhen I started running, it took a few  months to manage running for 15 minutes at &lt;10pmh. Now, I can manage that by the second week, even when I took half a year off.\n\nIt depends on your age. I found it really easy to bounce back into shape in my 20s. Now in my late 30s I've put in over 5 years of consistent pretty high mileage running and I'm still slower than I was after hardly any training in my 20s.\n\nMy 5 highest mileage years ever in my life have been the last 5 years, but my most recent race PR was 13 years ago at age 25.\n\nI think studies show that it’s a couple weeks right? Days seems fast\n\nYou don’t lose muscle mass until you haven’t lifted/worked out/trained in 14-21 days. So yes, 2-3 weeks. But muscle memory is very much a thing.\n\nI lost very little strength after taking over a year off from the gym during COVID. \n\n\nWe really don't lose strength that quickly.\n\nIt really doesn't leave that quickly and maintenance requires way less effort than building strength or endurance.\n\nIs tapering bad then?\n\nNot from me but one neighborg that once saw me running told me to enjoy running because once your knees give way, you’re screwed.\n\nMost injuries are due to strength imbalances. As long as runners keep up with their strength training and PT they will be fine. My dad still runs quite fast near age 70.\n\nI've been working on having good form to try and avoid that fate. 6 months later and I'm still working on my form.\n\nJust to back up what you're saying, I had a running gait analysis session recently (an hour with an actual professional, not just at a running shoe shop) and the number one thing he said was that I need to strengthen my glutes to improve my running form, reduce my overstriding, etc. I've not had a chance to put it into practice yet but he knew what he was talking about!\n\nIf your run was absolutely garbage for no apparent reason, you are 100% waking up sick in a day or two 🤧\n\nOr your period is starting next week\n\nYeeeep. If it feels like running on wet cement, the uterus is starting to activate.\n\ncould you share what your warmup looks like to activate your glutes more? i think i need that too !\n\nWhat I’ve found is it’s more mental than anything. \nSo for warmups I do the typical stuff, leg swings, lunges, calf raises, high knees, squats. But what I’ve started to do different is hyper focus on glute activation with each movement. Because the laziness is simply that there isn’t the mind-body connection for the glutes to engage.\n(The way I think of it, they’re just hanging out letting the quads and hamstrings do all the work. So I have to intentionally force them to also participate ha. So it’s like I’m a manager of the muscle groups. Most muscles I don’t really have to manage, but I have to micromanage the glutes)\n\nDon’t take health and your ability to do any miles for granted\n\nI'm not running decades, just on and off a few years and have done a few half marathons and a marathon but setting Strava to private and setting my runs to 'only me' was the best decision I made in awhile.\n\nYou can enjoy the mini wins of finishing a tough run you weren't feeling that day without comparing yourself to others. Plus you can do genuine 'recovery' runs 😂\n\nI don't need a goal to work towards, I can just run to run.\n\nwalking a bit doesn’t mean your workout is ruined. still, I resist it until after the damage is done most often.\n\nIncreasing volume is what’s gonna get me faster for a longer duration.\n\nNot quite an epiphany but after nearly 20 years of running in any old socks, a couple years ago my husband bought me some fancy expensive ones, and I swear it’s a whole other level of “running on clouds.”\n\nSame went for when I got my first pair of proper running shoes in my now go-to brand/drop/size combo, rather than just running in my everyday walking and gym shoes. Which sadly also took me…I think over a decade.\n\nAny recommendations for socks?? I recently picked up Balegas and I love them.\n\nInjinji, they're toe socks for running.  Weird at first, but then you never want to go back.  They allow your toes to spread out more, which just feels nicer when running.\n\nMy body really doesn't want me doing it.\n\nThat i hate running outside in the cold and that’s okay\n\nI've been seeing so many treadmill hate memes and videos, saying people who don't get out in all weather are missing out. \nMan, it's winter where I live 6+ months per year. I'll do a handful of runs in extreme cold / wind / icy conditions. But I have fallen on ice and hit my head way too many times. I don't need another concussion from running in stupid conditions. I will happily treadmill on those days!\n\nAgreed! The treadmill isnt the best I get it but in the winter I don’t mind it. I am from the northeast, but I still cannot BEAR the cold. As crazy as it sounds, I’d much rather be hot than cold. Shivering when i step out the house and before I can warm up is just purely dreadful to me. I’ve tried many times running in the snow, in the windchill, etc but I can never get used to it unfortunately. One pro is that it’s true, you do run faster. Probably because you’re so numb from the cold that you don’t feel the pain as much lol\n\nHere’s why I’m not missing out on outside running when I get on my treadmill: I am *extremely* self conscious about my physical self. Always have been. I didn’t start trying to be fit until I was 30 because of it. If I am where people can see me, I don’t give it my best. I don’t pay attention to my form or my pulse or how I feel aside from embarrassed, and I quit every time. Bought a treadmill, and I’m on it almost every day and I finally feel good.\n\nSame here.  Minnesota winters mean if I want to run outside in the winter, it's lots of running in the dark and ice.  It's not the cold for me, I'd just rather not fall and hurt myself.  I don't need ankle surgery again, thanks.\n\nIf I'm doing a really long run and can get out during daylight on the weekend, and the sidewalks look decent, I'll go.  Otherwise I just find a good Netflix show and treadmill it.\n\nInteresting! How cold? I live in US Midwest, and I love the 30-50 range. Once it gets into 60+ my runs are less enjoyable.\n\nI think 50s can be okay but anything below that i really hate. It just ends up feeling like a chore. Running in moderate-warmer temperatures is just overall enjoyable for me.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf you’re running somewhere nice/with a great view, you’re allowed to stop and enjoy it.\n\nQuitting all sugar was the best thing I have ever done for my running.\n\nOnly about a decade for me, but that strength training makes you a better runner lol\n\nI recently came to a similar realization and have found that changing my gait to really emphasize tempo over stride has helped a lot in this department.\n\nWhat do you mean with tempo over stride?\n\nSame here, I have slowly increased my cadence from 156 to 180, and now running feels easier, and even though my steps are shorter, I'm actually faster.\n\ncadence is same as tempo. you also have discovered that you're faster with higher cadence (tempo) at 180 with shorter strides (steps). this is a key to running more efficiently, good job!\n\nSmaller stride, faster cadence.\n\nMany hands make light work\n\nThat running is just about keeping it up. Your heart rate, your morale, your desire to finish, your pride, your resilience, your V02 max, your will to run again when you're sore and tired, your hydration and appetite, everything. Not about speed or times, just about not stopping.\n\nI've been running for about a year but never made any progress because of shin splints that come back after any sort of speed session. Just had the same exact realisation about my glutes and really hope that will make a difference\n\nI had this problem when I went from not running at all to trying to run 5 times a week while training for an half. Also ignoring the fact that some runs really need to be easy runs. Shin splits, injuries, burn out. Then I didn’t run for a couple of years. For my most recent half, I set a low and realistic goal and picked a training plan that had me running 3 times a week. No injuries, sustainable training. I’ll be running 4 times a week now. \n\nThere is a reason that all those running zones exist, so use a HR monitor if you want to get faster. The art of it, is applying them correctly to your training if you want to improve. Regardless of your distance (ignore short track), zone 2 is your friend most the week. even do z1 for recovery runs. Speed training should be a small part of weekly mileage. \n\nYou then apply z3 lightly is a bit of a nothing zone for benefitting your general speed. If you are training for marathon distance you want more z4 speed training fot the speed training element, and under that distance a proportionate amount of z4 &amp; 5.\n\nMarathon training doesn’t necessarily make your overall speed slower. I PB’d in the 5k/10k/10m 3 weeks out in races because it’s a strength event, I then took another nearly 16 minutes off my marathon to get a 3:03 marathon time in London. I was so strict in with zones so leave the ego as the door and run to your HR zones.\n\nI also hated running at one point because I was spent all the time but loved it again when I went out for easy runs as they weren’t so taxing.\n\nDo gym work once a week to keep you injury free and strong. There has to be progressive overload like with running, so change it up. Do weights, especially to improve 5k and 10k times. \n\nMileage is your friend if you can hack it. 5k upwards you benefit from time on your feet. Obviously you need to make sure it’s in proportionate to whether you’re a true speedster runner vs an endurance monster. I’m an endurance one so I need more miles as that’s where my running strength lies - even in a 5k - but I wouldn’t be busting out marathon mileage either.\nI could go on as I’ve tried as tested everything and 9 years on I’m stronger than ever, but won’t bore anyone further!\n\nI can run any way I like. I don't have to have \"a goal\", I don't have to follow \"a program\", I don't have to time my runs and actively work to get faster or run longer. I can simply run, just for fun and good health. \n\nI don't have to do a single HIIT session, I don't have to run intervals at all, I don't have to do long runs, I don't have do \"hill work\" or \"drills\", and I most certainly do not have to sign up for races or log my workouts on strava for the world to see. \n\nI can simply run, however I like it.\n\n30 years in here. That all these data points and metrics are completely unnecessary to a decently successful running career and may actually be detrimental to many people.\n\nStop running on concrete/asphalt. I only go on dirt, grass, sand or track, I feel less tired, less joint pain, less pain overall and my recovery is much faster.\n\nAsphalt is better than concrete\n\nFellow lazy glutes runner here. And the worst part is that I'm a Physiotherapist!! (Don't worry, I worked in Hand/Upper Limb therapy for most of my career, I wasn't passing my bad habits off to patients!)\n\nFinally got tired of being such a slow runner and looked properly into my mechanics. I'm tall and I tend to over-stride a LOT, while my glutes and hamstrings are just chilling back there doing not much at all. Even just thinking to myself \"push your hips forward\" while I'm running helps a lot. I'm still slow but it's getting better!\n\nOP, are you on Instagram? You might like to follow David Grey (@davidgreyrehab). He's an Irish physio and posts lots of fantastic hip exercises that actually work. Sooooo many people spend soooooo much time doing clamshells, banded crab walks etc and it's not necessarily super-effective. Get hinge-ing, folks!\n\nAwesome, yea I notice shorter strides when engaging glutes. Also, it helps to lift the knees a bit more. \nI saw a video a while back that showed that lifting knees and feet more off the ground actually ends up requiring less effort. And it’s a more naturally glute engaging motion.\n\nI'd like to say I've learned not to run through pain or run injured. But the hip bursitis keeping me sidelined for months tells me I've learned nothing. \n\nOTOH, I'm also learning the elliptical machine at the gym is harder than it looks, at least in the beginning.\n\nStrava is a net negative for a lot of people. People either care about your runs or they don't. If they don't care, it's pointless to share. If they do care or even if you just think they care, it creates a pressure to be more consistent or faster than you can realistically be. It makes the good days a little better, but it makes the bad days a lot worse. I was able to deal with the ebb and flow of training significantly better once I deleted it. And I can't even imagine how bad it would've been with the injury I'm dealing with now. \n\nOn a more positive note, it took me 20 years of running to learn to enjoy speed and threshold days. Yeah, they suck. But they work. And I can coast on the high of nailing a tough workout all day.\n\nI started enjoying Strava and started using it a lot more once I found out how to not share my runs with anybody else. It's great for tracking runs, looking at data, planning routes (and taking inspiration on routes from prior runs), etc. The sharing element is completely irrelevant to me.\n\nI also deal with this issue, would love to learn how you are approaching the issue in more depth.\n\nMind body connection basically. Really focusing the mind on squeezing the glutes while running and working out and walking. \nIt makes a HUGE difference. What I’ve found is that the other muscle groups are forced to engage, but the glutes are more passive. \nWhen we mentally focus on engaging the glutes, it makes all the other muscles work less.\nTry doing basic body weight stuff (squats, lunges, clamshells). Go quite slow and focus fully on engaging the glutes. Let the other muscles handle themselves. I bet you’ll notice an immediate difference.\n\nRunning is the secret that is hidden in plain sight. It enriches your life so much. I think long time runners can attest to just how much it changes everything.\n\nOnce you experience the endorphins high, you get addicted to running\n\nI no longer enjoy it, so I don’t. \nSad truth, but my decades of endurance running are behind me. I had fun. I ran far, but I never ran fast.\n\nI love running when I run with my dad. I run every day and still find joy from it, but it doesn’t compare to running with my dad. \n\nI had this epiphany not too long ago, and have so much to say.\n\nThe first mile is a liar, and getting out the door is sometimes the hardest part. On days where I'm tired or just not that into running I try to force myself to at least make it through one mile. Before deciding to turn around. Sometimes that whole mile sucks, but once I start warming up usually I'll keep going.\n\nRest days are necessary.\n\nThe importance of good shoes. I know, it should be (and is) obvious. But I’m a cheapskate and often don’t like buying new things until I feel I’ve truly worn out the old.\n\nI put about 900 miles on my last pair of Mizunos, which don’t have much support to begin with compared to some other brands. Every time I tried to start stretching out my mileage, I’d get leg pain cropping up. I finally got disgusted enough to pull the trigger on a new pair of Brooks, and my goodness, what a game-changer!\n\nTo anybody out there as dumb as me: BUY THE DAMN SHOES!\n\nMy epiphany: no one cares. \n\n\nNo one cares that you're running 10 min/mi or 6 min/mi.\n\n\nNo one cares that you're at mile 10 of a long run.\n\n\nIt's liberating \n\nWhat are you doing for your glutes?\n\nMind body connection basically. Really focusing the mind on squeezing the glutes while running and working out and walking. It makes a HUGE difference. What I’ve found is that the other muscle groups are forced to engage, but the glutes are more passive. When we mentally focus on engaging the glutes, it makes all the other muscles work less. Try doing basic body weight stuff (squats, lunges, clamshells). Go quite slow and focus fully on engaging the glutes. Let the other muscles handle themselves. I bet you’ll notice an immediate difference.\n\nIt is easier to run far if you try and keep your form similar to sprinting. I got yelled at by a coach to sprint in the middle of like a 8-9 mile ct and it fixed my form instantly.\n\nThe pants/shorts dividing line is around 50 degrees F. And gloves when it drops below 45.\n\nSame! I've only been running for seven years (and the first three don't really count to me - I was basically on-and-off going through C25K on repeat with months in between) but after starting pilates just over a year ago, and now some weight training as well, I'm finally understanding what it means to use your glutes on the run. Not only does it give me a nice little boost in speed, but I also feel like it's easier to breathe - probably because engaging the posterior chain results in opening up my torso.\n\nWow - I’m so glad this post came across my feed. I know how important rest days are, but sometimes I tend to be stubborn. These past few weeks I’ve been extremely tired but still trying to push myself in my runs. I just woke up getting ready to head to the gym and after reading some comments have decided to lay back down and sleep in. I have a race on Saturday and I know my body will thank me just for resting.\n\nLearning to run slow was an epiphany for me. Running used to just be about exercise; something that had to be endured. Every run was done hard. The I discovered slow easy  running and running has become something that I actually enjoy. Running slow has increased both my distance and my speed on race day. \n\nNow my easy runs are faster than my hard efforts used to be."

    "all_comment_text": "\"She took up running after joining Bhutan's army. She won the Bhutan marathon last year and this year, clocking 3 hours and 26 minutes in March, and came second in 2022 in the Snowman Race, an extreme event covering 203 km (126 miles) through the Himalayan mountains.\"\n\n3:26 in the Buthan Marathon is quite a feat. But 203 km in the Himalayas... I doubt many of the participants would survive that. \n\nShe is definitely an ultrarunner, and that's a different skill set. My type of runner :)\n\nThat's the type of stories that attract me about running. The share willpower, not wanting to give up agaisnt all odds.\n\nKudos Lhamo!!\n\nThat Snowman race is Barkley Marathons type numbers and maybe even more gruelling! What an extreme runner.\n\nHow did she qualify for the Olympics with those times, though? Doesn’t a specific threshold need to be met? I thought it was around sub 2:27 or so for women.\n\nBecause it is by country, not by world time\n\nAh. So that sub 2:27 would have been my country’s specified standard to qualify for consideration, not a global requirement?\n\nI was wondering this too.  Basically, a country is allowed to send one athlete to an event even if they don't meet the qualification standard.  This allowed to ensure greater participation from smaller countries.\n\nThanks for the explanation on how she got in.\n\nGreat story too and the 203K through the Himalayas is crazy.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n“Under the Universality rule, any NOC without a qualified athlete or relay team will be permitted to send the highest-ranked male or highest-ranked female athlete to either of the following individual events, namely the 100 m, 800 m, or the marathon.”\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics_–_Qualification\n\nI think this was the reason that the Solomon Islands sent their best marathon runner to compete in the 100m at the Olympics, as there were no spots left to compete in the marathon and only 100m option remaining.\n\nThanks for this\n\nYou’ve gotta win the heat you’re in to progress towards the final race. And each country conducts its own heat.\n\nSo if you’re in a country that has a lot of talent you might not qualify for your country. But if you’re in a country with a dearth of talent your odds of being selected go up.\n\nCross posting from my comment in r/Olympics: \n\nI was one of 2-3 spectators who started running alongside Kingzang around the 36k mark. At that point there were was no media present and a stretch of very little crowd support. Most people who were around were just waiting for the course to open up and cross the street.\n\nIt was getting so freaking hot and she was struggling. Despite having to pack and check out of my hotel, as a fellow runner I made a split decision to just start following her to give support.\n\nA few bicyclists joined in, then a handful runners who were just out for their daily jog as well. As she continued spectators along the rail started offering their own personal water bottles (which she accepted a few times between walking breaks).\n\nAs shown by the cameras, by the 40k mark we went from dozens to hundreds -- it was a spontaneous international parade of strangers all with the sole purpose of supporting her to the finish. When she started running again after walking for several minutes we all went NUTS as she powered through to the chute.\n\nI‘ve finished five marathons and many other races in my 15 years of running. I also fulfilled a lifelong dream of going to the Olympics this week — seeing athletes win a few gold medals, world records, and the picturesque venues throughout Paris. \n\nBut following her for that final 5k was the highlight of my trip and one of the most special moments of my life. \n\nThank you Kinzang for being an inspiration and example to the global running community — a true Olympic champion. \n\nThis makes my heart soar. Some days people really get me down, but damn, runners just really being me back up again. What a great moment!\n\nYou have a story to tell for your lifetime.\n\ni didnt expect to cry ???\n\nBeautiful thanks for sharing 🫡\n\nThis is beautiful\n\nNice 🙂👍\n\nI'm not crying...you're crying!\n\nIf you want some more similar inspiration, I’m a huge fan of this story about the runners who commit to finishing [DFL at the US Trials](https://defector.com/at-the-olympic-trials-marathon-dfl-means-pain-over-regret), where it’s totally normalized for runners to just stop and drop from the race as soon as they realize they aren’t going to qualify.\n\nI remember watching the Kona Ironman competition on TV a few years ago. One of the top competitors was having a bad day and ended up in the back of the pack with the “age groupers.”  The media asked him why he didn’t DNF with other “pros”. He responded he wasn’t going to disrespect all the amateur runners who are just happy to finish. He continued, they have jobs, raise families and still find time to train and compete. He said it is an honor to finish with them.\n\nHah, I had no idea that \"age groupers\" were looked down on by pros. But I guess that's Ironman for you.\n\nI will occasionally run the shorter version of a big race because I know I'll place in my age group and it gives me a bit of an ego boost. There's a half marathon happening near me next week and if I run the half, there's no way I'll place. But if I run the 10k, I have a really good chance of an age group placing. Because all of the *good* runners are doing the half.\n\nIn videogames, I think that's called \"smurfing\".\n\n&gt;Hah, I had no idea that \"age groupers\" were looked down on by pros. But I guess that's Ironman for you.\n\nDidn't that anecdote just show how that exactly doesn't seem to be the case?\n\n&gt;Because all of the good runners are doing the half.\n\nWhere I'm from you always have fast people who specialize in the shorter distances so that it's generally not really easier to place there.\n\nI was at the finish of the Florence Marathon this past year for both the elite finishers and then also the 5hr30m mark of the general start, and honestly the people finishing in 5-6 hours were way more inspiring to watch.\n\nLiterally the only race I'd be happy to DFL in.  Except the actual Olympics, but there's no way I'm getting into that one. \n\nMan, now I have a new life goal.\n\nI love that article, this post definitely reminded me of it and I was going to post it but you already did.\n\nIt’s still a sub 4 hour marathon. I mean, not superstar pace, but also not a Raygun performance.\n\nLol raygun copping strays everywhere.\n\nI mean, Raygun's day was probably a lot like a 3:52 marathon. It looks a lot worse in dance form, but she's still doing something that takes a lot of work and a very tiny percentage of the world can accomplish.\n\n&gt; It looks a lot worse in dance form,\n\nI think this phrase could get a lot of use. Hey, XYZ wasn't great, but at least you didn't have to see it in dance form!\n\nMMM no, anyone who knows breakdancing can say that it was a disgrace\n\nExactly, My marathon PB is 3:57 (though I was 52 when I did that, having run my first marathon at 48). If you factor in the hills and heat, it's pretty respectable. Just not Olympic standard.\n\nYet she is an Olympian.  And here we are….\n\nSo was Raygun, so...\n\nI can’t bring myself to watch what is, apparently, an epic train wreck.\n\nI actually watched it live for a while - she looked as though she was having a seizure.\n\n[deleted]\n\nLooks like she rigged it to get there. Her husband was the coach, he was on the judging panel for the “qualifying event”, which she set up, in Sydney, where it was tough for some of the best break dancers in the country to get to as they live in regional areas and transport and accommodation aren’t cheap.\n\nThis has apparently been debunked, but no one has actually explained why or how she qualified.\n\nTrue, but she did a sub 4 and walked a bunch of it.\n\nMy PB is 4:28 so fast is very subjective. Since then my pace per mile has gotten way better but 2 marathons is enough for me.\n\nHeat, is the killer for me. I just get slower and slower until I stop. Check my heart rate data afterwards, and it appears to slowly rises with my body temperature?\n\nI hope she enjoyed her Olympics. All the athletes are inspiring and it was so good to see the support she got around the course. \n\n\nMore Olympics. Less countries being jerks to each other. \n\nThis is great to see, and regardless of her finishing time, she will always be able to call herself an Olympian. Thanks for posting.\n\nI love it when spectators give as much kudos to the last place finisher as they do the first place finisher.\n\nThis happened in 96 Atlanta.  Our tickets only said Track &amp; Field and an early morning start.  As we get to our seats at the stadium, we see the women's marathon starting on the big screen.  \n\nFor 2 hours it was watching on the big screens, nothing else (no cell phones).  I tell you someone started the wave and it lasted 45 minutes!  We were pretty invested in this race.  \n\nAfter the majority of runners finished, they started setting up for the other events of the day.  Hurdles up, etc.  \n\nThen the announcer announced the final finisher and the entire stadium was off their feet going crazy for her.  It was something I'll never forget.\n\nSounds like she’s an ultra runner so she’s definitely a monster in her own right. And she still ran a great time in something she doesn’t really specialize in. Awesome stuff.\n\nNo hate from me.  3:52 is faster than my PR.\n\nAny race you finish is a good race\n\nThat’s dope. Stories like this are the best part of the Olympics. Medals are great and fine, but the perseverance and human spirit angles are way better IMO\n\nSomething that bothered me from this year’s Tour de France and came up again while I’m watching the marathon:  \n\nWhy don’t the jerseys have a pocket for the ice bags?  Watching these people at this level still having to improvise tricks for using ice is just astonishing to me. In a time when multiple shoe and clothing designs have been banned for being too good.\n\nThe Lululemon Further ultra event this past summer made me wonder the same thing for this marathon. They designed multiple pieces of kit with ice-holding capabilities for the athletes in that event, so you know other companies could have incorporated the same, and many athletes did have ice hats and also the Omius cooling headbands, so… also, they were handing out bags of ice at every water stop, so it seems like gear that could easily hold it to cool body temp would be hugely beneficial. \n\nI did notice Connor Mantz coming out to the start line for the men’s marathon in an ice vest, but it was gone by the gun.\n\nI did notice the women’s winner was wearing one of those headbands. I just learned about them before the Olympics. \n\nTour guys mostly used those ice vests after the stage ended but yes. Later this evening I was thinking a panel in the back made out of that cooling towel material, to make the effect last longer and prevent frostbite.\n\n[deleted]\n\nwow, good thing she wasn't 6 seconds slower or she would've lost all that undying respect....\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nYup! I am still proud of you.\n\nAnd you're still running, which is the important part 😉\n\nSame! I’m sitting over here with my PR of 6:57. Everyone is a running god compared to me. 😂 But hoping to ascend ever so slightly at my next marathon.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSobbing in hoping for a sub-6:20 first marathon in a few months. Most of the time… like 99% of the time in fact… this goal is all about proving to myself I can do it, but every once in a while it creeps in that my paces are VERY slow and often don’t show up on pace charts or even in conversations about slow times. So thanks for this external validation that hit hard enough to tell me I apparently needed it right now.\n\nAnother thing to remember is: even if the crowd is smaller for slower finishers, they probably get more individual attention. When I'm watching a race the fast finishers are too fast to see much of and I'm thinking \"wow, they're so fast\" and the middle of the pack is too big so I'm thinking \"there sure are a lot of people doing this race\" and yelling \"go runners!\".  \n  \nBut when the back of the pack comes by, I have time to cheer for people by name! There's a marathon that near my parents' house twice and I don't remember who has won it, but I remember the names of the slowest people the years I've been down there to watch! And I know thanks to the linkedin account I found for her that although last year's didn't finish in time to appear in the results, she did get a medal and is very proud to have finished her first marathon :)\n\nI think you're the bees knees for giving it a good attempt and finishing despite it all. You might be a scrub, but a legendary one who finished a marathon.\n\nYou know what? I think you're a legend, too.\n\nAnyone who is slower than me is a hobby jogger.  Anyone faster than me is on PEDs is how I see it.\n\nI'm a scientist and stand by this.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe hills!! 😭  The leaning the runners did on those hills made my thighs cry.  I have just recently started tackling inclines, for 2 minute intervals lol.   I cannot imagine going at their pace up those inclines.  It was amazing to watch.\n\nShe finished the marathon when even Eliud Kipchoge and many other men and women dropped out. Kudos to her for pushing through some tough conditions in the heat and the reasonable elevation gain.\n\nIt was amazing to watch everyone supporting her until the end.\n\nYes!!\n\nI always respect and admire the last place finisher.\n\nyou finished. in which place is irrelevant. 🫶💪\n\nInspirational story, and also a reminder of just how on another level these athletes really are.\n\nSo she finished last by roughly an hour. Her time was 3:52:59.\n\n3:52:59 averages out to roughly 8M53S/mile, over 26.2 miles of to what my understanding is a brutally difficult course.\n\nThat's a solid time! Like I'm a 41-year-old male in decent enough shape I'd say. If you put me on a track right now, I **might** be able to hold 8:53 for a mile. I'm not doing it for a 5K, and I'm sure as heck not doing it for marathon distance no matter the conditions, if I complete the distance at all.\n\nIncredible.\n\nJust makes me wish I ran in a slower country.\n\nThank you for sharing! I hadn't seen that, but it made my day\n\nIt's funny, at my company last place gets laid off. Stacked ranking.\n\nBut everyone on the internet is like \"aww!\"\n\n(I am not showing off the attitude of my company, I think it's bullshit. Peoples careers are not musical chairs)\n\nThe Olympics are so inconsistent with this stuff. They allow non-Olympic level athletes to compete in some events, while most other events maintain huge barriers to entry.\n\nPersonally, I think there should be Olympic standards for Olympic races, and this isn't close to meeting the standard. You don't have to be a medal hopeful to be a worthy Olympian, but I do think you should be able to crack a 3-hour marathon to be an Olympic marathoner.\n\nThe Olympics has universality places for countries with no qualifying athletes, kinda as a \"spirit of the Olympics thing\". For track, they can do the 100, 800, or marathon iirc. Usually they pick someone decently good, but sometimes for various reasons (lack of talent, corruption in selection, etc) you get competitors who are really not good (I recall a 16s 100m recently too)\n\nAt least with the 100 and 800 you don't have to wait an extra hour or two for a slower athlete to finish.\n\nI get the feeling, but I love the Olympic spirit of international participation. It’s nice to know that even the smallest, poorest countries in the world still has the opportunity to show up and participate. \n\nI do appreciate there are limits- you very much need to have elite-level skills for most competitions. They just save a spot for those smaller countries where it’s logistically possible to do so. \n\nAnd if the Olympics had an ultramarathon going through snowy mountains, Kinzang would be up there on my favorites to win.\n\nThis. It’s the whole idea of you can’t be what you can’t see. Check out Eric Moussambani. He literally couldn’t swim, but quickly taught himself, was the only one who showed up to Equitorial Guinea’s trials, and made the team for 100m freestyle through an IOC spot. He’d never seen an Olympic size 50m pool, and he swam his heat at the 2000 Olympics in nearly 2 minutes while struggling to finish (this year’s winner’s time was 46 seconds for comparison). And then he continued swimming and knocked more than a minute off his time, eventually becoming his country’s national swim coach. They’re still not winning any international meets, but they have a national training facility now, and other swimmers have gone to the Olympics, none of them placing last. Progress can take time, but attention can build programs.\n\nOh cool! I knew about the swimmer, but didn’t realize he went on to be a coach. That’s awesome.\n\nYou had me until end. She still wouldn’t win, come on now\n\nHow come she took longer to finish the marathon in Paris than she did in her home country?\n\nDifferent circumstances and probably the heat of the day she was not used to.\n\nYou've never had an 'off' day?\n\nEvery one of the American entrants also took longer than they did in the US Olympic trials, and one dropped out after 5K. This was a different course in different weather with who knows what popping up during her marathon build.\n\nDoing the worst at the Olympics still puts you in the top 0.1 % of the world\n\nThere's no way that time would put her in the top 0.1% of any race.  Even if a bunch of average people (non- runners) were also included in the start list.   If 1% of the entrants (10 people/1000) were regular marathoners, 3:52 would be unlikely to win that group.\n\nof the world, not of people in events, learn to read, thank you."

    "body": "Ran the sf 2nd half marathon this morning and the race was short by 0.6 miles. \n\nRace started on the coast in Golden Gate Park. 4 minutes into my run, i saw the Mile 1 marker and thought that was strange. It showed 0.4 miles on my watch. Mile 2 and mile 3 were also off by 0.6 miles to my watch. Needed to use the restroom at mile 3 and while in line, I asked those around me if their trackers were off. Everyone said they were off. \n\nWe all shrugged it off and figured the mile marker would adjust over the course. As I ran closer to the finish, I realized no adjustment was going to be made and that this course was going to be SHORT!!!  \n\nI crossed the line with my watch at 12.5 miles. Exactly 0.6 miles off ever since mile 1. \n\nI’m not complaining cause I’m coming off an injury and welcomed a shorter course, but I feel bad for anyone was trying to go for a PR or something. \n\nIt’s completely mind boggling that this error happened at a race as large as the SF marathon ",

    "all_comment_text": "They made the first right turn too early. Course set up error.\n\nLong Beach Marathon in 2023 was set up too long by ~0.2-0.3 miles. One of the u-turns was in the wrong spot.\n\nI guess it's pretty common to set up incorrectly vs the certification.\n\nEven though I’m am just running for my PR. I’ll more than happy to take 0.2 miles longer course. With the short course, I can’t just keep running for 0.5 miles more past the finish line because of the medal traffic jam.\n\nNormally I would say to just keep running the extra distance but half a mile is a really long extra distance to run.  I've run some 5ks that were really 3.0 miles and that hundred yards or so is one thing but half a mile more isn't realistic.\n\nI think it's funny to see you say that some of your have been 3.0 miles. My 5ks in the last year or so have been 3.07, 3.1, 3.11, 3.1, 3.11, 2.97, 2.47 (had to be cut short due to a fire along the course), 2.95 (that same race the next year), 3.05, 2.83, 3.1, and \"I have no idea because nobody ever told me to turn around so I don't know where the turnaround was supposed to be.\" Luckily, that last one was free. But I'm pretty annoyed that only 2/11 actually reached the full 5k distance.\n\nPutting those in metric, they were 4.94, 4.99, 5.01, 4.99, 5.01, 4.79, 3.98, 4.76, 4.91, 4.55, 4.99, and idk.\n\nI would love to have more races that were only 3.0 miles lol\n\nThat's like high school XC races, where the \"official\" distance is 5k but they can range anywhere from about 2.7-3.3mi.\n\n\"5\"\"k\"\"race\"\n\nCourse distance should be measured using the tangents. Maybe they measured in the middle of the trail/road and you ran tangents?\n\nThat's possible. I would normally think they have to do with my watch being wrong but the I only have problems with certain race organizers.\n\nAs far as I know courses are measured through the middle. When I run usually I end up running slightly more than 26.2. Sometimes Ina huge race I get some inside spots and other times maybe I run wider.\n\nDid the LA marathon in March and my Forerunner clocked me in at 26.6 miles. I still don't know if the course was off, the watch, or if I somehow managed to do that myself from the way I ran. But when you're on the last mile and you see that nonsense, it's a bit of a slap in the face\n\nI ended up at 26.23mi, so probably more about your path and less the route itself.\n\nThe course is measured assuming you run perfect tangents. It’s very common to clock longer than 26.2 miles because in a race that large it’s almost impossible to run those perfect lines for much of the race.\n\nWhat happens with BQs?\n\nYou can’t BQ from a half marathon. \n\nI understood this was part of a full.\n\nThe way I read it, the half was set up short, the full was correct distance. I thought you were referring to the half, my mistake. \n\nI’ve read that the full was 0.2 mile too long.\n\nhttps://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/sf-marathon-course-short-runners-furious-19604930.php#\n\nRunning “longer” is normal. Can happen because of GPS or tangent issues. Anyone complaining about a marathon being .2 miles too long is lame\n\nTotally baffling how they got this so wrong today. I previewed the “planned” course last week and we did not do that today— course shortcutted on mile 2, and miles 1-3 were all random distances\n\nThanks for posting about this. Wasn’t sure if it was just me. Is there any recourse here? It’s supposed to be USATF certified, right? It was my second half and I thought I PR’d 🙃\n\n[https://support.thesfmarathon.com/hc/en-us/articles/5199726979987-Is-The-San-Francisco-Marathon-USATF-Certified](https://support.thesfmarathon.com/hc/en-us/articles/5199726979987-Is-The-San-Francisco-Marathon-USATF-Certified)\n\nThey are indeed, I am in the same boat and also want to know if there's action we can take right now as participants. This is very disappointing and it was an expensive race - we very literally did not get what we signed up for\n\nThere’s nothing they can do. IF they acknowledge it, the most they’ll do is offer you a discount to register for next years 2nd half marathon 🤷‍♂️\n\nThey’ll probably give you $10 off next year and call it a day.\n\nThey'll add an extra 0.6 miles on the end of next year to make up for missing distance from this one.\n\nSince they cut the race short by 4%*, they’ll give a 4% discount next year, after they raise the price 20%. \n\n* cannot be combined with any other discounts or promotions\n\nfrom what I’ve read they’ve actually breached their contract with USATF on this course, so while for me it’s just a frustrating experience, I feel like it’s something they actually should take seriously and issue a formal apology about. Will be interesting to see the resolution of all this. \n\nNot sure I’d even want a discount on next year because I’d be too nervous about the same thing happening again!\n\nI’m sure they are already working with their lawyers to do everything they can to not have to pay back any money. \n\nAt the Santa Rosa Marathon several years ago, there was an intersection that had no course markers or workers telling people where to go. A pace runner went the wrong way, and everyone followed them, since they didn’t know either, and they were all taken off course. The race took no responsibility, stating that the runners should have studied the course beforehand and somehow committed the entire course to memory. \n\nI bet SFM will use a bullshit excuse, claiming that the course was measured properly and it was a volunteer that screwed up and mis-directed the runners. And they’ll say it’s the runners’ faults for not noticing.\n\nIt took several weeks for the Chicago half marathon to acknowledge it, and their response was basically blaming everyone else and not taking responsibility. I won’t run that race again because of that. People issued charge backs on their credit cards and I kinda wish I did the same.\n\nYou can actually submit a dispute with your credit card company if the race won't refund you. I did this with a race that was advertised as USATF certified ( Newsflash: it wasn't - they let the certification lapse). It was shorted distance as well. I got my money back from Chase even though the race refused to refund me.\n\nUgh Chase just told me they wouldn’t refund me for this 2nd half because I “completed the race” even though it wasn’t as promised. \n\nSame here\n\nWhat if you hadn't completed the race. Would they have then refunded you?\nNot understanding Chase's logic here\n\n[https://certifiedroadraces.com/certificate/?type=m&amp;id=3402](https://certifiedroadraces.com/certificate/?type=m&amp;id=3402)\n\nIs this the course you ran?\n\nAhh, nice found! I looked earlier today and failed to find it.\n\nSo... I think the certification is wrong - specifically the map. The written instructions for mile markers, say:\n\n&gt; Mile 2: On MLK Jr., Drive, 5 feet west of green bench on north side of road and 125-feet east (before) stop sign at Middle Drive on North Side\n\nThis implies, that, after the turnaround on MLK, you run all the way back to Middle Drive (and the 2nd mile marker is just before the Middle Drive intersection). But crucially the map has the 2 mile point just before the intersection with Metson, and takes the course up Metson.\n\nSome of the maps on the SF Marathon site show the course going up Middle, others going up Metson - this may be entirely on the course certification (SF Marathon pays the measurer to produce that certificate to give them the accurate course).\n\nYea, I saw the same thing in a comment further down.\n\nThe course certification is the course certification. If the map as proposed isn't measuring up, a measurer is going to report to the race directors and make proposals. It's a dialogue. If the race director can't implement a proposed change, they'll look for the distance elsewhere. A course measurer is going to prioritize accuracy over an easy to run or an easy to set course every time.\n\nRight - but the point here is that the map that is shown in the certification doesn't match the written words in the certification - so something went wrong in the certification process.  The map is the certified map - and its short...\n\nEdit: For the avoidance of confusion - the runners today ran the course on the certification that is shown in the map - its that I'm stating is likely short as it doesn't match the words of the certification for the mile markers.\n\nOh! I didn't read closely, and I thought you were pointing out the discrepancy between the certified course and the event maps. You're right. that's a big problem.\n\nYou should 100% ask for a refund. You paid for the correct distance. To be off by .01-.03 is one thing, but over half a mile is audacious. As a race director, if I was that off I’d be so embarrassed that a refund would feel like the least I could do, but jumping fences (the org that directs the SF marathon) is pretty shitty.\n\nPerhaps that would kill the race though?\n\n\nAccidents do happen. \n\n\nMy PB for years was on a short course. It was only three years later I thought it was so odd that everyone had a great day and ran so well. I emailed the organisers and they said it was about 0.2 miles short. This was pre Strava and GPS watches so harder to argue. \n\nI think people want an acknowledgement of error. It’s less than 24 hours, so I’m cutting the race organizers slack for not issuing a release yet. But as the days go on, ppl will be more and more upset and I can see people start to call their credit card companies.\n\nId be surprised if they've not put up something the next day. \nRace organizing is a tricky job so I'd cut them a bit of slack as you say. \n\nEmail went out today Tuesday with an acknowledgement.\n\nWhy are they shitty? What race are you a race director for?\n\nCouple of reasons: 1) they’re a small team, so errors like the above are bound to happen. For the price participants paid, they deserve accurate distances or reimbursement; 2) their waste stream plan (particularly for old medals and shirts) isn’t fleshed out; 3) their brand partnerships—Puma in particular. I couldn’t care less about their product, find a better shoe brand that people would generate more excitement. Puma is trying—they have the Jamaican national team and a few legit American track athletes like Prandinj\n&amp; O’Keefe.\n\nI race direct smaller SF races like 5ks and 10ks. Much easier, so I feel for them, but feel for the athletes that paid, trained, and expected the correct distance more\n\nWhat does USATF certified even mean? Seems like an oversight issue on their end also if it didn't measure the full distance\n\nThey measured the correct distance. \n\n\nThe course on the day was set up wrong and didn't reflect the measured route. \n\nThe SF sub has a discussion going. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/s/qkyWZM5074\n\nThe full marathon ended up being correct end to end, but the markers were off the whole way until Mile 25. I crossed the Mile 24 marker at 23.5 on my watch, and crossed Mile 25 right at 25.0 on my watch. “Mile 24” was 1.5 miles long\n\nomg thank you for mentioning this. I hit mile 2 at 1.9, mile 24 at 23.5, and thought I was tripping for the whole time. then finished at 26.3 somehow\n\nI hate that\n\nMajor 🤦🏻‍♂️. I don't think I'll run this race again. Seems like amateur organizers for a big city race.\n\nI lived in SF for 8 years and ran the marathon 6 or 7 times. Honestly, it NEVER felt that organized. I remember one year one of the leaders of the half marathon accidentally went the wrong way because the markings were wrong. \n\nIt won't get better until they properly close all the streets for the race. \n\nAlso it's pretty crazy how it seems to be getting worse. It's coming up on 50 years now right??\n\nThe 50th anniversary will be 2027. Honestly I don't understand why they can't close part of the bridge for the marathon runners why other cities can do it.   The congested side walks don't look fun.\n\nOkay I wasn't crazy, I felt like that shit was way longer and I was dying I needed that marker for my sanity and felt like it was never coming up.\n\nYeah, I came across that Mile 24 marker and thought I must have spaced out and missed half a mile. It wasn't anywhere near close.\n\nThat is about the worst possible place for such a mistake to happen, mentally.  I would be pissed at that.\n\nI noticed this too and it was driving me crazy. Every mile marker was off until the very end where I ran the longest mile of my life. It made it really hard to self-pace the tale end of the race because I wasn't really sure what my pace really was. At least it ended up actually being a full marathon in the end.\n\nWell they do say the last miles feel the longest :)\n\nSame for me! Such a mind fuck that late in the race\n\nThe mile 25 marker was also 1.5 miles from the end (you can see the difference between the finish and mile 25 splits on the leaderboard, everyone took about 1.5 miles worth of time), so mile 24 was actually 3 full miles from the end of the race\n\nI ran it and it was definitely short overall, but were the last miles longer as well? Everyone’s chip pace I’ve examined seems faster for the beginning and slower than what it should be for the end\n\nThere is a pretty decent amount of congestion right around the Giants' stadium too. I think that definitely slowed me down a bit.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was running the whole time, though slowed going down the hill once I caught up to the 1:45 pacers we were ahead on time based on markers. It seemed like 1:45 pacers slowed as well. The 1:50 pacers caught the 1:45 pacer I was following at mile ~8 when he literally stopped to get and drink water then he sprinted off. The distance being off messed with what I though I needed for my goal time of sub of 1:45. Upsetting, but lesson learned and personally will be better prepared next race to rely on myself, not pacers and nor the mile markers\n\nThat’s what happened for me. \n\nThat is unacceptable. 3mile fun run for charity. 2.9 mile. But a 1/2! So sorry.\n\n1st half was short too. I kept running a bit after the finish to get 13.1. I think I heard someone else did that though and got stopped by security.\n\nYep. Mine showed 13.0 too. Slightly miffed since my Garmin didn’t count it as a half marathon time 😭\n\nWas it short by .1 mile? Trying to work out if I would have still hit my goal\n\nYeah it was short somewhere between .1 and .2\n\nMy Garmin said 13.0 when I crossed the finish line and thought I may have started the run a little late.\n\n+1 first half was short by .1 for me and my buddy as well\n\nI didn’t run this year, but I ran the first half last year and my watch reported that short but it was not. Just GPS error on all the curvy parts\n\nYes. I ran this route last year and my GPS put it at 20.8km. Figured it was a one-off, just a GPS error.\n\nThis year: GPS also measured 20.8km.\n\nHonestly wasn't sure if there was something three-dimensional with the inclines and/or GPS being confused on the bridge. But the route on Strava actually puts the finish slightly further along JFK than the finish actually was in reality both in 2023 and 2024.\n\nran the full at SF today and we overheard a bunch of runners talking about how the miles seemed off. we noticed the markers seemed to be not aligned towards the end, it had the 25 mile marker and 12 mile marker at different places a distance apart. it sucks for all the runners and is really unacceptable for a big race that costs so much to enter to have an issue like this.\n\nThe full was a bit longer too, I thought it would never end!\n\nThis got picked up by SFGate:  \n[https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/sf-marathon-course-short-runners-furious-19604930.php](https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/sf-marathon-course-short-runners-furious-19604930.php)\n\n1st half was off too!!\n\nThe markers were off for the 10k, too. I think the 4th mile was off by 0.4 miles. Doesn’t matter to me because this was just a “fun run” for me, but yeah, very strange.\n\nYep, the first out and back in the park didn't come as far back as it was supposed to. All the way back to Middle drive instead of cutting up Metson. [https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1eeeblz/comment/lfe0cg8/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\_term=1&amp;utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1eeeblz/comment/lfe0cg8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)  \n  \nI was bummed, but I wasn't really pushing for a PR anyway as I'm training for MCM and it was just my long run with some coworkers, but I'd be super frustrated if I was really pushing it.\n\nDamn! My garmin shows my first half this morning also short at 12.99. Not as bad but still surprising for USATF certified. For the first half I’m betting they shorted some of the runner switches heading towards the park finish bc I fully expected to be long based on mile markers. My watch was clocking completed miles about 100yds  before the flags which is what I would expect given tangents.  They’ve screwed up my bib tracking too- showing me in the second half instead of the first which I registered and completed. Ffs\n\nGPS watches aren't \\*that\\* accurate. 12.99 on a course that's supposed to be 13.10 wouldn't lead me to believe that the course is short -- just that the fuzziness on individual GPS points plus the twists &amp; turns of the course led to a short measurement.\n\nThe 0.6 mile discrepancy on the HM is another thing. That's way more than I'd expect from any watch.\n\nI have run multiple half marathons (all USATF certified) and my watch has never recorded a distance over 13.1 — gps error I would presume. A .1 difference id assume is just that vs an actual short course \n\nBut the OPs report I think is a real routing error if the very first mile was 0.6 off :)\n\nI've never ran a single race, of any distance, and been short on my watch.\n\nIn most cases your watch should be long. I'm talking 95% of cases\n\ndepends on the watch. My previous watch was always long, but new one has been short on all races I’ve run\n\nI know! Mine stopped at 13.05! I thought I did something wrong as it was my first half. But now I see this was a thing for many people\n\nMarkers were also off during 5k too. I didn’t want to pay the $$ for the half but I wanted the sf/oak medal (which I still haven’t been able to get because they didn’t have them??)\n\nOverall, for such an expensive race for every distance, you would hope it would be more organized. Seems like too much to ask!\n\nSomebody should have told me about this so I could make my Olympic Trials attempt\n\nIt’s interesting because I live in SF and trained in Golden Gate Park based on the map they originally posted on their website. I was ALWAYS short and kind of figured that it must be a mistake and they would rectify it….\n\nNope. 0.6 short on my watch as well. I was baffled how they could have messed it up so badly given the problem literally started at Mile 1. It’s like they backed up from the marathon finish and then didn’t adjust the start accordingly. Truly bizarre.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I ran the 10K the past two years and the first year was absolutely terrible. There were no corrals, not enough room on the course for all the runners, issues with water stations, etc. I saw multiple people face plant. They fixed some of the issues last year but it didn’t instill much confidence in the race organizers.\n\nStop giving them your money\n\nWow. I am fairly new to this sport (two years) and I have been surprised by posts about events this huge handled so poorly (I think another one that didn't have this error but just bad logistics was Toronto?). \n\nI've run Pittsburgh's half twice now and am learning to be grateful it's been very well organized. \n\nIt just amazes me they can \"get away\" with shit like this. I am sorry to anyone who trained for this event looking to PR.\n\na lot of times there are multiple marathon events in a single city, where one is run properly, and the other is a rookie organizer, and is known to be suspect.\n\nJust using Toronto as an example, because I lived there for many years:\n\nToronto has an extremely well organized marathon/half-marathon event called the \"Toronto Waterfront Marathon\" and another event that *always* had bad logistics year after year after year called \"Toronto Marathon.\" They are run by completely different people/groups, with completely different sponsorships/budgets.\n\nThe \"Waterfront Marathon\" is the one that gets international attention and is probably the best organized event in all of Canada. The \"Toronto Marathon,\" on the other hand, is the one that's a disaster and gets bad reports/logistics, nightmare stories.\n\nIf you're new to the sport and want to try for some interesting runs in different cities, make sure you find out how many different marathons there are in a city. In a place like SF, I'm pretty sure there's going to be multiple run events at different levels of organizational effectiveness.\n\nUnfortunately this is pretty much the major (only?) marathon event here in SF…\n\nThank you so much for this! I'm running a small half in October, and I'm a little \"nervous\" about shit like this because I'm trying to get under two hours for the first time. \n\nI also have some cities that I just sort of vaguely have in my brain that I want to run there, so this is good advice to be cautious about offbrand races lol\n\nYep thought it was just my watch but I guess not. Insane fuckup\n\nDetective Monk would have figured that out asap.\n\nLooks like they updated the results to reflect a 12.6 mile race (which updated overall pace).  \n[https://www.athlinks.com/event/1403/results/Event/1072999/Course/2441958/](https://www.athlinks.com/event/1403/results/Event/1072999/Course/2441958/)\n\nIncredibly unprofessional and disappointing that a race this large (and expensive) can’t set up their course correctly.\n\nPosted this as a reply to another comment but wanted to comment here as well \n\nYou can actually submit a dispute with your credit card company if the race won't refund you. I did this with a race that was advertised as USATF certified ( Newsflash: it wasn't - they let the certification lapse). It was shorted distance as well. I got my money back from Chase even though the race refused to refund me.\n\nAlas, paid the entry fees in December of '23.  It's too late to dispute the transaction (I'm also with Chase).\n\nchase won’t dispute the charge because I participated in the race, regardless of the event’s shortcomings. I’ll just need to set it aside and start preparing myself mentally for a real first half marathon later this year.\n\nlol that doesn't really make sense to me, i'd try and fight that some more. if anything there's less of a case to be made for a refund if you didn't participate because it didn't affect you then, and you'd just be using this as an opportunity to get a refund\n\nYou didn't get what you paid for. Simple.\n\nI had proof of the advertisement on their site as a USATF certified race, and an email acknowledging they let i the certification lapse and that the course was short.\n\nThe TC ten mile in 2014 turned a block to soon out of the gate, took like a half mile off the course. I don’t think anything happened as a result.\n\nMy 10K watch distance was 0.2 miles greater—is that a normal thing?  With the weaving and all that? First race\n\nNope, I ran the race last year and I noticed they pushed back the staring line this year. And my watch clocked 6.52 miles vs 6.27 last year. And looking through strava I can't find anyone under 6.3 for this year's run.\n\nnope, mine was around .12 miles greater\n\nI was wondering about this! My watch said I completed the 10k about 45sec before the finish line, ended up being 10.2 km/6.34 miles. Watch time was 56:12 and chip was 57:06.\n\nI ran the 5K and the 3 mile marker was 0.2 from the finish. People tried to kick but then faltered as there was no finish line in sight. I and several others on Strava recorded 3.22-3.25mi 🙄\n\nSame!\n\nLol a lot of PRs today that will never be beaten\n\nSFGATE just updated their article:\n\n  \n**LATEST July 30, 10:45 a.m.** The San Francisco Marathon has tacitly admitted it made a major mistake with one of its half-marathon courses Sunday.\n\nThe marathon’s [time-keeping website](https://www.athlinks.com/event/1403/results/Event/1072999/Course/2441958/Results) has updated the “City Half” event to reflect that the course was shorter than the 13.1-mile distance it was supposed to be. The website now says, “2nd Half Marathon (12.6 Miles)” above the results, which has changed all of the runners’ pace times from the event. Neither the full marathon nor the Bridge Half half-marathon [have a parenthetical distance](https://www.athlinks.com/event/1403/results/Event/1072999/Results) next to their race results.\n\nSF Marathon has not posted any information about why the change was made. SFGATE reached out to SF Marathon race director and general manager Lauri Abrahamsen on Tuesday morning about the change.\n\n“We identified the issue,” Abrahamsen said in a statement via text message. “Our USATF course certifier validated that he measured the course incorrectly. We will be emailing the 2nd half participants today.”\n\nSo they blame the course measurer for this mistake. Fine, but why do they have 2 different course maps on their website, one of which has the right distance?\n\nCan OP share the email addressing the short course once it’s sent out? I’m nosy 👀\n\nDear Runner,\n\nFollowing Sunday’s event, we discovered an issue concerning the second half-marathon course. It came to our attention that, despite being measured and certified by a USATF-certified course measurer, the course was incorrectly measured, resulting in a length of 12.6 miles instead of the full 13.1 miles.\n\nWe have updated the race results to reflect the accurate distance of 12.6 miles. We deeply apologize for this oversight and appreciate your patience while we address the issue. This was a human error, and we understand the frustration this may have caused.\n\nThank you for running with us, and despite this error, we hope you enjoyed the course.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe SF Marathon Team\n\nThank you for sharing! I’m glad they acknowledged the error on their end. I wonder if SFM will eventually offer discount codes for next year’s races or Berkeley.\n\nthe more i think about it, i think the person at fault is most likely the graphic designer who created the \"official course map\" pdf: [https://www.thesfmarathon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Second\\_Half.pdf](https://www.thesfmarathon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Second_Half.pdf)\n\n  \ni think the course was mapped out correctly (probably via some tech app/device). i think this course was then properly certified by the USATF. i think they gave the course to a graphic designer to create a nice course map pdf that they could upload to the website. i think the graphic designer didnt pay attention, and highlighted the course to be the first right turn between miles 1 and 2, instead of the 2nd right turn.\n\n  \ni think the course setup team used this \"official map\" as their master guideline and everything was screwed up.\n\nThat makes sense to me\n\nBut then why pin it on the course certifier? Which wasn’t a good look for them btw\n\nI'm thinking about emailing the course certifier to see if it's true. I find it's hard to believe the course certifier missed a turn and short 800 meters\n\nHopefully the S.F. Gate checks! They already spent the time investigating, why not reach out to the course certifier to get their take.\n\nI've just talked with the course measurer Doug. He has seen the SF Gate article and has been working with the race organizer about this. He said there' are blames going around but it's not like race organizer threw him under the bus. He think race organizers probably will release more info about how this mistake happened.\n\nThis is great - thank you for sharing! Did he have any guesses as to how this happened?\n\nHe didn't go into deep but he said there are discrepancies between the maps on the website hence confusion. My guess is ultimately the person/people who draw the PDF file is mostly at fault. The crews setting up the course might have used it to set up mile markers and the mistakes cascade.\n\nI can totally see this happening. Happened at a trail race I did in Napa two or three years ago.\n\nI know someone who works on the team and explained that is was just 100% a human fuck up. They said they went out back in the spring in person to mark the course with USATF and it was absolutely pouring then. Course certifier took manual notes on where the course should have been marked as how it was shown on the map. Then during marking the course for the actual race months later - someone messed up and didn’t double check the map/original course\n\nWow, that really stinks for you who thought you'd PR'ed.  I've seen how they measure these things for certification and there is no way you can be under that because they measured the shortest possible route IF you ran the course perfectly.  Hopefully they'll make it up to you all somehow.\n\nI may be tempted to do a charge back on my credit card.  If I paid to run a half marathon, I expect to run 13.1+ miles.  Most courses add in an extra 1-200 meters as a buffer.  I may give it a day or two to see what they do.  After that, I would really consider contacting my cc company and at least dispute the race fee.  Travel, hotels, food etc., you're outta luck, but it would be better than nothing.\n\nDo the charge back. SFM is way too expensive for these mistakes.\n\nWas it a different course than last year?  Should be able to compare some tracking.\n\nFirst half was short by about .2 miles too\n\nI ran the first half and my watch was off about 0.20. Thought it was just me but I’m hearing it’s happened to others too!\n\nMy PB is from a marathon that was about the same distance too long due to a marshall misplacing some cones. \n\nIt sucks, I know it's just a bit of fun and that but I trained for months so it just took the edge off a bit.\n\nWow this totally sucks! I ran this yesterday as my first-ever half and was totally thrown off the whole time by my Strava stats vs the mile markers. I ended at 12.73, strangely but did get redirected for a turn around Potrero at some point that might have increased my distance a teeny bit. I thought Strava was just off bc that’s happened to me before (telling myself maybe it was due to the crowds 🤷‍♀️). \n\nI had even written a post to tout my first half achievement / stats but now I just feel robbed. Ugh.\n\nI ran the Bridge First Half and my Garmin showed 12.9 mi. I didn’t like this new course. The bridge section path was not on the road, but the pedestrian path and it created a lot of traffic I slowed down so much trying to dodge people.\n\nThey need to bring back the old course (it was essentially the first half of the full marathon)\n\nThe news is reporting on this, and the SFM states that they are looking into it: https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/sf-marathon-course-short-runners-furious-19604930.php\n\n&gt; I’m not complaining cause I’m coming off an injury and welcomed a shorter course, but I feel bad for anyone was trying to go for a PR or something.\n\n\nI would be complaining since this means none of the runners can say they ran a half (IMO). \n\nI am the 2nd half marathon last year and didn't have the issue so it was probably a course setup issue. But I would be pretty livid that this happened given that it's not a cheap race. It was probably the most expensive one that I had done.\n\nThis happened to me in a 5k short by only .1 miles but the finish line was too crowded to keep going. I would have PR’d by almost 3 mins\n\nI once ran my pb on a half marathon course before the days of GPS watches and got an email about a week later saying it was short (but not by how much). Always annoyed me!\n\nThis sucks, but it’s happened with really professionally run races like the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in DC. These races rely on volunteers and its pretty easy on a course with a lot of turns to fuck it up. Not excusing it, but it’s never 100% guaranteed.\n\nthe sf marathon is one of the most expensive races in the country. you'd expect a certain standard level when you pay this amount of money.\n\nI agree. But most of the cost goes to police and public services and the races have to rely on volunteers and there's a limited amount of training. The only 100% guaranteed courses are run on a USATF certified track.\n\nIt’s one of the largest, most expensive, courses that is USATF certified. Being 0.6 miles short is unacceptable. There’s no excuse for this type of massive screwup\n\nI have friends who worked for this race company as either employees or contractors and it’s just badly organized and managed. They should cut down the number of events, because seven events in two days is too much for a company this small. I’d stick to just one 5K, 10K, the first half, and the marathon. They can have the shorter distances on Saturday if runners want to do a double, and the company can make more $$.\n\nSFM has probably the poorest rep in the Bay Area road running community. This also happened to me the last time I ran the Berkeley half (same race organizer) a few years ago. There are other road halfs (some in S.F.) that provide a way better experience for half the registration fee.\n\noh that's why. I saw my friend's strava at 12.6 miles and was confused\n\nEmail went out acknowledging it and nothing else. \n\nHonestly surprised they didn’t try to use a 10% discount (doesn’t stack with anything) to try to kick start signups for next year.\n\nThey don't even say how they're going prevent this from happening again.\n\nThey were sending me 25-30% discount codes the morning of the race. Anything less than 40% off SFM or Berkeley would be an insult\n\nchargeback 100%\n\nSounds like this was a genuine course error, but I have incredibly inconsistent GPS tracking on my runs and I don't think anything of it at this point\n\nThe good folks at the SF Marathon sent out an email offering those of us affected by the short course snafu 50% off the registration price for either the first or second half next year. I tookthem up on it, and signed up for the Bridge half for next year. Price? $85! Apology accepted! See you next year!\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nCourses are typically measured down the centre line. Between the 2 extremes of what defines the course (if its a road course, it will be the centre between either side of the road). If you run the racing line, and take corners on the inside, on a very windy course, this can add up to the course being \"short\" by half a mile.\n\nIAAF/World Athletics generally advise to over-measure, and make the course slightly long (but no more than 10%, as any percentage under, or more than 10% over, invalidates the certification).\n\nI would also add that GPS is not accurate to the mm, or the cm.. its accurate to around 10 metres for consumer grade devices, so again, on a windy course, it could be that a sports watch doesn't pick up all the twists and turns, and sees a windy section as a slightly wobbly straight line.\n\n(I've had to measure courses and set up courses for local races in the past, races that dont get certified, still get measured as if they are getting certified, and we are told to take these things into account)\n\n&gt; Courses are typically measured down the centre line. \n\nThis is not true.  \n\nIndustry standard is shortest possible route (SPR).\n\nThe sf marathon was not set up properly. They made us take the wrong turn. Has absolutely nothing to do what you just wrote.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe full had some mile markers in the wrong places but I’m sure it was the correct distance. My watch measured .1 miles long which is a reasonable amount for not always running the preferred line the entire race. 5k and 10k were long. Both half’s were short. Crazy.\n\nYour partner and you running the same course and getting a .25 difference should tell you that the error is as likely to lie with your devices as the course. Phone GPSs are especially terrible.\n\nYou needed the restroom at mile 3?\n\nA separate unrelated to the distance issue with the second half marathon was the ~10 porta potties for the few thousand runners at the start. I only made it by a few minutes and the line was 100s deep behind me.\n\nYou’d think they would’ve learned from last year where the 1st half marathon had 4 porta potties (+ a few public bathrooms). I hate that this is my local marathon because I’d love to run it again…but they need to figure this stuff out.\n\nIt's not uncommon for a race not to match the exact race distance. This isn't necessarily a big screw up by the race.\n\nBy half a mile? And with multiple runners reporting this? Yes it’s a screw up. The race is supposed to be USATF certified.\n\nIf this is USATF certified, this is a MAJOR effup on the part of the race committee.\n\n0.6 miles. Not 0.06 miles. In what world is 0.6 miles not considered a massive screw up. That’s 5+ minutes for an average runner.\n\nThat’s a huge discrepancy. That’s only happened to me once. It was windy and volunteers had to put course markers back, but guessed wrong where the course was supposed to turn.\n\nFound the course organizer\n\n😭\n\nHuh?"

Sounds like anti Wonka propoganda\n\nit fits the name lol. very rich i prefer vanilla bean always been a vanilla guy.\n\nOh it is. The S’mores and Birthday Cake Gu’s are also delicious.\n\nI can see it in my mind where you look down, mouth slightly agape, stunned by what you have just learned, fading backwards as the chocolate Gu and the crowd run past you.\n\nWhich race was this? What year?\n\nPeople really are on a different level\n\nNot quite a costume, but the Disney half has about a dozen stations to take pictures with costumed characters. These photo stations are just far enough from the road to make them a pain to get to and from. I desperately tried to beat a guy in front of me who was stopping at every single one. He smoked me.\n\nI was very proud of myself at the Disney half once I was able to pass the dude in a full length Cinderella gown but he was crushing it the whole way!\n\nWas Cinderella tall and sporting a full beard? He passed me at end of the full a few years ago. I felt shame. Then found out he also ran the half the day before. Shame intensified.\n\nI mean, a fair amount of her lore involves running. I wouldn’t be too embarrassed\n\nAlways took her for more of a sprinter or middle distance specialist but she did alright moving up to full. Although I am a little suspicious about possible PEDs. Something about that beard didn’t look right.\n\nThey should make getting a pic with every character a requirement for winning, like a Disney version of the book pages in the Barkley.\n\nThe guys I saw were going after the record for fastest half with pictures at every station. I haven't been able to find anything online about that record, but the guy who beat me must have run in the low 1:20's, so the record is at least that. \n\nI've never run a half and thought \"I wish there was a way to make this harder.\"\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I resorted to the drive by selfie.  Stopping for every photo just wasn't realistic for me.  The lines were 15-20 mins long for each character.  I stopped for Joy and Sadness at the end of the 5k and man did that describe my marathon a few days later.\n\nThe only reason this worked was because the two guys I was running with were the first people to take pictures that morning. It was pretty comical watching them run off the road and then haul ass back. One guy blew up, but the other one pulled away from me around mile 8, despite the stops. Impressive.\n\nI have never beaten the banana man.\n\nNothing has been more humbling than being passed up by a banana pushing a stroller\n\nI passed 3 cyclists while running uphill one day.\n\nThis is true. It’s said the banana suit gives a similar stamina buff that Gu provides\n\n2022 Broad Street Run I caught up to a gorilla pushing a stroller filled with bananas. Later a banana passed me and was out of sight before long.\n\nIt’s always the banana man.\n\nOn a multi loop trail 50K a guy was getting changed into a different costume every loop (5K) to beat some record. I always started each loop ahead of him  (as he peeled off to get changed after going over the timing mats) but then he overtook me, every single time. He passed me as Mr Blobby, Batman, Superman, a penguin, a baby, a dinosaur. So many different costumes and he was fast in all of them.\n\nYou know the story of the hare and the hedgehog?\n\nThis is hilarious\n\nHahaha love it!\n\nTwo guys wearing flight suits sharing a giant cardboard fighter jet. It was pretty impressive actually, and they hung around at the end and took photos with a few people.\n\nAt the Toronto waterfront marathon last year there were 4-5 guys (can’t remember exactly) dressed as a TTC streetcar who ran the whole marathon connected to each other.\n\nDid they short turn the course?\n\nWas next to those guys for probably 2k.  Good fun group for sure.  Eventually I peeled off.  I had a hard time getting around them to get to the water station 🙃 \n\nPretty sure they only did the half and got the world record for whatever sub category they had signed up for.  Good for them!\n\nThat’s hilarious. I would love to see that.\n\nA pierogi. I found out later that she won the Guinness world record for fastest marathon run while dressed like an ethnic dumpling. [https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/shaler-woman-to-run-pittsburgh-marathon-dressed-as-pierogi-trying-for-world-record/](https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/shaler-woman-to-run-pittsburgh-marathon-dressed-as-pierogi-trying-for-world-record/)\n\nan esteemed achievement\n\nI'd knock it but I have to confess that I have never run a marathon dressed as an ethnic dumpling myself.\n\nOkay, these records are getting waaaay too specific.\n\nNot a costume but a guy with a tracheostomy finished ahead of me.\n\nEdit: for extra fun, this was in Leadville. Not the 100, but the marathon\n\nI passed a guy on a smoke break. He passed me back on an uphill stretch and was ahead the rest of the race\n\nA smoke break during a race is insane\n\nWhen I was in the military we had a 880 yard sprint as a test (marine corps). The clock starts when the last guy passes the start line (supposedly,  I'm sure there's limits).  This dude was getting out of the military in a few months and didn't give a F#$%. They blew the whistle and he lit up a cigarette standing there as we all began almost dead sprinting.  He takes 2 drags. Probably starts 10-20 seconds after  everyone.  then just starts booking it with the cigarette in his mouth.  He caught up to almost everyone too. Some of the other smokers were telling me that smoking does open up your airways if you smoke regularly.  Idk how true that is.  But man.. that dude would be one hell of an athlete if he cared more\n\nSmoking is absolutely horrible for your lungs and heart, and will ONLY have detrimental affects on running ability, both anaerobic and aerobic. That said there are people that can run fast and smoke especially young people where the damage hasn’t set in yet. I’m just responding to the part about smoking “opening up your airways”. Yeah, it doesn’t work like that, lol.\n\nLol I 100% agree. It's just smoker logic I guess\n\na smoke break is actually crazy 💀\n\nthat’s hardcore\n\nLess air resistance, unfair advantage jk lol\n\nAt a Thanksgiving turkey trot got smoked by a lady in a full ass pilgrim costume complete with buckle shoes\n\nOne year at a Thanksgiving 5 miler I was bested by a man dressed as an oven with a turkey inside. He was huge.\n\nNot running, but similar, hope it’s ok here.\n\nBesides running, I also like to do the city bicycle fun rides. Usually there’s a good hill or two that you have to struggle up, and I swear, every single time, there’s a parent pulling a kid in a domed trailer behind them that passes you on the up hill.\n\nMy first 5k I finished maybe ten feet behind a lady pushing a toddler in a double stroller while *holding a second toddler with one arm.*\n\nLike, how strong/fast is that woman when she's on her own?\n\nOh my god this reminds me of my old neighbor- she did an Iron Man just a handful of months after giving birth, and there was an article in the local paper with a picture of her pumping milk during the run section. Apparently volunteers/medics kept thinking she was like reaching for her heart and needed assistance and she was like \"nope, just gotta get some of this out real quick!\"\n\nmy last race I was running at my threshold and this dude pushing twins in a stroller went by me so fast I swear my hair caught a breeze. I was impressed but also hoping those kids were abiding by ATGATT with how speedy he was\n\n[deleted]\n\nAs someone involved in a small community race, I promise you’re the exception. We have an out-and-back course, and the stroller people that used to attend always want to group up and chat. The short course is a recipe for disaster - the sprinters are flying back on their last km and hit a wall of strollers in a narrow, tree-lined pathway. \n\nWe had to politely request “no strollers” since we couldn’t convince them not to “race” (well, walk) 2 abreast.\n\nWild. I work for a 5K series. We have tons of stroller runners, but I can't ever remember seeing them go together. I guess most of the routes just don't seem doable for side by side strollers due to the sidewalk/curb/out and back situation.\n\nBut we did have a dad try to race a crosswalk light and make it across during the last moments of the countdown. He hit a rock, and the whole stroller tipped over, dumping out various items, though not the kid thankfully. And because he was racing the crosswalk light, it was actual green for oncoming traffic. Thankfully, it was a small town, and all of the cars noticed and stopped to protect the scene. He got everything picked up, but he was clearly horrified by what happened. He went white with fear. And his wife, who was also running, was pissed.\n\nThe kids are her pacers, they scream if she drops below a certain pace\n\nI once got passed just before the finish of a 10k by a guy pushing a triple stroller. Turns out he'd done the half marathon and set a Guinness world (? I think that's what a remember reading) record for pushing triplets in a half marathon.\n\nEdit: I also just remembered biking around a hilly route in my old city and getting passed up a him by a guy on a unicycle. That was interesting.\n\nThere are a couple of local firefighters here who run races in their full gear -- over 40 pounds of it -- to honor firefighters lost on the job. I can't recall whether they beat me but they are always going at a respectable clip when I see them. \n\nI lost to a firefighter in full gear with an O2 tank a few weeks ago in a 10k in Austin.\n\nHad a whole group of those at my last 10k, full gear except with running shoes.  They started in an earlier wave but it was a hot day so I was counting them down as I passed by towards the end of the race.  Oddly motivating.\n\nLast Turkey Trot 'Beach Ken' flew by me in the first mile, just sprinting.  I did catch back up to him later but rollerblade (?) barbie passed us both like a neon gazelle.\n\nAn 8’ tall Purple Barney took me at the Rockland County (NY) Turkey Trot several years ago. And I’m not slow.\n\nSlower than an 8 foot barney costume though 😀\n\nI think I was around 7:30 per mile on a 5 mile course.\n\nSo slower than the eight foot Barney then?\n\nForrest Gump lookalikes always seem to be faster than me. \n\nBut it's always a nice hit to the ego to watch half marathon walkers beat your half marathon running time right in front of you at the finishline.\n\nhow...\n\nEither they're competitive race walkers knocking out 6 minute miles or OP has neglected their training.\n\nYeah, mine was gonna be the non-costumed elderly man who power-walked past me during a 10k once.\n\nI got beat by a walker. Found out later she was an Olympic silver medalist.\n\nHow fast are they walking? I’d say for someone who isn’t a competitive race walker, walking at a pace where you could beat a runner is a very, very fast walk even if it’s a slow running pace. Or are you talking about people who run/walk the race?\n\nLondon Marathon. I was running 4 min per km pace - a 2:48 marathon - and a clown ran past me juggling 3 balls. That’s not all. He was chatting to a guy in a Superman outfit - and they were both running faster than me.\n\nThat’s an awesome way to take a 2x4 to the ego!\n\nSaw the juggling marathoner go past me as I was slogging through Brookline on Monday, that was disheartening.\n\nI had a juggler go past me on a HM a few years ago!\n\nI thought there was only one \"joggler\" but apparently there are many! I can't figure out who it was.\n\nSame experience I just had at Runapalooza in NJ a few weeks ago.\n\nCharlotte half - a mattress passed me at the 11 mile mark. Super cool guy and very nice, but dressed as a mini mattress was most unexpected.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis was going to be my answer. Saw him at NYC 2022 and knew I was cooked when he motored past me.\n\nMy cousin got smoked by him in Berlin \n\nhe flew past me in copenhagen last year\n\nGumby. I thought maybe I was starting to hallucinate when I saw him go by.\n\nMy local (notoriously difficult) back yarder has a gimmick where Gumby leads every loop. I'm fairly sure that making runners question their sanity is actually the aim.\n\nI got passed in a half by a guy running backwards :')\n\nIn a 30km race, I started beside a guy in a butterfly costume - and not just the basic butterfly wings you'd find at Spirit of Halloween. He had a full-on aluminum apparatus with these massive wings. \n\nHe dropped me at 10k and I never saw him again. I finished in 3:15 so he had to be notably faster than that.\n\nSo, he “flew” past you? ..\n\nI almost got beat by someone in a giant foam Best Buy logo costume during the Twin City marathon.  My terrible time would have been even worse without the fear of that humiliation.\n\nI ran the London marathon 10 years ago and I was beaten by someone dressed as big bird in the last half mile 🙈\n\nI nearly got beat by a banana at The Great North Run - it was nip &amp; tuck until mile 10 when he had to stop to reinflate his banana, with some wag in the crowd shouting 'I bet that's not the first time he's given a blow job'. He still nearly caught me on the run in.\n\nIt wasn't *that* embarrassing, but my first marathon I finished [just behind a guy pushing a triple stroller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjuNRdGUJIk). I saw him at every turn-around just in front of me (the oldest kid always looked terrified while the other two were bored), and then he pulled away from me in the last two miles. On top of it, that marathon is still my PR and my only age-group medal, so it is not like it was a bad race for me either!\n\nThe funny part of this story is that one of my workout partners finished 30 seconds ahead of him and PR'd. He said afterwards that he was completely motivated at the end by, \"I'm not letting the guy pushing a triple stroller beat me!\"\n\nI got beat by a guy who ran (Pittsburgh Marathon, maybe?) the whole time while playing the trumpet.\n\nI would let that guy beat me.  I am not gonna run anywhere near him.  He can get miles ahead.\n\nThat’s both amazing and annoying as hell.\n\nI've been beaten by so many costumes. Santa Claus in August at 30°C, Bob Ross (with easel), Jesus carrying a cross...\n\nBut the most humiliating situation was: getting overtaken by a backwards runner.\n\nI once passed someone in a half while wearing flannel pajama pants, at the finish she said \"you passed me and I realized you were outrunning me..in pajamas.\"\n\nMy first trail race was a 25k in 16 degree weather. I felt pretty good until going up the last big hill about a mile from the finish I was passed by Tinkie Winkie\n\nA couple passed me by a few yards when they saw an Albertsons, she says to him “let’s go get something drink” so they run into this Albertsons, have a drink, and then catch up to me and pass me couple miles later 😩🤦‍♂️\n\nMount Vernon does a 5k and a guy playing a fife THE ENTIRE TIME was so far ahead of me, I never saw him, just heard the fife music floating back to taunt me\n\nOne of the giant WWF rhinos came flying past me on the final strait in London, 2018.\n\nI knew that I had had a bad run, but that put it beyond any doubt.\n\nAnother not exactly a costume but I got passed by the Men in Black at the NYC marathon a few years back. They had the neuralizers and everything doing the flashy thingy to people as they passed.\n\nHow did you remember that ?\n\nYears ago I ran the Twin Cities Marathon.  It was a pretty warm race day but the temperature was just part of the challenge.  The humidity was oppressive.  It was sweltering out.  \n\nI failed to catch up to Scooby Doo.  Fellow wore a Scooby Doo one piece costume for the whole run.  I just don’t know how he didn’t dehydrate himself and pass out.  \n\nAlso, I got hit by Spam.  It was a guy wearing a Spam shirt and in a wheelchair.  Not a racing wheelchair-just a regular one.  He came up behind me and just pretended I didn’t exist cut the back of my leg (ok not badly-it was just a scratch). I could see if we were running downhill and it got away from him.  But this was on flat terrain.  I was pissed and ready to fight (I am usually pretty casual when I’m out running). He never said anything. He just kept on going.  Yeah, just because he’s handicapped doesn’t mean he’s not an asshole.  I let it go, but I still have a distaste for asshole wheelchair users.\n\nI got overtaken by a lad running in clown shoes in the Paris marathon in 2007. My mate in the same race got beat by a chap on stilts.\n\nNot quite a costume, but passed at a 10k and a half by the same guy juggling 3 hackie sacks.  This dude juggled continuously for 13.1 miles!  I couldn't even run all that distance :)\n\nThere’s a guy at the local Philly races who runs while juggling. There’s also a guy I’ve seen who races while dribbling multiple basketballs. I can juggle but couldn’t do it while even walking, much less running!\n\nI ran the Philly Marathon and there was a guy dressed as The Pope who passed me.\n\nMy first ever marathon was at Disney and I had an IT band injury on the lead up to the race that caused me to walk the remaining 9 miles. I was disheartened enough until [Jogging Jack Sparrow](https://www.instagram.com/joggingjacksparrow?igsh=bXB2anN5bHd0NWFi) “drunkenly” pranced past me in full costume and boots.\n\nNot sure costumed but hula hoop runners\n\nA guy with one meter high Teddy bear on his back, running barefoot. I was 10 minutes slower then him\n\nNot a costume per se but I remember seeing a girl in front of me at the Brighton Marathon last year wearing flared jeans and I took that personally.\n\n\"I personally got absolutely crushed by Chewbacca at the Twin Cities marathon.\"\n\nThis just made me laugh out loud at my desk. Rrrruuuurrr!\n\nEvery year the herd of turkeys beat me at the Thanksgiving 5k\n\nWell they're running for their lives.\n\nI got beaten by a dude who was juggling while he ran.  I remain bitter.  I can't run a 23 min 5k no matter what I do and he did it while juggling.  Also got beaten by a 3 legged dog.  Less bitter about that.  The dog has more legs than me so it isn't fair.\n\nlol at this. And you are right about that dog. Unfair advantage\n\nSpent the back half of a half marathon trying to catch a hunky dude in a tooth fairy costume. I started to lag and he probably finished 5-10m before me.\n\nNot beaten by but I once went through halfway at London marathon on 2.45 pace and overtook someone in a full body lobster suit. \n\nEither he set off really early or he was one speedy lobster.\n\nNot a costume - but a guy wearing flip flops overtook me on sunday at manchester. \n\nLuckily i overtook him again. Props to him for wearing flip flops though.\n\nGirl dressed as a Pepto Bismol bottle beat me in the Krispy Kreme Challenge this year\n\nI don’t want to say it was a costume, but I fell apart during my first ever half marathon the last mile and I got passed by a dad wheeling their kid in a stroller. When they passed me I let out an audible “OH COME ON”. I definitely look back at that moment and feel like I was an asshole haha as he killed it…but at the time that crushed me and knocked my confidence down a peg haha\n\nThe babies in the bob strollers! \n\nAlways laugh a little thinking that that damn toddler beat me again 😅\n\nIn the Royal Parks half marathon in 2010, I was overtaken on the finishing straight by a giant carrot, and then by a Smurf who was chasing the carrot.\n\nIn Morrocco, there was someone wearing a human-sized replica of the Eiffle tower on their body for a half I ran. Not sure what it was made of, but it looked uncomfortable\n\nI was neck and neck with a guy in a Borat mankini in NYC. I kept him just behind me so I wouldn’t have to look at him but also not too far behind because the amount of cheering was amazing. \n\nETA:  this guy. https://youtu.be/s4lHNcD5SSI?si=r3u6fA0hDFtD8hBs\n\nWas there a caterpillar at Boston?  There was one at Manchester that ran sub 3\n\n2014 Marine Corp Marathon. Mile 14 or so. I’d under-prepared due to work stress so was about to start walking way ahead of schedule.\n\nThen I got passed by an active duty Marine.\n\nIn full fatigues.\n\nWith a full pack on his back.\n\nMissing his right leg below the knee.\n\nI wasn’t embarrassed I was in awe and thought if this guy isn’t walking then by God neither am I! Inspired me to go another 5-6 miles before mixing in the walking…\n\nNot a costume, but someone in sandals\n\nLondon Marathon 2013. Apple cart with the wheels removed and handles front and back, filled with apples. One guy in the front, one in the back, carried that thing all the way. Overtook me, the legends. I was also overtaken by a Big Ben and two rhinoceros.\n\nAn ovary\n\nThe lack of any further explanation makes this all the better\n\nFully nude man. Passed me and beat me in the Bay to Breakers race in San Francisco, CA.\n\nGuy wearing jeans cutoff to be 2” shorts, a wifebeater, and a porn ‘stache at a half I ran a few years ago finished ahead of me by a good 30 minutes.  I didn’t feel too bad. He placed first overall.\n\nWinnie the Pooh, Piglet and Tigger came past me at about the 35km mark in the Paris marathon. That was a low point.\n\nNot me, but I witnessed a grade school boy get lapped during a race by a grade school girl in a tutu. It wasn’t a costume 5K at all. His dad tried really hard to pep him up after that but even when you’re 8, that’s a hard hit to the ego.\n\nAlmost got beat by a girl recently in a tutu! She ran like 21 flat for the 5k though. Looked like she was out for a casual jog by the photos meanwhile I’m destroying myself.\n\nI think I did eventually pass him, but there was a guy at the Philly Half dribbling a basketball who was ahead of me for far too long.\n\nguy pushing a child in a plastic race car with plastic wheels (it was making an obscene scraping sound - likely a ton of drag plus the weight of a 4-year old) blasted past me about 1k into a 5k and I never caught him.\n\nThe very old CEO of the company I worked for easily passed me up at a local park one morning years ago. I'm unsure if he saw me but I defintely saw him.\n\nNot costumed, but in my first 10k I was passed by a guy in a sling whose pants kept falling down. He’d run for about 30 seconds, then need to hoist his falling pants up with his non-slinged arm. He chatted as he passed me and another runner, said he fell and dislocated his shoulder a few days prior. Then he was gone, but we did get to chat about his pants pulling up technique for the rest of the race.\n\nFeeling slightly better now about being lapped by Father Christmas on my first Christmas parkrun.\n\nA guy in full.plate mail armour (think knights armour) overtook me on a hill in a 5 mile race. Think is, it was 35c (95f). Race was nearly cancelled it was so hot.\n\nI've never been a fast runner, but it felt pretty bad getting beaten in a 10k by a guy running with a TUBA and PLAYING it as he ran 😂😭\n\nIn the first 5k I ever ran, I made a turn and was struggling up a hill. I'm sucking air, huffing and puffing my way up the hill when out of the corner of my eye I see a stroller passing me. Oh wait, that's a double stroller with 2 kids in it. This lady keeps sliding past me, like no problem, and then I notice she's wearing jorts. Ouch.\n\nToronto Waterfront Marathon - 100 meters from the finish line I got passed by a guy carrying a full-sized ironing board AND iron. He was working on a Guinness Record. He got it, and I was in the background of one of the pictures that ended up in Canadian Running magazine.  [link](https://runningmagazine.ca/sections/runs-races/quebec-runner-sets-strange-guinness-world-record-at-toronto-waterfront-marathon/)\n\nI got beat by a guy dressed as a Wheaties box during a 5k. He absolutely crushed it, completing the race in 15 minutes and some change.\n\nSomeone had to feel bad losing to this guy with a fridge on his back https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-marathon-world-record-fridge-police-b2487152.html\n\nAt the mad dog 10k in Southport a few years back there was 4 guys dressed as the Jamaican bobsleigh team complete with bobsleigh. They where always just ahead of me I never caught up with them\n\nI once did a race with my friend where I was in the 31-35 group and he was in the 26-30 group.  I came in second in my group, behind a guy pushing a stroller.  The funny part is my buddy finished first in his group with a slower time than me.  It still comes up like 15 years later, and he makes sure to remind me that he won his age group while I lost to a guy pushing a stroller.\n\nNot running, but during the bike portion of my second triathlon I was passed by a guy riding a fat tire mountain bike... that wasn't even in the race, he was just out for his morning ride.\n\nSo, I didn’t participate in this race but was running in the other direction at the same time this race was going on and it was hilarious to see everyone desperately trying to chase after a pink bunny and a mustard container both coming and going! 🤣\n\nNot exactly a costumed thing, but in my very first 5k I was beaten up by a person running completely barefoot, by another person pushing a stroller, and by an old gentleman who was likely over 70 years old. That old gentleman was kind enough to ask me if I was feeling ok.\n\nI watched my friend beat a guy in a banana by only 10 seconds in a half marathon. My friend ran 1:12:01 &amp; the banana ran 1:12:11. He was a really frickin’ fast banana\n\nHave run Javelina so I don’t even know where to start. Some highlights I’ve been beaten by:  \n\nFred Flintstone complete with car \n\nScary Hello Kitty\n\n “Jim Walmsley at the 2016 Western States” \n\nBaby Shark \n\nA pineapple (am allergic so this was doubly humiliating) \n\n(Edit: god I hate formatting on mobile omggg) \n\nI had an older guy beat me while carrying a cane.  Don't know what he ever used it for but it made me feel slow as hell.\n\nI’m a relatively new runner and slow as hell so everyone and their mum can overtake me, but two guys in full Stormtrooper armour on a boiling Australian day is up there\n\nI’ve been passed in three marathons by a guy who juggles. It was a bit demoralizing but he was a nice guy. \n\nAlso my friend dressed up as a walk to encourage people around the 16 mile mark in the marine corps and someone didn’t just reach out to hit (with a high five) the wall.  They took a flying leap and drop kicked him in the chest.\n\nTwo guys dressed as an elf and a reindeer and were *dying* crossed the finish line about a second after me.\n\nI only beat them because they stopped to take a sad, sweaty photo with drunk santa.\n\nDid beat the guy who was juggling 3 footballs the entire 10 miles though!\n\nMy girlfriend, with Office shoes...\n\nI was running the Soldier's Marathon several years ago. With about 2 miles to go, I got passed by a guy in full cowboy getup, including boots and hat. I tried desperately to catch up, but couldn't do it.\n\nI was beaten in a 5k by a guy with one leg.\n\nI got beat by a person dribbling not one but two basketballs at my marathon. To be fair I think he set the world record, but I'm still kind of bitter about it. \n\nI was working on my joggling for awhile just because I was determined to repay the favor to somebody.\n\nJuggling gumby not only juggled a whole turkey trot he straight up beat me and most of the pack.  I was very humbled.\n\nI didn't get beaten, but this guy was running in hospital clothes, full on bandages and an IV filled with beer\n\nAt the 2019 Boston Marathon a muscular, barefoot caveman in just a loin cloth passed me at Wellsley. I cou'd hear the scream tunnel getting louder aa he passed through.\n\nA minion\n\nIn 2019 I was beaten in a trail run by a guy in a black morph suit. The memory of him silently passing me has haunted my low-light trail runs for literal years.\n\nDude dressed as Buddy the Elf absolutely smoking me with a killer kick in the final 200m of a 10km. Seriously think he closed in less than 28 seconds.\n\nNot a costume, but ran a 50k trail race in KY and some guy forgot his shoes and ran the whole thing in Teva sandals and socks, and finished ahead of me.\n\nMario / Luigi in overalls and Timberlands. Luigi stopped for a cigarette break and hopped back in and smoked me after smoking his cig. Lowest point in my marathon running career.\n\nSomeone was juggling the entirety of my first half marathon…\n\nIt's a dream of mine to run a race in my jack sparrow costume, but I worry about sweating the beard off\n\nPassed at the Silverstone half marathon about 3k from the end by a guy who was bouncing 2 basketballs the whole way around. Didn’t mind, but I could hear the constant noise of them hitting the floor for the rest of the race 🤦‍♂️\n\nActually beat me: a banana. That damn thing was running sub-7 splits in a 5k.\n\nDidn't beat me, but fun to be around for a while (back in like 2014 or 2015): four people in prison stripes. Each had last names across the upper-back of the stripes, like on a jersey. The three I remember were LOHAN, RICE, and PETERSON (who ran with a branch/switch).\n\nMy first 10km as a chubby untrained 19yr old.  An elderly man (easily in his 70's) pushing a guy in a wheelchair who had a boombox playing Yellow Submarine on repeat. Kept up with them for about 1km then he just pulled away.\n\nMy first Great North Run, it was raining heavily by the time we got to mile 12. And I was passed by a guy wearing a SpongeBob costume he'd made out of a block of upholstery foam, which by that point must have weighed a ton. Fair play.\n\nlol my hubby got beat by the turkey at the turkey trot. I finished 4th female overall 😉\n\nWhen i was in my early 30's I was beaten by 5 minutes in a 5k by a guy in his 50's pushing twins in a stroller.\n\n It embarrassed, but my very first real race was the Disney Half marathon.  I watched, as I was going out, a guy dressed as Tinkerbell go past on the other side in the lead.  The next day, same guy did the marathon as Snow White.\n\n2017 Chicago Marathon I got passed by a hot dog and a banana.\n\nI got beat at a half marathon by a group of army men and women doing the race in full gear (jackets, pants, backpack, boots). They were awesome.\n\nNot a costume but I got smoked by a woman who had to have been 7-8 months pregnant while pushing a double jogging stroller with 2 toddlers at a 10k. I was just happy to be getting myself across the finish line and she was running for 4.\n\nI got beaten by a naked guy in Bay to Breakers even though I averaged 6:30 a mile!\n\nThere is a popular 5k in my town and the university marching band does a fundraiser has their sousaphone players do the race (think tuba sized instrument more or less). And I always always get passed by more than one person carrying one of the giant, undignified instruments. To be honest though getting beat by a sousaphone player has become a beloved annual tradition for me.\n\nBig Bird during a 5k and I consider it an honor\n\nThe NYRR 60K in central park was the day of a run for the elephants 5K. I'm struggling about 30K in and this guy in a full elephant costume (including a tail) comes up to me and my friend. We have a conversation for about 3K where he finally realizes that we are trying to run 60K. He informed us that even though he was dressed in a head to toe elephant costume, that we were the crazy ones. As we near the end of the loop towards Bethesda Terrace (where he was finishing) he picked up the pace massively.\n\nElephant man had a solid closing kick.\n\nNot me, but a friend of mine was passed at the finish line by a seven year old girl wearing street clothes and a fuzzy pink jacket at his first 5K. It was a bit humbling to him.\n\nI got out kicked by a woman in a hot dog suit at Grandmas Marathon.\n\nGuy running with a tuba beat me at last few miles of the 2012 Paris Marathon. And yes, he was playing it the whole time.\n\n“8th Marathon at 80”\n\nI wasn’t even mad tho.\n\nI got passed by a guy in a 3 piece suit at Mile 11 in a half marathon. Being Irish I tried like hell to run him down. No way was a guy in a suit going to beat me! Well he did of course. I ran like hell and burned myself out trying to catch him.\n\nGuy drinking a beer and playing a tuba 😫😫😫"

    "all_comment_text": "&gt;Consistently running more than a marathon a day began to take its toll.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After some minor tummy troubles in the early weeks, he was forced to take his first rest day after doctors found blood and protein in his urine on day 45.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But it was recurring back pain that caused the most concern.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On day 200, Mr Cook was forced to reduce his mileage and intensity at the request of a doctor in Nigeria - even missing consecutive days on day 205 and 206.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But in true Hardest Geezer style, he was not to be stopped.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He said: \"I took a couple of days to get some scans. No bone damage so figured the only option left was to stop mincing about like a little weasel, get the strongest painkillers available and zombie stomp road again.\"   \n  \nI'm not sure I'd class that as injury free! He's also bound to have had numerous sprains or repetitive impact injuries, not to mention hundreds of blisters burst and re-blistered all over again, but I don't think they're worth commenting on as he's a hard geezer.\n\nWatching his videos, over the last month or so he was saying that he was in pain all the time, but he just had to keep going to get it finished\n\nI started watching the early ones and like 10 days in he had 6/10 level (according to him, so I'm guessing pretty bad) ankle pain that he just kept running ultramarathons through. \n\nOkay running the length of a continent got my attention, what’d he do it for?\n\nfor charity  \nhas raised more than £750,000 during the run\n\nhe just felt like running\n\nThat day for no particular reason, I decided to go for a little run\n\nHe did it because no one else had done it before\n\nYeah he was straight up pissing blood. Hardest geezer, maybe ever\n\nI’m willing to bet it wasn’t blood and he was in rhabdo instead\n\nIn one of his videos a doctor confirmed it was not rhabdo. It was actually kidney stones\n\nIt was bright red and not dark brown. Definitely not rhabdo. Source: arm chair doctor\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou dropped this /s\n\nGood point. David goggins could have done this while carrying a boat and a log and making videos of himself talking to the camera every few miles\n\nStay hard !\n\nCan't imaging peeing blood.\n\nI’ll spare you the details, but this happened to me when I had a kidney stone. It’s pretty freaky!!\n\nBut does it hurt?\n\nThe actual peeing blood didn’t hurt, but every time the kidney stone moved, it was excruciatingly painful. And it’s pretty unpredictable. Like one time I was at a store and almost passed out because the stone started moving and all I could do was just keel over and wait for it to stop. I also had some complications from a shockwave procedure (to help break up the stone) and got extremely ill from that. But I swear that once the last piece of stone came out, it was like nothing ever happened and I immediately felt 100%. So weird. \n\nI haven’t given birth but have heard the pain of passing a stone is similar. Unfortunately, the only thing I got out of *my* labor was a little spiky rock lol.\n\nBut no leg or knee injuries? Got’dayumn.\n\n&gt;he's a hard geezer.\n\nSome say the hardest\n\nHe's 27, I don't see how that makes him a geezer\n\nGeezer is an ageless term in the Uk mate\n\nThe runs turned him into one\n\nWhat has his age got to do with it?\n\nHe's ran a thousand lifetimes worth of miles. A geezer is being modest - he's ancient.\n\nAnd one could argue it’s not really authentic if he’s needing to be under the influence to accomplish this goal. To me it’s not really admirable.\n\nI would bet your the kind of person who acts unimpressed by any incredible feat a person may accomplish, but have accomplished very little in life yourself\n\nUnder the influence of what, pain relief? Give over you wet wipe\n\nBruh I don’t even care if you’re captain america, running the entire length of Africa will always be an accomplishment or “admirable” imo\n\nThere's always one person that shits on an amazing achievement\n\nHe absolutely got multiple injuries and is gonna need a shit ton of recovery time\n\nYet he's signed up for the London Marathon in 10 days time, maniac 😅\n\nJesus, well I guess 26 miles is nothing to him at this point\n\nRecovery run 😅\n\n“Easy zone 2 run”\n\nThis made me holler ahahaha\n\nHe'll be fresh as a daisy by then with a couple weeks off!\n\nWhat an animal, by far the most impressive runner I've ever seen\n\nWow is that true? I had a little google but couldn’t find anything\n\nYeah he mentions it on the Happy Hour Podcast, just released\n\nCan you share the link of the episode?\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/3IXdfbf420YmLzAvuu9mBd?si=7HYNg9FTRqC18r06vs92zA\n\nI hope I’m allowed to post this\n\nWhilst I admire the commitment, this is just plain silly now. His body will not forgive him\n\nHe's the poster boy for mentally ill ultra runners lol.\n\nhe averaged over a marathon for a year, what's one more...?\n\nWhat makes you say that? \n\nThe London marathon is bush league for him at this point (pun intended)\n\nIt wasn’t injury free.  Dude was pissing blood at one point.  He just ran through most of the problems he had or he had to stop and slow down multiple times through out the run.\n\nlove pushing yourself but im too scared of getting rhabdo for shit like this lol\n\nWhen he was dealing with the rhabdo scare I was genuinely quite concerned I was watching a guy vlog a journey that would ultimately lead to his death.\n\nObviously, his experience isn't the norm.\n\nLol otherwise you’d be all about 70 mile days through Africa? It’s just the rhabdo fears stopping you? You must be a phenomenal ultra runner then\n\nBe nice\n\nLol\n\nthat's not what i meant at all, who hurt you bub?\n\nReading is tough\n\nI would also imagine that he just has the right genetics to be as “injury free” as he was — I suspect that most people would just straight up die if they tried to push through the way he did.\n\nHow does running so much cause you to piss blood?\n\nYour muscles take a ton of damage, and your body tries to recycle/remove the damaged cells. Your kidneys do this all the time normally, but if there is too much your kidneys cant keep up, and the stuff just ends up unprocessed in your urine. Its also really bad for your kidneys when this happens and can cause permanent damage\n\n[deleted]\n\nDid you go to a doctor or just roll with it?\n\nI went to the doctor.  In some cases in men it can suggest serious illness.  In my case it was just due to hard exercise with an empty bladder.\n\nLmfao\n\nMy nipples would have chafed to the point of disappearing. Like holding a piece of balsa wood to a power sander.\n\nThis is delightfully Partridgean\n\nFantastic term!\n\nHe had to cut the side off the shoe because his foot was so messed up. He saw countless doctors for multiple reasons. He was just relentless. His YT channel is a good place to start for answers. Enough videos to keep you busy for a week or two\n\nWeek or two? \n\nI’ve been watching through it for a couple months already, albeit I’m a slow watcher\n\nI think every one of his videos since at least January have mentioned how much pain he was in, but that he just had to keep going. His back seemed to give him the most long term trouble, but even at the backend of the journey he was getting Achilles issues.\n\nInjury free is a far stretch lol\n\nHe didn’t. He was pretty beaten up at various stages. I tracked him the whole way, watched every YouTube episode etc and at one stage he was forced to take a few days off and had a CT etc (in Nigeria, from memory) because he was so fucked. Ultimately though your body adapts pretty quickly to repeated stresses. I remember spending 7 months in Afghanistan - I was absolutely fine despite frequent and very punishing foot patrols etc. The minute I got back to Camp Bastion at the end of my tourmy body clearly realised it was safe and just promptly fell apart. Same after several punishing weeks on an army course - fine all the way through and then immediately afterwards my knee just blew up to about twice the normal size once I was in a car heading home. After finishing the Cape Wrath Ultra (400km in 8 days) I and just about every other runner completely piled in too. I daresay Russ Cook’s body now is going through something similar.\n\nEver since I had an angry PTI tell me to “get a grip and stop piling in”, the phrase makes me smile. Such an excellent way to neatly summarise falling apart!\n\nPTIs reliably have excellent banter.\n\nAnd to be fair, aren’t actually *that* bad if you’re making an effort!\n\nIt’s the same rule as if being chased by a predator of some description. You don’t need to be the fastest, just avoid being the slowest.\n\n“Last 10 go again!” 🥴 \n\nI’ve ran, hiked, rucked, cross-trained for years and sometimes I just look at a trail &amp; strain my calf.  I don’t get it.\n\nHe didn't. He's really banged up. Remember when he was pissing blood?\n\nDefine \"injury\".\n\nMany runners have \"injuries\" that other runners don't think are \"injuries\".\n\n&gt; Are you hurt, Flea, or just injured?\n\nHe had injuries along the way but he (mostly) just pushed through\n\nHe didn’t\n\nCan reccomend Scott Jureks book; North: Finding My Way While Running the Appalachian Trail. Will give you quite the insight in doing something similar.\n\nBeen looking for running books recently so thank you for the reco!\n\nI read his book “eat &amp; run,” came away from it really disliking him as a person but I’ll admit the book was forthcoming and honest. It’s unusual in that it’s a memoir with recipes between chapters, so he explains how his wife left him and took half his physical therapy business and then gives the reader a vegan pancake recipe\n\nLol I just listened to the audiobook on a road trip recently it cracked me up a bit toward the end because it was like \"I was lost and felt like I was done and washed up and didn't know what to do with my life anymore. Anyways, here's a recipe for some vegan cookies\"\n\nOne foot in front of the other\n\nOnes and twos\n\nJust the thought of going for a run gives me shin splints. This guy is an absolute beast.\n\nHe's a BEAST!\n\nNo top level athlete is injury free. They trade longevity for success in sport.\n\nIf you have Spotify watch the latest Happy Hour podcast episode with him; I think there was a part where he explained his response to injuries\n\nThere’s a 90 episode YouTube series on his run\n\nHe wasn't injury free. He was pissing blood pretty early on.\n\nI know man had kidney problems to the point he was peeing blood.\n\nBro doesnt understand what injury-free means lol\n\nPat Farmer ran 21,000km over 10 months starting at the North Pole and finishing at the south pole... Supposedly without injury!\n\n\nSome people are just built differently it seems!\n\nHe definitely WAS NOT injury free. Well… he didn’t break anything, but he definitely got a lot of blisters, peed blood, shat himself, and everything in between. I followed Russ from the start. I felt like I was with him. Amazing feat that deserves more credit\n\nNot a single Let Russ Cook joke in here?\n\nI was amazed at how bad his diet was. Obviously this was due to the crazy places he found himself and what was locally available, but the sheer volume of energy drinks and crisps was insane.\n\nProbably helped to stop the food poisoning and symptoms from changing food types. \n\nI thought the same, although the videos kind of focused on the treats, and less of the Huel and whatever else he was shovelling down. Ultimately, if you’re running ultra distances day after day you just need tons of calories, but you also need protein to help your muscles rebuild. I guess he got that from the Huel, supplemented by locally sourced meat.\n\nReally enjoyed his YouTube videos.\n\nNorwegain Ultrarunner Simen Holvik is quoted saying (translated): Running over 50 kilometers per day on average is not very impressive in itself and is something anyone can do. What you experience when you run long distances is that after a week everyday life disappears and the body is adjusted to the task, says ultrarunner Simen Holvik.\n\nWhile I myself think this sounds insane, I guess the part that the body adapt to the running pretty quick makes sense.\n\n  \n[https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/i/WR42PG/ranet-kidnappet-og-matforgiftet-naa-er-han-snart-foerstemann-til-aa-loepe-afrika-paa-langs](https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/i/WR42PG/ranet-kidnappet-og-matforgiftet-naa-er-han-snart-foerstemann-til-aa-loepe-afrika-paa-langs)\n\nWhat I don't understand is how these people don't fall out with shin splints progressing to stress fractures within the first week\n\nyes exactly, I don't get it :S\n\nHe was far from injury free, I can't remember what countries he was in, but there was lower back pain that almost crippled him, pissing blood etc\n\nHave you watched his videos, at one point he was pissing blood.\n\nI don’t think he was injury free. His back and hips are for sure injured, and he’s referenced his Achilles “hanging on by a thread”. He’s just ignored the injuries for the most part as long as they weren’t life threatening.\n\nHe didn't, he had a few issues while running and was advised to stop, he just decided to push through \n\nIf you listen to the latest episode of Jaack Maate's Happy Hour podcast you can hear him talk about it\n\nBecause.... he didn't finish inury-free. Watch the whole and you will understand. Btw in the end the body looks really mess.\n\nCopious amounts of painkillers and PEDs just like Iron Cowboy\n\nWatch Running the Sahara to get a good view of what “not being injured” looks like for a runner putting in these types of miles. Anyone sane would call it “being severely injured.”\n\nDid you even watch the series before making that assumption?\n\nOn the penultimate day, he was saying how his body was breaking down. He was hitting 85km’s a day at that point.\n\nThought this was a Russell Wilson post 😂\n\nLocked in\n\nNot only was he injured, he was robbed at gunpoint and almost kidnapped too https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Africa\n\nI'm not sure if you mean leg/foot injuries OP, but if that's the case, I think proper running style is key, I've been watching Scott Jurek and reading up on it. I've been running for 6-7 months, and I'm still working on my running technique.\n\nWhy he stopped tracking running on his garmin and swiched to workout for some period?\nAnyone knows?\n\nhe didn't\n\nHe walks a lot and goes very slow \n\nVery carefully?\n\ni suspect it’s not quite what we think it is. how come we hear of him at the “final leg” of his adventure?!\n\nYou\n\nBeing born a white man and having a team to support him probably helped\n\nDelete your account\n\nYou've been born a dumbass, obviously 😂\n\nAre you serious right now\n\nIdk if being white helps running through Africa. Racism tends to work the other way around in most countries he ran through. \n\nAlso I think it was Jamie who kept on joking about how much easier it would be if they could just replace Russ with Mo Farah.\n\nThe team ofc was essential, but it was more like a couple of pals trying to make it all work with limited resources than a team of professionals working around Russ."

    "all_comment_text": "Agree. I ran this the past two years and there wasn’t this amount of complete disarray in every aspect of the experience. Something’s changed and I’m not going to do it next year\n\nThey added about 3000 additional runners compared to last year (2100 to the half and 765 to the full), which I think accounts for a lot of the traffic/congestion issues. No excuse for the lack of traffic control and aid stations, but it helps explain the added chaos. \n\nNever doing this race again. I got there at 515 am and missed my 630 am start because of the chaotic shuttle situation. Oversold it to make some more money and it made everything worse off.\n\nI've had the exact same experience. This is the third year in a row I've run the full and this year was wildly chaotic and disorganized. The thing that got me this year was the line for half marathoners to pick up their gear check bags. It was incredibly long (90+ minute) wait for some and race organizers were telling people to email them and pick up their gear later in the week. Wild!\n\nFollowing Esteban Prado's disqualification I should have been DQ'd as well for the beer I grabbed at 22 and the Otter Pop at 24. So stupid and such a bad look on the OC Marathon on it's 20th anniversary.\n\nHoag sponsored it. When you have a \"non profit\" hospital sponsor and they don't give out water. I wondering how many patients they got that day from dehydration? Hoag is a joke and so is every event they put on. \n\nThe whole event sounds like it was a cluster. Lack of mile markers, lack of hydration stations or existing stations not adequately stocked or manned, traffic not properly blocked off in some locations, parking being so bad some people were late for the start... whoever was in charge of organizing the race should be fired.\n\nJudging by the rest of the info, the person actually ran by a water table to grab the bottle. Still I'm not entirely sure how this was unfair or worth a DQ.\n\nThis is outside just that guy. His punishment is justified, maybe, but just how badly run the event was has contributed to the concerns people have. His punishment is not in a vacuum. \n\nThere are plenty of runner accounts of missing tables, tables out of water entirely, electrolyte tables missing and areas where the traffic wasn't blocked and cars were cossing the course. \n\nMeanwhile, the parking situation being knarled up so badly it took hours to park because they hadn't apparently planned for it. People were late for the race start because the event didn't even have people directing parking traffic. \n\nMaybe the guy deserved his punishment, but it doesn't make the organizers any less culpable for how badly organized they were. Some of the stuff they screwed up were literally health and safety hazards.\n\nI feel like this are two very distinct issues. I find it quite far fetched that such an elaborate hydration/fueling strategy (having a family member pace you on a bike through the course and exchange multiple bottles) would simply manifest during the course of the race after encountering a few unprepared water stations. These plans, especially for runners capable of winning races, are thought out in detail well in advance. It's plausible he didn't know the rules, though that's still on him. Though maybe he watches a lot of running influencers and thought this sort of thing was the norm.\n\n  \nAs far as the race organization, I wasn't in the full (I ran the half, which started an hour later and thus had  more time for set up) but I found most of the race organization to be par the course for this size/quality of race. Regarding the parking situation, after getting annoyed at the situation for packet pickup (and the $12 price tag to park in a large nearly empty lot), I followed the pre-race instructions and parked at the start line, which ended up being easy and completely fine for me. It sounds like things got worse as the day went on, unfortunately. Much could have been improved, but perhaps I have very low expectations...\n\nAdding on to your analysis: this feels like they’re upset they didn’t know the rule or upset they got called out and disqualified. If you’re moderately competitive in USATF road racing the no outside help rule is common knowledge. They’re finding flaws with the race to combat the flaws in their strategy.\n\nIf they’re arguing that the race shouldn’t disqualify them under USATF rules because the race wasn’t under USATF guidelines, that could work, but they may piss off a few hundred runners who used that day as a qualifier for something else.\n\nI kind of agree with you about the guy. The basic optics were that he got screwed but once you dig deeper, the disqualification seems more justified.  Still, not having the water stations up and running properly is definately not ok.\n\nReminds me of the guy who went for the OTQ in Philly. At first his coach said \"Oh I didn't know the rules\". And it was soon revealed he was riding along the course supporting the athlete and even getting club members to help him get his water bottles placed in different spots and even handed to him. \n\n8 stations in the last half of the race, \"some\" of which had electrolytes? That seems a little crazy for a race that was also the RRCA championship.\n\nMakes me wonder if this *other* USTAF rule was followed (241.2(d)):\n\n\"In National Championships of 20k and longer, the Organizing Committee shall make provisions for the collection and distribution of personal refreshments for those competing for the championship, as determined by the Games Committee.\"\n\nThis thought had crossed my mind.  Maybe they were supposed to provide elite tables, but didn't (or did and failed to set those up in time).  Then again, you don't make up your own rules.\n\nEdit: To be honest, I don't know if RRCA and USATF share the same rules.  OC is run by USATF rules but it isn't their national championship.\n\nI was wondering about that too, but it seems strange to functionally disqualify someone from the RRCA championships for a rule from USATF then not follow the USATF rule for championships, even if that rule would be optional because it is the RRCA championships.\n\nThey were watering down the Gatorade a lot too lol. Only a couple of stations had actual Gatorade as opposed to the powdered version.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIsn't there video of him running past a water station with hands holding cups to get a bottle from his dad who was pacing him on a bike? That's fine if he's a middle finisher, but 2nd place was 17 secs behind and if 2nd place didn't get the same treatment, the DQ is deserved imo.\nEdit- https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/sports/runner-disqualified-winner-oc-marathon-water/3405692/ video in the article shows Dad on a bike next to him with water. Runner veers away from the manned water table to Dad on the other side of the lane. \n\nIt's not just the water either. Outside assistance includes not having a dude who can give you coaching on your pacing and form, telling you how the field behind you is doing, and maintaining a consistent speed near you to help you with pacing. I don't know that his dad did any of that, but these are the types of reasons it's just not allowed.\n\nthats pretty damning\n\nYeah I have to admit when I first read about this I was imagining this guy getting frustrated with no promised aid from the race and needing water and only being able to get it from his dad. But this video looks really different. \n\nThe whole things sounds like chaos though from what I've read.\n\nPardon my ignorance but how exactly is this an unfair advantage?\n\nEDIT: Wait this was only this dude's SECOND race?! Did I hear that wrong? WTF am I doing wrong?!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat makes sense thank you.\n\nWouldn't anyone who brings their own bottle have the same opportunity?\n\nyes, but water is weight. \n\nI’m sure runners are allowed to carry their own water, but they have to carry it from the start line.\n\n&gt;EDIT: Wait this was only this dude's SECOND race?! Did I hear that wrong? WTF am I doing wrong?!\n\nSecond marathon maybe, but Athlinks suggests he's been racing regularly since 2013, so he should be more than familiar with USATF rules by now.\n\nWell, a high school teammate of mine got 6th place at NYC in 2011 for her first ever marathon.  Of course, she might have been top 8 in the world for the 3000m and did the marathon as part of her prep for the London Olympics, but still, first ever marathon.\n\nI think he meant it was his second marathon. He said he's consistently running 100 mile weeks. He's an accomplished runner who won a half marathon earlier this year in something like 1:07 and completed the CIM Marathon in December in 2:25. He's been performing at a high level since at least high school, just in shorter races - like a 4:23 1600 meters in high school 6 years ago (9 meters short of a mile).\n\nSecond marathon. I’m old (it was my second also), but my kid and all his young college buddies ages 20-22 just ran their first marathon and they all qualified for New York &amp; Boston, averaging about 12 minutes under BQ. They are in a college running club, but none had done greater than 10K races. Young, fit and they trained for this goal for about 6 months.\n\nI'm not sure about the first shot, it could've been for electrolytes. but the 2nd and 3rd shots they show the santa ana river and the stretch to get back into the fairgrounds, which is where I didn't see any aid stations. And the 2nd place guy was carrying a water bottle so fortunately didn't have to rely on the stations during the last stretch.\n\nThe unfair advantage argument still applies if he gets electrolytes and the others don't, or if he gets more aid when the others don't, and more importantly, if he gets aid ferried to him while others have to carry their own. \nThe second place winner was only 17 seconds behind. I'll bet he felt pretty salty everytime he saw his opponent get a swig of water (or whatever) and pass it back to his dad when he had to carry his own. \n\nI agree, I just think it's also bs that oc marathon is coming out and saying that everything was setup. I personally didn't see the aid stations and everybody around me was complaining too.\n\nI posted a separate rule in the same section as the rule he violated, which states that the race must provide for the collection and distribution of personal refreshments at official stations for those participating in a championship of 20km or more. So, in theory, everyone should have had similar access to their personal electrolyte mix. (But it sounds like the organizers failed to provide for personal bottles?)\n\nSo why are runners allowed to use their own goo packs?\n\nThere's a separate rule that basically says that a runner can use anything (that is not a banned substance) they carry with themselves as long as they have it on them at the start of the race.\n\nSo, in theory, you could carry tablets and powders on you with a bottle, and pour water from the aid stations into the bottle and mix your own bottle on course too. But the rules also state that the race organizers should make it possible to have your personal bottle at a designated aid station (again, only for championships, which this was).\n\nWas his dad pacing him the entire race on the bike?  Seems like if he was just spectating along the course, how would he know that aid stations up ahead wouldn't have water? And he'd then have to go get his bike and water and then catch-up to his son.  It sounds like this race was poorly organized and had issues, but you can't have someone biking next to you for the majority of the race and expect them to recognize you as the winner.\n\nI am a very casual runner who has never done a race longer than 10k. Can someone ELI5 why that's bad?\n\nRace directors want to make sure the race is fair and that no one has access to any special treatment/benefits that other runners don't have.  Water/nutrition availability for the marathon distance is very important.  The race provides a certain number of water stations throughout the course that all runners can use - and they are typically spread out every mile to two miles.  If you had someone riding along next to you handing you a bottle of water/other form of supplement whenever you needed it and not just at the designated water stops, it would be considered an advantage/benefit not available to other runners - especially if some water stations were not yet set-up when the lead runners came through. Also, having someone ride next to you on a bike throughout the course and providing exact pacing assistance/encouragement/updates on where other runners are, is also considered an advantage.  The marathon is a long race and can get pretty dark psychologically the last few miles.  If my dad was next to me the entire time spurring me on for the last few miles, that would definitely be a HUGE advantage. \n\nAlso, one thing to keep in mind is that having family members hand you water/food out on the course is not considered that big of a deal if you're a runner who's not vying for a top place finish.  No one would care or say anything. However, if you're in one of top spots, it's a big violation.\n\nSomeone providing you individual aid outside of an aid station would, however, get you disqualified from most ultramarathons, even if you’re the most average back-of-the-pack runner.\n\nYep!   As a back of the pack runner I know that my crew has to meet me at “crew access” points.  Triathlons are the same (even more restrictive).  No runner thinks you can just receive ad hoc support whenever you want.  \n\nAnd really- think of the consequences if this *wasnt* a violation.  All of the elites would have a coach following them for the race, clogging the course with bikes/unofficial pacers/etc.  Folks trying to Boston qualify might do the same.  It would be chaos.\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nSaw one comment on a non-running sub talk about how the dad might have been slipping him *electrolytes*, as if they’re banned and only water can be taken drank. 🙃\n\nI ran the half and it was my first marathon of any kind. So many stations had tables covered in cups that were all totally empty. I’d then have to hold out for the next station and again, empty cups. \n\nThen stations that did have water would hand you a cup that was only a quarter full. No idea if all this is typical for marathons but it was pretty frustrating as a thirsty runner.\n\nNo comment on this winner disqualification, just saying I don’t blame anyone for skipping the stations. They slowed me down only to have no water.\n\nThe quarter full part is normal because you'd spill most of it if you took a full cup mid-run.\n\n&gt; No idea if all this is typical for marathons but it was pretty frustrating as a thirsty runner.\n\nThis has not been typical for any of the races I ran.  Most places tend to have 3/4 full cups.  I only ran one marathon and it was the case there as well.  I'm told that marathon has excellent support though so maybe it's an exception.\n\nThis has also not been typical in my experience. At the first water station, I didn't even get one mouthful of water because the cup was so minimally filled. I was lucky later to get over ½ cup of electrolyte somewhere past the halfway point, but that was the only station I passed that had any electrolyte ready until the last station (by which time it's way too late).\n\nNo, this is dangerous. Runners will get dehydrated. Even if you spill a bunch, my races have at least 1/2 to 3/4 full cups. Some of it spills. You don’t have enough time to grab something 1/4 full, still spill a bit and be past the water station with 1 oz. down your throat.\n\nJust as a general note, a half marathon and a marathon are different events.  You did not run a marathon.  Neither did I as I was running in the same event as you. \n\nYup, I know that.\n\nI’m a new runner and can only speak to the 5K, but my experience of the event from long lines to park, unexpected $12 parking fees, unclear directional signage for bib pickup, unclear starting line location, to unclear location of the bathrooms was not great. \nStrangely, those of us who finished the 5K first and wanted to leave were told we couldn’t go to the parking lot to our cars because the race course blocked access.  There was no way to get to the parking lot without crossing the course.  There were 3600 people in the 5K, and if you finished under 30 minutes, you were expected to wait until the race was over.  It could have been an hour wait, but people just started ignoring the security guard and timing the gaps.  It was comical.\nClearly there were logistical issues all weekend.\n\nIs this a US thing? I know of elite runners who had coaches cycling round the course and I thought you could get drinks etc from anywhere?\n\nMaybe a US thing but I would be surprised. I'm more familiar with triathlon where this would still be forbidden.\n\n\nOne thing that might be confusing is that there *are* some events that *require* outside aid.\n\nI’m sure it would vary, but this would be a logistical nightmare for either urban or rural\nraces I’ve participated in, in the US and Canada. Imagine at least 30 elite women and men each having bike support along the whole course. I’ve never seen a race that allows that. If you watch the majors or Olympic races, there are elite tables with their bottles marked by special colors or flags. I was far behind the elites in a race 2 weeks ago, but the signs were still there, “Elite table 100 m. ahead” and you could see the empty table where they grabbed their bottles earlier.\n\nI saw an interview of the guy who got DQ'ed and he gave me weird vibes...weirdly passive aggressively shaming/putting down the eventual winner in his interview, when he did enjoy special advantages (hydration, pacing, support, etc).\n\nWhen you win by 17 seconds and receive on demand hydration when your opponent doesn’t…\n\nHaving read the comments on this article in non-runner subs I have to admit I'm a little bit baffled. People seem to think this is some obvious rule, but I don't think I've ever heard of a road marathon where runners were banned from receiving water or fuel from non-official sources. Admittedly, I'm in no danger of ending up in a position to win a cash prize in any race that might offer it, but I know that Kipchoge literally hired a dude in Berlin to hand him his bottles during his world record races. \n\nI don't see any specific rules for \"elites\" in the OC Marathon page, but perhaps there were emails that went out specifically banning it in which case he'd obviously be in the wrong, but I'd want to see the receipts.\n\nFrom the elite application form, \"USATF Rules of Competition.  The marathon, half marathon, and 5K races will be conducted according to USATF Rules of Competition.\"  The race is part of the USATF SoCal Grand Prix.  While not every race disallows it or enforces it.  I feel like they have to even if its an honest mistake or organizer fault.\n\nHe was bib #1 so registered as an elite.  This is not his first marathon and knows what hes doing.\n\nWhatever other runners think is fair/unfair, which may be what is going on in many threads, in this case it is prohibited and outlined in the rules of the race.  Which is ultimately the responsibility of the runner to know especially at his level.\n\nI agree it may not be common knowledge but this rule applies in almost any race. You can't receive any form of assistance from spectators.\n\nIt's an obvious rule for anyone who registers as an elite. \n\nKlaus the bottle guy in Berlin was within the rules and approved ahead of time, other athletes had the option of getting a bottle guy if they wanted.\n\nThis isn't a concern for anyone except the top. No one cares if you took water from your mom if you're running a 4 hour marathon.\n\nCool, because my wife definitely tossed me a redbull during my marathon.\n\nKipchoges bottle guy could only hand him bottles at the aid stations.  He couldn't bike next to Kipchoge to give water whenever. \n\nYes, this. The elite table area is designated and that’s the only place where fuel/electrolytes could be offered.\n\nIt's pretty much always banned for elites\n\nHis dad paced him on a bike most/all of the race. I have never seen a race where this would be allowed.\n\nThey had even made a post today thanking their sponsors for offering hydration. They are a complete joke. I put up a comment let’s see how long before it’s deleted [https://www.instagram.com/p/C6pe-PjP492/?igsh=MWwwY2xqaXE0bHhlaQ==](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6pe-PjP492/?igsh=MWwwY2xqaXE0bHhlaQ==)\n\nHow does someone get to be a 2:25 marathoner without basic knowledge of rules!?\n\nAs a long time tail-ender I call BS.\nBeing at the wrong end of the pack I am used to aid stations emptied or closed all together, but there is no way the pointy end of the pack would have encountered this issue.\nThe pacing however sounds dodgy AF and I can imagine that prompting elimination.\nSad to hear the organisation fell  down this year. It is a good marathon, even if you do run right past the finish at about the 35k mark, just when you are questioning your life choices.\n\nMe, being a casual, very slow runner in several marathons. I had pacers, five friends with water who gave it to me, and snacks. I would have had no clue. Good thing I’ve never been in danger of winning a marathon. \n\nBS!\n\nI was at this race and it was top tier.  The logistics were perfect.  No complaints here"

    "body": "This morning, I was stressed.\n\nI had been training for months towards my first ever Half Marathon this Sunday, and was feeling REALLY bad about my performance.\n\nMy last 10k was on June 6th with a pace of 8:17/mile. \n\nDue to life being hectic, I only found time again to run on  June 10th. The plan was to run another 10k, but interruptions had me splitting it into two separate 2 mile runs each at a pace of 8:13/mile.\n\nTrying to catch up, I've been trying to run 5ks in the remaining days- only to feel gassed and only running 2 miles both yesterday and today. Today's wasn't even a good time for 2 miles.\n\nWhile all of this was happening, I knew in the back of my mind that a running partner that I was going with was planning a race pace of 8:45. All this obsession of numbers and seeing my stats going down had my guts in knots. I was going to look like a failure on Sunday.\n\n....until I remembered that the ENTIRE point of me signing up was for fun. That was the whole reason.\n\nI got so wrapped up in training that I forgot to actually enjoy myself with the process.\n\nHope this resonates with someone this afternoon. Happy race days.",

    "all_comment_text": "Never play catchup in the last 2 weeks before a race. You aren't going to make any training gains in that short a window and you are risking injury. Rest and be ready! \n\nBesides, first half marathon means it will be a shiny, new personal record Sunday!\n\nI got to a point about 4 years ago where I realized running was not making me happy. I was pushing myself hard, not getting enough sleep, and most importantly- not looking forward to my runs at all. And I just… quit. Prioritized sleep and relaxation for a year or more. I eventually decided to run but with a new mindset and less pressure on myself. I am slower. But I’m enjoying myself and I don’t stress over running anymore.\n\nMy brother says to me \"Focus on fun times not fast times\"\n\nI get very in my head about where I am now vs where I was a few years ago before life got in the way and I fell off the wagon hard.\n\nFantastic mantra! At mile 11 of my first half a couple weeks ago I started to get emotional in a bad way. \"Why am I so slow? What is wrong with me? Everyone will think less of me. There must be something wrong with me.\"\n\nBut then I told myself to be happy. I could either focus on the negatives (which aren't even true and don't even really exist) or I could focus on the positives. In 6 weeks I went from running 2 miles at a time to finishing a half marathon. My journey has just started and there's so much good I've already done for myself and will do for myself. I focused on fun, not fast.\n\nI'll definitely be stealing that mantra.\n\nI love that mantra so much I’m adopting it ❤️\n\nI did the same, except I’m coming up on year seven!🤷🏻‍♂️ I certainly do miss my long runs, but I don’t think my body can handle it anymore.\n\nSame here. What changed it for me was getting a dog running buddy. Now it’s all about making the run fun and enjoyable for her!\n\nI ran both of mine around 12. Around 8 is fantastic\n\n13 here.\n\nHelllll yea bruthaaa\n\nHell yeah! Give me a couple months and I'll be right there with you at 12. :D\n\nHow was Harvey Mudd? Is it a good school? How is the STEM there?\n\nIt was a lot of work.\n\nI see. Thank you for the response.\n\nYW\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhat field of work are you in?\n\n[deleted]\n\nI didn’t enjoy running until I got out started running on my own. It sucks being forced to run. We had pt 3X a week at 0630 and I dreaded it! Now I run with my dog in the evenings and it’s awesome.\n\nThanks for the reminder - I have to tell myself the same thing too. I started running to improve my health and I’ve continued to get more into it because I enjoy it. Sometimes I get stressed because I miss runs I had planned or I get discouraged that I’m still pretty slow (but much improved from where I started initially). I just tell myself I’m not a pro lol this is a hobby I’m supposed to enjoy!\n\nI started running because I was overweight and diagnosed as a T2. That was in 2009. I will run my 3rd marathon in Sept. I had been pushing myself to run farther and faster. It wasn't working. I finally just let go and decided that for me it's not about speed, it's about the accomplishment. I will run at about a 13 minute mile, I will finish the race and I will be thankful that at 64, a diabetic and cancer survivor that I can run a marathon.  Sometimes we overlook what is truly important.\n\nMy first half is in 5 weeks and I’m going to be completely happy with a 2:20 time. \n\nEveryone is on their own journey.  You are only racing against yourself, so you can be kind to yourself as well.\n\nI would kill (okay maybe not) for a 2:20. I'll get there on my journey. Or not! That's okay too.\n\nYour body needs somewhere around 10 days to recover and see benefits from hard training. Running a 5k at race pace a few days prior to the actual race is probably just going to hurt your actual race time so I'd chill out and do some very easy running.\n\nNeeded to hear this! Thank you and happy running to you!\n\nBest of luck on Sunday! I did my first half last month too. I almost quit a couple of weeks before. I was so stressed (parents were visiting me and they were a lot to deal with). But I'm glad I didn't quit. You've got this! (: \n\nI recently ran slowest half marathon (by like 20 minutes!) and it was the most fun I've ever had during a race! I felt great, cheered on everyone else (the marathon was an out and back), and just enjoyed the experience. I'm not going to win any prize money, might as well have a blast.\n\nStressful, relatable, and good advice. 10/10\n\nWhile improving times are nice, most if not all are never going to be super stars or even stars. It’s all about health and enjoyment. If you feel extra energy, go for it. As I age, I can work harder at it but times still get worse. So; in the final end, just enjoy it. My .02\n\nYou're all superstars to me, fwiw.\n\nYeah I had to remind myself recently that the point is to show up on the day, do it and hopefully enjoy some part of the run so I want to do it again! Not to mentally beat myself up beforehand about how much training I'm doing or whether I beat last year's time.\n\nIt was a wonderful story, by I think Matt Mullenweg. He was going through this little trail around his house biking and was killing himself to 20 minute total finish time. Exerting so much effort, stressing about it and just being exhausted afterward.\n\nHe did it one time just for fun with a friend and it took him like 21-22 minutes to finish it. And he realized that is a lot of extra effort for not a lot of gain. I don’t have the exact numbers, but that is more or less what it is. I’m glad you found out and realized it was just for fun.\n\nYour mixing between the metric and imperial system really really bothers me.\n\nWelcome to Canada.\n\nNot dropping dead in 20 years, that is what I ultimately hope to get out of it. But a chance to listen to podcasts and audiobooks in peace, generally feeling healthier, having ripped leg muscles (I live in a very hilly area), getting close to or beating my previous best, taking part in large organised events as someone with a fairly isolated life are all little things that make it worthwhile in the short term.\n\nThe moment I realise I'm not going to meet my goal on an upcoming race or on race day itself I just relax and enjoy the experience and atmosphere while using it as another training run. No point in risking injury or stress and anxiety trying to force it. No matter how perfect the training has gone you're body, or the conditions, on the day can just go 'Nope'. No point in letting it get you down, just make the most of what you have and look to the next event.\n\nI had a goal of finishing my city's half this year in under two hours. Did it for the first time last year and was at 2:01 after some great training. \n\nI was doing so good, cruising along and did a ten miler in November and my pace was right where I wanted it to be for the half this past May. \n\nThen I got injured! Nothing major, but late 30s now so recovery time is a lot. I was out of commission from late November to mid March. Slowly made a comeback and was able go run a couple tens before the race, but I was pretty frustrated that last week not being where I wanted to be. \n\nOne of my best friends texted me the night before the race and I woke up to, \"Good luck today! Enjoy it!\"\n\nAnd it made me smile, and I remembered the same thing you did, OP. \n\nI didn't hit under two hours, but I enjoyed it. 🙂\n\nHey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's easy to get caught up in the numbers and forget why we started in the first place—just to have fun! You're going to do great on Sunday. Btw, do you use any pre-workout or running chews? They can really help with energy and endurance. Happy running! 🏃‍♂️\n\nIt's never worth worrying about looking \"like a failure\" - especially when those who are looking are those you're ahead of anyway.\n\nI'm really sorry you felr like this.  It's completely normal to have doubts/nerves before a race, and also for a training plan to have been compromised a bit. \n\nHowever you should remember that you've already achieved more than most people just by doing the training and signing up for the race \n\nOnly one of the athletes will come first, but everyone can compete with their own times, and learn from race. \nYou can't always get a PB in every event - injury, weather, nutrition even badly run event can all get in the way.\n\nWhat you can do is just go out there, do your best, experience the event, and celebrate/bask in the glory of what you achieved.\n\nRemember you are awesome for doing this - go out there, smile and enjoy it.  I hope it goes well for you 🤞\n\nBeen through something similar… I had the impression my performance was getting worse and worse but it’s actually because I used to be happier while running. I’m trying to find my way back into it again\n\nI yearned to be fast, now I'm happy to be fit.  \n\nShow up.  Do your best.  Be proud of the runners we are today.\n\nIt absolutely resonated with me. I just finished a three mile run, in which I walked the last two miles. Humidity, heat, and a wonky knee. I need to take a step back.\n\nYeah, I find that I need this reminder frequently. \n\n\nI do it because it feels good to move and it's good for my brain when I'm outside &amp; away from other responsibilities. Unfortunately, I'm motivated by times and absolutely need consistency to keep going. \n\n\nThanks.\n\nYesssss 100% - I stopped looking at my watch in races and just running on feel.  I ain’t winning anything in my age bracket anyway!!!\n\nI'm not good to enough to compete, so I enjoy the events I paid money for.\n\nIn most cases it's just more fun to have a small chat, have a drink or do high fives than pushing myself for a good time.\n\nI have a minimum target time, but it's around 25 min slower than my PB.\n\nIn the end nobody cares about my performance and I get the same \"good job\" and cheers like the runner who is 20 min faster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck for your first Half Marathon and have a lot of fun!\n\nI only run 2 or 3 times a week, so I don’t end up hating it.\n\nTotally agree. Here one who is fighting just to finish without pain, thinking about metrics is not even an option for me.\n\nThe injury I'm recovering from, gave me that gift.\n\nI use to run twice a day. I pushed myself to be able to compete. I end up stressing my right ankle. I can no longer run as fast as i used to before. 8 years of training...\n\nYESSSS! Thanks I needed this! It’s about fun and enjoyment!\n\nI’ve (almost) always enjoyed running, but lately I’ve been really loving it. I run, shower, get in my car, and get jealous of the runners I see on my way to work. That doesn’t mean I’m not a jerk to myself for being behind on my yearly goal. Have a great race and don’t hurt yourself.\n\nSo true!\n\nNeeded to see this! I am running a half marathon this coming Sunday and could only hope for the best race day conditions. Coming from an ankle injury, I decided to just finish the distance and have fun while I'm at it. Running really is a privilege so I'll just make the most out of it on Sunday.\n\nIt's nice to take a step back sometimes and get a refreshing perspective on the whole situation. Good for you!"

    "all_comment_text": "I let my hands go limp and kinda fling my forearms around every once in a while to loosen up. I’m sure anyone who has seen me thinks I’m being chased by bees or something.\n\nHey me too! I go floppy arm/hands usually at the tail end of a long or hard run. I tell me myself it's to loosen up but really, it's because my body is slowly giving up piece by piece.\n\nNope, you’re not alone. I do this too from time to time when I need to reset my posture. I’ve seen other runners do it too!\n\nI do something similar to this but more like the punches down to the sides that fighters do in movies when they are walking up to the ring\n\nI do that with my wrist. They just flail all about\n\nOn long runs I listen to podcasts, and I am constantly reacting to them by making faces, laughing, exclaiming, etc and I’m sure I look insane to passersby but I don’t care.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSame here. My podcasts definitely have me grinning like a crazy person a lot. Lately I've been listening to a series of books that gets really dark at times and caught myself making some pretty dire faces while empathizing with the characters. Luckily I don't usually see a ton of people while I'm running.\n\nI’ll never forget the time I was running and listening to to a cricket podcast and I yelled ‘WHY WOULD YOU FUCKING HIT THAT’. I was so embarrassed, I pretended to be on the phone, and ran off as fast as I could\n\nI listen to a trivia podcast and about our the answers. \n\nI have to wave at every runner I pass. I can’t not do it.\n\nI wave at cars that give me space as they pass\n\nThe amount of space they give me decides how enthusiastic my wave is.\n\nHaha I'm so glad I'm not the only one. I started running recently and feel terrible about how little space I used to leave. You all are getting the whole lane to yourselves now.\n\nI try to make eye contact and give a nod to every car at the least, unless they're being jerks like rolling coal on me or shoving me into the ditch, in which case they get a discrete bird that they can't see after they pass. I run on a lot of semi-rural roads, and I honestly think it's made a difference with me doing that. There's only like 3 runners at most that use these roads, and I feel like I am getting left more space now than when I started running these roads and more people wave back. I don't think most people realize how little space there is and being enthusiastic when they leave it helps them learn that we appreciate it.\n\nI always think to myself \"welp, that driver certainly doesn't run\" when cars just blow right by without giving any space. They just don't get how scary that can be!\n\nI mouth the words “THANK YOU” but never say them.\n\nI do this too but have since incorporated a thumbs up in case it lip reads F you.\n\nNow I'm just thinking about someone who actually says \"Fuck you\" while giving a thumbs up.\n\nI think this is kind of a necessity to \"confirm\" that you have both seen each other. I hate when people have window tints, like if I don't see eyeballs I do not trust a crosswalk.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHe was probably just glad to finally have someone who wasn't pointing and laughing\n\nI wave at cars who actually stop where they're supposed to stop at stop signs instead of blocking where I can cross.\n\nI only wave at cars that slow down for me. If they keep the same speed AND dont move over Im flipping them off (in my head, lol)\n\nThats just normal behaviour\n\n100x this!  Reinforces good behavior from drivers on the road.\n\nI used to give a sheepish little wave and smile, but a while back I was running and another runner gave me this HUGE wave and smile and it just made me smile, so now I make a conscious effort to give a big cheesy dumb smile and wave at everyone I pass by. Don't care if most of the people think I'm a weirdo if it occasionally makes one person's day a little better.\n\nI do this too. I started used to do it, because one time someone waved at me with a huge ass smile and it just completely boost me with new energy.   \nSo now Im trying to do the same.  \nUsually just male runners answer, females are under 50% ratio.  (Pale AF ginger man)\n\nI've built an age and gender breakdown in my head on which local runners will answer my good mornings/nods and which will not.\n\nI do the same. Also, extra interesting to assess the 5am-6:30am crew - which in Chicago (where I am) is plenty of people. \n\nIf those 5am'ers don't wave back. Thats not cool. I'm waving because it provides a quick note that you're not alone out here, in the dark, with whatever creepy city stuff may be going on. \n\nIts about a 65% wave-back rate for males, and 25% for females. A head nod counts. I'm a typical runner looking male. Curious your stats??\n\nMy early morning runs are usually between 4:30 am and 5:30 am in a Dallas suburb.  I feel I get close to a 100% wave-back rate during that time frame; however, that's usually less than 5 other people  and almost always guys.  I've noticed one couple (1 guy, 1 girl) who I see often.  The guy always waves back, the girl never.  I suspect she let's her man do all the waving in their relationship.\n\nI posted a reply to another comment about the stats, but I also get more replies from men, as a woman.\n\nAnother factor in my small town is that it's a lot more likely to get a wave/nod back while on a small country road than any of the main roads, even though I also run before the morning gets busy.\n\nI try not to take it personally when I don’t get a wave or nod back, but on longer runs I can get salty if I get a streak of no replies. \n\nOn the other hand, I get it. People are doing their own thing. That, and I’m a bigger white dude. They don’t know what I’m doing.\n\nSometimes I will be a few metres past someone and realise they said hello and I ignored them. Then I feel bad, but really, I was just in a completely different world.\n\nI so get that!! I am never ignoring anybody, I am just too conscious to keep my eyes up all the time and am just focused on the music.\n\nIf I don't get a return nod or wave, I just assume they think they're better than me, and the resentment fuels the rest of my run\n\n99.9999% of the time they just didn’t notice\n\nWhy’d you say that!?! Homeboy was getting great interval training.\n\nI live in the capital of a nordic country, if you wave runners only foreigners will wave back, so I only do when running in tough conditions as a: “we rock mate being out here running” feeling\n\nAs a late 20’s woman I assume we are in the “no response” category 😂 I am so paranoid about someone becoming obsessed with me on the route I take that I usually keep my eyes forward lol. Sometimes I will wave at another woman if she looks like she’s having a tough run though. \n\nYes, the young will either not really even seem to see me at all, or will give an uncomfortable glance. I don't mind. (I do mind a bit that there's no thank you wave or acknowledgment if I step on the road to give them space, though.)\n\nYeah I do this, it’s like a club that we are all apart of. Bunch of crazy folks who run around for fun.\n\nI run on the lakefront trail in Chicago. If I waved at everyone my arms would be so tired after each run. I easily pass 1,000+ people on the running trail every single day when the weather is nice. Probably still 100 people even if the weather isn't nice.\n\nAnd I will wave right back.  We need more of this\n\nBless you. I'm not gregarious enough to do this, but I see the same folks on the trail and I know who will wave at me (and I'll wave back) and those little moments are often the boost I need. Also, I give everybody who waves at me consistently nice nicknames.\n\nI silently go for high 5s… the satisfaction of the nonverbal “🙏” from my fellow runner, a complete stranger, gives me instant motivation\n\nI wave at other runners and also city busses and (if they make eye contact) senior citizens.\n\ni’ve had people high five me while they pass me. it’s such a fun rush of good energy. wish i had the confidence to high five someone but i like when other people do it\n\nThey never wave back tho! 😢😢\n\nWe're struggling and trying to remain focused. Your wave gives us energy and we regret not waving back.\n\nI want to do that but I have social anxiety and my country is full of introverts 😔\n\nThank you, you make up for all the people that haven't waved back at me.\n\nI've ran for almost a decade in Ireland and no one has ever waved at me 🤣\n\nI do this. Often, people's whole demeanor changes.\n\nI have a hand held water bottle that I run with and run in areas with lots of tree cover. When I come across a large branch hanging over the trail, I will toss my water bottle over the branch and catch it on the other side, hopefully without breaking my stride. \n\nI give myself points based on how high and difficult the branch is to navigate the bottle toss, along with my ability to catch it without breaking my stride. \nMy record is 70 points on one run!! Beat that losers.\n\nThis is excellent \n\nOn downhills I extend my arms out for balance but secretly I am pretending I am an airplane.\n\nI also do this and my running group always giggles when I go into airplane mode\n\nI did this last night! Have to have a little fun and keep it light!\n\nYes it’s somewhere between airplane and wacky inflatable waving arms man for me\n\nI ran a 5K that finishes on an actual runway. When I made the final corner onto the runway I went into airplane mode and the course marshal cracked up.\n\nI go full airplane when I'm running around corners. I particularly like going airplane mode when I run around a circular fountain downtown\n\nI do the airplane thing too. I like to try to hold my arms up for as long as possible. Its a surprisingly good workout. You gotta work on your posture somehow.\n\ni dont know if this is weird, but i pretend to perform the songs i listen to in my head. like i imagine myself on a stage singing or dancing to those songs. and i often lipsynch the songs while running.\n\nI totally air drum while I'm running.  Sometimes I'm sure it looks like I'm having a seizure!  I often scream out broken half-lyrics too, depending on how pumped up I get about a song.\n\nI air drum. As a women I sometimes think this keeps the weirdos away, because I probably look like someone you wouldn't want to mess with when I'm really feeling the beat. 😁\n\nUsed to do that. Even teared up sometimes when I thought how epic my imaginary performance looked like\n\noh yeah, when you feel like your run is a music video . 😂 imagining how epic it would look in slow-mo.\n\nI totally sing softly under my breath running and definitely got some looks at my last race lol. But it's just what helps me\n\n\nEdit: sing softly\n\nYesss!!! I’ll even belt out the chorus if the song hits right! Gotta keep myself entertained somehow 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nif im alone, i actually try to sing, but im usually too out of breath. havent figured out my easy pace yet.\n\nI do this and I dance with my hands!!\n\nI totally play drums at times\n\nI am lip syncing almost constantly while running. I absolutely love doing it. it's kind of a douchey flex for me. like yeah I'm running and happy, what are you gonna do about it?\n\nSimilarly I like to come up with music videos or a movie trailer for a book I’m reading! Music + running gets the imagination going so well\n\nI always lip sync when I run; if it's a song I really enjoy, I often visualize a whole music video in my head for it, in which I'm the lead singer.\n\nMaths in my head. Normally spend some time calculating how much I am through the run, what percentage of the run is left etc.\n\nI do this too, and because I’m comically bad at math it usually takes a while and makes me laugh to myself.\n\nHullo, fellow mather! I do the same calculations. To your list I'll add converting between miles and kilometers, or miles per hour and kilometers per hour. I can tell how tired and/or dehydrated I am by how difficult the calculations become.\n\nI also referee soccer. Sometimes we referees wear radios during matches so we can communicate with each other. A recent mid-game conversation:\n\n[clock shows 20:00 remaining]  \nMe: 77.8% of the game down, boys! Keep your focus!  \nAssistant 1: Why the FUCK do you know that?!  \nAssistant 2: Aren't you supposed to be paying attention to the game instead of doing calculus?\n\nGood times.\n\nI give tree branches/leaves high fives when I run by them.\n\ni imagine their upward facing branches as their arms up in the air cheering me on\n\nSame lol.\n\nLmao I will run by a good looking twig on the ground and pick it up and slowly break off pieces of it. It looks super strange and I cannot explain it but it’s calming in a fidget spinner kinda way.\n\nI imagine I look like a little kid with a stick tho\n\nYo I do this too!! Or if it's a big leaf I'll tear the green off of the veins so I'm left with a weirdly thin twig where once was a leaf. \n\nOmg!! I do that too hahah\n\nI often get really gassy when running 😅 have to run alone so no one can smell my shame\n\njet boosters\n\nI like to imagine the 3 mushrooms in Mario cart 64, giving me short boosts\n\n🏃🏻‍♂️💨\n\nYou ain’t the only one. I call it “cleaning my pipes.”  I did it in formation during PT in the army. 1982. Basic training… through 2002. 20+ years. Still doing it.  Yep. I was the company crop duster. \n\nI have no shame.\n\nAll the bouncing helps force the farts out\n\n\"Percussive enema\"\n\nMy favorite is when I do a little fart every step for like 10 steps.\n\nThis is me, but then I nervously scan my surroundings fearing I'm going to end up on someone's TikTok of what was a peaceful walk in a park. \n\nI doggy paddle when running up particularly steep trails.\n\nLmao you know what, I never knew what to call what I do sometimes with my hands but doggy paddle is exactly it!\n\nWhen I run downhills, I do a quiet (or not so quiet) \"wheeeeeeee!\" as I go.\n\nI tap my fingers, like index to thumb, bird to thumb.\n\nI DO THIS TOO!\n\nMe too! No idea why\n\nSame and I will tap my fingers in beat with my footsteps. You too?\n\nMe too!! I did it initially as a way to calm down, i was feeling very self conscious. Now it's not always but still happens from time to time, not sure what the trigger is.\n\nGlad I’m not the only one lmao\n\nI have to urinate every 20 minutes.\n\nThis is me, for every run in my life. Yet somehow I ran a marathon last year without having to stop, it felt legendary. I also beat my goal of sub 3:20 by 12 seconds, something’s are just meant to be 😅\n\nI have to plan my runs around available restrooms lol\n\nI stop drinking liquids hours before my run, make sure to use the bathroom several times beforehand, yet the moment my feet hit the pavement I feel the urge.\n\nI know where every publicly accessible bathroom is within a 10 mile radius, lol.\n\nPretend I am being interviewed on a podcast\n\nMatching my breath to my cadence\n\nI do this as well.  I take 3 steps for a full inhale and 3 steps for a full exhale.  If I feel I need to go to two steps instead of three on either one or both, I know my HR is up and I need to either slow down or I'm doing a hard workout right or I'm racing.\n\nThese are l the two breathing ratios I was taught by my coach 15 years ago. 3 steps for long easy runs, 2 steps  during tempo runs/race\n\nOne note here, I attended a conference a few years ago with some fairly well known running coaches in the US—if you can train yourself to do an even-odd or even-even-odd-even (main idea is switching between even and odd, as long as it is comfortable for you) breathing pattern then it is overall better for your body. The reason is due to the fact that if it is always the same number of breaths then you are striking with the same foot for each inhale and exhale cycle. This disproportionately stresses one side of your body. \n\nI’ve never been able to consistently master this rhythm, but I make sure to try and throw in a change every now and then to switch “sides”.\n\n&gt; This disproportionately stresses one side of your body. \n\nand as I discovered early in my running career, can cause stitches. I had to stop listening to music to un-sync my breathing to cadence.\n\nI always did this during races. I would start out singing Allman Brothers' Whipping Post when I was doing 3/3, then switch to Dave Brubeck's Take 5 later in the race when I switched to 3/2.\n\nThen by the end it was just breath however lets you finish the race.\n\n100% - done consistently enough you can align these transitions (my runs start with 5 in 5 out and gradually decrease to 3/3 or 2/2 as you mentioned) and can serve as an imperfect but good proxy for HR zones.\n\nNow I'm breathing funny at my desk. Getting light-headed.\n\nDo people find this weird? I can't even imagine not doing this.\n\nAirways two steps for inhale, three for out. I try to keep my cadence between 170 and 190 so my breathing is fairly regular\n\nI try to high-five other runners coming the opposite direction. Give an \"UP TOP!\" and hope they do it. I'd say I have about a 40% success rate, another 20% try but are too late and miss. I hope that it makes people smile.\n\nI had just started my run, out in front of my house. I was only 150' into the run when a neighbor who I don't normally speak with, running in the opposite direction, made his way to my side of the street and fist-bumped me. It was great! \n\nWhen I got home after the run, my wife said, \"I saw that fist bump out the window - wtf was that all about?! Is that a thing?\".\n\nI would die happy if someone high fived me. I’m in nyc so we don’t look at each other lol\n\nChewing Gum. \n\nNow I don’t know the science behind this but I can run for longer without being tired…\n\nI used to do this, then almost choked on it during a sprint workout. I figured that would be an embarrassing way to die, so I've stopped that.\n\nAs a person who is constantly congested and a mouth breather gum is the only way I can run otherwise my mouth gets so dry it's uncomfortable.\n\nI think there's was a study out there that had some kinda conclusions that adding a little bit of sugar water or similar to your mouth has some benefits like you described.\n\nSomething about tricking your body into thinking it's got fuel coming in does something?\n\nI read in an article somewhere that athletes who rinsed and spit with a carby drink right before lifting had increased strength\n\nWild\n\nMe too. I think it helps with my sinuses a bit and is a type of distraction\n\nIt helps dry throat too.\n\nI play the air drums to songs when I hit my runners high. I can’t not feel good in that moment.\n\nI wave/nod/some acknowledgment at anyone I run past.  \n\n\nExcept walkers with off leash dogs.  Fuck those guys.\n\nI do a weird over the top side to side head movement which for some reason gives me a little boost when I'm flagging.\n\nBend my wrists to the rhythm of my music when I need a distraction\n\nRobot hands, every race day photo of me could be a freeze frame from a certain Styx music video.\n\nI touch my fingers to my thumb. Pointer finger to thumb then middle finger to thumb, then ring finger then pinky, then the pattern starts over. It started as something to concentrate on to keep my distracted from how much my chest hurt.\n\nThere is also zero rythym between doing this and my step cadence.\n\nI run around every road in the estate, even tiny closes. My 15k on Strava looks like a 5 year old scribbled on a page\n\nYou should map out routes so you can draw designs from your runs!\n\nI give myself the 🤙🏽 when the beat drops for certain songs, people take it for a wave sometimes. Race day it gets the weirdest looks though\n\nBeat drop DJ hand gestures are one of my most childish running quirks, but the amount of joy I get from them is immeasurable.\n\nI bring a washcloth to blow my nose into (and hand sanitizer). It just runs so much whenever I'm exercising, I can't stand doing nothing about it\n\nI just wipe it on my shirt because I have no shame\n\nThey recently put in safety cameras in this fancy neighborhood I run(but dont live in) and all I can think of is some security officer watching me wipe my nose on my shirt. \n\nI'm convinced they are disgusted.\n\nFunny cuz I was wondering if I was the only person with runny nose.  I’ve been running for over 20 years and I think I could count on one hand the number of times I’ve ever seen anyone else carry a towel of some sort with them.  Mine is tucked in the back of my shorts.\n\nI usually have a couple kleenex in whatever available pocket I've got.  I've blown a few snot rockets, or straight into my hand, before.  Winter gloves at a biohazard and get washed every time\n\nOh...i just use the bottom of my tank top\n\nI bring a handkerchief on my runs for same reason, and I bring two of them for very long runs. Hand wash after the run and hang dry to get them ready for the next run.\n\nSometimes I just stop mid-run, drop into a heel squat, and rock back and forth on my feet for a few seconds, then pop up and keep running.\n\nThis only happens on super long runs when I just feel like my legs are dead and everything is getting stiff. Like knocking off the rust.\n\nI wave at every runner I encounter. Most ignore me, i bring joy to the others.\n\nI do the arm up and down (while looking crazy) for truckers so they honk their horns 😂\n\nWhen I run past traffic, I honestly run as if I’m in a film and I’m the main character. Like everyone in the cars, busses, taxis etc are all watching me. My heads high, I feel like I’m looking 10/10 and sometimes even pick up the pace a bit. All this when realistically no one cares or probably even notices me, but for those few minutes I feel like I’m a movie star on the way to discover my happy ever after\n\nI smile at every cute dog I meet on my run 🥰 seeing cute dogs is honestly one of the best parts of running, it’s even better than seeing hot topless 6 pack guys running during the summer 🤣🤣🤣\n\nAlso I try to non-verbally communicate to any runner i meet that they are doing wonderful, especially when the weather is crap, like rain or snow 😂\n\nSnot rockets. Dumb decisions in my younger years left me with a severely deviated septum 😂\n\nA woman blew a snot rocket on my leg in my last half. Make sure to avoid friendly fire!\n\nAir drumming and singing.\n\nI greet cows and sheep with a ‘Good morning/afternoon ladies’ when I run past/through their field. I think the village think I’m a nut case.\n\nI am not a fast runner. My easy pace is 10:30 min/mile, but when I am coming up behind another runner, oh we’re racing now. I’m fast as fuck boi, eat my dust.\n\nI often listen to the same song on repeat for the entire run so that it’s like no time is actually passing. Zen!\n\nI run through every sprinkler and will turn around to get one that missed me\n\nWhen I’m struggling and thinking of quitting, I force a smile and give a hang loose sign to remind myself I’m having fun and getting better.\n\nI call my self a fat F@!k running up big hills out loud quite a lot\n\nYou're doing great man keep it up!\n\nSlap signs/branches/poles when I go by them.\n\nOn longer runs (2+ hours) I might slow down to an easy pace and bust out the kindle. I like to go for walks and read so it was really just a matter of finding a text size I could read while trotting at an 11 min. Mile.\n\nActing as if I'm on cruise control anytime I pass someone going the other way, then returning to having a heart attack and blowing out of my arse once they're out of earshot.\n\nI just count in a loop … repeatedly. I count in rhythm with my stride and when I get to 100 I start again. I don’t really mean to do it, it just sort of happens 😂\n\nWhen running for 4 miles plus I start to get an intense urge to dance lol like pump my fists and move my arms. I try to not do this so sometimes I spin my hand by the wrist and not break out in dance lol\n\nWhen I’m feeling particularly unmotivated, I’ll turn my run into a series of out and back stretches one block at a time. It helps me to be able to think “I only have to run 0.25 miles and then repeat this X times”. My running route maps look insane as a result, and I look like the crazy person running just a little bit down every street 😂\n\nI cough and wipe my nose post-snot rockets on my left shirt sleeve. After every run my shirt is disgusting and I can't go anywhere afterwards out of embarrassment and disgust. But after a race when I'm hanging out it doesn't bother me because I assume every runner understands my dried mucus on my shirt.\n\nWhen I see some other runners ahead of me, I feel this urge to \"win\", to overtake them, especially when the person is walking slowly or in pairs, blocking the way. I find it difficult to control, and I even speed up and find \"extra energy\", coming from God knows where, just to win some imaginary competition.\n\nStopping to move a snail that's in the middle of the path\n\nStopping to catch a snake that wandered onto the path\n\nSmiling at everyone I see (and waving at many)\n\nTelling anyone who's out working on their yard something positive about their yard\n\nSaying hi to people's dogs\n\nOccasionally saying hi to horses, cows, goats and chickens. \n\nDodging worms on rainy days to avoid stepping on them\n\nDodging grasshoppers to avoid stepping on them\n\nI do the horse snort too!! I imagine it resets my stamina lol\n\nI’ weird. I count or make up self motivation chants (s-t-r-o-n-g-strong). Or if I’m feeling like I’m always leading with my right foot, I’ll start saying left, left, left to shift the weight to that side.\n\nDoes anybody else do air punches like Rocky from time to time? I always look around to make sure no one is looking before I do.\n\nI run uphill on my toes. Also, I have constant allergies and my nose is always running, so I carry about one tissue for each mile or for every 10 minutes.\n\nI don’t know if this is weird, but if I’m listening to music while I run, I can’t run off beat.  My foot needs to strike the ground at the same rhythm as my music.  I find this super helpful, as it dictates my cadence and I don’t realize I’m easily keeping a pace up that I normally couldn’t without music.  Plus it makes me feel like I’m dancing and I forget I’m getting a purposeful workout in.  It’s a lot more fun.  \n\nIt’s usually 90-120 beats per minute.\n\nGetting caught out and having to have a shit in the bushes. I always tell people that if they see me running with only one sock on don’t ask questions\n\nMy coach joked one sock missing was a bad run, two socks was the bad runs\n\nI now pack a couple paper towels in the butt pocket of my running shorts.\n\nI eat cough drops to loosen mucus.\n\nOn uphills i sometimes use more ass muscles so it probably looks like a wiggling it from behind\n\ni do not step on the lines of the street. i also count the number of steps i take between the 2 boxes\n\nI am brutally arguing with… anyone whom I guess I was too polite, not far before. And it’s work pretty good for my mentality, indeed.\n\nI have to step on any leaf that looks crunchy. I adjust my stride when I spot one so that I can get it\n\nI listen to cadence like we used to sing when I was in the Army.\n\nWhen I pass a house with a basketball hoop at the end of the driveway, I pretend to make a reverse layup w a pretend ball. I have 100% accuracy on these baskets so far.\n\nI usually do a 30k every weekend. Once I hit the halfway point I buy a tall can of beer, slam it and then finish the other 15k.\n\nDamn if I still drank that would 100% make it into my routine. Then again if I still drank, I would not be running at any time but especially not on the weekend\n\nI point aggressively at cars that I'm not sure know I exist.  People seem to notice you quicker when you point at them from my experience.\n\nI just yell and point impotently at people who don’t stop at crosswalks. At least some of them have the decency to look abashed.\n\nThumbs up hands and lip syncing to my music.\n\nWhenever I jump over a log or big rock on the trails I have to extend my arms out and up and hop to float down :)\n\nI have the same spot on a trail where I always stop to pee :)\n\nI love kpop and that’s usually what I listen to when I’m running. If it’s a song I know the choreography for I am 100% doing it while I’m running. Sometimes I put them on specifically because doing the dance distracts me if I’m having a rough run.\n\nI definitely grunt and yell up hills. I try to say positive things, but sometimes it comes out, \"You weak flaccid worm\"\n\nI pretend I am Link in Breath of the Wild foraging for cooking ingredients and shooting down squirrels for meat 😭"

Time for the Annual Summer, Heat, and Humidity Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/uhlseh/you_guessed_it_time_for_the_annual_summer_heat/?sort=top)\n\n* [As much as I don't want to admit it, it's time for the Summer, Heat, and Humidity Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/13k9fwh/as_much_as_i_dont_want_to_admit_it_its_time_for/)\n\n**[NOTE: If you happen to be in the Southern Hemisphere and entering the season of the cold, snow, and/or ice, [here's the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather#wiki_winter.2Fcold) to the \"Running in the Cold\" section of the wiki which links to the Cold megathread with tips and tricks.]**\n\nIt's a good time to get reacquainted with heat training, tips, tricks and adjustments you use to get through next couple months of misery, whether it's just for the next 2 months or 5 months.  However, the most important think is to recognize the signs of [heat exhaustion](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html#exhaustion) and [heat stroke](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html#stroke) and not to try to be tough.  If you're running alone and you push into heat exhaustion, you have to stop immediately before you hit heat stroke.\n\nSigns of heat exhaustion:\n\n* Confusion\n* Dizziness (good indictor no matter what, but more so when it's summer)\n* Fatigue (more so than usual)\n* Headache\n* Muscle/abdominal cramps\n* Nausea/vomiting\n* Pale skin\n* Profuse sweating\n* Rapid heartbeat\n\nHeat stroke is what heat exhaustion will turn into if you don't recognize it and stop immediately.  Signs of heat stroke are fairly similar but one notable difference is **that you have stopped sweating**.  Heat stroke is a serious medical condition and requires emergency treatment.  Call 911!\n\nSymptoms of heat stroke include:\n\n* Confusion, altered mental status, slurred speech\n* Loss of consciousness (coma)\n* Hot, dry skin or profuse sweating\n* Seizures\n* Very high body temperature\n* Fatal if treatment delayed\n\nRemember that SLOW DOWN is never the wrong answer in the heat.  You're going to go slower - it's just a fact.  Embrace it and the fitness will still be there when the weather cools off.\n\nSome quick high level tips:\n\n* Run slower (duh)\n* Don't run during the heat of the day\n* Run in shaded areas.   Running in direct sunlight in the summer can add 20+ degrees to your skin temp, and that's what counts, not the air temp.\n* Avoid highly urbanized areas if at all possible during hot days.  The concrete jungle retains and radiates heat back at you, it is almost essentially an oven effect.\n* Focus on humidity as much as the temperature.  Understand how the mechanism of sweat works.  If the humidity is extremely high, sweat will just drip off you and not evaporate.  Evaporation of sweat is the mechanism of how the body cools itself - the phase change from liquid to vapor extracts heat from your skin.\n\nAnother good tip from a helpful Runnitor:\n\n&gt;Dew point is actually a better measure of humidity than humidity percentage points are. That's because air at 100% humidity and 50F holds less water than air at 50% humidity and 90F.\n\n&gt; You can use a dew point calculator to figure out the dew point. Over 65F dew point is sticky, but over 70F is very humid. Make sure to hydrate often and to pay attention to your body to see if it's overheating.\n\n&gt; Here's a good dew point calculator:\n\n&gt; http://dpcalc.org/\n\nFinally, one good table for pace adjustment is here:  http://maximumperformancerunning.blogspot.com/2013/07/temperature-dew-point.html?m=1\n\n**As a way to keep things a bit more organized and easier to find info later, I'm going to make several top level comments.  Please respond to those instead of the main post.  All other top level comments will be removed without notice.  I'll include a stickied comment with direct links to each of the topic headings.**",

I feel so seen. Hahaha\n\nIt was me, tonight. Like an hour ago. Just awful haha\n\nLast Sunday I was disappointed with my pace on my long run, so Tuesday when I went out I decided to do my normal Tuesday route but just run the first mile as fast as I (reasonably) could (to prove… something, I guess?). When I hit the mile marker I felt like I had worked so hard; I wouldn’t have been surprised if I hit a PR. Checked my watch. I was 90 seconds slower than my actual mile PR and I had to sit down on the sidewalk for a while so my heart didn’t explode 🫠\n\nOk but on the plus side you'll get the random day this summer where it's cool and rainy and you go out and CRUSH a time and it feels easy.\n\nSo true!!!\n\nI AM NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME\n\nI finished my run this morning and I was exhausted and I said to myself, “this is so unpleasant” as I’m drenched in sweat.\n\nCold shower feels great after tho, that is my motivation as I lose half my body weight in water while running.\n\nI think about the cold shower almost the whole run when it’s hot.\n\nIt’s probably because I’m not working towards any big goals other than keeping myself moving, so if I put in a shit performance, no big deal. But. \n\nI went out this morning and the misery the weather induced was the best high I’ve had in a long time. \n\nEverybody gets so excited and romantic about the summer and I just get visions of suffering\n\nFortunately I live in the UK which so far this summer has simply meant warmer rain.\n\nI live in a desert, and every time June hits, I start trying to rope people into bad land purchases in Alaska\n\nGod I miss winter\n\nIm conflicted. On one hand I hate having to plan my runs around snow and ice (Colorado). On the other hand the running itself is so much easier than long sessions in summer heat.\n\nI find the hardest part of winter running is just convincing myself to step out the door.  When I am inside and warm I am convinced that I will be cold and miserable during my run.  Once I get out and start moving I am never as cold as I thought I would be.  After that I usually start to enjoy my run.\n\nWhite clothing is a vicious cycle. Wear white because it’s hot then sweat so much all the white is stained with sweat\n\nI undress in the shower when I run or play soccer in the summer. That initial rinse goes a long way. Also great for hats if you're a serial sweat stain hat ruiner like myself.\n\nOxiclean FTW\n\nIt’s like trying to breathe through a wet sock.\n\nWhy tf do I get headaches the second I step outside and it's 80+ F.\n\nMy shoes become waterlogged with sweat and splash with every step.\n\nCan the sun not hate my skin so much?\n\nIs it fall yet? I’m already sick of this\n\nI hate waking up at 6 am just to run, it makes me wanna vomit 😭😭\n\nI was running at 6 today and it was already 80 degrees, fml\n\nHooray, I'm in the top 1%.... for sweat rate. I hate it here. Please be October again.\n\nI yearn for the freezing temperatures to crystallize the sweat to my body. I'm a regular Jack Frost type.\n\nBut also, it's nice not having to thaw myself out for a change.\n\nIt has finally dawned on me why I’ve been so dang cranky and irritable and anxiety-ridden the last two or so weeks. Hello Summer Seasonal Affective Disorder my old friend.\n\nI am moving to the Southern Hemisphere to escape the heat like a migrating bird.\n\nAs someone in the Southern Hemisphere who is currently running at lunch time because that's when it's warm enough, this thread is a welcome chuckle.\n\nI’ve never once felt the heat of the sun on my body and thought ah yes, amazing. When will it be winter again.\n\nHere, we only have two seasons; Summer and Not Summer. I miss Not Summer.\n\nThis is hell. I went out a little too late at 8 for a tempo run, I was STRUGGLING to hit my goal pace.\n\nWhy am I oiled up with Vaseline and still chafing in all my ladybits....oh....because its fucking florida and it's hot and I'm becoming a salt mine thats why.\n\nI almost died doing a half marathon long run this last week. 95 degrees and no shade😃\n\nKids are everywhere\n\nOn the bright side, I got a new watch about a month ago, so I’ve hit back-to-back “New maximum heart rate!” achievements on my last two runs (running a very uninspiring pace, I might add)\n\nGoing through a heat wave this week in southern Ontario…no central AC in my apartment. Everytime someone says “I bet it’s always cold in Canada” I  combust and cry in global warming.\n\nIt was already +35 today at 8am and why does it thunderstorm every hour? But it just gets hotter and muggier? Why do I suddenly live in Florida?\n\nIt’s only June and all of my summer running gear smells terrible already\n\nI hate hate hate running in this weather but having recently moved to Chicago it’s soooo nice just jumping in the lake when i’m done\n\nIt's June and in Belgium it still feels like October, it's been raining non stop for 6 months, we only had like 5 days of sun in 2024... I wanna die too\n\nHeat is one thing but heat &amp; humidity..? I miss winter.\n\nIt snowed last night. Yes, I'm in the northern hemisphere.\n\nOn a beach vacation — and live in the high-desert at home — mother of god is humidity awful.\n\nI hate summer so much..! SUPER hard to breathe when running\n\nMy body is sticky, I don't like that.\n\n**HYDRATION ADVICE, TIPS, TRICKS**\n\nHydration is a before activity as much as during and after. I force myself to drink half a litre of water when I wake up to set myself up for the rest of the day.\n\nAgree on the 500ml of water when you get up. I thought my wife was crazy when she told me to do this, but it stopped me getting a headache after early morning exercise.\n\nI feel like it helps me poop too, gets the body going and hydrated so I can drop some weight before I head out\n\nMore of a before activity than anything in my opinion. If you're not well hydrated when you start there is no way to recover that on the run.\n\nPro tip: sprain your ankle weeks before summer starts and you’ll be out for the whole season 🤘\n\nCurrenly drinking 6-7L of water a day with electrolytes. Did a 7 mile long run at 113F and I held well.\n\n**MODIFYING TRAINING FOR THE HEAT**\n\nAs a HS XC coach here is my speech:\n\n\n&gt;Everything we do this week is zone 5 because your body hates the heat. Show up hydrated and no one is allowed to walk home afterwards, so get a ride. If you aren’t here, I will never ever hold it against you because I promise you that I don’t want to be running with you but I will anyway.  \n\nI wanted to try zone 2 training but I'm guessing summer is NOT the best time to start that. 😂\n\nI am able to change my schedule a bit so I will be doing morning runs before work, it's annoying but doable.\n\nRegardless, I have decided to invest more time indoors doing strength training instead so hopefully I will come out in October in my best shape ever!\n\nYesterday I went out for a warmup run in the morning, and it was cloudy, warm, and a bit humid when I left. Everything was fine until the clouds parted and the temperature jumped by around 5-6 degrees (at least). Things went pretty quickly from fine to hard, and it didn't help that this coincided with a long climb portion of the loop. It was a good reminder from my desert days that the sun makes a big difference.\n\nSlowed things right down at that point and was able to keep things manageable for the rest of the warmup at least. I've learned over the years (the hard way) to modify my workouts based on various changing conditions and how I'm feeling at that moment.\n\nAs the heat/humidity increases, I'll be increasing the ratio of walking sessions (ideally in shaded areas) over running. Trying to keep the time-on-feet consistent especially if cardio is a bit tougher right now.\n\nI don't know if this is considered \"modified training\" but Florida summers are brutal. My goal is to simply *stay at level* during the summer. I'm not trying to get faster at all, I just want to stay consistent (i.e. don't slow down). Because you're having to work harder to stay consistent, you actually are making gains, though it doesn't seem like it until the weather cools and you start getting faster. \n\nWinter gains are made in the summer.\n\nRun in the A.M. It used to be possible to run in the summer sun but these record summers lately have weeks were it's 100F nearly everyday. Even worse over asphalt. If you refuse to run in the morning then find a tree covered trail for the shade and run later in the evening.\n\n**HOW HOT IS TOO HOT TO RUN**\n\nFlorida\n\nWhy am I training for a marathon rn please help\n\nSame. Every time the alarm goes off at 0500 (start running by 0530) I die inside a little more but goddamn do I want to run this fucker (marathon) in October.\n\nEmbrace the heat and think about how it is making you stronger. Once autumn starts and the temperatures drop, you will be flying.\n\nSeriously! Especially after the past few weeks without any rain until recently. I think that was the driest heat I’ve felt here in a while.\n\nWe just got 3 days of rain in Louisiana and 84 feels like prime running weather compared to the high 90s we had last week\n\nSummer of 2017 in Phoenix it hit 121. I did a short 2 mile run for the novelty. That was too hot for running.\n\nA dew point of 70+\n\nI can do a dew point of 70+ as long as it's early morning.\n\nLol the dew point here in south florida is over 70 all day every day\n\nI don't even know anymore. I'm in Bangkok and since Feb, I have been running in 30°C+ (86°F+)  temps, 65%-85% humidity and dew points ranging between 24°C and 26°C (75°F and 79°F).\n\nLast night was one of the better nights weather-wise: 29°C/84°F, 83% humidity and 26°C/79°F dew point. My shoes were still extremely damp.\n\nI was in Vienna in early May and my pace was automatically 10% faster and even managed to run 20% farther than usual.\n\nHere's hoping I can run significantly faster again when I run my HM in France in Oct!\n\nI'm in Canada over here, and we're seeing temps of 30-32C with 56% humidity. \"Feels like 42C\" and I feel like I'm suffocating just walking around. I couldn't imagine running in this weather, I'd collapse and die.\n\nNow, get me in the cold, I'll run until my breath freezes in my nose. But heat is no bueno, dunno how you guy do it.\n\nThe woes of living in SEA. Have been training in the PH with crazy temps and humidity. Will be running a half also in October in Europe, and I do hope I'll perform better with the more pleasant weather.\n\nAtlanta. Hot, hills and humidity\n\nMe IRL 😢\n\n No such thing as too hot to run, as long as you’re preparing and adjusting pace and length. \n\nAs a midwesterner, when we get heat domes and the humidity is boiling you alive I’ll spend all day pre-hydrating for a 30-40m easy run that leaves me soaked.\n\nThere isn't as long as you run when the sun isn't pounding on the pavement.  It's frequently 70 80 degree dew points in South China, and I used to run every night.  You come back looking like you took a dip in the pond, but it's easily doable with proper hydration\n\nI know someone who uses an exercise bike in a sauna\n\nDid my run in yesterday’s 95 degree heat after work.  Hydrated really well all day.  It went fine.  I would definitely stop if I started to show signs of heat exhaustion…happened to me last year when I didn’t hydrate enough.\n\n**FAVORITE SUNSCREEN**\n\nObvious choice, Neutrogena. That said, I will slop budget sunscreen all over me when the UV is high. Melanoma is a killer.\n\nEdit: Lip balm deserves a mention too. The orange Nivea with the SPF 30 rating has a permanent home in my Salomon.\n\nSun bum had an SPF 30 lip balm that also has a more mild coconut-like flavor than some other SPF balms I've tried. There's also Jack black SPF 25 lip balm that has additional flavors that aren't bad but they come in squeeze tubes but the formula is thick so it doesn't seem to run out of the tube. It's funny to think about scents and tastes for sun protection but SPF does have a bitter aftertaste that I hate and our lips definitely do need the sun protection too.\n\nNeutrogena hydroboost is the best feeling sunscreen I have ever used and my skin loved it, but if any amount gets into my eyes it's like hell on earth (all Neutrogena chemical sunscreens do this to me). It makes me so sad, but I absolutely cannot use Neutrogena if I'm going to sweat =( \n\nBut yeah, skin cancer sucks, slop on all the sunscreen.\n\nCoppertone Water Babies. Highly rated by consumer reports, stays on well through exercise/wet conditions, and doesn't sting the eyes when you sweat.\n\nAnthelios by La Roche Posay. I've used it for the past several years and it works great. SPF 60 face is my favorite. \n\nI also use Blue Lizard Sport SPF 30 on my arms and legs.\n\nThe La Roche Posay face sunscreen is my HG. It's soooo good. I also like Blue Lizard for my body.\n\n  \nI've recently started to like the Neutrogena Beach Defense lotion because it's in a pump bottle\n\nEchoing some other commenters re: Korean brands for sunscreen, especially for the face. I always begrudgingly wore sunscreen because I hated the texture, even highly recommended brands like La Roche Posay and Supergoop etc., but having a formula that I really like makes it so I never skip it. \n\nMy favorite is Isntree Watery Sun Gel 50++, but Beauty of Joseon and Cosrx Aloe are great too.\n\nSupergoop Play for any outdoor activites! I have sensitive skin and it hasn't broken me out.\n\nFor your face: Supergoop unseen (or the matte mineral one). It’s the lightest, least greasy, least runny liquid eyeball burning sunscreen I’ve ever used. I’ve never had anything else with a similar texture. Second place: Elta MD. So far these two are the lowest acne breakout inducing options I’ve tried and yall, I have a whole closet shelf solely for sunscreens.\n\nBeauty of Joseon for the face and supergoop play for the body\n\nI recently started using Banana Boat Daily Protect Factor 50 and I really like it. Doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my skin. \n\nNow I just need to find a face sunscreen that doesn't make me break out in horrendous spots\n\nGot a lot that I like, these are what I use for running because they don't really run or burn my eyes. \n\n1. The cheapest store-brand waterproof SPF50+ sunscreen at the store for body. \n\n2. Banana Boat Light as Air - good for body too, less greasy than the cheaper banana boat variants. \n\n3. Biore UV Athlizm Skin Protect Milk - light white cast, but doesn't budge.\n\n4. Trader Joe's Knock off of Supergoop unseen - don't love the texture, but stays put while I'm sweating. \n\n5. Not sure how waterproof it really is, but Biore UV aqua rich watery essence is my fave everyday sunscreen.\n\nBlue lizard sport SPF 30 as my daily driver.\n\n**FAVORITE ELECTROLYTE SUPPLEMENT**\n\nNuun has been excellent for me, and it's cheap\n\nLemon lime Salt Stick tabs are my favorite. Does that count?\n\n[deleted]\n\nomg the watermelon one is so gross\n\nLiquid iv since it’s cheaper at Costco and doesn’t taste terrible\n\nMy Costco only carries the sugar free one now and I can't stand the taste.\n\nGatorade Endurance powder passes my nutrition label scan and is cheaper than other supplements on Amazon\n\nI've always been on Tailwind.  Reasonably cheap ($0.75/8-12oz mixed volume at full price), mixes well in my bottles, tastes good to me, pretty heavy on carbs with a decent amount of salt per scoop.\n\n[deleted]\n\nJust looked it up, 1000mg sodium?? I'm a heavy sweater, may have to try that.  I normally use nuun or gatorlyte which is 500mg\n\nI tried their watermelon salt flavor and loved it!!\n\nI love their new sparkling waters. Even more than the powder.\n\nI like Nuun. It's also what they will use in the Toronto Waterfront Marathon his fall which is good for me!\n\nSkratch, no gross sweeteners (just sugar), real fruit.\n\nSame. All those sugar substitutes make me sick.\n\nBeer\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’ve been enjoying the packets of Pedialyte. Somewhat fewer artificial ingredients\n\n1/4 teaspoon salt and a healthy dose of lime juice into a 1L Nalgene. I’ll throw in some coconut water if I got it.\n\nLime juice, pinch of salt for sodium, pinch of Nu-Salt for potassium, and a couple tablespoons of sugar in a liter of water.\n\nI use LMNT, as well as Precision Hydration PH1500 tabs. Both seem to work really well. Did a fast 13 miler on Saturday in the heat (90F/32.2C) and didn't have any issues. Plenty of gas left in the tank at the end of the run.\n\n**TIPS/TRICKS FOR RUNNING IN THE HEAT**\n\nIt’s ok to carry a water bottle or hydration pack, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise\n\nThis, 100%. I BQ'd carrying a water bottle belt with 4 10 ouncers. Do what you need to.\n\nYeah same. I had a marathon earlier this month and carried a bottle in my hand the whole time due to the heat and finished in 3:11\n\n[deleted]\n\nThere’s just a lot of chatter on various social media  that I’ve seen where people shame runners for carrying water for shorter distances and I think that kinda stuff is echoed by people who don’t get why some people need to carry hydration.\n\nDepending on the distance and the heat, having water back at the car might be just fine. Caching water might be what you need.  Or there might be water fountains.  \n\nMany people who carry water should be sure where they can refill, so they don’t need to carry huge amounts.\n\nYep, trail running vest always comes on when it gets too hot for runs at home\n\nI could trail run more in the cooler mountains but you know, effort\n\nFind the lawn sprinklers in your area and learn the times they go off. Time your runs to be able to run through them.\n\nGetting hair wet before a hot day has been a lifesaver for me, too. I'll dunk my head into water then put up into a braid.\n\nEver since I saw my neighbor install some herbicide feeding system to his sprinklers, I'm very hesitant to run through sprinklers.\n\nI saw a little kid watering her front lawn yesterday and she waved at me as I was approaching. I yelled “Spray me!” And she did and it was the best thing ever. She got a kick out of it too.\n\nI like to dip my bandana in ice cold water and wring it out about halfway right before I set off for my run. Keep my head cool for a good portion of the run!\n\nFor DC runners, there's some broken sprinklers on the National Mall around the Art Gallery that often wind up soaking the sidewalks instead of the lawn. I jog through them around 6:15am and it's so nice.\n\nI take the dollar store sponges (not the one with the hard green side) and slice them lengthwise super thin. I soak them in ice water and put them under my hat. If you run in loops you can swap them out as you loop. \n\nI do this for the run portion of my triathlons too and it works miracles! At every aid station I dump water on my head to keep the sponge wet.\n\nLess water, more hydration drinks.\n\nAs a South African we have the heat for almost 90 months of the year and I started running in an area which would hit 30 celsius with 20% humidity in the winter. Having run during the heat many a time, here are some key things.\n\nLight clothing, no bare chest : clothing soaks up sweat and keeps you cool. It also provides UV protection. Alot of people want the sunshine in the summer but you increase your heat absorption alot when your skin is exposed.\n\nShades: yes, you need to look cool but also protect your eyes from the glare and reflections.\n\nHydration: see opening statement. Water loss is a problem but you will going into the danger zone much quicker losing Sodium and potassium. Having good, proper sportsdrinks is essential to keep electrolytes in balance. \n\nAlso, beware of over hydrating. The key is simple. Are you thirsty? Sip some water. Are you still thirsty? Yes = Take a break, no= still good\n\nWe just had the comrades marathon and one big problem they see every year is runners fallimg out due to OVERhydrating. You know what you need, don't increase the volume of each sip, increase the frequency with which you sip.\n\nAlso, if you are at altitude, you will feel it alot worse. On the hottest days, you will feel like there is no air. If that is the case, wait for it to cooldown. I live pretty high and on the 35+ days you can feel it is just not going to be a good one.\n\nLastly, make sure you wear seamless or soft seam clothes, as the seams get soaked and they ride your skin which is not nice.\n\nCould you please explain what some of the signs of overhydration are and what dangers it can pose? It’s not something I’ve heard of.\n\nEarly morning runs or late evening runs. \n\nWhere it's safe to do so, 2-3 a.m. runs can be fantastic.\n\n&gt;Early morning runs or late evening runs. \n\nCool cool. \n\n&gt;2-3 a.m. \n\n\n😳\n\nI start marathon training in August, and always run before work. Let’s hope the 2-3am runs are as nice as you say 😂\n\n5:00am runs. The only way from July to Sept.\n\nIf you use a hydration vest with a bladder, put ice cubes in the bladder. Cold water feels more refreshing. Also you can put one of those flat reusable freezer packs in the vest to help keep your back from feeling like it’s slow roasting.\n\nModify routes to maximize shade\n\nSmall loop with water at your car if you don't have access to a water fountain.\n\nMy mom sets up little caches of frozen bottles along her route via car or bike so she can switch out empties and have ice cold water.\n\nRunning at dawn or just before, it's cool from the night but light enough to be seen.\n\n[\"Get inside and onto a treadmill, ya dingus!\"](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/pv-target-images/7d4b5c2b90b079e6aca584e6313f92125cf69fd0b48add7be6dcb91475c85a6b.jpg)\n\nI've been using a frog tog cooling towel on all my runs and it has been helping immensely to keep me cool and keep the heart rate down. I soak it with cold water and wear it like a scarf.\n\nFrog togs are a lifesaver. The flopping around is a bit annoying, but the relief they provide is worth it. Bonus points for being able to use it as a sweat towel instead of my shirt.\n\n**RECOVERY FROM A HOT RUN**\n\nLay on the cold garage floor and drink cold electrolytes until I feel able to deal with life again.  Eat something easy on the stomach like bananas or applesauce, then a small peanut butter sandwich.\n\nIf no garage floor, a shaded lawn (freshly sprinklered if possible) is also a delight.\n\nCold basement\n\nMy local ice cream shop starts making my small vanilla milkshake as soon as I pull into the parking lot. \n\nNot sure if this is scientifically proven, but after doing my cooldown stretches and before I shower I like to have fruit ice pops. Very refreshing and something to motivate you through the last few KMs\n\nThere's nothing I crave more when I'm hot and sweaty after summer exercise than cold fruity stuff. Juice, watermelon, freeze, it's all great.\n\nCold drinks and cold shower\n\nCold showers until you shiver or ice packs on your neck after you run. It helps bring your temp down and avoid heat stroke after hard hot efforts. It will also assist with sleep if you run later in the day. Frozen damp towels also work on the neck or face if a icepack is too intense or you don't have any handy.\n\nCold beer?\n\n**FAVORITE HYDRATION PACK**\n\nI will still sing my praises for my saloman adv skin. The fit is incredible and works with just the front or back baldder.\n\nOsprey Duro 1.5L\n\n**HEAT ACCLIMATIZATION TIPS**\n\nTry not to think too much about it — at least in my experience, the hot runs NEVER get easier.. but the fitness (“heat doping”) is sooooo real and it’ll all be worth it!\n\nIs this actually true?? I have been hoping this bc some of these runs are SO discouraging and I just feel like I'm losing fitness because of how much I slow down (or if I don't slow down, how hard it feels).\n\n100% true!!! my fastest races have always been in the fall after a horrific summer training block lmao.. think about it this way -- even though your paces are slower, your HR aka effort is about the same (or higher) as to what it usually is. sure your legs might lack a bit in the speed/turnover department, but they have a long memory and frequent strides/tempo/vo2 max workouts help significantly here.. once the cooler temps hit, you'll suddenly be able to FLY as if a 30lb weight is off your back!!\n\nas annoying as it is, I've found it best to just accept the fact that the summer training sucks and the runs still contribute significantly to your fitness even if you slow down 1min/mi+. keep at it!!\n\nOmg, this really helped my mindset so much haha, I have just been assuming no one is struggling but me 😂 such great perspective, thank you a million!! Fingers crossed!\n\nMy favorite thing is when you run all summer and it's hot as hell, then you run a race in October and it's cool and you're suddenly so much more efficient.\n\nConsider moving somewhere else.\n\nDrink a lot of water and run in areas where if you begin to get heat stroke you can go in and relax and ask for water (ie, mcdonalds).\n\nCities usually have maps of all their water fountains throughout the city as well\n\nRun in the mornings\n\nI don't acclimatize to heat the same way I do to the winter and am sure this is the same for a lot of other runners. The best solution is to be prepared and that's it\n\nAfter a run outside, instead of running inside to the A/C I will try to spend 5-10 minutes in my garage or a shaded part of my lawn while I drink some water. I find it helps my body get used to the heat.\n\nTake a walk in the sun during the hottest time of the day and stand in the sun for a few minutes. Do this a couple of days and suddenly you will start feeling it less and less.\n\nAt the beginning of the season I'll go for short runs at the hottest hours of the day. Always with plenty of water, a cap, and some sunscreen. Worked wonder to make it more bearable.\n\n**GENERAL QUESTIONS/COMMENTS**\n\nI started running last fall and run 10 min miles. In the the fall and spring, my heart rate was ~140. Now it is 160 even when I run a minute or two slower. What do I do? Run even slower? (I’m 6’6/220lb)\n\nI mostly ignore HR June-August and try to look at how I'm recovering instead.\n\nIf my \"easy\" days have me feeling good for my \"hard\" days then I'm not so worried if I was in Z3 for most of the run - that had more to do with the heat and my hydration than my effort on the run.  If I feel too worn down to execute workouts then I know I need to back off the effort/duration to give myself more recovery.\n\nIf you are running by HR, then you need to expect it to be a bit higher and give yourself some latitude.  Probably worth slowing down a little, but I would just allow for your summer runs to have a slightly higher HR.\n\nAppreciate! I generally don’t look at it too closely but it was so stark a difference it was starting to worry me a bit.\n\n[deleted]\n\nEMBRACE THE HEAT!\n\nThis is not \"get good mile times\" season, this is \"sweat a ton / keep that water weight low / if sweating actually gets bad stuff out, we're getting bad stuff out\" season. Embrace it. Learn to love it. Make your body long for winter to come once more so you'll appreciate it all the more.\n\nHeat can be awful if you're not prepared but i actually love running in the Heat and sweating profusely. It makes me feel badass and human\n\nPrevious years I have resorted to run/walk during the summer and just gave up any hope of any real running.  I can't say that I made any progress at all training wise or fitness wise.  This year I am trying 3 runs a week + 2 lifting sessions at the gym.  One of the runs is a speed session at the gym.  Another is a regular easy run at the gym (4.5 miles yesterday) and the third we are going to try to do a long run starting super early in the morning when the humidity is a billion percent but the heat isn't there.  We will see if this yields better results.\n\n**GEAR FOR RUNNING IN THE HEAT/HUMIDITY**\n\nWhite or other light colored running hats. You can dampen them and freeze them for some early run assistance to keep you cool.\n\nExtra points if the hat shades your ears and neck.\n\nI don't change much, but I do go from a black hat in the winter to a white hat in the summer.  It makes a noticeable difference!\n\nDon't know if this applies, but Body Glide is a lifesaver for those of who chafe. \n\nAlso if you're a guy, may need the band aids for nips. YMMV.\n\nI find that a loose fitting light coloured shirt helps more with keeping me cool than going shirtless when the sun is beating down on me. If running shirts are hard to find, I've found that fishing shirts do a pretty good job with this as well.\n\nThe Patagonia Capilene Cool Lightweight shirts have been solid. As the name suggests, they are super lightweight. \n\nBit pricey but they’re worth it.\n\nI'm already fully embracing running shirtless. In some ways I hate to be \"that guy\" wearing 2\" running shorts and shirtless in my neighborhood, but I do it at sunrise so not too many people are out and about. When it's 70 degrees with high humidity it's the best I can do.\n\nI wish I could rock a 2\" short. When I see people out there with that \"runners body\" I'm always jealous. I'm not big by any stretch, but years of weight lifting have given me some thick thighs. \n\nRock that shit.\n\nI live in Georgia and it’s hot! I need a new hydration belt, but I’m struggling to find one with a good fit. I’m a petite women. 5’1 and about 130lbs. I’ve gone to my local REÍ store, but they didn’t have any in my size. I’ve tried the Salmon brand, but I’m hesitant to spend the money. Any brand recommendations? I don’t want anything that bounces when I run.\n\nWhen I lost 42 lbs, I found that I had much more tolerance for running in the heat.\n\nadizero 5\" split shorts have been great, super light and breathable.  Of course no shirt to go with it.\n\nJanji 3” afo middle shorts!! Lightweight and a nice back phone pocket with no bounce\n\nLong sleeve shirts, anyone?  The idea of a lightweight, loose fitting, long sleeved running shirt to block the sun appeals to me.  But it also seems like it would trap heat and make matters worse.  I don't own one, otherwise I'd just experiment.  Is it a regional thing?  Like, they're good for very hot &amp; dry climates but not good for hot &amp; humid climates?"

    "title": "What are your running superstitions?",
    "body": "“I’m not superstitious. Just a little stitious”. -Michael Scott (&amp; Davey Martienz)\n\nI have a coffee mug I picked up at a warehouse sale for a local running store. The thing literally cost me a buck and has become my favorite mug. It has “Good Run, Champ” printed on the side. \n\nThe thing is, if I know I’m going for a run that day, I CANNOT drink out of this coffee mug. I’m convinced if I drink from this mug before my run then I haven’t earned its accolades and I will end up having a bad run. So it stays on the shelf until afterwards. \n\nSo that’s me. What are your running superstitions?  \n\nEdit: Changed quote attribution. Sorry for any fans of The Office I offended. \n\n",

    "all_comment_text": "eating before a planned run —&gt; side stitches every time. \n\neating, and then going on an unplanned run —&gt; no side stitches\n\n🤷‍♂️\n\nThis might be partially attributable to going on unplanned runs when you are presumably feeling more physically capable or extra motivated, whereas planned runs are forced regardless of how much you eat / how you feel beforehand. You are probably more likely to feel good during an unplanned run because feeling good helped inform your decision to run in the first place. At least that is how I justify it to myself.\n\nThis is crazy. I have something similar. If I plan to go run I have to time it just right after breakfast or wait a while after lunch or I’ll be too hungry or my blood sugar feels weird and I feel weak. If I go impromptu it’s never an issue. \n\nIf I go before breakfast there’s never an issue.\n\nNoob question, how do i prevent or handle side stitches? How early do i need to eat before running??\n\nallow me to quote the third line of my post:\n\n🤷‍♂️ \n\n(i wish i could be of greater help)\n\nI asked this recently IRL - I randomly got one that was BAD this past week when I was running, but good news is I was with my running club so I asked some experienced folks there, answers I got were:\n\n1. Core strength exercises\n\n2. Run through it, even if you have to slow down considerably\n\n3. Pray\n\n4. Breath through your nose when you have one, it hurts less\n\nWhen I have a nose?\n\nOMG lol was just horrible phrasing on my part bc I was typing fast 😭😂 I meant when you have a stitch. keeping it there for the memes \n\nYMMV. You have to test it for your own body. I don’t eat anything at all for 2 hours before a race and I have certain foods that I stick to. Then a gel (a brand I’ve taken before) before the start. \n\nI often run early morning runs after a banana plus a small bowl of oatmeal or a couple graham crackers. But it’s your body and you just need to consistently try something and see if it works. Train your stomach at the same time you’re training your legs/heart/lungs.\n\nIf I get a stitch I do a few very hard exhales through my mouth and they usually go away quickly.\n\nI used to be able to eat a pop tart and oj before running in the morning. Now I just throw it up lol. Gotta give myself longer time or load up the night before.\n\nSometimes you get things in advance, and I won't wear the shirt of a race before I run the race.\n\nYeah, that's my one hard and fast rule. There's superstition, and then there's openly taunting the gods.\n\nOnly because we were having this conversation at work on Friday…\n\nThere is a time and place to taunt karma lol. I happen to be on call this weekend, and EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I am on call and my attitude is generally “Mannnn…I hope I don’t get a bunch of calls…” I get a TON of calls. When I throw caution to the wind, and say some outright spiteful, hateful sh*t towards karma…maybe a call or two all weekend lol. I’m convinced karma dislikes punks lol. \n\nNow I can’t prove that also applies to running. YMMV 🤷‍♂️ lol\n\nYep! This one!\n\nI qualified and signed up for Boston 2020. Ordered the finishers jacket from Adidas website. It showed up in early March and I tried it on to make sure it fit. A few weeks later, Covid hit and I still haven’t made it to Boston. The jacket hangs in my closet taunting me.\n\nso that is what opened the door for covid! gee thanks\n\nNo one feels worse about it than me. I was in the grocery business at the time and my life was hell for the next year and a half!\nI did qualify for Boston 2025, not going to buy a jacket until I get to the expo if I make it under the cut.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo one ever told this to Rush or Dead fans\n\nRush is Canadian and that's high fashion for us.\n\nDeadhead here, can confirm, I wear dead shirts to concerts\n\nThis is the way.\n\nI won't either, but it's not superstition, it's that I feel I need to earn my shirt.\n\nThis is my only one. Cannot wear the race shirt to the race. And if you DNF, you can never wear it\n\nThis is absolute law in my life. I have even ended up with a couple of shirts for events I didn’t actually run, and I won’t wear them, even if I ran the same event the year before and the year after. If I didn’t run the event, I can never wear the shirt. Period.\n\nI can’t buy or use any race merch prior to the event. Bought a JFK 50 hat, didn’t even wear it and DNF’d at mile 38. Now my wife has to make the purchase.\n\nYes, a big one. And also if you didn't run the race for whatever reason, you can't wear the t-shirt.\n\nAbsolutely this one\n\nSame here.  I also won’t wear a shirt for a race I didn’t run.  I had to cancel a race this past weekend, but they said I could still pick up the shirt.  I said no thanks.\n\nThat's a \"must adhere to\" rule for me.\n\nTHIS!! Every race where I’ve worn the race shirt has been a disaster !\n\nI was coming here to make this same statement.   I can’t wear anything that I didn’t earn.\n\nI grew up a hockey fan, this is the running equivalent of touching the Stanley cup before you win it.\n\nYep. I only wear it when I finished the race.\n\nBack when I started running in 2015, I got myself a nice Adidas running shirt, NB running pants, and a pair of Saucony Kinvara 5.\n\nThe pants and shoes have obviously since passed to a better life.\n\nBut that old worn yellow **Adidas Performance Sequencials tee** remains my \"lucky\" t-shirt. I've run all my PBs in it 😅\n\nI don't know what I'm going to do when it dies, bro...\n\nGolden Boy!\n\nAnd eventually his son, Baby Blue\n\nAnd then Baby Blue unlocks its true power as it slowly turns into Old Bluey.\n\nI've just begun one of my own. I have a tendency to fall fairly frequently on trail runs. So I started wearing bike gloves to protect myself a bit. Since I've worn my bike gloves, I haven't fallen once. So now they are my lucky running gloves and I MUST wear them so I will never fall!\n\nThat's just smart! But being prepared always means the thing you think will happen certainly  will not. See me, every time I check the weather and take an umbrella (it doesn't rain); when I don't check, it does. Life is weird and plays games like that.\n\nHey Fern! Good to see ya. Life IS weird, that is for certain.\n\nNever ever realize that you're breathing or you'll fuck it up\n\nWas lamenting to someone about my difficulties getting cardio fitness up as fast as muscle fitness. I have my own theories on that, but this lady goes on to say \"are you sure you're breathing? You tend to hold your breath a lot, I wonder if you do it while you're running.\" Now I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT BREATHING\n\nHow not to help\n\nThis but also hyper analyzing your form mid-run and ending up awkwardly running like T-1000 at easy pace.\n\nLiterally me a few days ago thinking about an Instagram video I saw where they talked about lifting your knees more. Looked like a wonky horse.\n\nI swear it happens to me every time I do a long easy run. Fucking Robocop running on the sidewalk\n\nfwiw, you can totally train your breathing control. Which I've found really useful. I can set my breathing to set my pace, I can know my pace or effort is changing if my breathing needs to change, and decide whether I want to do that.  \n\nThis is the guide I went off: https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a28413381/rhythmic-breathing/\n\nWhen starting I found it easiest to count from the foot landing with the outbreath. Might be worth trying different points to count from, see what works. They also only go up to 3:2, while I use 4:3 for my slow pace now. Starting in 4:3 and seeing how long you can stay there is a really good way to learn to run slow. \n\nFor a while you are super aware of the counting, and it's hard not to count once you've started doing this. It is very meditative though, and eventually it quietens down and becomes second nature . You'll be able to seamlessly switch and mix up patterns at will.  \n\nIt also pretty much immediately stopped the side stitches I was getting, which is why I was trying it in the first place. \n\nymmv\n\nAs a new runner it's awesome for headgame. I just tell myself \"in\" or \"out\" in my brain + it means I can hold out a little longer before I give in + have my walk break (otherwise I'm just whining about I'm so tired or something inside my head. When I get close to whining I just yell it at myself. \"IN.\" \"OUT.\" no space for whining haha)\n\nI’m the opposite way! I can’t trust myself to breathe automatically 😆\n\nFacts.\n\nAny distance I set out to run, I always run .10 miles more because I don’t trust technology\n\nIts called the Strava-tax! :D\n\nThis is what I do. When training for my first half, I noticed that my FitBit, Apple Watch, and iPhone all tracked different distances.\n\nMost frustrating thing in the world - I finished a PB marathon and on Strava it won't count because it's not the full 42.2km according to the recording.\n\nI EARNED THAT, MARK IT DOWN\n\nThis is funny, I didn’t realize other people did this. For me if I’m trying to hit a certain distance or time, I can’t tell anyone what I’m doing ahead of time. If I’m trying to break my mile PR and I tell my husband I’m attempting it I will always fail but if I keep my plan in my head I tend to achieve it.  Yesterday I really wanted to run 4 miles without stopping to walk (a new record for me) and I didn’t tell my husband what I was doing and ended up doing almost 5 without stopping to walk. I swear if I’d told him I would’ve ruined it somehow.\n\nI think I’m the opposite ahahah, all my PBs and best races have been when I’ve told someone my goals. It doesn’t even need to be someone close to me, once it was my nurse, once it was just another lad at the start line. I think I thrive on that little bit of external pressure.\n\nThis is a good one, and it makes sense. The more you verbalize something, the more it floods your thoughts and psychs you out. Any time I'm about to go driving on a trip, see a lot of anticipated traffic on waze, and complain about it to whoever is around, I have a bad drive and am like, \"yep, look at all this traffic, it sucks.\" When I don't complain about it and think about it too much beforehand, it's never as bad for some reason.\n\nThere's actually a scientific explanation for this, or so I've heard, and it applies to anything that takes effort.\n\nSupposedly, telling people about your plans to do something that takes effort provides your brain a similar reward to actually achieving the thing you're talking about. \n\nSo, subconsciously, your brain knows now that there are two ways to achieve that reward: you can actually DO the thing, which is hard, or you can just TALK about it, which is easy. Your brain wants to pick the easy option, so it will give you less motivation, less discipline, and less energy to do it the hard way.\n\nMoral of the story: if you want to do something that takes effort, avoid talking about it as much as you can until after you've already done it to teach your brain that reward requires effort.\n\nI’m this way! It’s taken years but finally I’m open about my goals if someone asks. I think there’s an early stage in any hobby where you actually don’t know what a reasonable goal is and it’s extremely deflating to tell someone you’re going to do something and fail. Or maybe you could do a lot more. Also it frees you up to adjust them as you go.\n\nNow that I know reasonable goals to have, it feels less dicey speaking about them.\n\nThat’s a good point! I’ve only been running for about a year and just finally seeing some good progress. I signed up for a 5k next weekend and didn’t tell anyone other than my husband who needs to know for childcare haha maybe once I’m more confident I won’t feel the need to be so in my head.\n\nI’m the same way with everything lol. I’m always paranoid it won’t happen and then I’ll get some smug comments about it.\n\nIf I don't complete the distance I set out to I will die.\n\nIt’s obviously worked so far…\n\nSo far so good. We'll see at my 50k in October lol.\n\nWhich one are you doing?\n\nWomps romp in Mass.\n\nI can’t tell anyone if I’m doing a race, and never mention my goals for  PB. Every time I do, I blow up.\n\nIn high school one of the teams in my conference had a track that I hated running at. It wasn't anything about the track or other facilities, though--no, it ws the giant [Rocky Rococco](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/70/6b/b7/706bb7189504f4ef52888fa116428e30.jpg) sign across the street. I convinced myself that if I met his baleful gaze that I'd have a bad race. It sounds stupid, but I'd go entire meets trying not to even glance at that stupid sign, inevitably happen to look anyway, and then get psyched out for my event.\n\nI did run some good races there even after looking at Rocky's dumb face so I knew that what I was doing was irrational, but I never liked having meets there.\n\nWhen my sis and I race together, we have to listen to “born to run” before the race. I have to eat my pre race meal the night before (veggie pasta, baked chicken, Parmesan, black olives, tomatoes, avocado, with a little Olive Garden Italian dressing). Black coffee and a pbj for breakfast before the race. Lastly, the only time I listen to “good feeling” by Flo Rida is the last .2 miles. That’s my finisher song. I’ll turn it off any other time it pops up irl.\n\nNever take a photo in front of the finish line or walk under the finishing arc before a race.\n\nI remember in high school NO ONE from any team went through the finish line before the race. When I race now as an adult and I see people warming up through the finish line I get a little panicked. How could you be so careless?!\n\nSame! I can’t stand races that have the same start and finish line.\n\nIf I don't look a second time at the glowing green eyes looking back at my headlamp glare, then whatever it is won't kill me.\n\nTell me you're an early morning runner without telling me: you can identify wildlife simply by the color of their eyes in the dark 🤣\n\nAs someone who had to scare of a coyote this winter because it thought I was more interesting than the THREE deer nearby, I now have to stare all green eyes down until they move on or I identify what it is\n\nGot one of those Taylor swift friendship bracelets from my running partner before a marathon in January. Wound up getting a 30 minute PR. Wore that for a 10k, half, 5k and a second half and PRd in each (been chasing those PRs for 10 years). \n\nDidn’t wear it for one half and I lost my gels and salt chews 2 miles in and it poured the entire time. Not saying it was the bracelet, but it definitely was.\n\nIt appears the bracelet has made you a true \"Swiftie\" 😂\n\nTaylor mad 😆. I’d be suspicious too\n\nEvery time I think something mean on my run, I trip.\n\nEvery time I put my right shoe on first, I stub my toe mid run. So I'd say my superstition would be always putting my left shoe on first.\n\nOk I just realized I always put my right shoe on first. But until I read your comment I never even realized that I do this, I would have said it's random.\n\nAnyway I don't stub my toe but it's funny that I have habits so ingrained but I am not even aware of\n\nI have to put my right shoe on first or things just don’t feel right 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nPodcasts all throughout training...foo\nfighters greatest hits for race day\n\nI try not to look at the treadmill distance when I hit 6.66 or 13.13 miles.\n\nSame!\n\nI’ve been listening to the same playlist since I started running 4 years ago. I don’t know if that’s a superstition or if I’m just lazy.\n\nsame! I have one playlist I put on when I'm doing a difficult run. A bunch of fleet foxes lol\n\nShare the playlist lol\n\nLol it’s really just Chvches, goth babe, 808s and heartbreaks and a little bit of lil Wayne.\n\nThere is a statue I have to greet as I run past or else it curses me with an injury.\n\nPoop twice before your long run. Hard and fast rule…\n\nI didn't think I had any, then I was looking back at some race photos (the ones official or unofficial photographers take on the course) and realised I was wearing the same grey inov8 t-shirt in almost every event. I should probably find a replacement for when it bites the dust.\n\nNothing new on race day\n\nAbsolutely. That’s not superstition, that’s just good advice.\n\nI once used a different brand of gels on race day (left my own gels at home), never again 💀\n\nI know this, and yet I tempted the gods by wearing new leggings once (fleece lined because it was super cold), and the bastards kept slipping down! I kept having to stop to pull my pants up until I FINALLY got sweaty enough for them to stay in place. At least I wasn’t running commando.\n\nCan't stop mid run or my legs won't start back up again.  With the exception of having to stop for a pee of course.\n\nWish I could break this mentality because I'm envious of people who stop along their routes and take some great pictures.  Any photos I try to take are terrible and blurry because I take them while running 😂\n\nI'm not allowed to wear a race shirt unless I've run that race's length that day. \n\nGuess that isn't race specific. I'm not able to turn on my running playlist until I start running.\n\nI started running 30 years ago, when I had a Walkman. Despite all the advances in technology, I still have to carry my music in my hand and wear wired headphones. And I have to switch hands every half mile. Plus there’s a little saying I repeat each time I switch hands. I have the capability of loading enough music onto my watch and use Bluetooth headphones, but I won’t.\n\n&gt;there’s a little saying I repeat each time I switch hands\n\n  \n👀👀\n\n  \n.....don't leave us hanging!!\n\nSorry! I call each half mile a segment. Instead of thinking about miles, I think about segments. I always start with my phone in my right hand, and when I’ve run 1/2 mile, my phone alerts me. I say, “Segment one now is done.” Then at the first mile, I switch hands, and say, “Segment two now is through.” I continue the rhyme as I move through my segments, up to, usually, segment 13. I also have different mental calculations I do depending on whether it’s a left- or right-handed segment. \nTyping it all out, it may seem ridiculous. But I like to run for an hour and sometimes need that mental stimulation.\n\nI don’t post anything about my run before I do it. Like no commenting how far I have to run the next day because it always ends in disaster.\n\nHad this happen to me on the 1st of January 2024 and I kicked into full superstitious mode.\n\nI decided to go for an early morning run for one lap around the Tokyo Imperial Palace and ran the lap clockwise. The entire lap I kept crossing runners going the other way and saw almost none going my direction. Fearing I was running in an unlucky direction, I finished my lap and ran another in the other direction, with all the other runners \n\nDon't fuck with local running track traditions.\n\n[(Proof)](https://strava.app.link/rP11FdpVlMb)\n\nThis seems really wise to me. Would also have switched to run in the same direction as everybody else.\n\nMy running socks (from Moremile) have L and R on them. I always make sure that they don’t actually match my feet. No idea why. \n\nThug life!\n\nIf I have a good training run, I set the entire wardrobe aside. Shorts, shirts, shoes. Everything. That’s my race day attire.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’m of the mindset that if I step on a crack, then I break my mama’s back.\n\nI have to listen to a podcast for a long run, but music for a short run. If reversed, then the run shall only be a woeful one.\n\n100% agree with this.  Music gets me running too fast, I've had many a long run where I threw on music and went out 1-2 min / mile faster than I probably should have\n\nPrecisely. With my training plan, I'm alerted when my heart rate is too high during my longer runs. Only ever occurs with music. Podcasts keep me grounded.\n\nOh I'm similar!\n\n\nEasy runs = no headphones \nQuality workouts = music\nLong runs = podcast\n\nNever say to myself “oh man, this sidewalk is clear for a mile or more!” Because someone or something will pop out of nowhere.\n\nMaybe not too superstitious, but here we go. I only use my running clothes for running. I'm afraid that if I wear the clothes without going for a run immediately after putting on the clothes, the clothes looses its trigger value.\n\nI'm in a bit of a pickle, my superstition is that I cannot have any superstitions. 🤷‍♂️\n\nI match my ponytail holders to my running outfit!\n\nNever wear the race shirt until after having run the race\n\ncrew socks. always. non-negotiable.\n\nJust a little stitious 😂 I can't tell anyone I'm signed up for a race or *something* will go terribly wrong. A side stitch, shoe malfunction, coming down with a cold. I don't tell anyone and I crush it. Every damn time!\n\nProbably a bit dumb, but I usually have to take a good luck beer the day before the race, nothing strong, just something refreshing for good luck.\n\nPre-pandemic I used to always lay out my running clothes on top of my shoes the night before my run. In a way it was a promise to myself that I would actually do it. That was when I would also have to set an early alarm, getting up at 5:30 or earlier to squeeze in a run before commuting to work. Now that I work from home I don’t do that anymore, thank god. But I do always but on my right shoe first!\n\nVery low-key, I have a specific hair tie that I wear on race days or very demanding long runs. I ended up buying several packs just to get multiples of this color/pattern and it’s a nice little reminder that I’ve done well before and will again!\n\n30 jumping jacks every time before I run otherwise convinced I’ll hurt myself (even though I do other exercises to warm up)\n\nMal de ojo. I have a deep need to touch a baby if I look at it. Just on the foot or leg. If you don't know, there is a Mexican superstition that if you look at a baby, you should make contact with it, because you could steal its energy or give it bad luck. If you see Mexican babies with little bracelets or anklets, that's why. The bracelet is to absorb the bad juju.\n\nI have on OCD breathing pattern that borders on superstition\n\nDon't tell me it, or I will, too. OCD can be so ridiculous lol\n\nI always throw a few jabs when I run past a statue of a local boxer on one of my regular routes.\n\nI’m definitely in the group that never wears the shirt before completing the race.\n\nAlso, when I used to listen to music I would not allow myself to listen to my running playlist unless I was on a run. I have since stopped listening to music/podcasts while running altogether. Not a superstition, but I just feel more in tune with my body.\n\nNone that I am aware of.  Never really thought about it.  Hope I don't pick one up.\n\nNever run with a stress/tension headache.... it'll make it worse. I've had to stop a few runs bc of it.\n\nI cannot get a good night's sleep the night before a race. If I sleep through the night then the race sucks. But if I toss and turn and wake up 88 million times then I can run my butt off and do well.\n\nShorts can never be a lighter color than the shirt\n\nNot really a superstition, but…\n \nThere’s a particular tree on my favorite trail - I couldn’t even tell you the species - that has a branch that grows down and out just off the side of the trail, like an arm. It gets a high-five every time I pass it.\n\nI don't cross the finish line until I've raced the course. \n\nWhat if the start line is the finish line?\n\nThen it's not yet the finish line\n\nAlways run clockwise around lakes.\n\nAlways anticlockwise when running laps like a running track.\n\nI'm convinced I'm going to get food poisoning right before a race, so I avoid restaurants and food that's been in my fridge for more than a few days. I'll pretty much only go for dry staples (oats, rice, cream of wheat, protein powder) or things in the freezer (veggies, fruit) in days leading up to the race.\n\nI always have to listen to \"Drivin South\" by Jimi Hendrix and \"New Boogie Chillun\" by George Thorogood before I run a race. I've been doing that since high school cross country. Otherwise, it's not an official race or going to be a good one.\n\nRight shoe always goes on first\n\n(1) lace shoes three times before starting a race; and, do not wear race tee until after finishing the race.\n\nNot really superstitious, but I never announce my races until they happen.\n\nThe night before a half or full marathon I always watch “Run Fat Boy Run”\n\nWait. That’s not an original Michael Scott quote?\n\nI can not run on a treadmill without headphones and music but I just run without when I’m outside. It’s a rule. The music messes up my breathing and listening to my cadence outside\n\nNew running socks before every race 1/2 marathon and longer. Nothing else in my race day gear will be new, except the socks.\n\nI have developed a superstition against wearing Saucony running shoes. There is no rational basis for it — I even have worn and enjoyed Saucony as casual shoes — but I have contrived to convince myself that something terrible will happen if I run in any model of their running shoes. I am not proud of this. \n\nIt’s absurd, especially since I don’t have any brand loyalty. I have bounced around every major running shoe brand — Adidas, Brooks, Nike, Hoka, ASICS, Mizuno New Balance — and I am open to trying On and Puma. But not Saucony.\n\nI had a pair of Saucony's and after a few wears the sole started falling apart in the middle of a run. As far as I know this is not a common problem, so it must have been that one pair of shoes. But I also had multiple pairs of Saucony socks that wore out fast. Maybe my bad luck with one particular brand so I'm with you on this one.\n\nI had a pair of rides that had the bottoms peeling off, the part that’s like glued on if that makes sense. They were cool about replacing it though but I traded them in for the endorphin speed and they’re very nice.\n\nOnly listen to a certain playlist before and during the race.\n\nNo wearing the race shirt before completing the race.\n\nRight shoe first.\n\nHalf-marathons and marathons: pacer timing band is worn to the right of my watch.\n\nRight shoe first, always!\n\nI only have a „good“ run if I wear a shirt of my fav Team (Real Madrid) 🫣\n\nJust developed a new one, right before heading out for a run, I told my friend that I wasn’t going to trip. I then tripped and ate it so hard that I broke my wrist. Clearly never going to talk about tripping again.\n\nNo dairy 3-5 days before a road race. The 3-5 days depends on the length with 5 days being the minimum for 13.1-26.2. \n\nThe same race outfit I always wear whether I think I will PR or not. I know that my sports bra, shorts, shoes and even socks/underwear being the same I won’t have a chafe or blister issue. \n\nA playlist that starts with my specific “race start” song and my specific “race end” song. Again does not matter whether I think I will PR or not, but knowing I have my energetic song to start strong and my finisher song to know I can empty out the tank to goes such a long way.\n\nI usually smack a tree branch every 5k and make sure to never leave trash (gels, gum wrappers) on the course\n\nIf I weigh myself down on a long run with everything I might need, I will go the whole run without using any of it. \n\nIf I run without it, suddenly I will lose a contact, get a calf cramp, cut my finger on a branch, and be totally parched from not packing enough water.\n\nI got clipped by a car running in Central Park many years ago. So I always speed up at that point to get passed it as quickly as possible\n\nLeft shoe on first. Always.\n\nLol that is a funny superstition\n\nI just have to run on the first day of the month, otherwise I believe that the whole month will not go smoothly.\n\nEverything’s around races for me - one fancy beer the night before, a specific pair of socks, gotta wear my RUN FOR BOSTON rubber bracelet my FIL got for me…\n\nI had a dream that I got hit by a car while wearing a particular short and tshirt combination. I’m never ever wearing that again!\n\nPre-run coffee in the morning and same running playlist with wired earbud headphones\n\nI avoid stepping on manholes or cracks while jogging.\n\nAnytime I am training for a half, I usually start training with a Gu when I run 7+ miles. The last few training cycles I got to that point, bought Gus in bulk, then proceeded to injure myself. No half this time…… moral of the story, I should not by a large pack of Gus\n\nNo red sneakers in a race. Not even once. You're bound to trip and it'll hurt real bad.\n\nI don't have any.  Four decades of living has made it abundantly clear to me that all superstitious, supernatural, and spiritual things are false and utterly incompatible with the mundanity of real life.\n\nthat running has given me a tan\n\nIf you start talking about falling, someone will fall 😭🍁\n\nthe park i do most of my runs at has a few little posts along the path way. i always have to boop the top of the post as i pass by.\n\nI never run without my trusty running cap. Ever.\n\nMust jump over the 2.5 stairs leading to my door after any length of run. To show that the run didn't kill me.\n\nI have to clean off my running shoes with a warm cloth before I go to set the stage for a successful run.  Clean shoes = Clean run.\n\nPoo before. That’s about it.\n\nSame bud - I can’t log a weight (bench press) until after I’ve done it. It’s just bad juju.\n\n10 side leg swings, 10 front leg swings and 10 calf raises per leg before any run.\n\nnot sure if this is a superstition but if I’m running with a group I cant bring myself to complain about anything being tough until the run’s over. if I allow myself to admit I’m having a rough go of it I’ll immediately start slacking\n\ni only run at night: putting my hair in a Top bun = an Owl will attack my head and rip my scalp off\n\nNot quite a superstition, but when I did XC in high school, we had a tradition of always tapping the stop sign at the top of the school’s driveway as we finished our run.\n\nLast couple of years I have often been driving out to my old high school to run our old XC routes, and I still make sure to hit the stop sign as I’m finishing my run!\n\nI have a pair of running shoes I got in 2013. I run in the same ratty, old, threadbare shoes for every race. \n\nI have identical shoes that I'll run when I train that are in newer shape, but if it's race day, I'm in ol' reliable.\n\nA path I often run passes between two huge Beech trees. I have to touch the tree on the left and then the tree on the right as I pass through. I’m not sure what would happen if I didn’t but it would feel wrong and no good would come of it.\n\nLonger Distances takes eternal to complete without long playlist and prepare socks earlier before running\n\nI got a pair of running socks during my first half marathon back in 2013. Have reached a new PB every race I've ran in them.\n\nIf it's raining before I start, no running. If it rains during my run, it's a wonderful run...\n\nNever wear a race’s shirt before the actual race or on race day.\n\nI have to wear my summer running cap between April and October, and my winter running hat between November and March. \n\n\nI also have to have odd knee-high socks on and the same running gloves, whether it's -5 degrees or 40 degrees. \n\n\nThe run can't start if those conditions aren't met. I also celebrate the 2 changing-of-the-hat days per year.\n\nEating a PBJ (specifically strawberry uncrustable) or a Pop tart before run- best run ever.\n\nI never wear the race t-shirt before/during the race. I only wear it after I complete the race. Bad JuJu.\n\nNot looking at my watch during races.\n\nI can only listen to the songs on my running playlist while I'm running. If I listen to any of them out of that context, they lose their magic.\n\nNot at all religious but I do a cross after finishing a race.\n\nAnd a McDonald's before race if possible 😂\n\nI have no idea where I first heard it (sometime in high school when I ran cross country and track) but I was told that a completely new/not used bib wouldn't be read by the finishing senor sometimes, so you should crumple/crease up the bib a bit. To this day I still do this to any bib before I pin it to by shirt just in case."

    "all_comment_text": "I wonder if the median time would look substantially different. My guess is yes...\n\nI saw a list of median times and it's much different. I think it said the median half marathon for men was in the 1:43 range\n\nThat seems high, I looked a couple half marathon results and 1:43 would’ve put you comfortably above the median male finisher (which was closer to 1:57) Median is definitely the better metric though, averages easily skewed on the high-side by the slower runners\n\nIt's probably heavily skewed by the specific race, too. Different races attract different crowds.\n\nIt may have been a little slower but I remember being surprised how fast the half median was even in comparison to the other distances. At 55 I was faster than the median for 5k, 10k, and 10 mile, about average for the marathon but the median half was faster than my PB of 1:47\n\nSelf selection presumably. A higher average level of fitness and running ability in those choosing to sign up for half marathons\n\n...and now i feel bad again\n\nThey couldn't just leave it could they\n\nWoohoo! Slightly quicker than the median!\n\nThat’s funny as my last half was 1:43!\n\n&gt; median time\n\nIt feels like the winners of casual races are still at (what I consider a) \"regular\" 17 to 20min for a 5k (depending on age group), but now there are a lot of slower times.\n\nIn some of my local races, it seems like going from 28min to 23min will move you from 30th place to 4th (again age group). But you need to get to 19ish to move up one or two more slots (in an older age group).\n\nIDK, maybe people think that's normal, but feels like there is a big gap between untrained and somewhat trained runners. My races have series-level prizes, so maybe that's driving a handful of faster people to show up.\n\nHow big is the city that you live in? I live in a larger city (around 5 million people) and 5k winners are almost always below 17 min. In some races sub 20 wont even get you a top 10 finish.\n\nIt’s not only the city, but the specific race as well. There’s a 5k in a small city/bigish town near me that will have 10+ folks under 16:15 or so. The winner will be under 15, and this is on a difficult course during the hottest part of the year. Any other race in that town could be won with a 17 95% of the time. Fast runners attract other fast runners, because folks will seek out races that will have others in a similar competitive bracket even if it means traveling a bit.  There’s really no fun in turning up to a 5k and winning by 1:00+. At that point it’s just a time trial that you paid money for.\n\nI have fun at every single race. They are also all essentially time trials against myself. I'm not going to beat elites, and unless I know some others who are about my speed, there is no way to know if there will be any real competition. Everyone might be faster or slower.\n\nTo each their own, but going and dominating a local charity 5k or 10k doesn’t do much for me. It’s not hard to figure out which races will have better competition, which is really what I’m looking for in most local/regional races. I just ask around and see what other folks are running, and look at prior year’s results. That said, if I can get a comped entry, or if there’s a cash prize, my feelings are subject to change.\n\nRunning in and finishing any race always thrills me, no matter who else is there or where I finish among the field. \n\nI don't care about the competition at all. Unless no one else shows up, it doesn't matter who is there or not there.\n\nI try to use others as motivation to make me go faster, yes. Try to catch someone or keep someone behind me, for instance. But if I don't succeed, no big deal. \n\nI always run faster in races anyway because it's just psychological, knowing it's a race.\n\nBut I'm ultimately only racing myself. Seeing what I can do. Enjoying the experience and getting to talk to other runners afterward. Maybe attending whatever events are associated with the race after it ends, like a festival or something. \n\nI am not even super fast and I have a case full of trophies and a wall full of medals from charity races, some that were harder to earn than others, but in the end they are all just souvenirs to me - no different than the t-shirt most everyone got by entering. \n\nIt's nice to win things, sure, but I'm there for the experience. That's the joy to me. To push myself in the race and see how I do on that day and that course, then to take in the events and talk with others. It doesn't really matter if I easily win the whole race or somehow come in last by many minutes.\n\nThat’s cool man. Different strokes. This isn’t like some moral or philosophical competition. My point was just that people that run races to actually race will choose races where there will be people to compete with. Obviously that doesn’t apply to everyone. I’m just speaking for myself and the other competitive runners I know.\n\nThis series of races was in a city of around a million and was mostly casual despite some prize money\n\nThe other responder mentioned weather / course. The specific one I was mentioning a ~19min 5k for 3rd place in an older age group was flat (~50' of elevation) but it was very hot and humid (heat index of 102F).\n\n[deleted]\n\nMales only. Women can win with times in the low 20’s unless the race is particularly popular.\n\nI run a lot of small field races (between 50 and 200 participants usually).\n\nWhile winners are usually under 20 minutes and can often be faster (last one was around 15), the rest of what you said isn't similar.\n\nIf you go from 28 minutes to 23 minutes, the latter can easily be an age group winner many times, or top 3 anyway.\n\nKeep in mind that a 23 minutes finish is often a runner who trains. Even 28 could be as well. \n\nIf you can finish in 23 minutes with no training, you should be able to go sub 17 with training.\n\nAverage time is about to spike when Encino Man gets around to finishing that 10k he started in the ice age.\n\nThe average finishing time in the 1912 Olympic marathon was about a year and a half\n\nThey should provide the metrics from 10-20-30 years ago for the same distances. These times are getting a lot slower than they once were\n\nThe purely rec runners are older and heavier on average.\n\nWould also be interesting to look at the whole distribution and not just the average. The pointy end is definitely faster/deeper than 10-20 years ago - most marathon qualifying times have come down 5-10mins in recent years.\n\nWith the distribution, I'd love to see the raw numbers too and not just the population-normalized percentages. My expectation is that the present day bell curve will completely cover the 10 to 20 years ago bell curve, with more athletes finishing at every time.\n\nAverage people weren't running marathons all the time then. Now the pool has expanded to more slower runners which bring down the average.\n\nYou have to realize as the distance goes up the ability level does too and a lot of the walker and joggers fall off.\n\nCourse cutoffs, too - a lot of 5ks have a 10k option so the course cutoff is very generous (20+min/mi). A lot of halfs will have a 3-3.5hr cutoff (&lt;16min/mi).\n\nI clicked on the article. It says that the average finish time for a 5K is 39:02, but it also states:\n\n&gt; When you break it down by gender, the average 5K finish time for a male runner is 31:28, with an average mile pace of 10:08, and the average 5K finish time for a female runner is 37:28, with an average mile pace of 12:04.\n\nHow is the overall average 5k time slower than both the male and female times?\n\nIf you click through this is what the source says:\n\n&gt;Average 5k finish time for men: 35:22 min\n\n&gt;Average 5k finish time for women: 41:21\n\nThose numbers align a lot better. No idea where the article pulled its info from. The 31:28 appears for average time for &lt;20 male runners. The female number does not appear.\n\nRunner's World isn't a great magazine these days. A long time ago it was pretty good. \n\nNow it's more articles like \"Top 9 ASICS running shoes\". Top 9? Seriously?\n\nData magic 🙃\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo, that wouldn't be Simpson's paradox.   It's pretty hard to come up with a realistic example of Simpson's Paradox for running, since the \"sample size\" (i.e., the mileage), is the same in all real cases (i.e., races).\n\nAn unrealistic example (because you'd never make this type of comparison) is:\n\nIn one race, I ran 6 minute miles for a 5k and you ran 7 minute miles for a half.  In another race I ran 9 minute miles for a half and you ran 10 minute miles for a 5k.\n\nIn both races, I had a faster pace than you, but your overall pace (or time to finish) across the two races is faster than me.\n\nOf course, that's contrived and you'd never compare races like that. I can't come up with a good running example.  \n\nBut Simpson's Paradox wouldn't lead to the overall average being lower than the two other averages, since that's not what it's about. You basically need four samples across two groups for it to rear its ugly head\n\nThat doesnt seem to apply here and doesnt really make sense mathematically.\n\nI agree, Simpson’s did it.\n\nNo, this is just positive skew. Race times, like most things in nature, are close to a log-normal distribution - this naturally makes the mean higher than the median.\n\nI prefer it this way. Having run in Europe in some countries where only “serious athletes “ sign up for races, it’s nice to see all body sizes and shapes get out there and hit the pavement.\n\nI've never known it otherwise.\n\nThese averages include a lot of walkers, which skews the averages much slower.\n\n[This site](https://runninglevel.com/running-times/5k-times) has a more comprehensive list of time standards by ability level, age, and gender.\n\nWow, my 5k is that of a 55yo beginner and I'm 38, feels good man\n\nBaby steps 🤣\n\nYou are clearly wise beyond your years.\n\nhaha! I lost 10 years over the past year, down to being a 50 yo beginner at 30\n\nThat site has identical times for everyone from 20-30. Doubt it's accurate. It provides literally 0 source or even an explanation of methodology. We don't know whether that's based on the US, Western countries in general, the global population, etc.. You also don't even know if that site doesn't include walkers, you're just assuming that because it's faster. It could simply be faster because it has the wrong dataset. \n\nWe can look at a major marathon like Philly and look at the M20-24 range. Of the 875 who competed, the median would be #438. #438 ran a 3:55 which is 20 minutes behind the \"intermediate\" time that the site claims is accurate. Intermediate they claim is 50% of runners. Meanwhile, the advanced is also off. Beating 80% of runners would be #175 which ran a 3:21, 12 minutes behind the claimed advanced speed. Going in the other direction, they claim a novice speed is 4:10. #700 raced a 4:42. Also only 25 people in that age group were slower than a 6:00 so it's not like a huge shift if we shift down a bit. For the time that the site quoted of 3:34:56, that would actually be #259 out of #875 for the Philly Marathon. Is the Philly marathon representative of all marathons? Probably not. but it's a fairly major and common marathon to run and if the numbers are that different I'm hesitant to trust a website that doesn't link its sources. \n\nI'm honestly surprised now that I'm thinking about it that there isn't a better database for this info for people to reference. You could easily grab all the major marathons and group them together and at least have something easily to reference.\n\nEdit: Some of y'all think that because I'm not an elitist, I'm trying to compensate for being slow. I'm faster than all the intermediate times posted. I'm just making a point that the people who think these are averages are being delusional or just only considering a very small subset of runners (who are by definition not average). You can't use a marathon that has competitive qualifying standards to determine what the average marathon runner's time is. That should really be common sense. That's like asking what average household income is and removing anyone who makes under 6 figures. Yes, Americans are wealthy if you ignore all the poor ones. Yes, marathon runners can be very fast if you ignore all the slow ones.\n\n&gt;I'm honestly surprised now that I'm thinking about it that there isn't a better database for this info for people to reference. You could easily grab all the major marathons and group them together and at least have something easily to reference.\n\nI'd say the 6 majors (Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and NY) would be the perfect dataset for this. Combine it with the Super-Halfs (Lisbon, Prague, Berlin, Copenhagen, Cardiff, Valencia)  and it's likely a good set of reliable quality data without many joggers\\\\walkers.\n\nFor the average runner? Definitely not. Nobody is saying 5 or 6 hours is a fairly outstanding marathon time but if you're finishing a marathon in 5 hrs, that's a pace of 5.24 mph for 5 hours straight. I'd consider that running. \n\nThere's a huge gap between someone who is just walking the marathon vs. someone who can qualify for these marathons. I'm aware that there are plenty of charity bibs, lottery, etc. other ways to qualify but that's def not representative of the average. Boston's median for the mens 18-39 for context was 3:08:40. I tried NYC/Berlin but the results databases are so unfriendly. If I have some free time maybe I'll assemble and put smth up so people can look at it lol. \n\nLooking at LA marathon for comparison, of the 1128 that finished in the m20-24 category, #564 finished with a time of 4:37:50. That's a gap of 1:29:10. It's pretty significant. Obviously, courses being different has a huge impact on that but still, I would find it hard to rule one as more valid than the other when judging what the *average marathon* time is. \n\nThis also kinda goes to show why the overall conversation around this is a bit pointless. Marathon courses aren't built the same (we all know this), and the population doing these marathons aren't the same. Even though we're talking about US marathons, the population that attends them is neither a good representation of the US population as a whole due to being local to a city + the prevalence of international athletes at the major US marathons but also fails to account for all the other normal runners around the world. I'm running the mexico city marathon this year and if you look at the times from previous years (can't find a good results database but go to page [3](https://www.athlinks.com/event/205411/results/Event/1029195/Course/2299517/Division/31329520/Results) after sorting by m18-34) and you can see that the Boston Marathon's 3:08:40, which was *average*, would put that runner at 300th for men and 325th overall in the marathon. 15000 people ran that year (2022). Meanwhile, the median time in that race for m18-34 was 4:35:40 which makes it slightly faster than the LA one. Quite interesting to see. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you're curious how fast you're gonna be relative to the population. Find the local marathon you're going to be running and check previous stats. You'll have a pretty good ballpark of what is the average. And regardless, keep in mind the long tail of people who can't run a marathon.\n\nDoes LA marathon have qualifying standards? Boston requires either qualifying times that are pretty quick or fundraising.\n\nNo, you just register.\n\nThat'll skew the times way slower then.\n\nYes, because runners are allowed to run marathons that are slower than 3 hours and still be considered runners? In the grand scheme of things, the vast majority of runners who can run marathons are not able to run a BQ time. That's like if I only looked at College track athletes to determine what are appropriate 5K times for runners.\n\nYes, plus it has a 7-hour finish cutoff (or at least it did). That’s the longest I’ve ever seen anywhere.\n\nNo I think that is a very accurate chart.... I have no idea where it is pulling data from but for sure it is very close to accurate....\n\nFrom the age of 20 to 30 you should essentially be able to be in the same shape if you trained the way it is described at the bottom of it.\n\nI went through all the times from 5km to 1/2 marathon and it was essentially accurate. Also very accurate in terms of what you would call novice to intermediate to advanced range.\n\nWhat is your evidence that it's accurate? It sounds like you're going off feeling. You don't show any evidence, whereas when we look at actual major marathons being run in the wild, we can see that the times are far off what they claim should be average. I could say the exact same thing. \"I went through all the times from 5k to 1/2 marathon and it was wrong. Not very accurate at all in terms of what you would call the divide.\"\n\n  \nAlso just as a general principle, novice comes before beginner so it's weird that they've mixed up the two. You start as a novice and progress.\n\nYou just need to get into better shape.\n\nI'm faster than the intermediate times and this is just one of my many side hobbies so I'm perfectly comfortable with that.\n\nIt's good that your hobby is running; I don't think you'd be able to handle the mental load for anything that requires logic, deduction, basic statistical knowledge, etc..\n\nSeems that your main hobby is Reddit Troll lolol\n\n  \nSo you are faster than the intermediate times,,, would you say you have trained in the intermediate range that is stated? That would be about right for this chart?\n\nWhat psycho 15 year old ran a 13:18 5K? My lord that is fast for that age\n\nWikipedia lists the US record for an outdoor 5k under 20yo at 13:24 so yeah I’d be highly skeptical of a 15yo running a 13:18…\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_junior_records_in_athletics#:~:text=Event%2C%203000%20m%2C%205000%20m%2C%20%2C%2010000,2022%2C%2028%20March%202024%2C%20May%207%2C%202005%2C\n\n[deleted]\n\n13:18 is only 29s off world record pace. Call me cynical but I don't know how official that time is for a kid that age.\n\nThat's Kiplimo.  Though it was only 13:19.  He ran for Uganda in the Olympics as a 15 year old and has the current half WR.\n\nYeah, back when I ran cross country in HS, mid 15’s were good for being the best in the state of Florida. (It definitely wasn’t me but another guy on our team my senior year was that guy haha)\n\nNo chance it was a legit time. Guaranteed the course wasn't measured.\n\nIt was Kiplimo and it was on a track.  It's a legit time.\n\nMy fault for not reading the article. I thought it was just U.S. road races.\n\nTo be fair, I'm pretty sure it was just 13:19; I know - scrub.\n\nBut he's racing the 10000 later today.  Should be a show.\n\nThat's Kiplimo, current world record holder in the half.\n\nVery humbling 😭\n\nWait holy shit, are we really saying maintaining a 7 minute mile is just \"intermediate\"?? I mean that's definitely not an expert time but I think that most runners can't maintain that pace.\n\nYeah. I already pointed it out elsewhere but the median for M20-24 in the LA marathon was 4:37:50 which works out to a pace of like 10:39 or smth.  And in any case people are forgetting that marathon is such a small subset of runners in the first place. Most runners are not doing marathons and would be a lot slower if they actually did it. \n\nAlso sidenote but people keep talking about this supposed \"slowing\" of marathon times but if you look at the Philly Marathon (because their database is actually easy to look through unlike others), this didn't happen. The median in 2023 was a time of 3:55 for m20-24. In 2014, the median was 3:57. This holds up for the general population as well. In 2014, the overall median (mens and women) was 4:13:41. In 2023, it was 4:08:05. So the time actually got faster. And the logic relatively holds up even at the tail end? In 2023, 489 runners ran a time slower than 6 hours. (4% of all marathon finishers in Philly). In 2014, it was 411 runners (3.97%). So basically a similar amount of runners were slow. I really don't think there's been a great \"slowing down\" of runners especially at the marathon level. Maybe at the 5k/10k level because that's a lot more approachable but almost nobody is waking up and deciding they'll randomly do a marathon. A) it literally just costs a lot more money to do even before anything else. B) It's a lot scarier to most people. C) It does require a lot of effort and contrary to how some runners act (as if anybody remotely fit can just get up and do a marathon &lt;6 hrs) it does require training.\n\nThat's interesting. I am a low 2:50's runner and in no way would I consider myself \"Elite\". That is a sub 2:30 runner or professional runner...\n\nElite is comfortably sub 2:20. Into the two 2:20s is sub-elite. A 2:30s is a “very good club runner”. \n\nIf we’re dealing with actual definitions of course.\n\nThat site needs to reconsider \"elite\".  I don't think my 17 minute 5k will result in a pro contract.\n\nthey just define it as the 95th percentile of runners, which that probably is. elite in colloquial terms is more like the 99th percentile though, i.e. to be in the elite category.\n\nI'd be amazed if 5% of people can run those times.   I'm usually finishing right around the top 0.5-1% overall and only my 5k makes the \"elite\" time cut.  Admittedly I look at overall rather then age group though. \n\nElite means pro or at least semipro in a lot of cases when talking about a marathon field. Definitely not the colloquial definition.\n\nInteresting site. They claim a 10 year old male Elite marathon runner is running the marathon in 03:22:31. While doing so he is faster than 95% of 10 year old marathon athletes and as an elite he has already \"dedicated over five years to become competitive at running\".\n\nThat's a nice ego boost. My age and times put me between advanced and elite for most distances.\n\nUnfortunately the elite times are laughably inaccurate.\n\nThat's why it's an ego boost...\n\nI've been working on my speed for over a year now lol and apparently I've finally reached beginner level for my age group. This thread is depressing me a bit because I honestly don't know how to get faster any faster! At least I'm improving against myself I guess.\n\nI think this is very accurate in terms of running.... I am right in the group that I should be in....\n\nReally interesting, but I don’t think the same methodology should be used for all distances. For someone to run a marathon, I would say they’ve already advanced beyond the beginner and novice stages.\n\n&gt; A good 5k time for a man is 22:31\n\nWell shit\n\n70 year old WR holder running the \"elite\" 5k time for 20-somethings. Nice!\n\nCool.  I show Elite on this one.  I'll take it for now!\n\nMakes me feel so much better about my 46 min 5k pb! 😅 just a bit more closer to being average\n\nJust reporting in to represent the slow runner and make the rest of you look good.\n-runningbacktotokyo, marathon PR 5:39 \n\nat my large attendance parkrun, so that covers people of all ages and abilities, running the 5k in 39 minutes would put one, I dunno, slower than 85%-90% of runners?. And I am pretty sure near half the people running only run parkrun each week. The lower half are not, usually, running 3 times or more a week. \n\nIn fact in winter, which tends to knock out the casuals, 39 minutes is 290th out of 300 :(\n\nYeah because that pace it is called walking not running. I am sorry.\n\nNo way. \n\nIt's odd to think that I've been an above average finisher in 5k and 10k races my whole life if I've only now at age 41 started training. 🤔  I used to do like 10 miles a week at most. No heartrate no nothing. Just junk miles.\n\nNow that I'm actually following a plan I hope to finally get below 20 minute on the 5k. Definitely harder at my age. Then going to try my first half marathon and I hope go achieve sub-2.\n\nat a 25 min 5k, you should be able to sub-2 a half.\n\nYeah that's what it says on the vdot charts. Since I had never run that distance before, I'm not going to take it for granted.\n\nMy first half training ever, I was coming in running a 21:50 5k (7:02 pace). My coach told me my goal time would be 1:35 (7:15 pace), and I immediately looked at her and said, \"Seriously?\" 'Seriously.'\n\nDidn't make that goal. Did break 1:36:30, though. You'll be surprised at what you can do.\n\nThat's encouraging to hear. Thanks!\n\nI turn 40 this year and after several years of battling to hit a 20 min 5k, I’ve started running much MUCH more in 2024 and now I’m hitting 20 minute 5ks on the regular and knocking on a sub 18.\n\nYou got this man.  Just keep at it\n\nWow, that's encouraging. I'd love to continuously hit 20-minute 5ks.\n\nHow much was \"much more\"? How much were you running per week when you finally broke the 20 minute barrier?How many weeks did you spend running at a high mileage before you got below 20 minutes?\n\nI was running maybe 20-30km per week but inconsistently.  Ran a backyard ultra last year and got bit by the ultra bug.  Now running 100k weeks with a running coach and more structured training.. hills, speed, long and slow…\n\nI’ve been running for 16 years and have not had a sub 20min 5k despite ~10 half’s, 2 fulls and about 30 5ks. Some of us are just built different regardless of how much we run, I guess. \n\nMy 9th half was my first sub 2hr (by 3 whole seconds) and since my fastest and my 2nd full was my fastest at 4:12, yet I still can’t break a ~23min 5k!\n\nNumber of races finished doesn't equal training level.  Are you regularly running 40+mpw all year? \n\nThis whole thread hurt my feelings, I thought my sub 2 half (first one) was a good goal 😭\n\nIf it's a good goal for you then it's a good goal! People at all sorts of ability levels are in this sub. I've got my fourth and fifth HMs in October and I'm still chasing the sub 2:00, only ever managed it in training.\n\nif you can comfortably finish a half marathon in approximately 2 hours without injury, you are a) in better shape than the people who finish ahead of you and destroy themselves and b) in wayyyyyy better shape than &gt;95% of the general population.\n\nOkay okay, that made me feel better, thank you 🥹\n\nLots of purely recreational athletes in the 5k races.  You would expect the average 10k time to be a bit more than 2x the 5k time if the same people ran both.\n\nBloody hell. When I was running well, in 2019 after 5 years of running, I was doing 59 on 10K and 2h17 on a half at my best.\n\nEither your speed fell off a cliff after 10k, or one of those is not correct.\n\nThank you for that. 2h17 for the half (edited!) not 1h17.\n\nComparison is the thief of joy. Stop comparing yourself to others and compare who you are today to the person you were yesterday.\n\nWeird… everyone here is running a 16 min 5k… 🙄\n\nI wonder what it would like if you only include runners that have ran the race distance at least twice. You get rid of a lot of bucket listers or people doing a one time effort and get more people who run as a sport structurally\n\nThe average 5k time seems way too slow. I’ve checked a load of local race results (including Parkruns, which welcome walkers) and haven’t seen one where less than 85% of the field are beating 39 minutes, and that was on the toughest Parkrun course in the area. 96% of people beat that time in the race I did tonight, with 12 of the 15 who missed that mark being 43 minutes or under, and the slowest taking 49. It just doesn’t seem right.\n\nI'm better than average! \nI'll take any win these days 😜\n\nThose are times I can only dream about, I'm still rather unfit.\n\nGreat reminder for everyone here, you can't really many any conclusions on a given average value without the  corresponding median\n\nFor 5k they report the average male time as 30:XX and the female average as 37:XX. I have literally no idea how the average 5k is then 39:XX.\n\n&gt;the average time has become considerably longer...\n\nI wonder what the average cutoff time was for races over the years.\n\nWooooh I’m above average in all categories.\n\n10-42km the time is doubled from the previous distance. However the average for 5km is almost 40mins. \n\nI wonder why that is.\n\nThank you! I wanted to check this, but it was behind a paywall. \nYou rock OP!\n\nHow do I fix my fucking shins, I'm trying to run 4:30 in 5 weeks\n\nMy shins were going because my form was crap, switched to forefoot and focused on not over-pronating\n\nOkay so I focused on forefoot today, problem is now I feel like I found a cheat code, but I have a problem slowing down and staying in zone 2. Any advice?\n\n[removed]\n\nCan't thank you enough, did 18 yesterday and my shins don't feel any worse today. Feels like I'm using completely different muscles, calves are super tired but it went way better than I was expecting\n\nA little while back, I took a look at the times for my local major race weekend. The 5k runs on Saturday morning, and then the 10k/HM/FM run on Sunday. They’re not fast courses; for example, the 10k had 109 metres of elevation gain according to my Strava. Also, especially when it comes to the marathon, more serious runners will often go elsewhere in the region. Still, the 2024 races created a set of 4,855 useable datapoints/races run, and I think that it’s enough to draw some inferences. \n\n[Firstly, division winners.](https://imgur.com/ZHyLG5q) I don’t think that this one is too surprising. It’s not an elite race, these are not elite times. The division winners generally have pretty respectable times though; there’s plenty of people with successful running YouTube channels going slower than that. \n\n[More relevant are the average division paces.](https://imgur.com/hdw5uxF) The half marathon had the fastest pace, followed by the full, then the 10k, then the 5k. That makes sense when you consider that the more casual runners usually won’t be doing the longer races. This would suggest the average half marathon finish is in 2:04:29, the average full marathon finish is in 4:18:50, the average 10k finish is in 1:03:50, and the average 5k finish is in 33:05. \n\n[Finally, there’s where things fell out by some somewhat arbitrary 20 second pace bands.](https://imgur.com/JjXyylE)\n\nI know all too many people who go super hard in half’s and get super injured afterwards. In fact this the majority of people I know. I don’t think time is the only indicator of fitness.\n\nYay! I’m an old lady and I’m solidly to way above average in every distance! Woo hoo!!\n\nThis is just weird to me.  A 39 min 5k is not even remotely close to translating to a 2:14 half or 4:32 full.\n\nA lot of people walk 5ks. Far less people walk a half or full.\n\nThere’s a lot more people running 5k than the longer distances. Most average fit people can sign up for a 5k on a whim and get through with walk/run. 10k and up is usually only done by people who run at least semi-regularly.\n\nAbsolutely. I wonder if it includes parkrun times, which you get quite a few walkers at.\n\nA lot of people walk at all sorts of 5k events. Most of the smaller ones around me are advertised as walk/run events\n\nNobody said it should.  Lots of grandma's strapping into their Brooks for a turkey trot .  Not so many doing HM or fulls, and almost everyone there has at least done *some* training.\n\nAw man are brooks Grandma shoes? They're just what I've always used :^(\n\nHa you’re good. They are great shoes for running if you like them. But they are also a primary choice for mall walkers. ;)\n\nIm guessing this includes a lot  of walkers  and the times are totally skewed. At 46, I’m the slowest runner in my training group ; 17:52 5K, 38:30 10K,\n\nThose are not slow times."

    "body": "TW: suicide \n\n42F, have been running for about 2.5 years. For context my HM PR was 1:37 and I was planning to run the Eugene marathon this year and hoping to squeak out a BQ (my goal was 3:30).\n\nIn late January I lost my husband to suicide. It was completely unexpected and no-one who loved him saw it coming. I was near the beginning of my training block for the Eugene marathon when it happened. Obviously this really derailed my training. \n\nI stopped running for two weeks after losing him, ran again for about 2 weeks, then got COVID and took another 2 weeks off. And I just can’t get myself back on track and it’s so frustrating. Prior to his death my easy run pace was usually 5:30-6:00/km, with the goal of keeping my HR under 140. And now it feels like I’ve lost 2 years of progress - my pace is often 6:30/km or slower to stay at or under 140. I’ve been trying to keep my mileage around 50 km/week, so I don’t think I’m pushing it too much. I think I was at around 60 km/week prior to losing my husband. \n\nWhat has happened to me?!? I’ve think my nutrition is still on point. Sleep is admittedly not great - I wake up in the middle of the night a lot and can’t fall asleep again. I am mostly functional - I’m back at work, I visit friends, I have our 4 year old daughter that I have to take care of and I have to be “normal” for her so that she can have some stability in her life. \n\nRunning was such an important part of my life before this tragedy, and it’s something I was so proud of. And to have lost my fitness too, on top of so many other things I’ve lost, is really hurting me. \n\nDo any of you know if losing fitness or having trouble maintaining your zone 2 HR is part of trauma or loss? My counsellor is not too versed in running physiology and I don’t think she’s too concerned about how my zone 2 pace has changed ;-) But this really is causing me stress and grief, so if anyone has any insight it would really help me to hear from you. \n\nAm I ever going to be fast (relatively speaking, of course, I am well aware of how unremarkable I am as a runner) again?\n\n",

    "all_comment_text": "This is not a running problem - this is a “how do I live life normally again” situation. \n\nStress has an enormous impact on our fitness. You will be back to - and even better than - where you were before. \n\nBe the best mom you can be. Take care of and love yourself. Keep at it with the running. Go slower when you need to, walk if needed, push hard if you want to. \n\nLife is incredibly hard and unfair sometimes and I want to wish you the best. Keep at it, and I hope you remember to be proud of yourself.\n\nAmazing comment. \n\nIt might be time to just de-stress on your runs and forget about the pace for a little while. Good luck with everything op.\n\nAgree. Whole new thing now. Find someone to talk to and give yourself a ton of leeway in all things as you try to adjust to this new life.\n\nCondolences.\n\nThis, but there's another piece here. \n\nOur body doesn't care if we're sapped by physical fatigue and mental fatigue. Sure we can feel the difference, but from a performance standpoint it's identical. I suspect OP is spending a lot of effort managing stress right now and that is fatiguing.\n\nRecently found this out. Going through a break up and my running performance has tanked. Even my resting heart rate has been elevated since. Stress is stress, and the body/mind need room to heal from it regardless of its source.\n\nCouldn’t agree more with this. As you heal, you’ll get back there. Try your best to be open to other activities that feel more attainable in your body right now. Listen to what your gut is saying, and it’s also ok to take a break for a little while. Let your body grieve too. But as said above, you’ve got this. You *will* get back to you eventually.\n\n&gt;Stress has an enormous impact on our fitness. You will be back to - and even better than - where you were before.\n\n100% this. You've gone through one of the worst experiences I can even imagine, and it happened not that long ago. I hope running can become the stress release it is to a lot of us again for you as opposed to a source of additional stress. Until then, try to remember to show yourself some grace. You've gone through something incredibly traumatic.\n\n+1\n\nYour tl;dr: \"A few months ago, I went through an immense emotional trauma and then contracted a physical illness that weaken the lungs and circulatory system specifically. Why am I not ywt back to my previous pace?\"\n\n\nNow reread this as though a close friend you care deeply about wrote it. What would you say to them?\n\n\nBe as kind to yourself as you would end to that friend, and maybe for now let running be a source of catharsis and healing, rather than a goal to shame yourself about when you don't meet it.\n\n\nThings will get better, and that includes your running, but it will take time.\n\nCatharsis is the operative word here. Hopefully running can be utilized to get some much needed ‘me time’. Nothing needs to be forced at this stage in life. The child probably needs most focus followed by the (equally important) self in terms of love and caring. \n\nAnd OP also correctly self identified it as trauma - mental followed by physical trauma to the body. OP needs time to let some of the new realities settle in - it will be tough(-er) but humans endure all the time and this too is possible. \n\n@OP do open up about this grief - it is part of the catharsis and you may already be aware of the stages of grief. Our brains are wired to go through them - seek help as your child needs your presence too.\n\nI'm so very sorry for your loss.  \n\nFor what it is worth, I had a giant dip in performance following Covid.  HUGE.  My VO2 max tanked.  I think it took me a year to get everything back up.  I have never experienced a dip like it.  \n\nThat said, I'm sure trauma can play a role too. Please give yourself a lot of grace.\n\nYou should do some research on post-covid exercise intolerance. There is research that suggests that Covid can damage the lungs and heart long-term making exercise very difficult and can also have effects at the cellular level that result in exercise actually damaging and weakening muscle and other cells instead of strengthening them. \n\nI agree with everyone that you should focus on the trauma and your mental health but your running issues may be more directly related to Covid.\n\nSorry a bit of a tangent, but could you provide some further info/ sources so I can find out more\n\n[Johns Hopkins (lung)](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-long-haulers-long-term-effects-of-covid19)\n\n\n[NiH (heart)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/severe-lung-infection-during-covid-19-can-cause-damage-heart)\n\n\n(I've not read the articles, just from a Google search)\n\nHere's some more\n\n[Yale study showing compromised extraction of oxygen into tissues](https://news.yale.edu/2023/12/19/study-helps-explain-post-covid-exercise-intolerance)\n\n [review article discussing mitochondrial dysfunction due to covid](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01165-5)\n\nGrief is a physical experience. All emotions are. I lost my husband nearly 5 years ago. For the first few years my whole body hurt and I felt like I could barely breathe. My running paces tanked. I haven’t gotten back to the paces I was accomplishing pre/loss but I do now sometimes enjoy running again. Hugs to you.\n\nThis is so true.  I lost my mom suddenly in January and I have struggled with running since then.  I would have been asking the same questions you are, except that I had a similar experience and I lost my dad three years ago.  The grief left me feeling unable to breathe normally while running and just physically exhausted in a way that’s hard to describe.  With both losses there came a time when I just broke and started sobbing through part of every run - I’m still in that phase now.  Often, after that physical release I can breathe more regularly and I felt more like my old running self.  \n\nI can only imagine what you are going through.  Be patient with your grief.  It will become less overwhelming and it will come in waves that get farther apart.  You will have a fantastic run one day and on a tough grief-filled day it will feel like it takes every last ounce of effort to pick up your feet.  Keep running if you can because it is a release your body needs, but know that running may be a different experience and have a different purpose for a while.  \n\nSending you love.\n\nPlease be kind to yourself. You have been through a lot. I also believe that covid is playing a role here too (it took me three weeks to feel normal again and i lost fitness after a very mild case). Run if you want to, the fitness will come. But don’t put pressure on yourself! It’s amazing that you even want to run right now. I am inspired by you\n\nIf I were in your situation, I'd be more focused on the trauma first and then think about the running. The running will come back. That said, I don't think that being dogmatic about HR training zones helps. If you get a scare along your run, your HR might go up, but I don't think it really changes the training stimulus you receive too much. But, again, in your position, I would use running to help with trauma, and I would try to banish all thoughts of pace and performance from my mind.\n\nI went through my hardest season with trauma in the last couple years. And I, too, have completely struggled to regain fitness. For me, it’s all related to the trauma/stress. Nutrition, training, etc. just doesn’t impact it.\n\nIf I had broken a foot, I would expect the recovery to take a very long time. Lots of PT, lots of patience, and lots to grieve with the loss of a functional foot. And maybe, I will never get back to pre-broken foot results.\n\nI had an injury of the heart, mind, body, and soul. And that became the primary healing focus for the past 2-3 years. Using the running anology, it felt more like someone ripped off my leg. Now, I just finished a half today and I improved over my half from 6 months ago. Not by much, but my training was able to pick up as I was getting my inner healing to a more stabilized system. I’m recovering physically as I am healing internally.\n\nIt’s possible to recover, but please be kind and patient to yourself in the process. Close deaths like that, especially unexpected ones, are said to take 8 years to properly grieve (don’t have the source, sorry).\n\nWhat if it takes 8 years to get back to normative function? What would it look like to treat your heart as if you broke a foot? Or lost a leg?\n\nI feel for you, OP. Thanks for putting this out there!\n\nRunning is often an escape. A mechanism for self care and peace. An opportunity to challenge yourself. Grief turns all of that on its head. You can’t outrun grief. You have to sit with it, honor it, process it. Have you taken time for yourself to do this? Are you trying to escape the waves that will crash down on you? Be kind to yourself. Meet yourself where you’re at each day and focus on healing.\n\nSecond this. Also maybe think in therms of why do you identify with you pr. You are more than that.\n\nHi there. I am so sorry. I lost my brother to suicide in August. \n\nI went through 6 months of struggling through workouts, skipping days, feeling fatigued, thinking I was just lazy. Then I took a break for 2 full weeks in March and rested completely. It helped me finally return to my former fitness. I didn’t realize the impact that complicated grief has on the body. \n\nYou hear that exercise is good for grief and you try to power through it. But your body is telling you that it’s not in a state where it can perform. I really encourage you to take a rest and allow yourself to slow down. Your shoes will be there once you’re ready.\n\nOh, OP, I am so sorry. My husband just lost his uncle this way. \n\nThis isn't a fitness thing. This is a huge trauma and loss that is, and will affect you mentally. It'll envelop you, take over you and you just have to let it. You have a lot of crappy \"firsts\" that are just gonna be awful.  \n\nJust put one foot in front of the other, each day,  the best you can. Some days will be lighter than others. I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nRunning gave me a more than mediocre life. When I trained for half marathons and marathons, I felt like a badass woman capable of handling anything life throws at me (that day). It gave me an identity, of being more than a wife, a mother, a bread earner. So I understand when you're concerned whether you'll get that identity back after a huge trauma. The answer is yes you will. You'll be better than you are today a few years down the line if you keep training. We work on our basics first, to get our paces up. Right now, your heart demands that you slow down a bit (relatively speaking). To take care of your sleep and your stress and your grief and your daughter. Maybe let this marathon be a run you run, not a race.\n\nThis reminds me of something my therapist said to me after my wife and I experienced a miscarriage. I was struggling to “stay on track” with all of my other things while caring for my wife. Dishes, laundry, cooking, running…they all started to fall by the wayside as I just had no energy to do any of them. \n\nI was at an appointment discussing all this and he said “When I used to do yoga, I had an instructor who said *you can do today’s routine in Warrior Mode or you can do it in Healing Mode. It’s up to you to decide which you need.*”\n\nThe point is that you just experienced something very traumatic. It’s okay to take this time to *heal*. In fact, if you try to tackle your running in “Warrior Mode” when you really need to just heal, chances are you may be digging yourself deeper into the hole. \n\nForget about performing well on your runs. Forget about crushing the run. Forget about pace. If you’re running at all during this time, maybe run in “healing mode.” You need to fix yourself back up before you can go out and crush it. Give yourself grace and allow yourself that time to heal. You’ve been through  and are going through a lot of negative stress right now. Don’t let running be another negative stressor. Let it be a positive stressor if you do it at all. \n\nIf I were you, I’d just run for catharsis. For healing. For relief. Just let it be a time to experience yourself in your mind and in your body, to check in on yourself.\n\nI lost my husband to suicide in August 2022, so I understand to some extent. I could not run for a while afterwards, but it was primarily because I could not eat much (I found him and it was a horrific scene so I frequently felt ill). \n\nIf I were to guess, it would be your lack of sleep that has impacted you, but also trauma changes the entire nervous system in wild ways. We are no longer the same people as the “before” time, and it may take a bit to figure out your “new brain/self.” \n\nI am not sure how affordable therapy is where you are in the world, but I highly recommend attending to help process what just happened. I also recommend getting some sleep aiding medication. I take trazodone when I need and have since 2022. \n\nYou may need to rework your goals, which I know is heartbreaking. But it is necessary to give yourself grace and kindness. These things will almost certainly help your body heal and you will be back running in no time. I started running regularly again in December 2022 and I am now in the best shape of my life. \n\nRunning will be part of your life, it just might look a little different for a while. 💜\n\nHey OP, sorry for your loss. Lost my wife 2 years ago and noticed a significant drop in my performance as well. I was never as fast as you, but still fell off. Think it had a lot to do with consistency and energy levels. Just a lot more on my plate and no one to share responsibility with. Running while I try to make it a priority, becomes a secondary one pretty quickly. I need to run though for my mental health, but now I focus more on getting out rather than the pace. Take care of yourself.\n\nI’m so sorry for your loss. Please go easy on yourself during this time. Run what is comfortable to you and makes you feel marginally better as opposed to trying to do what you did before. Lack of sleep always has a HUGE impact on my running. I would also focus on that first.\n\nI’m so sorry for your loss. I’m sure a traumatic event like this will affect your mental and physical health.\n\nIf running helps you recover then pull your shoes on and go outside. I know that running is one of the best things for my mental health, and I often have to push myself to go out but it’s always worth it, even on days where I underperform. \n\nI also struggle after covid and colds. Takes me weeks to get my form back. It can be a long road to recovery but I always tell myself even on days where I’m only able to run for fifteen minutes that’s it’s still something and it’s still better than doing nothing. Take care.\n\nPlease be gentle with yourself. Running can help you get through your trauma by giving you a safe place to work through your emotions and thoughts. Most people underestimate how much the mental aspect plays into long distance performance. Focus on healing, on getting better, and running performance will come. I’m so sorry you’re going through this, but you’ve got this ❤️\n\nI'm so sorry for you loss. \n\n\nI think COVID is a huge factor here. When I got it the first two times, despite being very mild infection, it took 6-8 weeks for my heart rate to return to its normal pattern.  When running it was 10-20 BPM higher at any pace.  I could not run by my typical zone 2 heart rate. I could only run by perceived effort. Eventually it returned to normal.  I had COVID a third time recently and it didn't affect my heart rate the same way.  \n\n\nTake care of yourself.  \n\nStress and disrupted sleep can impact your training, even if you're eating well/ cross training/ maintaining your mileage. Please be kind to yourself- I cannot imagine the pain that you're in, but turning running into something that adds to your pain rather then helps with it is not what you need. Please give yourself grace, and know that this stranger is sending you hugs and wishes for easy miles to come.\n\nSorry for your loss.  Even outside of what you’ve endured, my experience is running in your 40’s is that you’ll go up and down.  You’ll have periods where you don’t run for a while, then get back to it, times where you’re healing from injury and times where you lose motivation for a while.  For me, running comes from a place of happiness inside and depression just eliminates my will to run.  My only advice is to not let the run you *can’t* do (going fast) prevent you from doing the run you *can* do (slower pace).\n\nOn a physical level, your cortisol levels are probably wayyyy up due to the stress, and sleep has a MAJOR impact on running ability. You probably haven’t lost any fitness at all, your body is just going through a lot right now as your mind and soul are. \n\nI personally went through a similar situation when my childhood friend and neighbor was lost in the same way. It actually caused me to quit running for about 6 months. I just didn’t feel good about anything and life felt very meaningless. Doing anything I was passionate about just felt wrong. But there was a day where things did feel a little better and the thought of her loss wasn’t the first thing on my mind each day. \n\nDo what you can with the running. Give yourself grace and time. Much love to you in this hard time ❤️\n\nYour life has changed dramatically, focus on getting better. PR records should be an afterthought. Maybe you’re depressed? Who knows but you should try to figure that out and I’m sure your running skills will return when you’re back to even.\n\nIt’s also the fact that that you had a traumatic experience which does affect your mental state and in a way it’s like shock. The state of the body is in overdrive and can’t function right even if you think it is. Best thing to do is focus on your metal state first and the rest will come in time!! You’ll be able to get back there to the start line!\n\nMy deepest condolences. I feel very strongly you will regain your previous fitness. ❤️\n\nSorry for your loss.\n\nYou shared that your sleep has suffered. It's possible that your heart rate is elevated in part due to stress and anxiety as well. So though some of what you're experiencing is due to detraining, some is likely due to other factors. If you're 30-60 seconds/km slower at the same RPE as prior to his death then perhaps it's entirely due to detraining; otherwise give consideration to ignoring heart rate near term.\n\nSorry for ur loss . Please do take things easy and focus on yourself this time 🙏\n\nI’m so sorry for your loss. \nI am a newbie runner and just getting the hang of the metrics of it all. I am a mental health professional though, and by going off of your story i can probably say that what you’re experiencing is acute stress and grief. Our body stores our emotions (energy in motion; e- motion) and your body is simply responding to this traumatic loss the way it is wired to. You will get back to where you were, but in due time. It sounds like running gives you purpose, and it still can! Please give yourself grace, kindness, love, and rest. 🌞\n\nI’m so sorry for your loss. I don’t feel qualified to give much advice in this scenario other than to be patient and kind to yourself. You are grieving, while taking care of your child too and trying to keep things together. Plus having Covid so recently too!! It took me months to feel like I was running normally again after I had Covid, and I think I had a quite mild case. Please give yourself some grace. Sending love to you OP.\n\nI'm so sorry you are going through this. It sucks on so many levels.\n\nCould a run club or finding a running buddy help? Something to make running not just about getting back \"to before\".\n\nAlso I'd suggest talking to your doctor. I haven't been in your situation but I got bronchitis in Feb 2020 and then with COVID, job loss and so much else I just couldn't get back to my \"before\". I worked with my doctor a ton! She ran a bunch of tests and tried a lot of things. The big stuff that helped was increasing my vitamin D and B12 and switching my birth control prescription to a lower estrogen dose. Her theory is that my body went into a fight or flight sort of mode and we had to figure out a way to transition it out of that mode. \n\nIt was good to have my running as a metric because I was able to point to \"I'm not normal even though the tests say I should be.\"\n\nSo sorry for your loss. \n\nBe easy on yourself. \n\nEasy does it. \n\nThe performance will come back when your body is ready.\n\nWhat has happened to you? You’re grieving. I went through a breakup at the end of January and I’m just now barely getting back into my routines and feeling moderately alright some of the time. I just today for the first time felt like picking up some light free weights and moving them around. I can’t fathom going through the loss of a partner vis death, with children involved. It’s barely been 3 months. You really need to be gentler and kinder with yourself.\n\nI’m so sorry for your unimaginable loss. \n\nI will say this is an age thing. \nIn my 20s and early 30s, I could skip running for short periods of time and pick up right where I left off. Same pace, distance. No training. \n\nOnce I got into my late 30s, early 40s- even the shortest of breaks makes me feel like I’m starting over. Taking a week off makes that first run back feel impossible. Breathing is harder, pace is slower. \nIt’s really frustrating! \n\nProbably carrying something you haven’t let go of yet. That would explain the slowing down.\n\nOP: first off you likely should be seeking therapy for this. \nSecondly: this definitely isn’t a problem you have physically this is definitely something mentally telling you that you can’t do it when you really can but your mind doesn’t want you to because you’re hurting and going through a stressful situation so your brain is trying to avoid other stressful things like exercise.\nIf you really want to get better possibly listen to David goggins, read his book etc. don’t seek to be like him but seek to have that mental toughness and awareness that it’s 95% in your mind and that physically your body is capable of so much more than you realize.\n\nThirdly: on the medical/physical front, you had Covid which is a respiratory illness. it can take a while to recover from that especially for running \nThe body for example takes roughly 1-3 months this to fix any skin related damage (ie cuts or scrapes) if they don’t scar.. that’s how long it takes for the skin to regenerate usually.\n\nWith sickness internally? Same concept, the body has to fight off the bad cells/organisms and kill them, then it has to also replace/repair any of your own cells that got caught in the crossfire AND it has to remove all the dead cells from you, and from the organism that it fought off. \nEven if the illness is dead, your body still might be working harder to remove the dead virus from your body. \n\nSo don’t worry too much, just remember to rest and take it slow and steady\n\nI am 25 M, running for just over a year. I have a HM coming up this Sunday. I was all fine one week before. But this last week I came to know in a difficult way that my parents are on the process of a divorce and it is turning out very messy day by day. The last week I was not able to run, my legs feel weak. I usually run 60km/week. My easy pace is 5:30-6 in Zone 2. But the last week I couldn’t run more than 25km. I became exhausted after 5km I couldn’t run more. The moment the news broke down my legs were shaking, my stomach hurt and hips felt weird. I am eating as usual and sleeping 8hrs. But I could feel my peace of mind is lost.\n\nThe insane amount of trauma you're dealing with aside-- you also got Covid recently. That alone probably damaged your times and HR level. After I got Covid, my HR is so much higher and I can't even get close to the times i was hitting before. And i was fully vaccinated then too. \n\nPlease be patient with yourself and your body. None of this is your fault and you're doing the best you can.\n\nHonestly take a break if you have to mentally, I hope you recover from this and then when your ready you can go back to training without worrying about your fitness\n\nI lost my brother to suicide last year in April and I’m still recovering. It took until jan this year for me to start turning my life around. My fitness utterly tanked. I had zero motivation. Go easy on yourself, this is a shitty shitty time. I’m still grieving and recovering, as will you for some time. Fuck I hated this advice when I got it but it’s true. \n\nI’m so sorry for your loss.\n\nset a new data field on your watch with time only, no hr, no pace etc.\n\nfor 2-3 months run easy/recovery only by RPE\n\nlook at the world around, take your car and drive to run in new nice places, find a new \"meditating\" way of running, buy a stroller and run with your kid\n\nread about progrsssion, if you are runnning for 3 years almost wwith no proper planning of recovery weeks, easier months etc. at some point your body can give up wanting some more rest. maybe it just saw an opportunity\n\nyou don't lose 3 years fitness in a month, ofc you can lose 10-20% but you should be used to it bc any offseason is like that.\n\neven a mild hard to notice covid can set you off for a month or two in terms of your HR\n\n\"Do any of you know if losing fitness or having trouble maintaining your zone 2 HR is part of trauma or loss?\"\n\nfor any experienced athlete who races it is a yearly basis thing so no trauma at all. if you train a lot and train hard, you can be fast like twice a year for a week or so max and your training stress load is pretty huge meaning except 3 months where you do hard intervals, all other is z2 and during an offseason you just rest for a month bc you body needs to recover, heal etc. so if you watch a guy who got a silver medal at olympics and is angry etc. keep in mind for him to get another chance to get gold is 4 years of training where he builds form 4 times from scretch, loses it during the offseason and after 4 years can maybe get a gold. only people who train recreationaly can sustain a same weekly load all year long bc the load is much lower, but at the same time it is no healthy anyways and results in plateau.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss ;/\n\nps. from a training perspective your loss and covid both are like huge marathon races (losing a husband is more like 10x marathon at once and covid like 2x) run in a very close time frame, you can and should be wrecked and you should and can rest (reco, z2 runs max by feel) and not any more results for now or next months (inluding setting PRs etc.) if you like running it is better to recover and lose fitness a bit for a while but to keep your running with you then overtraining yourself which can result in a hate for running for like couple of years.\n\n\"Am I ever going to be fast (relatively speaking, of course, I am well aware of how unremarkable I am as a runner) again?\"\n\nonly if you heal/rest properly but ofc yes you can be fast or even faster but being fast is not the mos important thing in the world ;)\n\nwell first I want to say sorry for your loss it must be very hard and my condolences goes to you and your family.\n\nAlso 1:37 half marathon for a 40 something female without a competitive background in running is remarkable and you should be proud of.\n\nI'm no psycologist  but dealt with depression and luckly had a terapist that was involved in sport herself, anyway I think you're experiencing anxhiety, I think you have two solutions: \n\nditching zone 2 training for intensity and do the \"I'm short on time\" training shedule and is three sessions a week with one 15km run, one warmup + 40' tempo run the closest to threshold the better, one HIIT. HIIT should variate every week in intensity. This is more focused on 5k and 10k but whenever you want to do a half marathon you can add the zone 2 volume and you're probably going to be surprised how fast you can be.\n\nstop using the heart rate monitor or even time yourself, zone 2 is where you feel zone 2 is, HR as you are experiencing can change for external conditions, and if you get discouraged by your lack of pace there is no need to see your pace, just do the kilometers, it's still going to be effective zone 2 trainng even if it's not on strava.\n\nthe mind and body are one that’s why. I’ve dealt with the same thing/am dealing with the same thing as you OP, basically stuck in a grieving process that’s now went on for over 2 years and had a really significant impact on my running. Let yourself grieve a bit, I’ve had three very close friends/family pass away in the past 2 years and haven’t fully allowed myself to go through the emotional process but from the first time I heard my friend/mentor passed away in August of 22, I haven’t had the mental energy to go hammer out runs like I did before, then a close family friend passed away immediately before I deployed for a few months, and then when I got home from deployment a good friend of mine died in a horrific way and my mental energy has been completely zapped lately. I recently spoke to a customer who didn’t recognize who I was after not seeing him at my P/T job in 2 years  because I gained nearly 60ibs in that timeframe and I had explained all of the above to him and he was the one that I explained to me that when your mind is healed then you’ll start to heal your body and return to what you enjoyed. \n\nAllow yourself to grieve and then worry about running OP.\n\nI recently experienced my running ability to completely tank. Seemingly out of nowhere, i wasn’t able to hit anywhere near my usual zone paces and I would feel awful doing it. I had several blood tests, heart checked a couple of times over, and all of it came back negative. Turns out it was anxiety and stress. I had it buried so deep I didn’t even know. Whilst what you have experienced is 1000x worse than what I was going through, you need to focus on your mental health and you need time. Forget the training, its putting additional pressure on yourself. Run when you feel good and don’t even look at your numbers. The training can come back when you’ve had time to grieve.\n\nYou didn’t lose too much progress.  Just go run.  Run daily.  Don’t stress on pace.  Your pace will improve with daily training.  You are overthinking.  And running helps trauma recovery.  I’ve run through every trauma I’ve experienced.  It helps.  I don’t really are about my pace anymore.  Been running almost 20 years. I’d say the first 10-15 years I cared a lot about pace but no more it’s just a fun feel good thing now.\n\nI’m sorry for your loss. I’ve experienced 2 big losses over the past 5 years. \n\nThe sleep will come back. It takes time, don’t beat yourself up over it. The fact that you’re mostly functional after a bad night of sleep is a plus. For me there was a lot of stress involved for each loss and it took time for me to get right, or as right as I can be now. \n\nI’m a novice runner, so I can’t speak too much on performance, but what has helped me get better as a runner is finding a running club. I tend to get a bit too comfortable when running and don’t realize I’m not pushing myself. Since I found my club a few months ago, I’ve made a lot of improvements, but I forgot how nice it is to run with other people and in the process make friends.\n\nJust breathe, it sounds like you’re doing your best for you and your daughter. Be proud of the small wins and I’m sure your running goals will start coming back too.\n\nIt’s incredibly brave to be so vulnerable to share this.  Thank you for your willingness to do so. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss. I can’t imagine how difficult a path this must be to navigate.  Everything about your life has shifted. \n\nPlease remember you are no less than you were when you were posting your times.  It’s easy to be proud of production.  Be proud of yourself. \n\nOne step and one day at a time.  Take care of yourself and treat yourself with love and kindness.  Allow that self-compassion to guide your parenting.  \n\nRun the miles you can the best you can.  Also, please remember you are not alone.  Behind this comment is a 42f runner who is cheering for you.  \n\nYou’re showing up.  Keep showing up. All love.\n\nNotwithstanding the immense impact of stress on your body, COVID can be a wildcard.  When I got it, I wouldn't have placed it in the top 20 illnesses I've ever had (it was more mild than any cold I've ever had), and yet despite this my running performance was heavily affected for about a month\n\nI’m so sorry you went through this.  The effects of emotional and physical (illness)trauma to the body are real.  You have to run at where you are presently.  Pushing any more than that, will cause more stress to your body and will risk injury.  \n\nThe body has a way of telling us that we need to pull back, either we agree to do so or it will force us to. \n\nRunning is organic.\n\nI (and I'm just a guy on the internet so ignore away) would temporarily change running lanes.  Some here are saying to run slow and accept the slower time. Be easy on yourself, etc.  I am guessing from this post that that isn't who you are as a person.  It can be really hard to set \"easy goals\" compared to what you know you could have done previously, regardless of the reason.\n\nYou live in a beautiful area (maybe, I'm assuming Eugene is local ish).  Try trail running and ultras.   EVERYONE slows it down.  See what your body thinks of a 50 miler at the pace you have now.  Think, \"okay, I can't do that crazy fast BQ pace for 26 miles, but can I do this new pace for 50?\"  Or maybe 50k?  Maybe you get crazy and sign up for a 100 miler and all those long days running are where you get the time by yourself to heal.  You're \"normal\" for your daughter at home but those long 5 hour training runs you get to be angry and sad and happy and all the human emotions.  Maybe that's too much time on the trail. \n\nI have zero background on therapy.  I don't want to gloss over the other trauma related parts, I just don't have anything intelligent to add.  But for me, a completely new goal in a new type of race that has me facing new challenges (trail running, more elevation gain probably, longer distances, etc) sounds so much better than simply \"lets see if I can do a less worse version of a marathon than expected.\"  Then as you continue to work through your grief and your counselling and continue to heal you make your way back to the marathon and you crush it.\n\nStart by walking your route. Then jog it. Once comfortable with jogging, start running again. You are an entirely new person.\n\nI am sorry for your loss. That you're able to run at all is testament to your resilience. Many people have trouble getting out of bed when something like this happens.\n\nIt’s grief. Grief impacts your whole life, even if you were sleeping normally. If you are still enjoying running, for running’s sake. Getting out the door. Moving your body. Keep doing it. Your fitness will come back as your new life evolves. \n\nEveryone is different and grief is not linear. But the first 3 months were the hardest for me in two major grief situations. Around 6 months I realized I was becoming more functional in a “new normal” manner. My running paces didn’t recover as quickly. But I also was not training for a BQ.\n\nI'm sorry about what happened, but you will get your running pace back, it'll just take time. \n\nI’m sorry for your loss.\n\nJust take a moment at a time. The shock is probably still there, and it will take some time to even try to process all the feelings you are having now. \n\nSomeone told me the advice of “say yes to everything,” meaning don’t turn down any social invitation. Getting out of the house was a lifesaver for me, as it forced me not to sit on the couch crying all day. Go to dinner, get drinks, go for walks, go for drives, etc.\n\nCounseling and group meetings didn’t feel like they helped in the beginning, but they definitely were excuses to get out of the house, which in itself was a positive thing. \n\nJust make sure to get up and out of bed every day, take a shower, brush your teeth, and reach out to all of your friends and family. I had a call list when I needed someone to speak with, and called down the list until someone answered. \n\nIt will be a long and arduous journey, but you will become stronger by the day and will be able to handle the pain. I promise you that!\n\nI started running again after I lost my wife like this, and it was therapeutic. For now, just breathe!\n\nIt has taken me 3mths in the past (if not longer) to fully recover from Covid. It can be really frustrating. Stay strong and consistent. You will get there.\n\nIt is surprising how fast fitness can disappear after just a short time off.  However, it can be recovered.  I went through a very similar series of events when I lost my wife, and what I've found is that it can take several months of consistent work to regain what can be lost in just a few short weeks.  Keep it up.  It does get better.\n\nNo worries.  Your fitness will recover.\n\nFind a running group or club and get out with new faces.\n\nTraining wise, do a fair bit of z1 z2 long duration training, and 1 day a week do a tempo run.\n\nYou'll be back to speed, hopefully mentally too, before you know it.\n\nHugs. The human body is weird. At the age of 40 I developed a stutter for one year after my dad died, then it went away again. Be patient with yourself and kind to your body during this time... you'll be in a different spot a few weeks and months and years from now.\n\nCovid did such a number on my cardiovascular ability. So there’s that. But stress also has a huge effect on your body. Treat it like an injury and give yourself time to heal and then build back up. I don’t see why you couldn’t eventually be faster than ever.\n\nSo sorry this happening to you. \n\nI don’t have any advice, except be careful running after having COVID.   \n\nYou should google ‘running after COVID’. It may take longer than you think to be ready. \n\nIt looks like you can damage your lungs by running too hard too soon.\n\nI know exactly what you mean. I lost my Mum to Alzheimers two months ago and the few weeks after it I felt I could hardly run the length of myself. Just go easy on yourself. Slacken the pace and go shorter - keep it ticking over whilst you recover from the trauma. I'm just starting to feel a little better myself but it comes and goes. It's not a linear process. Some days are better than others but keeping exercise going is a big healer I've found for trauma. Along with a good circle of support from friends and family. I hope things work out for you with the running.\n\nI’m so sorry you had to go through this. :(\n\nLots of good advice here, so I’ll just toss some extra love your way.\n\nI ran about 4ks in 3-4 weeks recently with the birth of my first child(I am the Dad), it was a bit of a traumatic experience involving intensive care, all happy ending however.\n\nI got back on track about 8 weeks ago, and I am still not to the level I was prior to the break/birth.\n\nWhile I have upped my load from where it was, my HR is higher and pace is slower than before.  \n\n\nI had put it down to just having a few weeks off, but maybe there was a bit more to it\n\nIncredible honesty. Thank you for sharing. I’m feeling a lot of the same rut, but I can’t imagine what you are going through with your tragedy, and won’t try. \n\nWhat I do get is the loss of joy in running, and the challenges finding that motivation despite psychological challenges. Before injury, running was my therapy and I was running 40-50 miles a week. Then I hurt my back, ironically stretching after a long run. That kept me off the pavement for nearly 12 months. The physical inability, along with being a dad of a toddler and depressing Portland winters impacted me more than I could have expected and took me out of my rhythm. I started to drink too much, I developed some depression, and I can’t find a rhythm in life or running. It’s a spiral as my inability to find the outlet in running is exacerbating the bad behaviors. I have good and bad days, but no consistency. I’m trying to work through it and looking for motivation. \n\nI really hope you are able to find joy in running again. I hope you and your daughter find peace, somehow. Give yourself grace in performance, and enjoy each step forward. Life may not be the same, but allow yourself to find some solace in the things you love. Wishing you well\n\nI am so sorry for everything thst you're going through. \n\nYour body is holding onto the trauma the way your heart and mind are. \n\nYou've gotten so much good advice and great comments that I agree with. I recommend looking to either EFT or EMDR to help you process with your mind and body\n\nsome thoughts -\n\nhang in there. as you can see from these comments, you are not alone.  \n\nmany rivers to cross, and many years ahead. \n\ngive your daughter a hug (and maybe a pet).\n\nask yourself if you need another counselor.\n\nwrite. \n\nit may be that running, thinking about running, stressing about running is itself a healthy adaptation - better this than to deal with the awful hole in your life.\n\ngive yourself permission to be angry.\n\nthank your friends and ask for their patience.\n\nI am so sorry for the unfairness of this.\n\nI lost my husband 7 months ago and my performance and tolerance has absolutely tanked. I’m devastated by it. Sending you love xx\n\nI’m so sorry for your loss. Idk if you have a specific faith but I always believe that someday I’ll see my loved ones again. As for the running portion, some of the comments already brought it up but don’t worry about pace. Focus on you and your quality of life and everything else will follow. \n\nWhen I lost my older brother to sickness and a few friends I served with to suicide, time was a big factor that helped with recovery. Along with a good support system and fitness, I eventually got back to my feet. \n\nUse your support system as well as your daughter as motivators. \n\nHope this helps\n\nSorry for your loss, i think it’s mostly covid related.\n\nBe easy on yourself. You need a running coach and a mental health professional and or a spiritual coach as well. But most importantly you need to be your own best friend. Running a fast marathon now doesn’t need to be your top priority as much as healing.\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]"

    "title": "How I started a Running Habit (as someone who hated running)",
    "body": "I always admired the simplicity of running as a sport. \n\nYou just need good shoes, some shorts and a shirt and your good to go. But I was never able to establish a running habit in my life. I loved going out for a long bike ride, but running always felt terrible.\n\nSomehow, all of this changed last year in April. \n\nI finished my first half marathon last month. \n\nHere are 3 things I learned that might help you to start a running habit too - even if you currently hate running.\n\n**Start with very short runs**\n\nIn the past I always started running with runs that were too long. \n\nI thought a proper run must be at least 5 km. Everything shorter would be a total waste of time. \n\nLast year, I started my running again with very short runs. The first three weeks or so I didn’t run more than 2 kms per run, but 5 days a week.\n\nAlthough I was completely out of shape, I didn’t feel completely destroyed after these short runs but I was proud that I went out for a run this day. \n\nAnd this built momentum for me to keep going. I went for a run to feel proud of myself and since it didn’t hurt, It wasn’t hard to bring up the willpower to do so.\n\n**Start slow. Really slow** \n\nThis is another classical mistake I made and I’m sure many others make:\n\nI ran too fast. \n\nRunning too fast lets your heart rate rise and your metabolism changes from aerobic to anaerobic. And when the lactate in your muscles accumulates, it starts to hurt. \n\nStaying in lower heart rate zones like your „Zone 2“ (60 - 70 % of your maximum heart rate) does feel much better, it’s also a very effective way to build your base endurance. \n\nAnother benefit is that you don’t feel so exhausted after your run which makes it easier to go out the next day. \n\nAnd the risk for injury is lower too. And trust me: Getting injured while starting to run regularly is easier than you think.\n\nSo go out regularly, but run veeeery slowly. I mean very slow. In the beginning I often altered between running and walking. I still do it. \n\n**Optimize for enjoyment, not performance** \n\nThis point somewhat summarizes the other two.\n\nWhen starting any new habit - like running - it’s important to focus on making it enjoyable. Improving your performance can come later.  All of these advanced tactics to improve your performance don’t matter if you don’t train regularly. \n\nIt doesn’t matter how your running workouts look like, as long as you do and enjoy them. Otherwise you won’t stick to it long enough for your running habit to form. \n\nFor me that meant short and slow runs that didn’t hurt. They were actually fun and I felt great afterwards. Not only was I proud of maintaining my momentum, but I also felt absolutely great after these slow and short runs. And I treated myself to a little snack or a cold alcohol-free beer afterwards. \n\nAll of this associated running with a positive feeling for me. \n\nAnd the next day I wanted to feel that good again, so I went out again. Eventually I saw improvements in my fitness and this motivated me even more. \n\nSo make sure that you do everything to make your runs enjoyable.  \n\n*In the end, that’s what it’s all about anyway.* \n\n\n\n",

    "all_comment_text": "I can second all of that. \n\ni was in the same situation. last april my fitbit died and i opted for a garmin, discovered thed had interesting metrics and training plans for 5k and just decided to start.\n\nthere are a couple of things, i did wrong in the past:\n\n*dont run with experienced runners/very fit people*\n\ni had a very fit friend that invited me to go running with her and i was game. unfortunately our paces didnt match bc she was so much more used to run and also more fit, therefore faster. after every run i was exhausted and during the run i constantly over exerted myself trying to keep up with her. it was no fun and i quickly developed shin splints. \n\n*find the right time for your runs*\n\nlast time i tried running, i went after work. i hated it (i still hate running in the evening) and wasnt really motivated to go run. when i started last year, the most practical time for me to go run was in the morning before work. and i realized that i fucking love it! yes, i get up very early, but its the best. \n\n*set easy goals and stick to the plan*\n\nmy first goal was to run 5k in 35mins. i stuck to the plan religiously. after 12 weeks i ran 5k im 32mins and i was happy. i didnt set the goal too hard bc i knew that i needed an easy win to keep going. after 5k i started 10k, and the half-marathon. always with very easy target times. it keeps me motivated. now that i ran the half, i try to lower my target times. not by much bc easy goal. \n\n*invest in good shoes*\n\ni totally underestimated running shoes. last year for the first time i bought actual running shoes and it has changed my life...well, maybe just my running. my body hurts less and running feels good.\n\nGreat tips!! What shoes if you don’t mind my asking?\n\nI run with brooks adrenaline gts 23 and ghost 15. \nits already my 3rd pair of the adrenaline model. \n\nbut i think, its important you get your shoes fitted in a running store. i was overwhelmed from the choice, so i went to the story, they analysed my foot and my running style and recommende shoes. it was worth it.\n\nI love my brooks adrenaline\n\nTossing my shoe rec- Saucony Women's Excursion TR15\n\nI love them so much, I bought a backup pair because I can't imagine running without them now. FTR- I have completely average feet. I can feel the road, but rocks don't hurt at all, AND I got them for $50 a pair!\n\nI tried to explain the first point to my friend. He thinks that I'm embarrassed to run with him. I'm not, I just don't want to burn out after like 10 minutes of running because I know he can run more and faster than me.\n\nI absolutely refuse to run with someone since I am still a beginner and I have a routine which I don't want to modify because of others.\n\nexactly! i went running twice with people that are usually at least a minute under my pace and even though, they assured me, that they are okey with going slower, their bodies dont know how. 😂 i know they ment well, but it stressed me out. \n\nin general i prefer to run alone, i just feel more comfortable and think less about how fast, how far etc i should go.\n\nencouraged me!\n\ngo for it! \n\nand another thing: dont compare yourself to others. \ni still do it and have to actively remind myself, that im on my own journey and thats okey.\n\nYes. Absolutely agree with this. We all have ours and each journey is unique!\n\nI always tell people who want to get into running not to worry about the distance they run. Because while running for distances is a flex for people who run, for people that don't run, it can be embarrassing and intimidating. Instead, focus on the time you are out there. For instance, when you start, tell yourself that you will be out there for 15 minutes running. It doesn't matter how far you go or how fast you go. Just do 7 1/2 minutes out and 7 1/2 minutes back. \n\nSlowly increase your time out there by 5 minute every 10 days or so and give yourself rest/recovery days. When you can get yourself up to an hour, then you are getting a really good workout and you can start to look at speed, distance, etc. \n\nI've been injured since running the Tokyo Marathon so this is how I'm building my base for Berlin. If I don't set simple goals for myself, it becomes too overwhelming and I just shut down and don't do anything...\n\nYep, I picked this up reading Daniels Running Formula. That paradigm shift has helped me a lot with getting into running this year.\n\n\nI'd always just run a few km quite hard and start getting pain in my feet. Now I've been running without injury since February, doing \"30 minute E runs with strides\" and recently introducing T runs and doing a 5k parkrun all out with no real fear of injury\n\nI disagree with this.\nIt’s all about the distance. Not the time.\nTell yourself today you need to do 5km. If you need to walk at times - do it - and the time you spend is not important - see it as a journey - an experience.\n\nThat's an interesting perspective but I definitely disagree with you here. I think that walking in the middle of a run just to make a distance sets the wrong midset. When you set your goal to \"run\" the entire length of time and not have to walk, your confidence in your body's ability grows. So it doesn't matter how fast or how far you go, just that you don't walk. \n\nOf course distances matter - but the OP was stating how to get into running. And my approach was always to break it into time chunks because it is much easier for most people to say \"I can do something hard for 10 minutes\" than it is to think of it in miles. Slowly adding time is psychologically easier for most adding distance. \n\nIn the end, it's about doing something hard that 90% of the population doesn't do. None of us are going to win world championships. But all of us can gain benefits of running no matter how fast or how long we go.\n\nIt builds confidence, but doesn't build mitochondria as much :)  \nWalk breaks, for beginner runners and even for average runners, is, dare I say, critical IMO. Since most of beginner and average runners, regularly get deep into zone 3 in their easy runs.\n\nTalking about short 30s breaks every now and then. Just enough to get back into zone 2.\n\nI disagree with that. \nMaybe I was not clear. \nWhen I say walk - I mean walk here and there for 10-30 seconds to access your body. Maybe every 5km or so. \nAnd to build up your running further - is just to increase the distance every time you run. \nYes running is good for you if you do it correctly.\nI see many people that think running does not require a teacher. That we all just know how to run. No guys - please learn how to run - to avoid injuries. I highly recommend barefoot running as it’s very low impact in the body.\n\nWe just have different world views on running. Thanks for sharing.\n\nIf you’re running 5km and then walking for 30 seconds before doing another 5km, not sure this beginner advice is intended for you!\n\nI am not here for running advice. I am here to debate the information given. Why are you here ?\n\nThese are all super good points. I use the phrase \"embarrassingly slow\".\n\nElaborating on the \"optimize for enjoyment not performance\", an uncomfortable amount of performance in running is based on genetics.\n\nI spent years religiously following different running programs, but I never saw the improvement they promised. I've recently found that I might have a genetic condition which probably makes me less efficient at running.\n\nSo, keep in mind that high performance at this sport is a survivorship bias thing. People who get fast have put in a lot of work, but also have good genetics for it. But from the inside, that's not visible so they will constantly tell you what happened to work for them.\n\nRunning can be fun for a lot of reasons and a lot of ways, but trying to optimize for performance can be demoralizing. Just run, and if your body can improve then it will.\n\nI'm running 11:30-13:00 minute miles currently. It's definitely embarrassing!\n\nBut like, revel in it. You are doing training right if you are going embarrassingly slow.\n\n11:30+ fellow club member here\n\nHear, hear! We're a slow but mighty bunch!! 🙌\n\nYay, it's not just me, lol! We're doing fine, doing fine.\n\nAll day. My mate goes on about how hard slow runs are, meanwhile I revel in them. Easily my most enjoyable time spent running is plodding along at a snail's pace.\n\nI'm on the high end of that pace, and I'm happy with it! Even running that \"embarassing\" speed has improved my fitness so much. I can push so much more with weight lifting and biking.\n\nEmbrace the embarrassing!\n\nIt’s not embarrassing. Slow is better. \nMy last marathon took me 8hours. I was the last to finish - but the one who will be remembered the most because he fought the longest.\n\nCongrats on doing a marathon, to me that sounds impossible! \n\nI truly don't think slow is embarrassing, I run at the pace I run, that works best for my body.  I push myself during my runs, but I'm not an Olympic athlete, nothing is riding on how fast I go.\n\nGood to hear. Yes I have done 4 marathons and 150 half marathons - in the last 3 years.\n\nThat is incredible!\n\nMy easy pace hovers around 12 min/mile and I’ve recently tried to reframe the challenge of running as keeping my heart rate low, rather than keeping a fast pace.\n\nFocusing on heat rate...I like it. I shall implement it. Probably be even slower, lol.\n\n+1 here. Did a 13:52 recently, slightly faster than fast walking. No injuries. Feel great. Blood work changed positively.\n\nAwesome, keep it up!\n\nI think I know what it is with me... I'm getting old. 50 years, to be exact. 10:00 min miles used to be a breeze. But, this is where I'm at, and I will try to embrace it.\n\nYou focus too much on time. \nReal runners don’t care how fast or slow you are. They care about if you like it or not.\nI don’t respect anyone who runs only for time - but don’t even enjoy it. Life is too short. \nYour pace is your pace - focus on your surroundings and where you want to go.\n\nI did that this morning. My first 5 miler of the year, kept my heart rate around 130. 15 min miles. And I did enjoy it.\n\nFaster than me! I'm in the ~15:00/mile range. I *can* go faster but it's uncomfortable to sustain a faster pace for more than a single mile.\n\nOne thing I did that increased my running enjoyment was I removed the pace from my watch face during runs. So now I never feel like \"oh am I going too fast or too slow?\" I just run. Hit a distance or time that feels good for that day and walk if I need to. It's awesome.\n\n[removed]\n\nI have made the same mistake as I used to play soccer a lot and developed the habit of running so started doing 5k’s for 5 days in a week and pushing myself. I did a half marathon though but ended up pushing my knee too much. There was no injury and I felt something is not right. \nDid x rays of knees, shins and all were good and docs were of no help as they couldn’t figure out what was wrong and gave me painkillers.\n\nAfter a year, I had to go to PT and they figured out the problem of me having some knee muscles really weak so after a lot of PT session, I started playing soccer again and recently did a 5k. \n\nTaking it slow is something I do now and will keep on doing.\n\nI‘ve run every day for 8 and a half years, at least one mile.  I still “dislike” the act.  But there hasn’t been a run that I didn’t feel better after than I did before I went out.  For me, an important motivator for running has been having the streak — I do NOT want to break my streak.  I’ve run when it was -20°F out.  I’ve run in howling blizzards.  I’ve run in an underground airport tunnel.  None of my runs were ever on a treadmill.  I go slow (10 to 12 minute miles), never very far (7 miles is my longest during the streak) and I run first thing in the morning (hence something positive always has happened in my day).  And I have a dog that absolutely loves running and she insists we go.  I’ve avoided injury by going slow and short.  I’ve only been mildly sick and been able to knock off at least a mile when being so and for the most part I think my daily couple of miles has help me avoided illness.\n\nI absolutely hated running. So I stared with walking, then I felt stronger and incorporated slow jogs, then one day I hit my first mile without stopping. I was hooked at that point. That was the hardest milestone to reach, but once I could run an embarrassingly slow mile without stopping, everything became easier. It's really about patients and consistency.\n\nIt will never be harder than that first mile, because you can always slow down to get your heart rate in check. Once you can regulate you're heart rate, there's nothing stopping you!\n\nI run to consume my running shoes so I can buy a new pair asap. It's a great motivation. Soon I will have to look for a larger apartment because I have no more room for the shoes in the current one\n\nHaha! I know that feeling. They make them so shiny and beautiful!\n\nThe thing I would like to offer, that I'm working on myself, is *don't compare yourself to others*.  \n\nOther runners you see on the road, trail, at the gym, on this sub.  There are always going to be those natural, talented runners that look like they don't sweat or struggle.  That are running a 5 minute mile.   I was killing myself trying to be one of those people until last weekend and I had an \"enough\" moment.  Last weekend, I had the best three runs that I've had in so long!  My goal was to enjoy myself.  To set a comfortable, steady pace.  To be able to take deep easy breaths.   It was like falling in love all over again.  I am now looking forward to my runs this weekend instead of feeling dread and anxiety.   \n\nI love what you said, OP.  **Optimize for enjoyment, not performance**.  Solid advice.\n\nGreat points. Slow running is a game changer. I also think don’t underestimate how hard it is to crack that first 5km. It is a monumental achievement to be able to run 5km. \n\nAnother thing I do now that I’m a bit more experienced as a runner is make an event of my long run. I make it the centrepiece of my weekend, put on the New Yorker fiction podcast and follow it up with a nice brunch. I try not to care about my pace. That’s my time to just get into my body and relax. I love it.\n\nCelebratory pancakes post run is my go to.\n\nI have changed my focus from pace/distance to heart rate and time and my runs are so much more enjoyable. Every day our bodies’ ability to run is different based on sleep, food, muscle aches, or mood. When I say I’m going to run for x amount of time and keep my heart rate between a range, I always feel like a winner. Effort is not the same as pace and distance is what I’m trying to say ❤️\n\nGreat post and advice! That is exactly how I began running as someone who “hated/wasn’t good at” running too. To this day I couldn’t care less about how fast I am or doing races. I just like the feeling of running, and watching myself be able to go farther easier.\n\nWhen I started running seriously in 2019 the biggest advice I would've given my out of shape, asthmatic self would've been, if something hurts, stop and recover! I had shin splints for about two weeks, all I had to do was take a few days off, but I kept trying to push through the pain.\n\nYou are all talking about goals which are related to distance or speed.\n\n\nThere's also another angle: exploration!\n\n\nFor me what has kept motivating me is exploring the area where I live. \"I want to be able to get to the top of the mountain I see from my window\", \"I want to be able to run till the neighboring town and back\", \" I want to see where that path I saw the other day\". \n\n\nThis has gotten me from being stuck to gentle 5k runs, to being ready for a HM!\n\nI started running over a year ago, and I still hate it, lol. I totally get what you're saying. The only thing that keeps me going is my running playlist. I love curating and discovering great feel good vibey songs.\n\nDo you want to share songs on your playlist?\n\nSure, I'll DM u the link\n\nThis is sound advice. Great work on your half OP!\n\nGreat advice for anyone! Thanks for sharing friend\n\nI signed myself up for a half marathon. I hated running so much, but that 90$ registration fee was my sole motivator and damn it if I was going to let that money go to waste. Running four times a week for 12 weeks kind of gave me a resigned determination that eventually turned into enjoyment after I saw myself improve and completed the half marathon. So that’s my advice. Sign yourself up for something expensive that you can’t get out of lmao\n\nThe easiest is to set goal to reach runner high once  in your life time to see the effect for your self !!\n\nYou will be in love with running for life !! Guaranteed … every time you run its kind of back on to your head somehow you want to experience it again so you keep going !! \n\n\n\n\nLove ❤️ I felt inside of me …. Feeling of Being loved … and warmth and emotional feeling 🥰 and I felt like an opening of the heart. Its a relief \n\nBut I listened to Love me like you do and it triggered the effect for me for first time !! \n\n\nNothing in my life gave me that effect to extent and the level I reached in Runner’ high 🏃 in the beginning of the RH’ effect !!\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/584157924\n\nI felt so much in control and felt powerful and euphoric, happy, highly motivated, joy , positive \n\nThe effect from runner high from the beginning to the end is f sick !! \n\nEven if you don’t reach you will feel good but sleep well  💤 and food to healthy is a must with lots of fats pref and lower to mid carbs … and in early morning for best chances , and music will increase its chances and how regularly you run for the last 2 weeks and heart rate percentage during the run to be around 70-80% !!\n\nEven alcohol, mariuana, Caffeine is garbage stuff compared to the effect only you will be getting from Runner’ high 🏃 if you had the effect during the run !!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n======__________======\n\nSecond reason if you enjoy running 🏃 \n\nDopamine will reach 2.0x\nYour brain 🧠 will reinforce that behavior and the next day its kind you have this thought among you. And I believe more so if you listen to your favorite 🎵as well\n\n======_________======\n\n🧠 Remember how you felt yesterday when you run under the sun. It felt so good \n\n🧠 Doesn’t it ?! \n\nAnd You like omg, yes it did. It felt soo good and I was so happy 😀 I loved it 😍 \n\nYou: Thank you brain 🧠for those happy neurotransmitters feelings 😄 during and after exercise\n \n🧠 you’re welcome bro I got u 😉 \n\nBrain 🧠 ok u wanna do it again \n\nYes lets do it again 😀 👍  and you become super excited all of the sudden 😆 to go for a Run 🏃 \n\n\n======_________======\n\n\nI have this thought today when I wake up I swaer to god , … I truly believe brain gave me this thought and I wasn’t thinking about it in my own.\n\nbecause I exercise yesterday in the morning as well. When I wake up\n\nSo It reinforces that behavior and make it as repetitive healthy habit and can form habit easily  \n\nDrugs can also make your brain 🧠 do like this but it feels more like an obsession, craving and urges as well thinking about substance 10 min or longer. \n\nEven slight things like sugar gives you that obsession, craving and urging effect if you spike blood sugar and coffee if the cup was soo unbelievably good and you felt really its effect the highest and after caffiene leaves your system in 10 hour. You will feel craving and obsession with it. Its rare though like one out of 30 cups your had and it was the best and its been a while few days or so since you had the last cup \n\nNicotine makes it more appearing as well  \nAnd there are withdrawals with those substances.\n\n\nWhile Running 🏃 gives you this thought for few second most of the time and leave you on your own !! \n\n======_________======\n\nI encourage you to do it under the sun ☀️and early morning once you wake up. As serotonin will accumulate that way and you will see the effect right away in front of you. Dopamine will raise as well and vitamin D3 !!\n\nThis is great advice. Thank you!\n\nMan, I want to start running but every time I do so my ankles gradually hurt more and more until I physically can’t run anymore. I don’t know if it’s my running shoes or posture or what.\n\nHad exactly the same in the beginning. \n\nIt took around 2-4 weeks of regular but short running until the pain decreased and now they don’t hurt anymore. \n\nThe only tip I can give you is to shorten your runs and just keep at it.\n\nThank you, I really appreciate this post and it resonated.\n\nThanks for sharing! This is so relatable!! \nKeep it going 👍\n\nThis has got to be one of the best references I’ve seen it tapped into my soul\n\nCould have been me writing this. Been cycling for a long time but always hated to run.  Specially the point about running SLOW the majority of my runs made me enjoy everything so much more. Finished my first HM 2 months ago and now going for the full one in september 😎🏃🏃\n\nI love this thread, thank you so much! Last year I started running and immediately tried for 5k. I was exhausted and I ran really REALLY slow which is fine but I lost all courage and had to start all over again. This time I did the \"start to run\" scheme and felt so good about it. It starts with just 2k with a lot of walking pauses and builds from that. At some point I did 3 runs of 3k a week and you know what, that's 9k at the end of the week! I did my first \"competition\" on Monday and ran 6k. I finished with the slowest 20% but I never walked and ran the entire thing at a consistent pace and I'M SO PROUD OF MYSELF FOR THAT. Ahh! :-)\n\nMy next goal is to run during some of my favorite music albums so I can do \"themed\" runs. Like do a Tortured Poets Department run (1h) and work my way up to a TTPD: The Anthology run (2h). Whatever music album you love, choose that as a goal. \"Optimize for enjoyment\" right :)\n\nIn for later\n\nWhat time / period of the day you run?\n\nI try to do runs/workouts first thing in the morning. Before my brain wakes up and talks me out of it.\n\nI see - same for me. I was expecting you to say that you have a religious routine of waking up pretty early and going on runs first thing always. But in the end, what works for you routine, the better... Even if ocasionally changes depending on the season - or even on your mood!\n\nNo, my sleep and health are erratic enough.\n\nBest exercise is the exercise you do. Best time is the time that you do it.\n\nNot OP, but my physio told me to run when I feel that I have the most energy. \n\nFor me that is about 1-2 hours before the sun completely sets in the spring and summer. In the winter, it gets pretty dark fairly early where I live, so I opt for whenever I have the time.\n\nI see... I agreed with this vision of yours. But I think that setting up a running routine would lower the risks of me not being able to run due to my own lazyness. That's why I'm interested in OPs routine, as a way of me knowing how to manage my own time!\n\nIn the summer I love running in the early morning at around 6 am before work. In the winter usually in the evening at 7pm or so.\n\nRead [The Running Revolution](https://www.amazon.nl/Running-Revolution-Faster-Farther-Injury-Free/dp/014312319X/ref=asc_df_014312319X/?tag=nlshogostdsp-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=481590905924&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=14070929735728150170&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9064890&amp;hvtargid=pla-454601791565&amp;psc=1&amp;mcid=e3d03b10b0e138a1ac5386e657492013)\n\nLove this! You’ve inspired me to get back to running. I tend to burn out too fast.\n\nGreat post.\n\nI think it is important to set the right goals before you start running if you dont naturally love it. In my case, my primary objective is to workout injury free to improve heart health. Injury free being the key word as that will impact consistency. My stamina and overall health improved (says my blood work). I ran a half marathon this month which was the first ever race i took part in my life. Saying this has changed my life would be an understatement.\n\nSince I’ve given myself ‘permission’ to walk whenever I want/need to I’m having more fun, more consistently. Thanks for your great post!\n\nThese are great tips! I had a similar process + I used the Nike run app at the beginning. Coach Bennett is my hero ❤️\n\nCongratulations OP on completing your half marathon and really loved your wisdom on Running and you know what , these kind of posts make reddit worthwhile\n\n\nRunning two times in a day is recommended? \nSuggest best shoes for running\n\nYou don’t actually need shoes to run.\nThe shoe makers will convince you that you need shoes - but that’s just because you run as they tell you. Once you learn to run properly - you don’t need shoes.\n\nEventually you will need to increase miles run if you’re planning on a race like a half marathon. I would recommend at least getting 2-3 10 mile runs in before your first half marathon. If you can run further, then great. \n\nAlso, learn how to keep your glycogen stores replenished. Try different gels, chews and electrolytes. Don’t experiment during a race. Make sure you work through any gi distress issues. Find what works for you. This takes time and trial and error. \n\nStretch! Daily, even on rest days. Learn dynamic and static stretches, focus on hip mobility, knees, and ankles.  Listen to your body, allow time to recover. Try to finish every run with a smile and feeling good.\nHave fun out there!"

It’s become such a big part of my life over the years, but depression is a thorn in my side that’s curtailed many would-be runs.\n\nHow do you get your head in the game for a run when you’re depressed and just so mentally exhausted from it?\n\nWould love any advice and any stories you wonderful people have.\n\nTIA friends ",

    "all_comment_text": "I just do three easy miles, knowing that half an hour or less of effort will make me feel better about the rest of my day (endorphins, sense of accomplishment).  I trust from decades of experience that even if I don't want to run or (insert cardio here), I'll always feel better if I do. I  try to only skip exercise if I'm physically worn out.\n\nI'm 36, and it's taken me until now to accept exercise as a holistic endeavor instead of a performance-oriented one.\n\nPlus there's studies about how cardiovascular exercise alleviates depression and anxiety.  I actually wrote a meta analysis on the topic waaay back in undergrad.\n\nRight there with you. I turn 40 this year and I've found more and more just the act of DOING THE THING helps with so much. If I knock out even 2 miles I know I can get through the rest of the day, no matter what the dark and stormies of my mind say.\n\n41 over here! And I couldn't agree with you more!\n\nThis is it!! Running will NEVER leave you in a worse mental state than you began in. You will always feel better.\n\nI was feeling a bit meh today and feeling down about some injuries. Found some new trails to run on and it was absolutely incredible. Being out trail running alone in the woods on a beautiful morning... perfection.\n\nAbsolutely. To piggyback on this just get yourself out the door. If you don’t feel like your regular distance, halve it. If halving it is too much quarter it. Do a walk-trot. Or just do a walk. Just find a way to get out the door, to hell with the mileage.  Get that heart up or break a sweat any way you can.  Try and remember the joy that hitting the pavement can bring.\n\nI found the Headspace collaboration with Nike Running really useful when I wasn't feeling the motivation to go running.  \n\nTheir approach is very much like this - praise yourself for getting out the door, and counter-intuitively don't push yourself, do the opposite and ease off ..  after a bit you find yourself starting to enjoy it.\n\nI use these, too! I find the Head Start guided rings so helpful when I'm feeling down and tired and like everything is getting to be too much, and I keep it on the shorter side. I also try to run somewhere with people (I live in a cute downtown area) that I don't have to drive to.\n\ni don’t have depression, but i do have adhd, so i can relate heavily with the struggle of just getting started. i’ve found out that getting started is literally the hardest fucking part. not the running itself, even when i feel like i’m fucking dying because my stamina is shit. \n\nweirdly enough i’ve found out that someone calling me or talking to me helps me start things, it’s really strange. i have an issue with bed rotting &amp; doom scrolling for hours in the morning on weekends. i’ll be awake by 8/9, but not get up till 12/1 because i’m on my phone. today, my friend facetimed me just to ask me a question and it somehow made me get out of bed. nothing in our conversation made me get up, i just did. this happens a lot during college when my mom calls me just to check in and it gets me out of whatever paralysis i was in. \n\nwhen i know i need to do something, i let someone know and ask them to either remind me or pester me about it until i do it. i’ve texted my friends “tell me to do xyz or else i’ll be extremely disappointed/upset/annoyed with myself and it’ll make me feel better.” something along those lines. a lot of my friends struggle similarly so we all help each other out with it. it works in the same way as body doubling to me and helps so much\n\nFor me it’s ten minutes. If I’m not feeling it, I run for ten minutes. Then if I’m still not feeling it I have to run home. So I’m guaranteed 29 minutes. Usually the cloud lifts in the first 10 minutes and I complete my run, but if it doesn’t at least I got 20 minutes in\n\nRunning has saved my depression. This 100%\n\nSpot on. I on the other hand love to run but that love is magnified by how I feel when I’m done. Running helped me through tough times in my life. I suffer from OCD, depression and benefited from running while caring for my father who had Parkinson’s. Too many benefits IMO.\n\nI love this so much.\n\nI whole heartedly agree! I’m 44 and just a year ago found out I was in early menopause. Talk about no energy and emotionally unstable! I don’t have depression but i definitely feel like my hormones are out of balance when it’s and that can definitely feel like depression. I count on the fact that if I run first thing in the morning (after coffee of course) then the rest of my day is great! I accomplished something most people don’t accomplish in a week! Another reason I make my bed every morning. It makes me feel like I have my life together.\n\nI agree but I’m not sure how much “just run” helps someone asking how to combat the drag depression has on their running.\n\nOne truth I’ve found is that no matter how long it’s been since you last ran, you’re just one or two runs from feeling like an honest to god runner again. Even if you’re too slow or too fast.\n\nTotally, you're right. \"Just run\" isn't very helpful at all.  My message was more that anything is better than nothing, and even a small amount of running can go a long way in making us feel better mood-wise.  It's about trusting in the result, even when we don't feel like starting.\n\n35 here and agree with everything you said. I know 3 miles doesn’t take that much, so if I can just do 3 miles, even slow, it’ll be over before I know it and I feel much better after.\n\nThis is me. Got even better for me when I added a daily dose of yoga  I look forward to it everyday\n\nYep! I have never once regretted going for a run or doing some form of exercise and when I think about it there really isn’t that many activities in life I could say that about\n\nThe way I tackle going out when I'm struggling to find motivation is I give myself permission to completely bail on a run at any point, but I have to put my shoes on and go out the door and start. \n\n99% of the time I get at least a few miles in and if I don't hit my goal there was probably a good reason not to.\n\nI also find that this helps me maintain the habit of just doing something which can be protective against low motivation. \n\nI'm also very aware that running is the single most productive thing I do for my mental health which helps a lot.\n\nEdit: I'll just elaborate that by at least starting your run means that you're reframing the decision from \"I'm depressed and unmotivated so an entire run feels overwhelming\" to \"I'm already out, do I really want to stop now or keep going a bit longer?\" I think it helps take a lot of the weight out of the decision. And sometimes you make it one block and feel like shit and you head home and that's still a win in my mind because you made an informed decision based on how you felt on your run.\n\nI think I said the exact some thing in different words.\n\n\nSometimes it's not the idea, it's finding the right framing of that idea that clicks. \n\n\nGlad there's more than one \"how to\" here because that's just it. It all boils down to \"just do it\" but you can't \"just do it\" or this wouldn't be a question. The real question is HOW you 'just do it'.\n\nI was gonna say the same thing! I tell myself that I only have to go 1 mile and if I'm not feeling it still, then I can bail.\n\nThat’s my method. “Just 1 mile”, even if I walk the whole thing. Doesn’t take up too much time and it’s easier to get yourself out there when the expectations are low. 99.9% of the time I end up doing more than 1 mile and I ALWAYS end up running instead of just walking. But even if you get out and end up just walking 1 mile, your mind and body still benefit from it and you feel at least a little bit better about yourself compared to doing nothing at all.\n\nThis is great.\n\nYES!!!!!!!\n\nThis is what I do too. I basically run in a plus sign from my house, so I'm never more than a quarter mile away from home, and I still usually never bail once I'm out there. I get myself out the door by reminding myself that I always feel better once I run, and often feel worse if I don't.\n\nRunning helps me cope with depression so it’s easier to do regularly than any other task\n\nI also use running to cope with depression. When I’m feeling too depressed to run, I run -knowing it will likely pull me out of my funk.\n\nHooray for endorphins\n\nSAME HERE!! Literally I tell myself it will be worth it, and I just did 8 miles today, and feel AMAZING ! :)\n\nYep. It’s one of the only areas of life that I truly excel in while everything else gives me anxiety. It’s a very simple activity with immediate tangible benefits. It would be much harder for me to not do it(as I learned when I was injured and going insane not being able to run).\n\nRunning is the primary way I deal with depression. It’s my therapy. I’ve tried regular therapy, running helps me more.\n\nRight? I know I'll fee much worse if I don't so it's a \"gotta do.\"\n\nMy mental health has like a direct correlation to how often I’m running. Besides the stuff of making it easier (laying clothes out, not setting expectations, etc) the biggest thing for me is having a moment after a run to literally say “I feel better after getting out of the house and exercising.” It helps as a reminder for future me who needs the motivation or reasoning to get out of bed\n\nI started running because I was depressed. In moments when I felt like I wanted to not do anything, I pushed myself and created a habit which led to discipline. It may not be many miles or minutes but every minute counted. \n\nAnother thing is when I get overwhelmed, I would just go on an endless run to clear my head. Hope this helps!\n\nI also became a habitual runner because of depression. For me, it was the only time my thoughts didn't spiral, and I had clarity and peace. I found that the most addicting. I always tell people I run for my mental health, and the other health things are just an added benefit.\n\nMy experience exactly\n\nI try to build a habit. If I exercise every day at a similar time, things change from having to psyche myself up for a run to my brain just realizing \"oh, it's time to run now\". And I get some really good streaks going.\n\nThe difficulty is that breaking the routine, say by a change in work schedule or small injury, really sets you back in motivation.\n\nYou can also start with something really easy like a 10 minute stretching routine. If you're not feeling motivated you can say, \"I'll just do my stretches today instead of doing the whole exercise routine\". It keeps the habit going and often you'll feel ready for a run by the time you finish stretching.\n\nEver read the book Atomic Habits? You might appreciate it. It's full of good info about forming good/breaking bad habits. I'm not sure how much applies to people suffering from depression, but it might be worth reading.\n\nI tell my self it’s medicine . So …not optional must do\n\nPlaying my jogging playlist gets me in the mood. I have trigger songs that I know if I play them, I will want to run.  Every. Single. Time. Gives me adrenaline and dopamine at the same time. This has been working for me for years now. Still have those same trigger songs too lol\n\nmind sharing some of these songs? :p\n\nI will jump in here...tom petty , wont back down, cars with ben orr , just what i needed, boston, more than a feeling, kansas, carry on, aviici flo rida good feeling\n\nNot running hurts more than running.  \nI remember that each time.  \nAnd each time I run, I never regret it.\n\nChronic sufferer here. My whole day is built around my run. I operate very well under a strong routine and it took decades of learning that the hard way. If I wake up and get my run/exercise in first thing, I come home and am hungry so I eat breakfast, I am covered in sweat so I shower, I am tired so I drink my coffee. After doing all of those things I am prepared to be productive and keep that momentum going all day. \n\nIf I don't run, I won't eat and just have a coffee, I won't feel the need to shower and I will just get caught in the dopamine search for the whole day.\n\nThe thing that gets me out of bed is that if I don't get out there before 6:30 my wife and daughter will wake up and I won't be able to. I find that pressure is a good motivator to do it even when I still have my brain fog. If I can just get up whenever, I won't until it's way too late in the day.\n\nWith all of that being said, if the running itself is leaving me feeling exhausted or like it's straining me mentally or emotionally, I'll take a day or two off and go on a bike ride to a cafe or something instead of the run, but the whole getting out of bed and immediately doing something is incredibly important for me to not be depressed.\n\nBack to the routine, just go easy on yourself and slowly tack things on it until you feel like your wake up and bed time routine check off enough of your minimum daily activities so the rest of the day can be sub-productive but you are still healthy.\n\nI'm not so much depressive but I have a chaotic, often unmotivated, distracted, ADHD type brain that doesn't lend itself to following routine.\n\n\nSo I have tricks to get me out. \n\n\n1) Dig into your motivations for running. Do you run to escape depression? Because of how much you resent being depressed and want the escape endorphins and fresh air give you? You could journal on your motivations for running - what it gives you in moments of need and where you would be without it. Boil it down to an essence and a strong mission for why you run. Then tap into that when you are not feeling like it. \n\n\n2) The other thing that helped me get out was joining a club and making plans to run with friends. I hate letting people down, so will always attend if I said I would even if I don't feel like. \n\n\n3) Even if you have a training plan, just allow yourself to do the bare minimum e.g. 3km easy run, and quit if you're not feeling it after that threshold. I rarely do quit but knowing I can is reassuring.\n\n\n4) Plan ahead of time - if you want to go for a morning run, lay out your clothes the night before. Even wear them to bed. Make it as easy as possible for you to get out of bed and go.\n\n\n5) plan some cool / more interesting/ different places to run. Sometimes when I'm not feeling like it the novelty of running in a new place will inspire me to go ahead and do it. So sometimes I will drive to a run just so it's more interesting scenery.\n\nStart by walking. Just get miles done. Don’t worry about time. Try doing it around sunset time. \n\nYou on anti depressants? That helps too 😂\n\nI’m currently on antidepressants. Been on them for 3 months. During this time I’ve finally managed to build back up a great running routine. Focussing on how my body needs to recover well to get stronger also helps stop me drinking alcohol (one of the contributing factors of my recurring depression). But the ADs could be helping too by removing any drive for hedonic pleasure 😐. I’m hoping to taper off the ADs and use running as my positivity but it’s all about choosing the right time. I don’t want to end up in a rut again!\n\nI also quit drinking for my mental health. Game changer, right?! \n\nYou just tell yourself you are „just“ going to put on the clothes. Then „just“ the shoes. Make each step a task so small that you can conquer it. And get out there and run. You‘ll feel less depressed after.\n\nI’ve had luck with telling myself to just go one mile out from home—then if I am having a good run I keep going, but if not it’s not too hard to walk back\n\nI run a lot before depression. 7-10 times per week. Marathon under 3 hours. Gym 3-4 times per week. When i started treatment i still tried to run. It was hard, because during of run i quite often get intrusive thoughts about suicide. With first meds i had big thirst. Later on i got too high heart rate that Even jogging raised it too high. Currently i have got normal heart rate during night but still too high while Nordic walking. It is too hot now to try to return into running. Still i have a hope!\n\nI run when I can.  I'm also getting older (53), and the days when I can run, are sometimes few and far between, due to injuries or other issues, so I try to think of that on days I'm less motivated, knowing I'll regret skipping a run later on when it's not really an option.\n\nSomewhere along the way, I realized I was being by loved by the sun, the trees, the wind, the trail… and that love was never going to hurt me, or leave me, or stop loving me. There was a constant source I could exchange my love with and that was enough to get me out there instead of on my floor, numb and motionless. Over time during bad depressive episodes, I found myself saying “just get yourself to the door, they will take care of you” (they as in nature). Now I see my depression as a person that joins me on my runs, we run together, we are both loved.\n\nYeah.  It helps me it is literalmy true; the trees are making me air, the oceans are bringing me food and water, the sun is fuelling all of life... interconnection is so amazing it can bring me a sense of awe\n\nHonestly. I just remind myself, when I run, everything goes away. That is the truth. For me at least. I put some headphones on, and just tell myself that it will be worth it and that I’ll feel better afterwards, and guess what, I feel better. That is how I do it, and I continue to do it ! :)\n\nRunning is one of the few times depression doesn’t get me, or anxiety. I feel as if they can’t catch a moving target, it’s that runners high. My treadmill helped me way better than a therapist or meds.\n\nLucky sufferer of major depression and GAD — I feel ya. It’s a colossal grind to get out of bed/off the couch and onto the road when a bad episode hits or lingers, but I remind myself that getting out there virtually never makes me feel worse and it almost always makes me feel at least a BIT better. I also give myself permission to stop after 1 km, but by the time I’m 5-10 minutes in, I’m usually ready for more. 😊\n\nI’ve also tried to throw out the idea of “motivation”, and replace it with “discipline”/“consistency”because nobody can be motivated all the time and it’s not some moral failing to not be in the mood to do something.\n\nStart the process small. Dont say to yourself 'I'm going to run 5 miles' just get your running kit out, maybe the night before, and put it somewhere obvious. Next step, put it on, then some music, then step out the door, whatever comes next. Dont overwhelm yourself.\n\nNormally I find if I take the first small step then I do the next. Once outside I might tell myself 'time to walk around the block' and eventually end up doing 5 miles.\n\nIf you like caffeine it can help to give a boost.\n\n1. Run with a friend. If I feel like someone is counting on me, I am more likely to do it.\n2. Sign up for races. A 5k run/walk takes the pressure off if you are just starting to run.\n3. Small steps. First, just tell yourself you only need to stand up. Then, you just need to put on running clothes. Next, get outside. Set small mental goals, so that when you meet them, it gives you a tiny sense of accomplishment that I think helps with dopamine, etc.\n4. When you feel good after a run/walk, take time to really reflect on that to rewire your brain… “I feel so good now. Look at how much I accomplished. I love this feeling.” Over time, when I start to feel overwhelmed/stressed about something, instead of withdrawing and shutting down, my mind thinks… “You need to move your body. Go outside for a run/walk.”\n\nBefore I run, I start a playlist of songs that motivate my headspace in that moment (212 by Azealia Banks if I’m angry sad, High by the Beach by LDR if I want to be alone sad, etc. I like to think of it as meeting my depression where it’s at on the starting line and then squashing it during the run.\n\nmy answer to \"how do you run with depression\" is, I would never have ran at all if it wasn't because of depression. Depression is why I started. I keep going these days because I enjoy it, and to help make sure that the depression never comes back (although I have resolved the other issues in my life which caused the depression in the first place).\n\nFor me, it was an escape, the more I ran, the harder I ran, the more I forgot about the depression.\n\nIt’s actually what keeps me going. \n\nI actually struggle when I’m not able to run. Lately have been facing issues with my knees and my Achilles heel and these past few months I’ve barely been able to keep my sanity. \n\nAnyway to address your question, the magic of running is that once you start running, the mind automatically starts focusing on the run. Running with music helps too. \n\nSometimes I’ll put on slow instrumental music just to feel the emotions again it depends on how I am feeling prior to the run. \n\nEven on runs where I literally had to drag myself because I was feeling down in the dumps, once I start running everything else just melts away. I’ve had plenty of “bad” runs but by the end of it certain sense of peace and emptiness takes over which tbh I can’t put into words.\n\nSet an alarm for it. \n\nIt could be 6am, or 9pm. Make it a concrete habit before you allow room for flexibility. \n\nIt's what got me back into running, and weirdly enough, journalling. \n\nI set an alarm on my phone for every day at 10pm, I'd take out my notepad and write about the day. It could be 3 sentences long if I'm lazy, or 3 pages if it was an eventful day. \n\nComing to the realization that it was the 45th day of journaling in a row, as someone who hadn't had a consistent habit in about a decade, it opened my eyes. \n\nSo after months of not running, I set a 5am alarm, every Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday, and now we're here, I've been running every 2 days for 4 months. \n\nAnd with that, some days I'll be away from home, at a social gathering, or whatever it may be. I don't force myself to play catch up the next day, but I'd often find myself itching for it because I miss it now. \n\nI'd also suggest running for time, not distance. In the start it was 1k, 2k, 5k, 10k etc. I realized I'd push myself too hard to achieve it. Instead of that, it was 10 minutes, 15, 30, 45, 60 etc. \n\nI'd also recommend turning off the option to see distance or pace on my watch, so I'd only know when I got home that it was X or Y distance. Over time, you learn a much more personal understanding of how your body feels, how it's willing to function on that day. (It should be mentioned that if I have a 45 minute run, and I feel like absolute shit, there may only be 15 minutes running, but there is 30 minutes of walking. 45 minutes is 45 minutes.) \n\nOverall, the most gruesome aspect of my depression, besides the occasional plan to kill myself, was the inability to keep a *loose* routine. Loose routines are half assing, in a time when you're already convincing yourself to half ass shit, it just doesn't work. \n\nLife gets in the way, there's nothing to stop that, but it's an adjustment in the moment, not an excuse. A \"set in stone\" routine via an alarm telling me to get up and go, well it took the agency away from me, it simply became a case of \"oh, time to grab the shoes\", instead of the \"oh, do I have it in me to go run when I get home?\", because realistically we'll find a reason to tell ourselves we don't have it.\n\nFirst, make sure you are getting the medical support you need: if you that's therapy cool. Medicine? Cool. Whatever is going to assist you.\n\nPrioritize your sleep, prioritize your well eating.\n\nAnd easy miles and consistency.\n\nI speak mostly from my experience. Just be gentle with yourself.\n\nWhen I was starting, I just put my running clothes on - I could always just not run and be in some comfy clothes then right? But chances are putting on the clothes gave me a little shot of dopamine such that I was motivated to put on my shoes too. Wow, dope, let’s maybe go for a walk outside, that’s not too much effort - I can do just a little walk around the block… you can see where I’m going with this - *baby steps* is what worked for me, each with the promise of ‘let’s just do this one tiny easy thing and it’s ok if I decide to quit after doing it’. 95% of the time I would end up going for a run, and eventually it just became a routine/habit (3 weeks was about how long it took!). Running, outdoors and activity didn’t resolve my depression, but it gave me the mental clarity relief to do it. You can do it too OP, just remember: baby steps, and try to congratulate yourself for each step you take.\n\nSomeone who also battles depression.. run 2 or 3x week and strength train.\nHeres the thing\nDon't wait to be motivated.  Do it anyway. Do it when you feel like shit. Does it make you feel better? Tbh not really.. not always but you do feel like you've done something, and that helps. \nCan say this though..  while it can be done,  it's difficult to run and cry at the same time. \nI hope the depression eases off soon\n Not alone there friend. Not by a longshot\n\nJust my experience but I started running while mega depressed, I don’t think I would have been able to if I hadn’t signed up for a half marathon, but ultimately running helped me find my way out, it was a sort of self therapy for me at the time. Thoughts I was normally able to avoid would surface, and little by little on those longer runs I became better at thinking things through in a more accepting and less self critical way.\n\nTrail running works for me when pounding pavement doesn’t equal a better day.\n\nNot to push meds. But I tried Wellbutrin and had very good results. There are a lot less side effects than other anti depressants. I finally decided to try medication when I was in my 30s and I was just so sad that I was crying on a ski lift surrounded by beautiful mountains doing a sport I’ve always loved! I knew I needed a bit more help. Sometimes medication can give you that little push you need to see the light. That being said exercise has been hands down the best anti depressant for me throughout my life. And yes as other have said sometimes you just have to FORCE yourself to do it. But you and I both know you’ll almost never end a run, walk, bike ride, etc feeling worse.\n\nCheers and best of luck.\n\nMy style of depression is mainly somatic so I have more brain fog, headaches and such. I start out slow and start the music.. it takes me some time to work up to it but I leave plenty of time for recovery for me that’s key\n\nI just do a mile, but everyday for a couple days in a row.\n\nAfter a couple days I want to do more. Running just one mile saves on the mental load- don’t have to carry really anything with you, don’t have to worry about timing your bathroom use, etc. basically you don’t have to plan ahead at all. Just get out the door, do just a teeny tiny baby half mile then turn around and run home. It feels like a running appetizer.\n\nwhen i'm in a depression episode, i focus on the habit of getting out still, even if i'm not pushing myself fully. its better than nothing at all. so i'll hit up a short trail w my dog.\n\nthat way i at least get out for a bit, but i don't have to commit to a longer run if i don't have the energy for it. and if i do feel like it once i'm on the trail, i can push myself or go as many laps as i am comfortable with.\n\nI think depression is WHY a lot of people run. It’s seriously all I have sometimes\n\nSometimes all I can do is go for a walk, and that's ok.\n\nI started running to help with depression. 30+min run is like a mental bath and I feel refreshed after.\n\nRunning has helped me so much with my mental health.  Sometimes after a run I will write down much my mood has improved. Then, when I dont want to run, I will revisit the note and it will motivate me.\n\n  \nDepression is hard. Anxiety is hard. Be kind to yourself. It gets better.\n\nIt’s really simple. Don’t give yourself an option to not do it. A lot of life boils down to will power. People need to learn to force themselves to do things they don’t want to do.\n\nAnd the forcing myself bit was almost more rewarding than the running. I don't think about it anymore, I just do it the same time everyday\n\nI wouldn't say I'm super depressed but mildly depressed and actually injured which kinda halts my running. Just put one foot in front of the other outside and go for a walk. Just walk and keep walking. I find the mental benefits of running is almost as good just going for a nice long walk. I was pretty mentally and physically exhausted yesterday and the fortitude needed to walk obviously wasn't as much as for a run, but the benefits after walking 30+ min or so was still there.\n\nSame. Sometimes, I'll make sure I'm dressed so I can shift to running. Other times (especially winter), I'll just bundle up for a walk. \n\nGreat idea. 👍 I normally use hiking shoes or Sambas but I'm going rn actually and should probably put my runners on just in case it shifts to that\n\nMe too! Have a good walk/run! \n\nCouple things;\n\n\nWhen I was going through a rough time I was really hard on myself.  I kind of used that a bit, rationalizing that if I felt worthless not going for a run would only be proof of that.  Probably not a great way to get out of the cycle because it is essentially self loathing, but I definitely muscled through a couple runs I wouldn't have done otherwise.\n\n\nOn a healthier note, of all the times I thought about giving up but was able to muscle through, I always felt better.  Maybe it wasn't a massive change, but it was at least a little bit better than before.  Muscle through it on pure willpower a few times, feel the results, and it becomes easier because you have undeniable proof that it does help you\n\nHey there, dealing with depression since the beginning of the year. While it had major impacts on much of what I do, my running isn't much different from normal. I can't find the will to build a training block or aim for any objective, I mainly do the daily suggestion from Garmin.\n\nNormally after or near the end of a run is when I fell the finest from a psychological stand point. If I can't complete it I just do a easy run. Even when it feels really difficult to get out it's just a matter of putting my shoes on and then my legs take me from there.\n\nWhen I don't feel like running I just say I'm going to force myself to do 5 minutes. Then when 5 minutes is up I always feel like going for more.\n\nMy advice is to set yourself a goal that is about the frequency of going running not the distance or the pace.  On a bad day you feel much better knowing beforehand you can also stop after 1 mile and take a slow pace. But you can still feel good about yourself because you did it. A short walk every second day is a great achievement in frequency.\n\nOnce you are out and about, your feeling of exhaustion may change or not. If you feel good extend the run. If not don’t bother because you achieved already your goal. You went out there and that is what matters.\n\nAnd the frequency helps you to get into the habit.\n\nBTW I recommend the mornings. You benefit the next 8 hours from your morning run.\n\nI start by going for a walk on a trail. Usually I start to feel better and begin running, or at least intersperse short jogs.  I nearly always feel better after spending some time moving among trees. (I don't think I could manage to run on roads at all, especially where I live).\n\nOn a related note, I found my depression symptoms closely tied to my diet.  When I used to eat poorly (and was morbidly obese) every day was dark and filled with self-loathing.  After switching and sticking to a healthy diet (and losing a lot of weight) the depression became far better. I still have dark days, especially as I'm dealing with some bad stuff and terrible people, but they're not nearly as severe nor frequent. And I can better see ways to manage and address things. And often, taking a walk then maybe a jog along a wooded trail helps.\n\nFinally, on the days when I really don't feel like getting out and moving, I remember that, as difficult as starting a walk or run may have been, I've always felt better once I started.\n\nI started running about four years ago. I was out of shape and depressed. Started walking. At least it got me outside and gave me space to think. Then I started running (super slow pace) for no more than 30 mins. I noticed that I was finding confidence. Confidence in my body, yes, but also mental confidence and self esteem. After a while, it was the thing I looked forward to most in the day. Time to get away from it all. Time to think. Time to work things out. As my workouts grew longer (6-8 miles, then 10-15 miles), I realized what a stress reliever it was. I have found that my problems seem much smaller after  90 mins or two hours of cardio. I guess what I’m saying is I’ve never really had the motivation problem because I get so much from it. I enjoy it. One piece of advice though. KEEP YOUR EASY RUNS EASY. Keep your heart rate low. Run slow. A 15 min pace if you have to. If you’re out there killing your self every time you won’t look forward to it. You’re supposed to enjoy it!\n\nFor me it's the opposite. Running days were the only days I felt good. Dealing with an injury now again so I'm just walking gently and it's been a real rough time but I'm getting through it. Everyone has different things that work you just have to keep trying everyday. There's not much else you can do. Find people you can talk to in your life who you feel comfortable being open and honest with. Even sharing on places like this can be helpful.\n\nSelf bribery. I (over) use food to self soothe and the easiest way to get that mile in or go get a cavity looked at by the dentist is to promise myself a toy or a treat. \n\nFor exercise it’s easiest to make a coffee shop my turnaround point, and I make one of my caffeinated drinks of the day the goal of the trip. \n\nYou can either split your workout, or if you live in a walkable neighborhood you can make the shop at your cooldown point.\n\nI find it a struggle.   Some weeks r good n I accomplish my goals other weeks I hate life \n\n Running helps with some endorphins but I struggle to show up everyday when it gets bad. Going through a real bad spell atm.  \n\nHaven’t slept in 36 hours so I know I’m not exercising today either\n\n Hopefully I can work through this fog sooner than later and get back into a proper flow.  GL If u find the answer. Share. \n\nIt’s my playtime in my head. When I was in my best groove while battling depression, I would smoke a little weed, get the dog ready, plug in my headphones and go. I love to daydream, and that was the time and place when I didn’t feel the heavy weigh me down. I forced myself to go because of the dog when I didn’t feel like going, but most of the time I looked forward to it because I sent my mind into space separate from my emotions.\n\nI streak. Minimum one mile every day, usually first thing in the morning on work days and afternoons on days off. I do longer stuff on the weekend (currently training for a half) and if i have the time/energy 1-2 days during the week (i often dont). Sometimes it can hardly even be called a run bc its barely foreward progress-- but knowing ive committed to getting out every single day or my streak ends takes out any decision-making when my brain is overstimulated or i just cant be bothered. \nTodays run included tears. Sometimes there's random profanity. Sometimes im grinning like a crazy person. \nStreaking isnt for everyone but for me, its helped me a ton with consistency. Im on day 226 after recovering from an injury.\n\nrunning and exercise dumps “feel good” chemicals.  true depression (not being sad or grieving) is a chemical imbalance and exercise can have a positive effect on the brain chemically.\n\nAfter coffee I just always put on my running gear and the rest takes care of itself. I run every day because I run every day.\n\nBite sized miles - at my worst (currently lol) I’m just doing a minimum of 2 (hard to argue against just 2 easy miles) and then IF I feel up to it during the run, I’ll decide then if I want to go more. In case I do, I usually leave myself a 40-50 min window for my “run” so no stress if I do decide to go longer \n\nI hope you feel better soon ❤️\n\nNot me, but I heard this from a subreddit somewhere but  “even brushing your teeth with 50% effort is better than none at all” so just get out there and run guy,\nEven if you only take a few steps, don’t let the son of a\nBitch that is depression win. You got this.\n\nI actually never go out on a run with the explicit intention to, or it would feel like a burden I couldn’t manage. I just put on my exercise clothes because it means if I feel like picking up the pace I can, but I don’t have to. I’ll just quickly brush my teeth before I go on a walk and listen to some music and that’s honestly good enough.\n\nI’ll slowly pick up the pace to a brisk walk and then stretch after a bit because that feels good, and then afterwards I almost always feel up for running the rest. And when I go home, I tell most people I just went out for a walk and so I will never be faced with any external pressure (real or imagined) to keep the running up. And then I shower since I got sweaty and sometimes I make myself some food because I’m hungry. \n\nBut it’s never planned. I don’t think too carefully about it ahead of time. I’m just going for a walk that has a tendency to turn into a run a few times a week.\n\nI definitely needed this thread today. I've been trying to get motivated to run again(had an extensive 3 part surgery that I've recently recovered from) but Bipolar depression has kept me near immobilized at times and it's rough.\n\nI don't know how much it helped with anxiety, but when I started running things improved quickly.  I started running to help with stress and anxiety over Xmas break.  It is my unbreakable rule for each weekend.  It has to happen. I also walk to work a couple of days  a week.\n\nFast forward to today.  I haven't missed a weekend and feel amazing.  I feel super disciplined and motivated.  I ran 2 hours straight today. Longest I have done in my life and I'm 39.\n\n\nI do it because I know it is exactly what I need and I don't want to go back to where I was a year ago ever again!\n\nHi! Been battling depression my whole life. I finally feel like I have control of it through running. Remember you will always feel better if you got out for a run than if you didn’t. Slow is fine and forward is pace. Start small and work your way up. No more than 10-20% weekly increases. The key for me was cutting out ALL drinking alcohol. Now I run daily 50-80 miles a week more if training for a 100 miler. I feel like i have a damn super power. Whenever i hit a low running i just think of when I was super depressed and the journey on how far I have come.  Never again.\n\nJust throw out all expectations when you take your first step. Tie your laces while you’re crying if necessary. Just find the will power to get out the door. Walking is totally acceptable. Don’t worry about your fitness, just get out of the house and into your body for a period of time. Your head needs the break.\n\nInteresting. Running actually helps me alleviate depression.\n\nThe hardest thing for me when feeling depressed is to start a run. \n\nIs usually a strategy of acknowledging how I feel, but taking action regardless of it. \n\nI'm thinking .... maybe I'll just put the running shoes. And then get out of the door to \"see how the weather is\". Maybe run a km. Then two, and from there suddenly I'm in a different mind state. \n\nThis winter I found myself running, during the night, in freezing cold conditions, for 10km+ and always feeling like I don't actually want this to stop. And this feeling helps me get out of the door next time.\n\nGetting started is the hard part. Is acknowledging that you feel like shit but nevertheless getting out of the door.\n\nIf I don’t run I spiral out of control quickly. Even a quick 1 mile will greatly help me\n\nI got through my near-suicidal depression by joining running clubs. Even on days I didn't want to show up, I texted people that I was coming for the run and internally forced myself to show up. In a month or so, all that dopamine and endorphins kicked me back to normal levels of mental sanity. It saved my life.\n\nI’d suggest picking up [Running is my Therapy](https://www.ebay.com/itm/375315819912?mkcid=16&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&amp;ssspo=WmDBEdUdSb6&amp;sssrc=4429486&amp;ssuid=pCw-rr_cRzO&amp;var=&amp;widget_ver=artemis&amp;media=COPY) and channeling all the negative energy into your runs. I was a far better running and in much better shape when I was coming out of depression after a breakup. That book helped a lot.\n\nFor me it is all about easing through the things that depression uses to keep me depressed.  Scared of people or how I look... Keep one outfit I'm comfortable in ready to wear, so I never stand at the mirror or door thinking my appearance is bad.  Having a route I'm comfortable with; not lots of people to see me if I'm not doing well or feel like I look stupid... Going at a time of day that is right for me, even if it's 2am... And being ok with turning around if I feel like it.  No pressure to go a certain distance or time or really any goal at all... I almost always go quite far once I settle in though.  As far as motivation I just kinda like to turn my brain off as much as possible, put on my same outfit, go my same route, just get out the door and the rest works itself out.  Once I get going then I let myself think.  Running has helped me through the darkest times!\n\ntbh when I went through a depressive episode of ~6 months I stopped running. Its always been the most enjoyable activity Ive ever done, I feel happy and zen and free. But when I was depressed, I tried running and couldnt enjoy it and it freaked me out to think something thats always been there for me could just disappear like that. It felt awful. I tried other exercise but I couldnt be consistent with any of it. I finally started taking wellbutrin and within a week I felt better than I had in months and my brain could actually process feeling good during the activities that I knew I enjoyed.\n\nAll of that to say, meet yourself where you are and dont force something that doesnt feel right. Sometimes you cant just power through, but whatever you can manage in the meantime is enough.\n\nI'm not depressed. But like everyone, sometimes I feel down. And for me, running often fixes that. Just running by myself for an hour helps me process my feelings. Sorts them out. It doesn't always work. Sometimes, I end up even more upset. But, typically, I feel better after the run\n\nLay out clothes the night before. Wake up, coffee, david goggins/jocko videos, run\n\nMotivation when in the depths is damn tough to find.  Knowing that running is my way of treating it (not recommended, therapy and medication work way better I am sure) and that if I can force myself to get out the door things will improve eventually, breaking the downward spiral, etc. gets me going.  Sometimes.\n\nCommit to ten minutes of running. If you get out there, ten minutes go by, and it absolutely sucks, I have permission to call it off. But usually, after that point, the happy brain chemicals are starting to kick in, I'm feeling the vibe with my music, and I can keep going for a bit.\n\nThese perspectives have helped me. I hope they help you. \n\nOften, it’s not possible to think or reason or debate or hope your way out of depression. You have to do something different with action being the key (as long as the action is not self-destructive). \n\nMind/body/soul: It’s all one and the same.\n\nFeeling better immediately after is the main motivation. I have done it so many times that I know there’s a 99% chance of feeling slightly better after running through a terrible episode. For me there also seems to be a point while running where the dread goes away… usually towards the end of my goal of about 30 minutes or 3 miles, when I feel like I could just happily keep going. \n\nI’ve found that music can be a motivator in the beginning, but the novelty of it wears off and I prefer to listen to a podcast or audiobook for the majority of the time. I can even go for something more ambient sounding if I decide to work through an issue during my run or look for some sort of inner clarity. Tbh since I have a standing desk, sometimes I just run through doing really mundane internet scrolling and shopping. It’s all just something to stay busy with while I attempt to make my body feel better, so that my mind will feel better too.\n\nIf I don’t feel even mildly better after about 10 minutes, that’s when I give myself permission to do something else. But usually I want to keep going.\n\nI just look back at all the work I have put in and then I tell my self I have to go.  I also don't hold myself to specific, like 66% of my total workload, which isnt a lot, up to 100% whatever happens happens. I also just run for the health benefits, not in a running sport way, although i like to imagine I am\n\nRoutine for me. I will run always Wednesday and Sunday. Whether I want too or not (usually not). I got used to obeying the routine.\n\nTell yourself to just get your gear on and then decide if you can face it. Then when it's on tell yourself you're just going to step outside and see what it feels like. Then try a little walk...then a slow jog...oh shit, I'm running...and it feels good.\n\nYou really just have to force yourself to do things when you’re depressed. It may seem impossible when you think about it but just start doing it and don’t stop.\n\nIt may be that I have a bit of an addictive personality, but tracking apps really help me. Keeping close track of my goals, etc. The apps really suit my natural task oriented mindset. I also echo many of the above comments, I know that when I don't run (like today because of a migraine), I'll feel bad about myself all day. I've made it to the point that I get my run in FOR my mental health. Remind yourself that once you get started, it rarely feels bad!\n\nwhen i'm really deep in my head and i really need to run to clear it, my partner have told me to drown everything out and just do two things: \n\n1. put on my shoes and \n2. get out the door\n\nhe told me not to nitpick at starting and to just run and keep running like Forrest Gump\n\nworks for me like magic\n\nLots of good info already posted but like others said you just have to force yourself to do it. Once you start running your mood will change but you have to force yourself to do it. You know you can physically put your shoes and clothes on so start with that and then go outside and start warming up. You’ll feel better once you start the process. You got this!\n\nI’m not really depressed, but I have a default nihilistic view of the world with a constant sense of existential dread like nothing matters. I work a pretty stressful job. Running is a coping mechanism for me also. That being said sometimes it takes me over an hour of procrastination to get out the door sometimes. Best thing I did was start running everyday, that way it’s a habit. It feels weird for me to go a day without running at all.\n\nI just try to hold onto the feeling of the runners high. Even when I don’t feel like getting out the door, reliably I feel better during those miles of running. Yes, the depressive symptoms return once I’m done, but I run in large part for the symptom relief while I’m actually running. Just hang onto that feeling.\n\nI trick myself.   \nI'll tell myself I only have to go for a little walk and I'll put on my running clothes and shoes. I'll put upbeat music on and inevitably want to walk a little faster, so I tell myself I'll just do a little jog. Usually about 2-3min into the little jog, I'm fully committed to a run. \n\nThe other way I get myself to run/exercise is group workouts. There's just something about knowing someone is waiting on you / expecting you to be there and will ask about you if you don't show that gets me out of my own personal bubble of bleak.\n\nI run. So much that I want to run again tomorrow\n\ngo slow, go moment by moment. prepare as much as you can to make the run comfortable for yourself. forgive yourself if you don't make your goal but give it a genuine effort. it also helps to listen to motivational speakers, music that vibes with your mood, or try to channel some anger into the run to get your blood pumping\n\nRunning replaced self mutilation for me. I have always hated running, used it as punishment, and always picked the hottest time of day to run 13 miles. As unhealthy as my mindset was, it inadvertently brought about healthy changes even though I wasn’t looking for them.\n\nObviously meds help.\n\nIf you drink, try reducing or quitting.\n\nBut at the time of the run, I usually just don't want to go outside.  I know I'm going to enjoy exercising once it starts.  It's remembering the first step is the hardest.  On my third stride, I'm goid to go.  Just getting to that third stride is the hard part.  Force yourself to to do it.  It takes all of 5 seconds.\n\nI ve also done mid day 1 mile runs.  It usually makes my day better.  Then I'll run longer at night.\n\nRun groups also help.\n\nfor me, it comes down to forcing myself to run. for this reason, I need a plan. \n\nif I don't have a training plan, I'll have weeks where I run 40 miles and weeks where I run 10, just based off my mood. \n\nif I'm running on a plan, the completionist in me can't not finish the miles. for this reason, I plan out basically 100% of the miles I run.\n\nMy brain is not allowed to talk to me before I go out/start working out. Whatever thoughts it wants to have, I will listen but only after I went out.\nAlso it helps me having something external planning the runs for me, like an app, or following any kind of program, that way I don't rely on motivation, I just follow.\n\nThe moment of indecision you have to do it . Wear mismatch socks, shitty shorts, good running shoes and just fucking do it. You can’t not do what you have to do because you ain’t feeling like it . If you let your bad days win , you will settle\n\nI get a routine and I do everything possible to stick to it. Makes me feel accomplished which helps\n\nIt's all about getting out the door. After that, it's all how much good you can get. \n\n\nTwo applications of the same idea: \n\n\n(1) have MULTIPLE strategies for getting out the door. Whatever it takes. Think about what pulls you to do it, what feels good or what consequences come. Maybe think about what you're escaping or taking a break from. Maybe focus on what you'll engage your mind with (music, debate, quiet, whatever). \n\n\n(2) Have your plan, your habit, your goal. AND THEN BE FLEXIBLE. I used to judge walkers. Now I am one at times. There are many times I am able to get out the door but that's about all the energy I've got; so then I turn that run into a pure core workout while walking. Takes some practice but it is really good to do as recovery or whenever. That works for me - find what works for you. If you can't do your planned workout, still do SOMETHING. \n\n\nIf you make a habit of getting out and just doing something productive, I guarantee you'll be moving forward. It'll take time, but it works. \n\n\nFor me, it's that balance of habit and flexibility. For me, running will happen one way or the other, and it'll be good on my body one way or the other. \n\n\nI don't get a choice about how hard this is or whether something specific (like giving some energy) is possible. BUT I CAN PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER ... Repeatedly. \n\n\nAnd then I keep going.\n\nTeam Persistent Babysteps. \n\n\nI'm getting shirts made. Still kicking around whether bowling shirts or singlets. Someday.\n\nYou will be frustrated and disappointed. Surprise, it's a day that ends in Y. So let that flow through and out. \n\n\nBe flexible in the big picture, too. This helps in between runs.\n\n\n\nYou want the strength that survives earthquakes - flexible strength in many directions like modern office buildings. You don't want strength only one direction like a hiking pole - immensely strong one way and brittle in others.\n\n\nI wish I could apply this idea of flexibility to other areas but it doesn't work the same for me. Running is simple enough that having flexible approaches seems to be enough, as long as I'm always flexible to get to what's possible and then trying what's possible.\n\nFor me, I've set a rule for myself that I have to go for the run even if I don't want to if I've spent more time than the run would actually take trying to justify to myself not running. I'm a podcast runner and I have a couple podcasts that I'm not allowed to listen to unless I'm running. Also on days when I know I may be struggling I've found making a plan with a friend to meet for a run or be accountability buddies with via text will help. Some how having to speak the action to another person makes it easier than being accountable to yourself. \n\nThese have always helped me through the valleys of depression and them when I'm not in the valleys of depression I don't need to rely on them as much to get me out the door.\n\nA painful, sustained run typically feels an awful lot like depression to me. If I’m going to have that feeling either way, I’d prefer the version I choose. Plus, you can reason that in some way you’ve been mentally training your whole life for the feeling. I think that’s why I read about so many depressives running long distances. I personally tend to view it as an advantage, like training your whole life at altitude. Hard for others to compete verse that. Which isn’t to say it has to be a competition. I just think most people shy away from suffering while those suffering from depression have no choice but to confront it. I approach my runs knowing that, even if they present a mental hurdle, they are the suffering I can choose.\n\nSeparate the concerns. How you feel emotionally doesn’t change the fact you still need to exercise, and in reality exercise is actually a way to improve symptoms of depression.\n\nExercise is one part of my “medicine” so I make it a priority knowing it’ll make me feel better, even if I’m in a dark place when I go for a run or to the gym. 80% of it is just getting there, so if you do that you’re already ahead of the game. As long as I keep telling myself that it’s just as important as taking my meds then I do it.\n\nFor me, running is what makes get out of depressive episodes, at least for a bit. I like to call it, running away from my problems, because I'll feel better while I'm running and at least a few hours after.\n\nSometimes I run *because* I'm feeling super depressed.\n\nI think it's just knowing that achieving/doing something helps get me out of my doldrums. I focus less on how much I don't want to do it, and more on how much better I will feel having done it (and also, in a very negative and possibly unhealthy way, how bad I will feel if I don't do it).\n\nIt's kind of a \"just do it\" thing as well for me. Stop thinking about it, and just do it. This also helps kick you out of your overthinking doldrums.\n\nHate myself more if I don’t.\n\nDon’t do this, would not recommend.\n\nLast year, I did 40-60km every week. This year has been a big struggle for me mentally but I try to get at least one run out every week even if it’s just 3km. \n\nI can’t seem to force it if I’m not feeling great even though I know running helps lighten my mood. Hoping to get back into doing it regularly again soon but we’ll see.\n\nFor me running is the best method to help fight my depression.\n\nThanks for this awesome question!\n\nFor me, when I run for about 4 miles*, I get into this zone which is bliss and makes the rest of the day great! \n\n(*This distance may vary from person to person though)\n\nMedication and upping the walking when it’s a particularly challenging day. I recently rescued a shelter pup who wags her tail every day around 5 asking me for a run. She’s probably the most helpful.\n\nI feel you, I’ve been there. \nRunning became something that helped me cope with mine. It’s one of those things that I remind myself will make me feel better when it’s done. \nEven if I have to drag myself outside/to the treadmill, once I’ve started, I know I can do it. And knowing that I can get there and begin makes me feel a little bit lighter.\n\nHonestly, I don’t get my head into any of it. I just do it (not to get all Nike about it but… yeah). It’s autopilot. Set route etc. no thought. Just do.\n\nJust go. Going out or starting is the hardest part. Do it enough times until it becomes a habit and you look forward to it. My psychiatrist said if exercise comes in the form of pills, it would be the world's most bought pills, something like that.\n\n1. Knowing that running will probably help me feel better than most of the other healthy coping mechanisms I have. \n\n\n2. Knowing that if I just get through the first 10-15 minutes the good brain chemicals will kick in and then I feel motivated to continue.\n\n\n3. Knowing that by doing something rather than wallowing in my feelings/ruminations I am reinforcing months of habits which have kept me feeling empowered.\n\n\n4. Knowing that regardless of how much it sucks to get up and do it, and it's cold and raining and even if I have to drag ass to do barely manage a 5k, I will feel better for having done so. \n\nYou can run, but you can’t run away from your problems. Came here to say that 😉.\n\nI just tell myself I'll run for 10 mins and if I hate it and cannot manage any more I can stop, usually that 10 mins warms me up, get the endorphins going and allows me to not only get some decent exercise but push through the depressive episode.\n\nWho’s going to carry the boats\n\ni just know how much better i’m gonna feel after.  also laying out my gym clothes the night before is huge for me, just makes it so much easier when they’re right there in my face yelling at me lol\n\nTold myself that NO MATTER WHAT I'm getting that first mile in. If I don't want to run after that, I can quit. I don't think I stopped at a mile like ever.\n\nJust start. Once you get going, you’ll start to immediately feel accomplished. I know it sounds dumb, but literally prying yourself out of bed or off the couch and lacing up them running shoes, even if you half walk, at the end of it you can say “ I won today”. It will help.\n\nLay everything out so it’s ready to go. Don’t deliberate, just go. Have a motivating music mix. Take a preworkout 30 minutes before, these have caffeine to get you going. Remember how good you feel after. Your body doesn’t release the energy to do something until you are about 15 minutes into it. This gets shorter the more often you do it.\n\nMy crunk: my family prefers me not running, coz of the time away - wife isn't a runner, and 2 pre-school kids. So when my motivation is low, that's it. \n\nI can't speak for depression per se. \n\nI'm realising this isn't helping you my friend.\n\nI like the sentiment of the sentence \"the days when you really don't feel like it are the days you NEED it the most\"\n\n  \nI've had some runs where I cry, just taking a little walk break and ugly cry when not passing others. Not sure if this is an issue for you, but maybe it helps hearing nonetheless. I know I'd rather cry running than stay at home because I'm crying\n\nRunning has always been my way to decompress. So when I’m depressed I kind of have to force myself to do it, but afterwards I’m always glad I did.\n\nI run because I am depressed and I don’t wanna feel that way anymore.\n\nMy brain trickery is ‘I feel like shit if I stay on the couch, may as well feel like shit and do something I know is objectively good for me’ - even if I bail after 20 mins and still feel the exact same, there’s a net gain somewhere that might build up over time\n\nSo many similar comments and I basically echo what has already been said, but I would add a weird caveat, I had been a strictly treadmill guy until my sole broke a month or two ago. Running outside as the sun is coming up is an entirely new level of awesome and feel good. I definitely notice a difference mentally since swapping the routine to outside runs\n\nBack in undergrad, running was the only thing that really pulled me out of depressive funks. When my thoughts were too much to handle I would go out and just run as far as I could, usually around 8-10 miles. I would say to be gentle with yourself as far as making it an obligation. If you’re feeling ok then challenge yourself to run, if you are exhausted that day then don’t make it a chore. You can always switch it up as well- I would run at dawn, sunset, midnight, through the city, down to the coastline, on the track, with or without music. I would also reward myself with a smoothie afterward, it was a special routine I really looked forward to.\n\nCold plunge or cold shower before running. It sucks, but it jumpstarts all the good feeling chemicals in us and also knocks out all the aches and pains you might be feeling. I feel amazing when I start my run and only feel better after the running endorphins kick in.\n\nI’m the type of person that likes lists and schedules so making a “running schedule” helps a lot with accountability for me. I sprinkle in speed workouts and account for increases in mileage. So in my head, it pushes me to do it to stay on track(haha on track). ANYWAY definitely give yourself the grace to forgive yourself for missing days but always remember that it will be there for you to pick back up.\n\nAlso! Another thing that motivated me was podcasts and audiobooks BUT I could only listen to them if I was on a run. Every cliffhanger was my reason for getting out of bed and into my shoes.\n\nIt’s hard and it sucks a lot of the time but it feels good keeping a routine, really gives me a semblance of control. I haven’t been good recently about sticking to a running schedule but what’s been helping me is remembering I’m running to feel good and that like most things with depression, it takes time to fall back into it. \n\nI admire all of you here for keeping on. I’m glad you’re here :)\n\nRun slow, just go.\n\nInteresting, the only way I stave off the depression is working out and running. Hadn’t considered it as a blocker for it\n\nSame as hiking. One foot in front of the other.\n\nI have days where i really dont want to leave home to exercise. What gets me out of the house sometimes is remind myself that this is a form of self love. “Im going to run 5 miles today because i care about myself”. It wont relieve my depression. But definitely make it easier to go outside. Other days its the david goggins type videos that will get me going. Thats cool if thats what gets people running every day. Thats not how it works for me though. Sometimes being gentle to myself will get me out of the house. \n\nEdit: this is on top of what other people have contributed. Once you’ve established that running is a non-negotiable its easier to get moving.\n\nI have mantras or sayings and keep the schedule  I set (first thing in the morning). \nCurrently my two: the race is long and it’s only with yourself (from the oft quoted Kurt Vonnegut/class of/ everybody’s free) and Rita Pearson  “I am somebody” speech.\n\nI’ve pushed myself enough to know that running almost always makes me feel better and as such that is what my mind focuses on. Indeed if I’m slack and don’t run or skip a session at the gym I can feel myself slipping. For me exercise and running in particular is the most effective tool I have found to deal with a life time of depression. \n\nI completed my first half marathon this morning.\n\nI try to give myself a lot of grace around running plans and expectations. Just do as much as I can at whatever speed I can and not be too rigid about time of day etc. \n\nMaybe having a set of running clothes ready and easy to grab and trying to seize the moments when it feels possible.\n\nI’ll also not be too picky about where I run but have some nice destinations in mind that I know will be healing (like by the water or on a nice trail) and plan how to get there so if my mood lifts enough to go I can do it without thinking.\n\nSOMETIMES, maybe when my mood is creeping back up, having a friend to make running plans with but with the agreement that we might have to cancel, maybe someone in the same boat mood wise, and that there’ll be big high fives if we do make it 😅\n\nJust run for 10 minutes. If you feel good, keep going. If you’re not feeling it, you did at least 10 minutes of running and usually makes me feel at least I did something for myself\n\nThe 10 minute rule. You force yourself to put your shoes on and go outside. Run for 10 min. If you wanna stop at the end of the 10 min you can, but most of the time you won't want to stop. It's the getting out there that's hard.\n\nThis is so true. I do this with running and other activities. I rarely get depressed these days but I used to suffer with it a lot. It takes an incredible amount of willpower to force yourself to get up and out for 10 mins but the benefits are so worth it if you can.\n\nI can tell you from my recent experience with it what’s been working: have something else in your life besides running. I’m coming back from an injury and am just getting my stride back. During the recovery I had to face down a lot of the depression I’ve dealt with and it meant making sure that running wasn’t the only thing in my life. Because when that was taken away, my mental health fell apart.  \n  \nAfter my breakdown, I found hobbies. And with that I was able to break out of it and help my depression. I was that much better when I recovered and it kept me out of the hospital. Find something fun that isn’t super active.  \n  \nAlso, if no one’s mentioned it yet, I recommend checking out r/eood (Exercise Out Of Depression). It’s a group that deals with this exact issue.\n\nI just felt like running * forest Gump voice\n\ni have had depression (diagnosed) for like three years now. and what helped me was finding things i love. dancing, running. as u said, u love it which is very good for motivation. \ni try to go running right in the morning or just walk around in sports clothes all day until im able to. the most difficult part for me is changing into clothes. \nand i try to remind myself on how good running/dancing makes me feel. \nmaybe u could also try to find a group to run with (if ur into that) that can help with getting up and going\n\nYou just do it. Get past the mental struggle and do it. End goal of feeling better mentally after. I force myself.\n\nHow do I *not*\n\nYeah I’ve been going through it really badly. It’s really hard too especially since I’m doing base training right now so my runs take long, instead of a quick 5k or speed intervals. But honestly what pushed me is that I know I’ll feel worse if I don’t improve. Plus a friend of mine got into running and he’s already getting close to my level. If I don’t train then he’ll catch up to me\n\nRoutine is the key for me.\n\nChoose days and times you know you can do. Then do it. Even if it's a little run, anything is better than nothing.\n\nRunning is the best depression-killer"

Works great!\n\nI usually add a sock or two down my pants just to add to the “wow” factor. Especially when it’s cold.\n\nInstructions unclear. I put two socks down the back of my pants now everyone avoids me.\n\nNot everyone keeps their genitals in the same place.\n\nI really hope this was a Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country reference!\n\n🖖\n\nInstructions still unclear. I put a glove down my pants and now everyone calls me Pentapenis\n\nYou understood the assignment. \n\nSome say wow. Others say ewww.\n\nOh, are there athletic cod pieces?\n\nDance belt for the win\n\n*Labyrinth* starring David Bowie has entered the chat.\n\nLike a merkin, but sportier\n\ncotton, or wool?\n\nIn the front or back?\n\nI like it to look like I bricked my pants and like I’m bricked up!\n\nLots of great advice here, but I don't think the camp that's just straight up derisive about wearing shorts over the tights is coming from a very kind place. Of course, it's ideal to be uninhibited, proud, free, neutral, etc about one's body and just opt for comfort, always, but we live within a context here. And if you feel more confident—temporarily, or forever—with the shorts over the tights, then there's nothing wrong with that. Even as a woman, it took me a couple of years into college running to feel comfortable not doing the very same thing; I came from a very modest and religious background and it was just something I eventually felt ok with on my own terms. I was also the only woman on my team who didn't run in just a sports bra, and people teasing me about it did not actually help at all in terms of making me feel inclined to let it all hang out. Some say that full confidence is wearing crop tops no matter your size, for others, they'll just feel more confident in a regular shirt. Embrace the bulge, or don't. It's a personal choice. Not to get too earnest, but I have feelings.\n\nReasonable and measured take, I am team tights only but the real answer is \"whatever makes you happy\".\n\nThis made me tear up near enough. Just do what you're comfortable with\n\nThis exactly, I have to wear a proper Bra to run - underwired sports bra, no cute crop tops ☹️ and I just can’t bear the idea of not wearing a shirt over it. Doesn’t stop me admiring/being envious of women looking super cute in their pretty crop top sports bras tho.\n\nEven with a small bust, I find most crop top styles to be extremely lacking in bounce control for the impact of running.  \nI prefer to have a top over it but definitely go sleeveless in hot weather.\n\nGreat answer. I prefer full length shirts to run (vs a sports bra alone) and sometimes wear shorts or a running skirt over tights for practical reasons (mainly warmth) but I don't think it's helpful to view others' choices in this area as right vs wrong. Just different.\n\nI can’t fix your problem directly, but I wear running shorts over my tights for this purpose. Maybe give that a try?\n\n[removed]\n\nAlso gives an extra layer of protection against the cold wind for my sensitive parts\n\nJust run naked and smear on a healthy glob of Vaseline.\n\nI'll never get to running if I follow your instructions\n\nIt’ll look like your junk is being blurred for tv\n\nDoes the helicoptering increase speed or cause drag?\n\nI use a speedo. Provides a small bit of extra protection and reduces drag\n\nThis is exactly why I prefer to wear shorts over leggings in winter, not because of modesty or anything\n\nExactly that… I thought everyone does this? Running around on tights is like running around in your long underwear\n\nNope, I run in just tights when it’s cold enough and have done so for the last 10+ years.\n\nNah I just rock quarter tights I'm not self conscious\n\nI mean there's a nuance to this. I'm not self conscious and if someone sees little ol me I truly don't care, but a lot of people just don't want to see someone else's junk. I can respect that and throw a pair of running shorts on at no inconvenience to me and it helps others not feel uncomfortable. Win win.\n\nThis applies more to races/group runs. IDGAF on a training run by myself.\n\nI mean my whole cock isn't flopping around lol. I don't think I have some crazy bulge that makes people uncomfortable. But I like wearing half tights and I don't wanna put shorts over them. It's funny because when I ran in copenhagen literally every dude was wearing half tights, its what put me on to wearing them. But then back in America people make it weird.\n\nWe just love staring at dicks here.\n\n👁👄👁\n\nDoes it bother you to see some giant melons bulging out of someone else's chest? Maybe women should wear an oak barrel around their chesticles to minimize the horror for others?\n\nDo you have any idea how ridiculous that suggestion is? Oak barrels big enough to wear are like $500! And in this economy? Forget about it\n\nIt obviously wasn't cold enough for tights 😉\n\nPersonally I wear non-lined running shorts over my tights, but as a cyclist, I've just stopped caring. People have \"parts\". \n\nIf they haven't seen it before, they won't know what it is. If they have, they won't be impressed.\n\nI wear shorts over full tights for the extra wind protection on said genitals.  If it's cold enough to wear tights, I need it.\n\nConversely I wear half-tights during warmer weather without anything else and don't think twice about it.\n\nI wore shorts over my tights for years. But these days, I'm like \"seriously? If you want to look at my middle aged genital silhouette that's on you\"\n\nI never WANT to look, sometimes my eyes just go there. It's like batting away an intrusive thought. I ran xc and track in college and remember at races having to actively be like \"don't gaze down DO NOT do it.\"\n\nA bit similar as breasts then, right?\n\nI think so, yeah!\n\nSmaller and there is just one of them\n\nDon't act like you're not impressed\n\nYou’ve aged into being that guy.\n\nNot even “that guy”. Just aged is all\n\nI grew up watching [Slim Goodbody](https://live.staticflickr.com/3278/2357917286_3a8fa27f6d_z.jpg) so nothing phases me.\n\nThis, being both a runner and cyclist made me accept my body. If it's comfortable to wear for exercise then I think that's all that's important.\n\nPersonally, I just wear running tights or compression shorts and just enjoy my run. It sounds horrible but I know that there are far worse bodies out and about wearing lycra than me.\n\nYep, far worse. \n\nI got you covered.\n\nYes this post really just tells me dads should not be overly worried what their teenage daughters think about their father's bodies.\n\n&gt;Yes this post really just tells me ~~dads~~ people should not be overly worried what ~~their teenage daughters~~ other people think about their ~~father's~~ bodies.\n\nFTFY\n\nExactly right. When I first started cycling, I tried wearing the padded underwear with athletic shorts over them. Once I tried a real set of cycling tights, I realized what a mistake the padded underwear was.\n\nOnce I got comfortable being out in public in cycling shorts, I swapped to tights for running. No shorts overtop. So much more comfortable. I then swapped to tights for strength training as well. I'm never going back. Though I rarely strength train in public. \n\nNow it must be admitted that color choice is important. Some colors are much more revealing than others.\n\nChop it off fam no other way\n\nEmbrace the buldge, forget dignity, this is true running form.\n\nShe’s your 17 year old daughter so of course she’s going to have that response\n\nOf course they will show a bulge, if this isn’t something you personally are comfortable with then you can layer with shorts. But it’s widely accepted and known that if a person with an 🍆 is wearing running tights, there will be a bulge. My dad ran in the 80’s when the only shorts available seemed to be those  2” inseam shorts. Even as longer shorts came available he kept wearing those. I lived in a perpetual state of humiliation, knowing everyone in town knew my dad as the guy who ran every day down the main road in his short shorts. I lived, somehow. I am probably a stronger person for it.\n\nMy dad was actually buried in his short running shorts and a race Tee-shirt.\n\nwow what a legend\n\n‘Excuse me, do these effectively hide my thunder?’\n\nThere are dozens of us!\n\nOh, I know.  More than you'll...never...know\n\nIve made a huge mistake...\n\nOption 1: try wearing Saxx (pick one of the non-cotton ones) underneath.  I find these to be very bulge minimizing, and they do a great job of keeping everything in place while running\n\nOption 2: get some quality unlined shorts and wear them over top. This should give you better pocket options anyway.\n\nOption 3: wear the tights everywhere, around the house, into town, until your daughter literally dies from embarrassment. Then no one will tell you not to wear them anymore.\n\nI wear tights or compression shorts with a pair of very light, single layer normal shorts over the top so people can’t identify my bulge. Though only really relevant for anyone carrying both a telescope and a microscope around with them on the regular.\n\nI won a half last year and I gave a massive bulge in my podium picture lmao. No advice really other than compression shorts under loose fit shorts. Half tights will be quite revealing\n\nI would also be exited winning a half! 😜\n\nI don't have to worry about that. 😹\n\nIf you win a half, sport a half. \n\nNow imagine if you win the full next time…\n\nPictures?\n\nJust you WAIT until you hear about boobs !\n\nJust get black shorts/tights.  If people are looking at your crotch - well nobody is forcing them to. \n\nIt's ridiculous to wear shorts over them because you have genitals.\n\n[deleted]\n\nA little? There’s no need to attack me!\n\n&gt;It's ridiculous to wear shorts over them because you have genitals.\n\n  \nIf you seen a guy walking round in tiny sports boxers to do his weekly shop you'd think it was incredibly weird despite the fact women do it.\n\nI think there’s a difference between having form fitting clothing and hanging out your dangly bits with shorts too short. \n\nWhen I was a kid I was deeply shook I saw the tip of my BJJ professor’s dong hanging out of his shorts. One of the reasons I wanted to quit jiu-jitsu\n\nNever been to Palm Springs have you\n\nFor me, being out in the cold is both the problem and the solution.\n\nI knew this thread was going to be gold 😂\n\n Tip goes in the waistband. 😂 (From a post a few days ago.)\n\nFound it. https://www.reddit.com/r/SipsTea/s/xQNQcvpTrW\n\nI call that “12 o’clocking it”\n\nI used to wear shorts over my tights/half-tights. Now, I don't bother unless it is really cold (below freezing probably or close) then I used running shorts with the liner removed as a wind shield. I just don't give a F****, but I'm in my 50s, comes with the territory. Might be your tights are a little too tight?\n\nWho cares?  You should be worried if you look like a Ken doll. You would be flopping in running shorts i you aren't were some sort of lycra underwear. Are you running in them or just standing around after the race in them. It is what it is. Some will look, and some will look back. \n\nSide note: \n\nIn the 80s, my buddy would look me dead in the eye and ask if I wanted to go to the mall. I laughed as I knew what he was planning on wearing. At the time, a company called Body Glove was popular. He threw on some spandex shorts and a tank top and off we went. The stares he got were what we thought at the time classic juvenile 80s humor. Brian was a shower, not a grower.\n\nI have a pair of running tights with built in shorts that are described as being 'cafe friendly' \n\nMeaning folk don't have to be distracted by the outline of my old chap while they are having a coffee.\n\nDo they not have tables at the café? \n\nOr is your cock actually above the table?\n\nPATAGONIA ENDLESS RUN SHORTS!\n\nThey have an extra “modesty” panel of loose rip stop sewn across the front. They’re also just incredibly comfortable and have great rear and double leg pockets. Ran Rim2Rim in them last year and basically stopped wearing anything else. Read waist pocket maybe won’t fit larger phones but iPhone mini goes in and out wonderfully.\n\nI’ll just say congrats for having a 17 year old daughter that still wants to run with you! I’d run in a post box if mine still wanted to run with me! I’m a shorts over Lycra man myself, I always thought to myself nobody wants to see a man run looking like he is running out of Sainsbury’s with a plastic bag containing a few apples and a banana* \n\n\n\n\n* The fruit used above is used for illustrative purposes only, and in no way should be used as realistic real life expectations.\n\nBe proud. If you're too proud, you could also wear eye-catching shoes to draw the attention away.\n\nSolution is don’t have junk. For real it’s just part of it of the human body. Be one thing if you rocking short shorts and your twig and berries hanging out. \n\nIdk life long cyclist and runner. Used to it at this point.\n\nYour daughter is likely freaking out because she’s your daughter and she hates the thought of you, her father, being a human male. Don’t worry about it. As long as it isn’t gross or vulgar attire to go running in, don’t worry about it. People have genitals. Compressing them away too much or for too long is bad for them anyways.\n\nShorts over tights or running pants/joggers.\n\nJust curious, do you run to keep in shape for pole vaulting season?\n\nI'm just here for the comments. Wow. Did not disappoint. I love reddit!\n\nTuck and tape big fella\n\nYou and your daughter by now should realize you have a penis (I'm assuming here). There might be a bulge, and I guess she should learn to deal with it.\n\nDo you like running in the tights? I know I do.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people wear shorts over them, personally I just stopped giving a fuck.\n\ni js go naked mate\n\nWear shorts over them. \n\nI personally don’t care depending on the brand and tightness of your normal clothes it also shows when you wear shorts and sweat pants, even dress pants and jeans. \n\nMen literally have 3 appendages that stick out from our body and change size depending on the weather/temperature/arousal it’s impossible to hide it completely. \n\nIt’s normal 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\n Bro wear them proudly!\n\nChop it off. You've got a kid already so you obviously have no use for it anymore. It's fulfilled it's purpose, lose the extra weight so you can run faster.\n\ni’m looking for running pants that show a bulge even though there’s not much underneath\n\nDon't wear tights. 🤷🏻\n\nMen have outward genitals. People can get over it. I see boobs out and about not being hidden every day. I’ve gotten over it.\n\nHaving no bulge is equally embarrassing, really. \n\nIf you aren’t comfortable with your body parts being visible, put on a pair of shorts.\n\nAthletic underwear solves this problem for me. \n\nI really like these pants at Decathlon: [https://www.decathlon.ca/en/p/8882067/men-s-breathable-running-pants-dry-100](https://www.decathlon.ca/en/p/8882067/men-s-breathable-running-pants-dry-100)\n\nJust bough one pair to try, but am considering buyin maybe 4 more since they are dirt cheap.\n\nMost dudes in my running club wear summer running shorts over their tights.  I do as well when running with the club.  When I run solo I just wear the tights because at 6am the number of people I see on the streets is zero.\n\nI have a pronounced bulge.  My friends pick on me.  At this point I think it's fucking hilarious.\n\nWhy?  Because women run in sports bras only and no one freaks out.  So my bulges shows. I don't care!\n\nhttps://dumbrunner.com/gear-news/2017/2/17/man-walking-around-home-depot-in-tights-like-its-perfectly-normal\n\nI wear Lycra running shorts for support and to prevent chafing. They have a similar issue with the outline.\n\n*So I always wear regular shorts over the top for modesty reasons*\n\nTherefore my answer is \"wear proper running shorts over the top of your running tights\"\n\nI found that all running pants, even the \"modest\" ones, show a bulge. I'd suggest wearing a bigger shirt that may go over the bulge.\n\nRunning underwear and then tights over does me fine\n\nI have found that [Kapow Meggings](https://kapowmeggings.com/) to be the best thing for running, in all types of weather. There are shorts also. These are discrete enough to wear on a regular basis. I have found that there are very few companies that cater to men’s tights and leggings. Good luck.\n\nI have the other model so I don't know from personal experience, but I heard that once you go outside there is a cold activated mechanism that takes care of that automatically?\n\nHaha, this thread made me laugh...thanks...1st world problems...I run with tights ...there is nothing anatomically that will fix this...bar the hilarious suggested drastic solution...shorts over tights is the most sensible suggestion but I personally hate that...other option tell your 17 yo to get overherself ha!\n\nJust wear shorts over them, ain't nothing extra you need to do.\n\nYeah I just wear shorts over my running tights. Problem solved.\n\nLife long tights no shorts guy here. Longer shirts, fanny packs, and proper underwear will be your best friend on this journey.\n\n“My 17 year old daughter was flipping out because there was definitely a noticeable bulge up front.“\n\n…..ok then\n\nLots of people here suggesting you wear shorts over the tights, but have you considered a kilt instead? There are three immediate benefits: (1) You look more manly; (2) So much more ventilation! and (3) Your daughter orders you to go back to tights to save herself from the second-hand embarrassment.\n\nIf you wear black ones it's not as noticeable as other colours.\n\nWearing shorts over tights also has the advantage of reducing the probability of frostbite on your genitals. If you just wear tights, go for a run and get sweaty, and then walk home, if wind chill is below freezing, it can be quite miserable.\n\nI find that any spandex with a center seam looks horrible. You want a Y seam, which for my eyes looks normal enough where I can be in public comfortably.\n\nPop a pair of shorts on over the top of them.\n\n1. If you have a bulge, it will show. It's natural and should not matter.\n2. If it matters, wear a pair of shorts over the tights.\n3. I wore tights (½ or ¾) for a long time because it was the best solution to prevent my thighs rubbing against each other and cause chaffing. Now I have lost much weight and don't have that issue, so I stopped wearing them.\n\nBack in the day when I first started running I would wear some lightweight unlined shorts over my tights. That didn't last long. Now it's just tights over compression short liner (makes the tights last longer).\n\nFlex\n\nI just wear a pair of soccer or basketball shorts over mine. Masks the bulge, blocks the wind, adds pockets, and they're loose enough that the extra layer doesn't restrict my mobility.\n\nFull send your bulge my dude.\n\nAs a serious grower I always wanted a bigger budge tbh 😔\n\nI love that he's looking for gear recommendations and most replies are predictably \"just be ok with it.\"\n\nI do like the rec of light running shorts over the tights.  I had luck with a pair of Adidas soccer training pants way back, but I have athletic build so any kind of \"joggers\" are typically too tight around my calves and thighs.  At this point, if it's really cold and I still want to run, I'm just wearing Hanes cotton pants from Walmart.\n\nThese comments are hysterical. But to answer your question, I throw some unlined shorts over, or wear running pants that are near the fit of tight but have some give.\n\nTake a look at Tracksmith Session pants. Fit like a dream and I don’t have the same issue as I have with tights.\n\nSometimes I don’t care though. If it’s towards the end of the day and the sun is going down, or I’m trail running. I just don’t bother. Realized nobody really notices when I’m running past. But running into stores is a different story.\n\nOnce you get out in the cold, the turtle head will hide.\n\nWear a kilt over it.\n\nOnce you’re outside and running in the cold there’ll be no bulge to speak of.\n\nJust wear tight boxers and it should be fine. It’s not complicated.\n\nNo one is looking buddy\n\nYou can get cheap linerless shorts or cut out the liner with a little effort.  That should hide any remaining hint of gender. If leggings are really comfortable for you, then find a way to make it work in your head-space.\n\nPerhaps a pair running shorts over the leggings? Layers and all that in the cold weather\n\nDon’t worry a few km into your run the blood will be diverted elsewhere and the bulge will be less noticeable\n\nDo women know about shrinkage? Like when a man in the cold goes running… afterwards?\n\nJanji tights have extra fabric there to help suppress a bulge. I swear they had a name for it but can't find it on their site. Not sure how much it works as these are my first tights but I feel comfortable being out in public wearing them.\n\nTell her she wouldn’t exist without that bulge\n\nwhen it’s cold enough for me to want tights, I just throw my shorts on over top. maybe that looks weird but I don’t want my neighbours calling me stupid sexy Flanders\n\nJust wear running shorts over them\n\nDon’t tell boys what to wear, teach girls not to stare.\n\nAm I in the right subreddit?\n\nTry shorts over pants.\n\nI don’t know, when it’s cold enough, a bulge is a non issue for me. Maybe that’s just me?\n\nWhen I run at work with tights, I wear shorts over them. When I run from home, I just go and don’t care.\n\nThis is the price you pay for being such a stud.\n\nEmbrace the bulge.\n\nShorts ontop of tights\n\nProper response: \"Why are you looking?\"\n\nr/HumbleBrag\n\nYou’d think the cold weather would do the trick\n\nIs that a flashlight in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?\n\nFollowing this convo to try and figure out how much I can put myself on display without getting in trouble!\nLike, I don’t want to force anyone to look, but if they want to look I want them to really *see* ;)\n\ni always do shorts over tights, it keeps me warmer anyway.\n\nWearing running shorts over top of tights like this has worked well for me\n\nWear other shorts over the running shorts.\n\nMake it even more embarrasing by wearing men's thongs. I couldn't use boxers because of chafing, so I needed something else. Buy a tight one and it will choke your snake so much that you can say bye bye to any bulge"

    "all_comment_text": "My biggest mistake was not realizing that prehab was better than rehab. Putting time into mobility work, strength training, cross training, and core work has led to far less time off due to injuries.\n\nI am trying to figure this out. I am following the Nike Run Club half-marathon training guide. I have 5 runs a week, and I am reminded constantly in the program about the importance of treating my rest days as proper rest days. When am I supposed to mix in the strength training and core work? \n\nCore and mobility work, whenever (usually right after a run, or before if you're doing lunges, leg swings, etc.).  Heavy strength training -- the same day as a hard workout, but ideally at least a few hours later (e.g., morning run, evening strength)\n\nI do strength the night before track and long runs, so that the DOMS hasn't set in before the workout (if it's going to be a DOMS kinda week) and is nearly indistinguishable from the post-track or post-long run legs.\n\nWhat is DOMS\n\ndelayed onset muscle soreness\n\nDoes strength before a run not impact your run? I would've thought it would cause some muscle fatigue.\n\nAny recommendations for strength training when you don’t have access to a gym?\n\nSome adjustable dumbbells and YouTube vids do the trick for me. I really like Caroline Girvan for strength and Julia Reppel for mobility.\n\nsecond vote for julia reppel!  perfect concise routines\n\nThanks so much\n\nI like to do my strength training on same day as my runs, usually do them on the day of heavier runs to keep just the hard days hard and the easy days easy\n\nMakes sense. The rest days work for both the run and the strength training that way. Makes sense intellectually at least. My body is saying “you want to do what now?”  Haha. Thanks for the advice! \n\nHaha that's how I felt at first too. It doesn't work for everyone but if your schedule allows, doing them at least a few hours apart will have a massive difference vs trying to lift right after running\n\nYeah I’ve been leaning that direction as well. Did my 5 mile run Monday bc I try to do my longer/harder runs Monday and then immediately hopped off the treadmill - and ran through my dumbbell/core strength workout to just get it done. By the end of that - I’m straining to finish but I like the hurt and it’s an excellent way to kick off the work week. Rested Tuesday, 5k this am - and just trying to kill some time WFH until I can get up to the Y for a solid basketball workout. It’s crazy that I’m finally at a place where I’m craving these workouts like a madman.\n\nRun first, then lift.\n\nI’d rather lift in the morning and run in the afternoon.\n\nFluctuate as your schedule fits!\n\nI’m new to running and also training for my first half and consider myself to be in the same boat. Now try to imagine working 5 days of running in with 3 days of weights, 2 days of yoga, and 100 miles of road cycling/MTB. 😅  What seems to be working for me so far is running first thing in the morning, then if it’s a lift or yoga day I try to work those in late afternoon/early evening. Finding time to ride has been the hardest part for me. My legs are just perpetually sore now lol.\n\n5 runs a week? 😅\n\nYeah, haha it sounds like a lot. But they’re of varying difficulty. One of them is a 15-minute easy run. Another is a 30-40 minute easy run. Two speed runs and then one weekly long run. \n\n5 runs a week is not unusual for a distance training plan. Agree it is hard to fit in strength training too\n\nYou could probably do a strength session after your two speed work sessions and maybe a cross training (bike, for example) on one of your rest days . Mobility should be easy to do daily\n\nI’ll try to do 3 a week of 7 days, speedwork, lsd and recovery.\n\nLSD, that's interesting. Does dropping acid affect your training?\n\nYeah pushing down that lactic threshold really helps in my training, the acid gives me energy. Wait what?\n\n5 a week is fine honestly, I do the same. But I’m following 50 mile ultramarathon guide. 1 speed day a week or hill.\n\nI run 7-8x/week right now, distance training means lots of miles\n\n3 of my 4 rest days are my job, which can be pretty active/physical. So some weeks I need to slow it way down if work was too difficult.\n\nThis for me as well. Once I cross a certain weekly mileage threshold (35 miles a week for me),  I pretty reliably have gotten runner's knee the past few years when I wasn't doing strength training even when I was increasing mileage slowly. The first time it happened, I thought the problem was solved more or less and stopped doing it. The second time I saw a PT who recommended doing it year round for prevention.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNothing too elaborate, but I do more or less what my PT told me to do for the runner's knee 3x a week. I do 2 sets of 10 single leg deadlifts for each leg and 2 sets of 10 step downs where you stand with one leg on a book or a platform and try to tap the heel of your other foot down without losing your balance while keeping control of your knee that is on the platform. I also do 10x 3 second clamshells with a resistance band and 10x3 second bridges also with the resistance band. Then I do 2 sets of 10 squats and deadlifts with a kettlebell ( the PT recommended following with them after since the exercises with the bands will \"activate\" different muscles that I needed to strengthen for the knee problems). I also will do lateral band walks and monster walks with the band sometimes, but I do tend to drop those if I'm in a rush. \n\nI also do a bit of core work since Ive had problems with that in the past (the woes a desk job and having two kids back to back), but it is mostly planks and side planks as well as dead bugs. I also do leg raises from the side plank that they added to my routine after the knee pain started as well.\n\nIf I’m running 5 times a week where do I squeeze in strength training though?\n\nDude said one of his runs is 15 min. and another 30 min.  I'd say probably on those days?\n\nI’m running 5 times a week and toss strength training in when I have an easy or short run the next day. The first few times it can feel tough but after a while it’s not so bad. \nSo like for me I strength train on Wednesdays, easy Thursday (3 or 4 miles), then 5-6 miles on Friday etc etc. \n\nI run 6x a week (45-60 miles depending what I'm training for) and strength training 4-5x a week. I come home and do 30min a day after my runs during the week.\n\nAfter the run.  We aren't lifting to PR.  Lift after a hard session, preferably the day before a recovery day.\n\nIt's amazing that 20-25min 2x/week will prevent something that will require 30-45min 4-5x/week + potential PT costs to fix after the fact.\n\norange theory is great for this if you don’t want to plan your own workouts. speed work and strength training in one class\n\nI do OT and have swapped tread for bike. I try to make one of the lower body strength 50 classes each week. It’s a nice balance and the cross training has been beneficial.\n\ndefinitely second this. i have to incorporate other workouts outside of running for my body to keep up. when training for my half marathon, i had a severe hip pain 6 weeks out. i had to take a 2 week break, went to a physical therapist and focused on peloton and strength workouts. seemed like my body wasn't handling the mileage well as everything else felt left behind since my focus was just legs. I also wasn't stretching as much.\n\nfast forward to now, i started doing some speed workouts and this brought up again the hip pain. Im not used to speed workouts and i wasnt cross training. had to take about 8 days off since it was hard to walk. in those days i decided to do  hot yoga and easy/light 20-30min workouts i found on youtube. i now run soo much better and feel so up for it, my legs dont feel tight. i will definitely keep up with atleast 2 yoga sessions a week, it makes my body feels loose and light. \n\nadding other movements will definitely be good to ensure your body's physical state is well-balanced \n\nand ofc, sleep!\n\nThis is why I lift and never skip leg day.\n\n100% yes\n\nGet the Myrtl routine into your exercise habits is far less of a chore than going to PT 2 times a week and being off running and at best having to cross train for weeks/months\n\nWas about to post exactly the same. Tore my hamstring and that made me realize how important mobility is\n\nJust one?! I have a pretty lengthy list but think there is a tie for the top two biggest mistakes. 1)  not understanding that under fueling was impacting my ability to recover from harder runs and 2) being very stubborn about how many miles I needed to run on any given day. For example, if I wasn’t running a minimum of five miles, I literally thought there was no point to run at all\n\nAny recommendations/resources for fueling? I'm thinking this is something I need.\n\nFollow featherstone nutrition on Instagram (or read her site). Her whole focus is on proper fueling and she gives good advice. She also has a podcast but I've never listened to it.\n\nholleyfuelednutrition is another good ig account for this\n\nI think it takes some trial and error and ultimately will vary by individual, but for me I’ve seen the biggest change since significantly increasing my protein and healthy fat intake. I don’t track macros or anything, but instead just try to make sure I get at least some protein with every meal and snack. Doing so keeps me full for longer and speeds up my recovery after hard workouts. For example, I always used to eat a bowl of oats for breakfast right before my runs. Now, I still eat oats but I also add Greek yogurt for protein and nuts/nut butter for some healthy fats.\n\n[https://www.fleetfeet.com/blog/the-best-gels-for-every-type-of-runner](https://www.fleetfeet.com/blog/the-best-gels-for-every-type-of-runner)\n\n[https://www.fleetfeet.com/blog/what-to-eat-during-long-runs](https://www.fleetfeet.com/blog/what-to-eat-during-long-runs)\n\n[https://www.fleetfeet.com/blog/what-to-eat-before-running](https://www.fleetfeet.com/blog/what-to-eat-before-running)\n\n  \nIf I run in the morning my breakfast is a cup of coffee, packet of oatmeal with fresh fruit and cottage cheese mixed in- it's not the most beautiful bowl of food but I truly look at this as \"fuel\"\n\nIf I run in the evening, it's usually a non-caffeinated gel or applesauce pouch.  \n\nI always run with an emotional support water bottle (I feel like I shouldn't always need this but I live in the South so having water is reassuring I won't die during the summer and than in the cooler months I'm just used to it). Usually my water has an electrolyte stick mixed in.  If I'm doing a long run (over an hour) I will put a couple of goos and chews in my running belt (My favorite is Gu Salted Watermelon or their watermelon chews)\n\n  \nI've had a lot of trial and error to figure out works for me so take all your fueling as part of the learning curve.  There is no one size fits all\n\n&gt; For example, if I wasn't running a minimum of 5 miles I literally thought there was no point to run at all\n\nA LOT of experienced runners fall for this trap. I used to love the maintenance day off where I would just jog out a light 4-6km, then do my full stretching routine. The following day was an easy run, then I'd do my first of two workouts for the week the day after.\n\nAnother one as well, day before an important race, my routine was my warm-up routine. It eventually did come out to 5 miles when I was jogging in between reps, but it would be something like 4-6km of warm-up running, drills and 4-5x 200m at 5km pace with lots of time in between.\n\nLet's say you did a 20km run. How do you fuel for this before and after?\n\nDuring, gels/gummies/fruit every 30mins, water. Consider your body as a fuel tank u need to refuel before u run out.\nAfter u can use a recoveryshake.\n\n2-3 hours before I’ll eat some carbs (eg. 2 slices of toast with peanut butter). During I might have a gel or two but I also might not, depends on whether I want to finish strong. After I’ll aim to eat some small carbs immediately (a banana or a slice of toast) and a meal within the hour. \n\nI eat a lot of bread.\n\nI've been amazed how well it has worked for me to add small doubles (2-4 miles), including occasionally needing to split runs. Also adding longer warmups and cooldowns has been amazing.\n\nI'm one of those people where the first 4 miles almost always feels bad. So, throwing on a 2-3 mile warmup means that I am doing more of my primary workout in that \"I feel awesome\" space. Meanwhile, a longer cooldown takes me throw my post-workout EPOC as well as making it more likely that everything is loose and slowed down when I am done. (And then I am more likely to stretch.)\n\n1. Trying to run faster every single run. It just doesn’t work like that. Pick a goal, find a race and follow a plan.\n\n2. Increasing mileage too fast. Once you have a base you feel like you can make big increases but it leads to injuries. Slow increases, follow a plan. \n\n3. Not knowing about fuelling long runs. I thought you were just meant to feel like death for the second half, and even when I discovered gels, though they were just for race day. Thought you couldn’t eat real food on a run either.\n\nThis is something I’m guilty of. I tend to feel like I can increase mileage quickly when I have good days, so it’s helpful to know that slow, steady increases are better for avoiding injuries. I hadn’t thought much about fueling during long runs either. I treat it just like any other run of mine.\n\nI'm recently found out that fueling during and after long runs helps me recover faster and feel significantly better after the run. Definitely would recommend fueling not only for performance reasons, but for not feeling like death post run reasons.\n\nAlso on the steady increase in distance, I believe the usual recommendation is about 10% increase of total weekly volume per week. Then every third week, take a lower volume week and bounce back up to the 10% increase(from the pre-lower volume week numbers) for the next week. Or follow a running plan that has all this sorted out for you.\n\nI wish I had paid more attention to fueling immediately after my long runs. I'd get home, shower, take my time and eventually get breakfast. I'd get headaches later in the day, just feel so fatigued. I read about fueling within 30mins and then have your larger breakfast within 1-3hrs. I drink a recovery drink within 20mins then make a breakfast about hour or so later after I've gotten home and.showred. Huge difference in how I feel that day and the day after. I replenish the lost glycogen and the salt I lost sweating (I do drinky electrolytes during my runs too).\n\nThis happened to me after a marathon. Didn’t hydrate well enough, chugged the free beer and someone gave me theirs as well. I felt so ill an hour later! Never again. Electrolytes and foooood\n\nI just went through that in the last long runs.\n\nTwo weeks back I skipped breakfast after long run for diet reasons, and I felt lethargic and was unproductive for the next two days. Last week I did similar long run as the week before, but I made sure to fuel during the run and had a full breakfast after the run. The lethargic feeling went away after 2-3 hours and I was out doing 3 miles of leisure walk in the afternoon.\n\nThere's probably other factors involved, but that experience really drived home the importance of proper fueling.\n\nI hugely underestimated the amount of fuel needed for a marathon. \nMan, I used to think I was special and could do a whole race on a couple cups of water. Meanwhile my calves would seize up around 35 km and I'd have to walk to the finish.\n\nAny recommendations on fuelling long runs?\n\nThis is probably fairly individual so a big part of this advice is to work it out during training runs. \n\nThere is a certain tingly feeling in your body you can learn to recognise when you start to run out of juice, which I guess is when glycogen is getting low. I think of something Bilbo says in Lord of the rings about feeling “like not enough butter over too much bread” - this probably means you needed some fuel half an hour ago, so try to get ahead of it next time. \n\nThe basic rule I follow is to eat something on runs over 90 minutes; about 30g carb before every 45 minutes of exercise as a guideline. This can be a gel, a banana, a snickers, half a bagel, a can of sugary drink, whatever suits you best. Sometimes I just plan to pass a shop after every 5 miles and grab whatever sounds good to me at the time. If it works it becomes part of the ritual.\n\nPoints for working in a LOTR quote\n\nHonestly if we could relate more general advice to each other in Tolkien terms, I'd be happier\n\nAs would all of middle Earth!\n\nBilbo knows! Along those lines, recently read about using baby potatoes (cooked) as a quick nosh; easy to transport, bite-sized, decent carbs and sodium. Half a dozen in a baggie, definitely doable.\n\nDude, i love potatoes. I experimented with all sorts of food during training for a backyard ultra, but I never thought of that. Gonna give it  a shot this winter's trail running.\n\nGreat! It was Coach Lindsey Parry’s tip, and he knows a thing or two 🥔\n\nGel every 30-40 minutes. Find one you like. I alternate gu salted caramel and strawberry/banana. I do 40 minutes\n\nI just tried the salted caramel one for the first time this morning. It's definitely going into my rotation! ITS SOOOOO GOOD!!!\n\nFind GU so sticky. If you get it on your fingers it’s the worst.\n\nUse whatever you plan to use on race day. It allows you to get accustomed to the fuel so you don't have any bad reactions to it during race day as it's normal.\n\nGels, but gels get stuck in your troath so look for aquagels, they are more fluid. Easier to consume and digest.\n\nMy dentist also says they're so bad for your teeth as your increased breathing dries out your mouth so you don't have a coat of saliva to protect the enamel.\n\nYou're supposed to drink water with gels.\n\nJust brush your teeth after the run if youre that concerned\n\nI think the dentists point was if you're running for 2 to say 6 hours doing the ultra runs I was training for, the damage to the enamel is done during the run, not the plaque build up that can removed after. So yeah he mentioned giving your mouth a swill with water after eating a gummy.\n\nHoney!!!\n\nAs a beginner, I just got hit with #2. I’m so bummed to have done it to myself and can’t wait to go out once I’m healed.\n\n2 is so important. I have never been able to past 6.5km but i tried increasing it so fast and now im dealing with a narrowing space between joints due to overuse. Seeing pt currently and hopefully it will be helpful😭\n\nYour arthritis in your joints is probably not from increasing your running too fast or even overuse. More just a part of life/aging. Good luck, get stronger. -from a PT.\n\nReally? But im only 24 how can it happen like this right after i started running? I have been running for 6 months and this pain started appearing after i started running. I started running for 5ks within the first week and kept experiencing this pain on and off\n\nJust sitting out an injury guilty of 2 during marathon training 😢\n\n2) hit me hard. I got into a great routine, but got greedy and cranked my mileage up from 15-20 miles/wk to 30-35 miles/wk, causing achilles issues in both legs; I’m only like 90% recovered from these two years later.\n\nDon’t overtrain, man. Increase mileage gradually and give yourself adequate time to cool down/stretch and periods of rest.\n\nI’m tiptoeing into a half marathon training plan and one of my colleagues said the fueling thing as well. What’s you’re go to on when to know if you should be fueling? They said 45 min is the point they start to consider fueling. I kind of feel that’s a little early but I’m honestly not sure\n\nI answered this in another comment I think, but a rough guide is if it’s a 90+ min run you might think about having one gel or a simple snack at 45 min (and having something to eat before you go out as well). You don’t need it at 45 min but it takes a bit of time to get into your muscles. Your stomach doesn’t digest very well when all the blood is busy elsewhere\n\nI now know how important a good night’s sleep is to my recovery\n\nafter my long runs, i eat a good breakfast and take a nap lol.\n\nsaturday or sunday long run + stuff my face + nap is my favourite part of the week\n\nMaybe an unpopular take but I did almost all running at zone 2, all runs were nice and slow. And that's not a failing recipe by any means but not one that would allow me to improve. Doing intervals, speed work, tempos, they're necessary. Not for EVERY run but at least sometimes. My body needed to know how to push it when running on tired legs. Just doing zone 2 and increasing weekly mileage wasn't enough and I got mental burnout, varying the runs kept things interesting. \n\nAnd not putting in enough work on strength training, stretching, etc. It took me having a baby to realize how important that all is. I did pelvic floor therapy and thankfully didn't have real issues there, but I found out I had a massive strength imbalance between my legs. Like I could easily do strength reps with my left legs several times that I could barely do with my right. And there was the explanation for my chronic IT band syndrome that had popped up every couple of years.\n\nAnother mistake people make: easy runs are not easy enough. I just learned that my easy runs were too fast, and that was the reason I never had enough energy to do speed work.\n\nNot unpopular IMO. There's just this common misconception about running easy, because it's not sexy and doesn't achieve much on its own, but it's the foundation on which the rest lays. You say zone 2 wasn't enough for you, but look at it the other way: it allowed you to sustain the speedwork, and it is the combination of both that improved your times. Sometimes it's good to remember our beginner days, when even a couple miles was hell and conversational pace was pie in the sky... You have easy running to thank for not being there anymore!\n\nI abide by everything you said about strength training.\n\nAgreed. I'm not discounting zone 2 running, just that it being the only thing I ever did was not helpful. Definitely good as a base.\n\nI agree, I did heaps of z2 for my last marathon, pretty much all my long runs were z2, up to 3hr30. Decent monthly km, and some intervals, etc. in between. Felt fantastic at the starting line but blew up at 32km &amp; ran slower than my last marathon. I think I needed more of my long runs to be race pace, and/or negative splits. \n\nI'm starting to think z2 is only really good for people that have really high mileage &amp; would otherwise overload.\n\nI'm never in zone 2. Always 4.\n\nTrying to run through minor injuries and not taking an extra rest day when I needed it\n\nI, at 31, began running about 2 weeks ago, 3-4 times a week. But about a month ago, I ran for the first time. Unprepared, no warm up or stretch with the wrong type of shoes. So naturally, I hurt my foot. It took about 2 weeks to heal, and after reading lots of comments like yours, i waited until there was no pain at all to run again. \n\n2 weeks and about 7 run later. No pain again.\n\nGood, smart move.\n\nI use myself as an example. In 2019 I stepped up training after breaking the two hour mark in the half. I decided to up the intensity and on a run had to stop abruptly to not get his by a car that blew a stop sign, I tweaked my hamstring. Two days later “it didn’t hurt too bad” so I went for a run and less than a mile in it hurt so bad that I had to hop home on one leg. I ended up missing the entire spring including losing the sign up fees for a couple races.\n\nAn ankle sprain isn’t “just an ankle sprain” and therefore you can run through it. Treat it according to best practice and see a PT/physio if you are able.\n\nConsistency is key. Get out, do the miles.\n\nConsistency over motivation for sure! If I always waited til I want to go for a run, I would almost never go.\n\nThat run/walk is still running\n\nHeck yeah it is! I might do this forever, although my intervals have gotten a lot longer.\n\nHonestly, same! I love run walking, it keeps me mentally engaged and creates more variation in my runs. Sometimes the intervals are 10km, sometimes they are 100 meters. Come race day, I can always run up to half marathon distance at target speed without having to take walking breaks so I feel like it serves me very well for training.\n\nTook me over a decade to figure that out and learn to enjoy running lol\n\nFor many years, my idea of using running as aerobic exercise was to sprint at 80-100% in 30 second intervals and walk in between to recover. My logic was that effort = gains (coming from strength training background), and running slow continually was just a huge waste of time. \n\nOf course, this resulted in me not making much progressive aerobic improvements. It was probably beneficial to my V02 max, but I did a mix of sports that already taxed my anaerobic system. \n\nTo avoid this pitfall, focus on staying in zone 2 for most of your weekly mileage. My measure for is being able to breathe through my nose, and say short sentences.\n\nI share this experience. I would add that, because of this mindset, I associated running with pain and exhaustion. I have since come to the realization that running slow makes running a LOT more enjoyable and therefore sustainable.\n\nI've switched gears recently and moved to run/ walk/ run now that my distances are going up. Holy cow. A typical 6-7 miler would have my knees kinda hurting and some cramping. I decided to switch between 8min run/2min walk the other day. Not an ounce of pain upon conclusion and the next day. I'm moving to this method going forward.\n\nFunnily enough, I’ve actually learned this lesson when running and talking. I used to have trouble running for more than 5 minutes, then a friend joined me for a jog once and we went on for 15 minutes or so in a slow tempo. We were talking all along and at the end I still felt like I could do more laps.\n\nHit the gym or you'll end up side lined like me.\n\nIgnored strength training.  Don't ignore strength training.\n\nHappy cake day\n\nCan I ask what’s the importance of strength training in terms of running? And any examples of what you do?\n\nNot enough cross training. I gained 20 pounds of muscle via weightlifting and ive never been faster. At 47 yr old i still beat my best times from my 30s wether sprints , 10k, or 21k. And way less pain or over training injuries. Cardio should be paired with lifting and core training in order to improve performance and increase endurance.\n\nThanks to concerted effort on building leg strength, I just beat my high school 400m time, at age 51! (Though I was a wrestler and not a runner, so I had horrible running efficiency then, and I am never touching my college times again.)\n\nCool! Do you have any plans you'd suggest? There's a big variety of recommendations out there on the internets.\n\nI actually work directly with an in-person coach. She's the one doing all the reading and research and making adjustments to my plan for me.\n\nOverall, I've been doing repeats totaling \\~3.5 miles on every tuesday and long intervals totaling \\~8 miles every sunday with functional strength 4-5 days a week. (Plus easy runs, z3 runs, and long runs, all totaling up to a peak around 65 miles per week.) There has been a lot of variety to those runs though, like my long intervals have ranged from 10x1200m to 4x4mi and the repeats from 12x400m to various 400m-1600m pyramids.\n\nNot to run through pain. I've got a torn labrum that I might not have otherwise at 31yo.\n\nBeen there, had surgery to repair a torn labrum in my hip a few years back while running in recovery from a meniscus surgery. Don’t ignore it when the pain pops up, it’s usually a sign of worse to come\n\nPushing limits. There is a lot of literature in running. You can find studies for everything: fueling, hydration, shoes, pacing, rest, nutrition, increasing distance, time of day, rest and even sex before a race.  While it’s good to understand the information, they are also based on people, all of whom are different. We runners are not a one-size-fits-all group.  I have learned through experimentation what works best for me. For me, this has been one of the most rewarding parts of running; learning how my body works and responds to this sport.\n\nRunning alone isn't enough to balance out your muscles if there's an existing imbalance you'll unconsciously compensate for it and end up with an injury\n\n\nSo be sure to include regular lower body exercises; glutes, hips, calves, quads and hams\n\nThis. I have a muscle weakness on my right outer hip. My long back muscle on the left (forgot the name) went in to spasm occasionally, and then i got pain on my right knee. Regular stretching and increasing strength through clamshells etc have kept me pretty much injury free for years now\nEDIT: Outer hip, not thigh\n\nThe first is nutrition. I am 183cm and went from 82kg to 64kg in my first year. Wife said I looked like Jesus. Got injured twice. See a nutritionist if you need help here. I did. Being too thin will cause injuries. You gotta eat a lot more during and after. I’m at 72kg which has been working well for me. I have noticed the fitter I become the less I need to eat for the same mileage. \n\nSecond is you can’t just run. You have to do strengthening exercises or you’ll get injured   It has to be part of your routine. \n\nFinally it’s all about being consistent. Slow and steady builds. Getting faster and fitter takes a long time. If you are too cooked from the previous run and can’t do another then that’s an example of not being slow and consistent. Live for another day. \n\nLastly there gets to be a point where running an easy 10km is just really fun and you look forward to it. When that happens running is pure bliss. \n\n&gt;  there gets to be a point where running an easy 10km is just really fun and you look forward to it. When that happens running is pure bliss. \n\nyes!  such a good feeling being able to walk out the door on a whim and cruise around town at easy pace for an hour, it's like going for an afternoon stroll but you just get to see more sights\n\nLook at running on multiple surfaces, not everything has to be asphalt.\n\nI used to get all the injuries - calf strains, hip flexor pain and Achilles tendonitis. Now I only run every second day, and make sure to do 40 odd squats or lunges to warm up first. Haven't had a strain since.\n\nAchilles tendinitis... Oh the fun 😬😬😬\n\nKnowing to listen to my body. \n\nIt's not a big deal to stop when I hurt or when I'm out of breath. Not every run is a race. Walking a little bit, slowing down, or taking a day off can be far more beneficial than pushing though and injuring yourself.\n\nDon’t ignore sprint/speed workouts.  New distance runners tend to hyper focus on steadily increasing distance, and expect better endurance to be the sole factor in faster times.  In my experience, speed workouts (and strength training) play a major role in increasing mile pace.\n\nIf I had discovered compression socks earlier, it would've saved me so much suffering from shin splints. I also wish I had thought sooner of buying wide sized shoes\n\n1. Not getting proper sleep/nutrition as a younger person. I am amazed at how much these help me now as a 40+ yr old. Would have been a secret weapon in my late teens / early 20s to have understood these things!\n2. Not getting coaching to help improve speed at shorter distances or general efficiency. I did a shit ton of miles and did well, but I probably could have done much better with some support.\n\nMy biggest mistake was not getting myself in good shoes right away.\n\nThinking that more expensive gear makes you any better. It doesn’t. Just getting out there consistently is everything 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🦄😸👍\n\nThis summer I introduced myself to trail running and for the past couple months have run 75% trails and 25% road. \n\nDodging stumps and rocks and maintaining balance has helped my road running immensely and I’m way less sore after a long run thanks to using different muscle groups.\n\nBe real, take 2-3 days rest when needed. Youre not an elite runner. Running almost everyday is sickening especially when you have other lifestyle responsibilities. Treat running as an exercise, not everyrun should be PBs. \n\nOn Good weeks, run 4-5 times a week. Take alternate rest days. Dont be drawn into social media trends, running almost everyday.\n\nEat well &amp; hydrate, especially on days youre running. Dont go on diets, on a running day. I learned it the hard way and almost died. \n\nDont be intimidated by other people’s progress. Strava to track your own progress. Running is a slow journey, just chill and enjoy the Zone 2&amp;3.\n\nMost importantly Full body strength training, go to the gym &amp; lift. Dont let the muscles shrink.\n\nIn line with your first paragraph - don’t push your family and friends aside because you “have” to get a run in. They notice, and relationships suffer.\n\nI had a rough physical weekend at work and could barely hit my short mileages on my runs last week so I'm taking this week off with some cross-training today and tomorrow (coincided with crappy weather so that helps).\n\nMy rest days aren't always restful, and I prefer to be a little undertrained and healthy.\n\nSlowing down in training.  Repeats, tempos, hill intervals should be high intensity.  Recovery runs should be VERY slow.\n\nRunning 30km on a Saturday morning and then ran another 30km the next morning. Will never do 2 long runs on a weekend ever again.\n\nTrying to force some stupid running form because someone on Instagram told me the best runners land on the ball of their foot. Had me running like a weird elf and my shins could not handle the stark transition to elf-running. \n\nAs my time became limited due to work and family I dropped longer sessions and focused on speed work. I stayed fast, until I got injured.\n\nWould have kept my yoga up too if I had my time over.\n\nMy best tip: Don't take advice from Reddit. Except for mine. \n\nThere are no pitfalls. Pick a plan and stick to it (consistency is king).\n\nWhen you have questions, consult a runner you respect, and/or check the literature.\n\nJust gonna piggyback off of this. There is no universal way to do it, not even for a single person. I train majority low intensity now, which is maybe necessary being older, but definitely did not in the 90s when I set all of my PRs and was on a cross-country team that won two team state championships and produced two individual state champions running pretty much all-out every single workout. Even the 80/20 book's example of how *not* to do it is Emil Zatopek, arguably the greatest distance runner of all time whose PRs would be PRs for 99.99% of all runners who have ever lived.\n\nThere are runners who achieved great success without ever touching a weight.\n\nThere are runners who achieved great success on all conceivable diet strategy, including no strategy.\n\nThere are runners who achieved great success wearing every possible shoe, including no shoes.\n\nThere are people who set world records running through injury.\n\nThe only thing guaranteed to set you back is quitting. I lost interest my senior year of high school and dogged it, didn't run in college, and then didn't pick back up until I was 28. *That* set me back, a ton. I doubt I'll ever match the near 16 minute 5k and sub-2 minute 800 I set in high school now that I'm in my mid-40s, which is fine. I'm just trying to improve from where I am now. But I almost certainly could have if I'd actually run in my 20s. Quitting is the only true regret I'll ever have.\n\nOr join a running club\n\nGo easy on yourself, this sport is HARD. There's a reason why a lot of normal folks \"don't run\". You aren't going to go out there and start blasting out 80 mile weeks like these other people, they EARNED it.\n\nNow I am one of those people, but I should have been easier on myself to get here. Way too much self-defeating talk.\n\nNeeded to read this today. I felt sluggish during my run today and felt bad about only getting 2k in\n\nComing back with the same volume after a long period of not running. \n\nI was fairly fit and had just ran my fastest 5k and then rolled my ankle bad. Of course I took time off running but then when I returned I didn't take that into consideration really and ran a half marathon shortly after. Totally fucked my knee up for the last 2 years.\n\nAlso pro tip, if you are halfway through a race and feel legitimate pain - just stop. It will be slightly shameful but that's better than a long term injury!\n\nHahaha this one is so easy to come up with but so hard to do ... DO NOT RUN THROUGH INJURY.\n\nOne more time for the folks in the back: DO NOT RUN THROUGH INJURY.\n\nTook myself out of running for almost four years because I absolutely could not deal with the fact I had a sore hammy. Surely once I get warmed up it will be fine? No, it was not fine. It was messy and I'm lucky I was able to come back.\n\nAs an older, experienced runner, I now have the knowledge (and thankfully the means) to see a PT when there is a persistent issue. It has helped me stay healthy despite increasing my volume to a career high. Sometimes the PT says it's OK to run through an issue, and then I do so - carefully. But there is no pushing through the pain anymore. No one run is worth a career.\n\nI should have done more strength training. I did strength training in and off, but I should've done it even more. Last year, I bought my first kettlebell and got into kettlebelling and it was a revelation.\n\n1.  I underestimated the importance of total weekly volume while training for my first marathon.\n\nOnce I was succeeding on my longest runs, I thought I was getting where I needed to be and neglected my mid week runs.  Totally blew up at mile 22 on my first marathon.\n\n2.  On those long runs, I was pretty much at or near my marathon goal pace.  When I finally got my sub 4 hour marathon, my LSR were 90-120 seconds pwr mile slower than my goal pace.\n\nI have two. First is a major regret. I never trained adequately in the off season when in High School or College. I am sad for what could have been. Second, I did not learn until the last few years how to properly feed myself before runs/races. Particularly when I was competitive, I was so nervous I never ate enough. Now pushing 40 and training for marathons has taught me to eat correctly before, during, and after.\n\n1. You need protein after a run. Sugar will give you energy but it's not going to prepare you for the next run. If you get headaches at all or muscle aches that don't go away you are not eating enough protein. I found that I need to eat within 1h of a run.\n2. Hydrate before a run and during. Heat hugely affects hydration, so you may need no water for 10k in the winter, but water for 2k in the summer. Don't run feeling thirsty. \n3. Focus on distance not speed. People will say slow down but that they mean is don't run at maximum heart rate because you won't be able to run the next day. \n4. Don't worry about people's judgement. Focus on what makes the run best for you.\n5. Everyone runs differently and you will find you're better suited to different types of runs or different parts of runs, for example I found runs get easier the longer I run. I am slower at 5k. You'll find you may run hotter or colder than other people.\n6. Switch up your running routes. Running on concrete is not pleasant, trails are much easier on the body.\n7. Replace your shoes. Shoes get hard over time. This is serious!\n\nI found that after the short initial phase, when you go from zero to beginner, running is quite enjoyable. This is until you start setting yourself targets too ambitious. Then you will find motivation to push yourself and will enjoy the rewards, but you will forget how lovely a morning jog is.\n\nMy biggest mistake (which I repeated for years) was doing all my runs at high effort. You have to vary your workouts. Easy miles are important. Hard workouts are important. Hills are important. Do tempo runs, intervals, STRIDES, long runs, WEIGHT TRAINING and Core work is SUPER important! Variation &amp; weight training has made me faster, has made longer runs easier to sustain and most importantly it has kept me healthy. When I was running like an idiot, I'd have all sorts of aches and pains (shin splints, plantar issues, knee pain, groin). Now I'm much healthier and resilient. I don't want to say I wasted years because I still put in the miles and the work. But I definitely could have run so much smarter in the beginning. Good luck in your running journey.\n\nWeight lifting is your biggest friend. \n\n100% start lifting weights regularly on your off days.  I run 4 times a week and lift the other 3.  \n\nWeight training was a game changer for me.  No more injuries and everything else improved as well.  \n\nMake sure you get your protein intake in check as well - I try to eat at least 80% of my body weight in grams of protein a day to make the most of muscle gain and avoid muscle loss with high-mileage.\n\nDitch the metrics. I was too dependent on my watch at the beginning and constantly being aware of pace and distance led to running many of my easy runs too fast (ego) and a number of my tempo runs at the wrong effort for my condition on that day. I no longer use a watch at all for any workouts and I’ve learnt to tune the effort correctly to work the appropriate system for that run. The only time I’ll use my watch is if it’s a complicated series of repeats or if I’m aiming for a target pace workout closer to the race.\n\nThe quality of my running has increased and I’m getting far more value out of workouts, spending more time in the correct zones for far less pain.\n\nSpending all my time in zone 2, and not pushing faster or for longer distances. Don’t get me wrong, it helped build a great aerobic base, and it helped keep me essentially injury free. But it also meant minimal progress for about two years. I started running in 2020, and then I basically plateaued in 2021 through to most of 2023. My new PBs were coming rarely, and if and when they did come it was just a few seconds.\n\nIn late 2023 and early 2024, I started pushing myself harder more often, setting aside at least one or two runs a week to try to push my limits. I didn’t stop doing zone 2, but it was no longer 95% of what I did, more like 60%.  The result was two minutes off of my 5k and 10k PBs, and over seven minutes off of my half marathon PB. Also, my speed in zone 2 improved significantly; my cruising “easy to maintain zone 2” pace improved by over 20 seconds per km.\n\nyour level of fitness determines your workout paces, not the other way around\n\nTrust the process.  Running, like any aerobic endurance sport, is a long game and you can't really take shortcuts.  You *can* in short term spurts by unrealistically ramping high intensity workouts, but that's not sustainable and there's no way around the hard requirement of a polarized training plan with adequate sleep/recovery and fueling if you want to run fast for a long time.\n\nAlso, for an acute lesson learned: don't run through [injury] pain.  It's just stupid to think this is a logical thing to do.\n\nGo easy. Muscles and lungs recover fast but other systems like your joints take longer. Better to slowly progress than sit out for weeks or months during a block because you’re injured.\n\nMobility. Tightness can lead to imbalances, imbalances to injury, so it goes.\n\nFFS when you're done with your marathon training STOP EATING.  I did not learn and now I've got to work off a bunch of weight\n\nI started running in the late 1980s and the internet didn’t really exist, so I was winging it as far as training.  It wasn’t until I started following a plan in the early 2010s that I realized how much better I could have been back in the day.  I set most of my PRs in my 50s.  So following a plan made a huge difference for me.  Learning about nutrition would be a very close second.  I basically ate nothing during my first marathon in 1991, and now I’m downing a gel every 20 minutes.  Lol\n\nSlowing down and fueling better! I used to have a mental block/ego about pace, even for easy runs. I used to get abdominal cramping and would be wiped from runs. I run slower the vast majority of my runs and I fuel way better (like in a half marathon in my 20s I literally only had a piece of gum and one pack of gummies) and overall I just feel way better, both on my runs and afterwards.\n\n1. Not losing weight before beginning my training. Trying to lose weight and train intensly just doesnt mix well. I was always fatigued and my workouts suffered. I also struggled to actually lose weight bc i was always starving from all the calories burned and eating at a deficit. This just led to me binging and overeating.\n\n2. Thinking I would be fine if I just kept drinking acohol to the weekends as a cheat day. Drinking every weekend absolutely wrecked my recovery and really made me feel worse and worse as time went on.\n\nWaking up early to go on runs. Sleep is the number one most important thing not only in terms of recovery, but life in general. Find time elsewhere. Don't skimp on sleep.\n\nflowery history sleep yam connect tender offbeat squeal distinct fearless\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nMistakes are part of the process. Just learn from them. It is good to learn from other's mistakes, but bear in mind that every body is different. What worked well (or not) for someone else, may not be the same for you. \n\nSecondly, the human body is extremely adaptable. So any mistakes from the early days of running, can be corrected later on. In many ways, you could be better off by modifying and adapting, rather than trying to get it right from the get go. Adapting is a more natural process for the body than trying to do something that does not come naturally. \n\nThirdly, if you are a beginner, do not look at the experience of seasoned runners - rather get advice from 'older' beginners.   \n  \nThat said, it will be beneficial to know the mistakes of Running Form early on and correct them. By that I mean your body shape, foot strike pattern, arm movement, stride length etc. I say this because mistakes of Running Form can lead to injuries, which can demotivate beginners. All the best.\n\nNutrition. Specifically choosing enough of the right carbs in my diet and supplementing with enough electrolytes during longer duration efforts (90 min +). To a lesser degree I found that I don’t typically need to do any stretching. I do some foam rolling but a lot of my knee pain disappeared immediately when i stopped stretching.\n\nI'm not an experienced runner yet, but a lesson I quickly learned is to not overtrain. I injured my calf muscle and it took about a month to recover. Had to start again from zero. Set goals, define a structure, and a realistic limit to how much to run every time, so don't just jump from 30 mins to 120 mins like I did 😅\n\nCross training and stretching to stay healthy is better than more time running.\n\nI'm not an \"experienced\" runner but I'm not a beginner either.  The biggest mistake I noticed was trying to PR every run.  \n\nProcess makes the progress. \n\nAlso, training for anything is so much more than \"run run run\" joining a local training group (and showing up to said training group) was a game changer. \n\nYou do not need every piece of gear and you certainly don't need everything at once.  Finding what you like and shopping at stores that allow you to try and return is paramount (my local running shop has 60 days return policy)\n\nStay consistent and get out no matter the weather.\n\nWhen I was a new runner so many years ago I made the mistake of doing all my runs at a hard pace and never incorporating easy runs or adequate rest days.  That of course led to lots of problems with injuries.  The easy days are necessary to allow your body time to recover from the hard ones.\n\nDon't run injured and don't rush recovery.\n\nBuild your speed before trying to go far. I dove straight into ultras and as a result never developed good running economy. I’m currently going down in distance to try and improve my 5k and 10k times to improve my running economy at longer distances.\n\nUnability to run recovery runs really slow and short. It costed me pulled abductor, pain, money for rehab and missed marathon race :/\n\nNot doing core work and strength training until I'd lost months of running due to avoidable injuries.\n\n(Oh, and carrying on with the running once those injuries occurred.)\n\nRunning through or trying to \"sweat out\" an illness or cold or what have you. Taking a few extra days off that you maybe didn't HAVE to is not a big deal, long term. I'm certain I battled colds for 10+ days that I could've cleared in a couple of days if I'd just been smarter about it. Lots of medical advice out there will tell you that you \"can\" work out depending on your symptoms, but I think your workout is less productive, and using that energy to heal is the smart move.\n\nI increased mileage before getting better at lower mileage speed. Focus on 5K distance and become comfortable with that, then work yourself up. Could’ve prevented most of my injuries that way.\n\nNot a mistake in the beginning but some I’ve been making more recently due to laziness- \n\nStretching - Don’t underestimate the importance of stretching after you’ve completed a run/workout. I’ve come to practices the day after a workout feeling more recovered than my teammates because I’d take the time to do post run stretches. \n\nCore - this will help so much with your form. Try to do a one day on, one day off for workouts and go from there. It doesn’t have to be anything drastic, just choose two ten minute workouts to switch between.\n\nOvercomplication. Trying too many different training tips. But it was kind if motivating, though. \nAnd getting too small shoes.\n\nThe right type of footwear and form.\n\nThey always say get good running shoes if your going to run. Well, I had good running shoes. They just didn't work out for me. I ran my first marathon in Brooks Ghost shoes and had significant knee and hip pain. My original thought was I just needed to condition myself. I focused a lot of effort in developing my hip muscles, stetching, and working on running form (striking towards the front of my foot instead of my heel). Come to find out Brooks Ghost shoes have a horrendous heel drop on them at 12mm making form nearly impossible to correct. Come to find out, running shoe makers is almost a snake oil business where there's no actual science involved in half the shoes that are classified as \"running shoes\". I found that switching to Hoka running shoes, which have a 5mm heel drop, worked a lot better for me after I got used to the increased demand it seemed to put on my calf and quad muscles.\n\nDon’t get caught up with instagram influencers telling you how to run with “perfect form.” Yes, there are some bad habits you can develop… but for the most part, if you run consistently, within the limits of your fitness, you’ll be fine and happy. \n\nSource: In nearly 30 years of running, my only major injuries have occurred when I started trying to “midfoot strike” and change my natural cadence. Achilles and IT band problems plagued me for the last six years, and I recently did what I’ll call a “hard factory reset” — now I’m back to running pain-free (but slower). I lost years of training, thinking I was doing what I was “supposed to” to reduce injury.\n\nTrain when I was a kid instead of playing Halo.\n\nStrength training for proper form and injury prevention. You'll be faster and in less pain. Trust me (and likely other below) on this. Proper warm ups and cool downs make runs better as well.\n\nSlow down!  Not every run is supposed to be done to set a PR. Not sure how to slow down? Eat something before you go run, that should slow you down.\n\nToo much fast running. I almost always run slowly now and my rare times have improved tremendously. My personal experience is that intervals is for the pros and increasing easy milage is much safer and easier way to get better times and PBs.\n\n&gt;intervals is for the pros \n\nI've gotta disagree.\n\nSpeed work once a week can make a big difference in results. And, for me at least, helps keep running fun\n\nSeconded. I also believe most training plans make intervals seem too daunting for beginner runners.\n\nI do speedwork once a week, with sessions much lighter than most plans recommend, and still crushed my goals over the past year.\n\nTo be fair, training plans aim to cater for the most determined, so their approach makes sense, but when it comes to intervals, even a little goes a long way.\n\nI like to include at least one speed session a week, otherwise I feel like I struggle to get out of low gear if I only do easy miles. Not to mention the VO2 Max and Anaerobic benefits\n\nFirst of get some mileage/km’s, zone 2 is perfect, let your body get used to the endurance, respect rest days!\n\nMy biggest mistake was: lost my way twice in a short row and did to much km with little to no rest in between, resulting in a runnersknee. \n3weeks out and lost some speed. \nThere are so many ways u can hurt your body with running(knees, ankles, shins, heels, lowerback, etc.) so take it easy.\n\nNot running hard enough in training when running every other day.\n\nStart low and go slow\n\nWarm up , cool down , good stretch , PT and Massages are very important for longevity.\n\nI wish I did consistent hip strengthening and mobility work, back when I started hitting the gym in high school. \n\nStarted running at 20, now mid 30s. Would have been nice to not have to deal with the various issues\n\n1. Improvement is directional, don’t expect gains every week. Better to look at progress month over month or against a longer horizon training cycle.\n\n2. Don’t short yourself on fuel during a run if trying to decrease calorie intake. Fuel appropriately before/during/after your runs to perform well. Cut calories elsewhere in your day. Avoid major calorie deficits when training (&lt;20% daily) to perform well and avoid complications.\n\n3. Easy days easy, hard days hard. 80% of time/miles are not a hard workout.\n\n4. Ease into volume, listen to your body over your training plan/desires."

Still, it’s hilarious how obvious they were about everything, probably thinking people wouldn’t (couldn’t?) look any deeper than “oh it’s a different username, they won’t catch on.” 🙄😤\n\nLiterally all they needed was a VPN.\n\nEven then it’s sus, but at least it wouldn’t be so blatant. The IP was verified, and that same account/IP padded her wiki while also deleted accomplishments from others. \n\nSooooo transparent. 🙄\n\nThey were tracked down by IP address. If you use a VPN you can't trace it with everyday skills. The VPN gives you a different IP address so you look like you're from somewhere else. No IP confirmation then you can't prove it was them or some fan. I mean NSA might be able to locate the poster by other means but not some Wikipedia sleuth.\n\nThey used an old email address known to be Camille’s to set up the account. The IP address was just additional confirmation.\n\nIf a new account is created with an IP address that's connected to a VPN (these are generally known unless you're using a tiny one) and is doing the same thing a previous account was doing then it's not hard to put it together.\n\nIf you are using a VPN the whole time they can't put it together.\n\nShit most people don't even know what an IP address is. I remember a couple years ago in the drawing community this girl got called out for staking and harassing as well as making numerous alts pretending to bully herself. It was weird\n\nYeah. I saw it on the letsrun website. I was kinda surprised it wasn't in the running subreddit but I guess ultrarunning is its own niche\n\nI just wanna know how someone running and training as much as she does has time and energy for all this nonsense lol\n\nSpoiler alert: even if she runs 4 hours a day (which she doesn't), that leaves a lot of free time to stir shit up. Aside from some coaching, I doubt she has much else going on, especially with her husband as a personal assistant.\n\nI mean running 4 hours a day is a lot of time for the mind to play if that’s how you’re wired\n\nI’m ADHD. Without music I would have gone through every single phase of my life in my head after 4 hours\n\nYo fucking same\n\nUsername checks out\n\nI do this even *with* music lol\n\nTotally what I was thinking and why the hell is she insecure??\n\nWikipedia editing has a HUGE amount of paid consultants sanitizing people's profiles. Very common for public figures and governments to pay for people to soften articles, add new content to outweigh controversy or any number of editing tricks to help a client. \n\nSource: I did this for a couple years for some high net worth types\n\nHow did you get into that work? Did you start in traditional PR? Is this just a part of traditional PR and I'm naive?\n\nI wouldn't say it's the most common tactic, but you might be a little naive 😜\n\nI got into it by accident! Was working for international clients in the DC area and some of them had prominent scandals they wanted to push out of public consciousness. We can't delete the news, so the next best thing is create more positive or neutral news, and add things to the wiki page that allow us to shrink the amount of negative. Also included editing unrelated or adjacent pages to make the pathways and references work. \n\nI've done it for individuals and organizations, both government and private. I don't do it anymore though, always felt a little yucky. But was kinda fun\n\nHow much money u got paid?\n\nI was making $60k at that time, then eventually $70k. Not good enough money for the weird work and intense hours. My whole job wasn't Wikipedia though, I did other PR work for clients. That salary is typical of an agency, though!\n\nI would feel awful doing that. How much did they pay to sell out your moral values?\n\nNot much! I was very junior making about $60k until a promotion took me to 70. I had very controversial clients though and PR typically isn't as needed if you're a good guy. But I don't do that kinda work anymore\n\nI never really felt that awful about it tbh I felt weird maybe but literally everybody is manipulating their Wikipedia page with paid consultants, including the federal government 🤷 It's just the world we live in\n\nPeople will do all sorts of stuff to clean up their reputations. I know one guy who used to call in to the press using a fake name to get journalists to give him good coverage. He went so far as to give one of his kids the fake name so people would find info on him instead of his fake name!\n\nA lot of people in DC don't even use fake names! Very common for public figures to call a reporter with firsthand information, but they attribute it to \"a person close to the XYZ office/administration/etc.\"\n\nA lot of our news is based on access to these people\n\nLooks like her husband is trying to jump on the grenade and take the blame.  Anyone buying this?\n\n[https://marathonhandbook.com/camille-herrons-husband-takes-full-responsibility-wikipedia-controversy/](https://marathonhandbook.com/camille-herrons-husband-takes-full-responsibility-wikipedia-controversy/)\n\nNope, I don’t believe it for a second. She has a history of trash-talking opponents that match or beat her times, including (somehow) making sure the race results that beat hers aren’t ratified. If it’s her husband then she should’ve shut it down long ago but she didn’t, so IMO she’s just as complicit. \n\nHonestly though? It’s totally her. 💀\n\nShe was the one who gave \"evidence\" to Derek from MarathonInvestigations about Ashley Paulson cheating during her Badwater win (there was no evidence and it was a legit win).\n\nI remember that, and there were people on here who would not let it go.  That's just bad form\n\nWasn’t Ashley the one who had a crew member dressed exactly like her? Same color shoes, shorts, shirt, etc? I know Derek cleared her but the doppelgänger always seemed suspicious to me.\n\nHe doesn't have an image to maintain. She does. It makes sense he would jump on the sword.\n\nHowever she also has a history of this behavior by mocking rivals and questioning accomplishments. All of this Wikipedia stuff is consistent with her previous comments and actions, so no one will believe she didn't at least know about it\n\nHe's also not employed and therefore dependent on the income she makes. \n\nHe’s falling on his sword haha\n\nSo that she’ll continue to fall on his. A real Chad move.\n\nIs that a barney stinson reference\n\nIf any of you follow the NBA this is the same exact script that played out with former sixers GM Bryan Colangelo. He blamed his wife and never accepted any responsibility. It didn’t prevent him from getting fired.\n\nThe \"his collars are normal sized, find a new slant\" chapter still lives in my head rent free\n\nAnd the same with Roger Clemens in baseball claiming his wife used the growth hormone\n\nHis apology conveniently skirts over the stuff that was done to others pages and still tries to deflect blame and take the high ground.\n\nNot buying the \"she's innocent, it's all on me\" con from the husband....\n\nNot at all. Her husband is her biggest enabler. They also had their own distinct accounts. The LetsRun thread ripped it to shreds and pointed out inconsistencies.\n\nOooh do you have a link to the LR thread? 🍿\n\n[https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat\\_read.php?thread=13052953](https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=13052953)\n\nNope. Not buying it at all.\n\nI got this guys. I'm going to go CRUSH her in a race.\n\nReminds me of author Cait Corrain that created fake accounts to give herself rave reviews and tank the ratings of others.\n\nAnyone who has been paying attention has known that Camille has a long history of awful behavior. Sniping at other athletes, challenging their times, and constantly trying to say that she is the best ever. She's toxic and her husband is just as bad.\n\nStrava mentality\n\nFound her/her husband’s account!\n\nI've just seen that it has been reported she has lost her Sponsorship with LuLu Lemon over this\n\nIf you have been around her longer than 30 seconds, none of this is that surprising\n\nIf we can take one positive from this it is that the Dauwatermelon flavor of Tailwind endurance fuel is delicious.\n\nhaha, what a loser\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhile pretty ugly behavior, Unless races are invite only I didn't see why she should be banned from competing. \n\nI do see companies being more selective in whether or not they sponsor her. I think she's currently with Lulu lemon. her behavior good pretty against their female empowerment branding.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDefinitely not the greatest. Shes a talent on track and road, actual mountain trail she’s not as strong. Courtney has won UTMB , and 200mi races, and other major mountain ultras.\n\nOh man… I’m an idiot. I confused her for Courtney. I need another coffee…\n\nAll good :). Get that coffee going!\n\nI think what Lance Armstrong did was more egregious and more deserving of a lifetime ban.\n\n\nCamille and/or her husband being petty and updating Wikipedia pages? Sad, but not damaging to the community.\n\nSad and also damaging.\n\nThey should suspend her from events for a year or two. \n\n\nShe was affecting other people's ability to make a living\n\nAre accomplishments of wiki that important? If I created a page for myself and wrote I won a bunch of stuff, what prize do I win?\n\nI don't think it is for me or you, but for a professional probably any increase in noteriety, or decrease noteriety for the competition might help you get a sponsorship, or ambassadorship or edge them out of one.\n\nThis comment from the article about Lululemon dropping her made me cringe a bit. This sounds boring as hell:\n\nThe imbroglio has left much of the running community mystified. Herron, 42, has accomplished incredible feats in ultrarunning and has gotten plenty of publicity for them, including coverage in the New York Times and Washington Post as well as running-specific publications. She owns the 48-hour record, which she set in 2023 when she ran 270.5 miles around a 400-meter track in Bruce, Australia.\n\n[Lululemon Drops Camille Herron](https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a62390250/camille-herron-lululemon-wikipedia-scandal/)\n\nIve had talks via Twitter/X over the last several years with her.  She has always been pleasant and nice!   She has always made a point to answer any of my questions as I prepare for my 17th NYC marathon this Sunday.   I hope this doesn’t tarnish her amazing accomplishments!  Redemption is for everyone!\n\nSo she just posted to IG about this. Did something new happen?\n\nClearly Herron is being super petty and shouldn’t have done this (and I’m skeptical it was only her husband involved), but I still don’t like the sheer volume of hate she’s been getting. It’s possible for people to do bad things while still being a decent person overall.\n\nGood, even great, athlete - sure. Good person? Barely even debatable given her history of being petty about not allowing results that beat hers to even be ratified as well as trash-talking opponents. Plus have you heard her speak before? Very self-aggrandizing. Maybe in this sport you need that kind of ego, but something like this feels right up her alley.\n\nYeah, I think the context here is that she really is not a decent person overall...\n\nLmao\n\nHi Camille\n\nDecent people do not do bad things. Decent is not being bad as a minimum requirement.\n\nSo any decent person on this planet has never done a bad thing? Ever?? Wild take.\n\nA bad thing? Sure. A few bad things over a period of time, sure. Dozens of shitty statements AND actions over years. Nope. Not a decent human being and being Neurospicy is not an excuse.\n\nThe quote was “decent people do not do bad things.”\n\nMost people do a lot of neutral things, some good things, and some bad things. This isn’t even that bad in the big picture! More embarrassing than anything else.\n\nI mean, they really had to go out of their way to do this.  It's one thing to do something bad on accident, but it's another thing to make an elaborate plan to boost your public image while tearing down others.\n\nWikipedia was a neat experiment, but the idea that anyone takes it seriously is hilarious.\n\nI've never understood this take. \n\nLike I'd never go to wikipedia for information about an ongoing controversy for exactly this reason, but for 99+% of all topics it's probably the best source of information available. A bunch of nerds who are pedantically correcting each other about details is a great method of getting accurate information.\n\nAlso those nerds have to provide sources to back up what they are saying. Even if you don't trust a wikipedia entry itself, it's an excellent aggregator of reputable sources on any given topic. \n\nYou’re kidding right? I can go to the sources of most Wikipedia articles and have tons of great research done for me instantly.\n\nReally? I had no idea about it and somehow I was thinking that her latest medical findings would explain much of her way of being. But this is really not very nice. Shame!\n\nEdit: \"That's why I wrote \"was thinking\". I guess people did not understood what I meant. What she and her husband did is not ok, and morally destroyed any good that she might have done with her achievements. Being the best is also knowing and cheering when others beat you and make you try to be even better. She totally failed at that.\"\n\nBeing autistic doesn't excuse this type of unsportsmanlike behavior.\n\nThat's why I wrote \"was thinking\". I guess people did not understood what I meant. What she and her husband did is not ok, and morally destroyed any good that she might have done with her achievements. Being the best is also knowing and cheering when others beat you and make you try to be even better. She totally failed at that.\n\nWhat other medical finding were you thinking about?\n\nPeople don't get diagnosed as autistic in their forties. They do in their childhood. My sister is a therapist and hand outs out the dual ADHD/autistic diagnosis like candy - even to her own daughter. It's very in vogue right now and it detracts from actually autistic/adhd people. The dual diagnosis is often the marker of it being fraudulent or based on a therapist making someone want to go away or have a nice label.\n\nThey do, actually. Some never get diagnosed (esp people who are now 40+) bc it wasn't well understood and recognized during their childhood like it is now. I have known her for years, and since I met her I figured she is either private about her autism diagnosis, or had never been diagnosed. Saying it's \"in vogue\" to diagnose people is an ignorant and offensive comment. I was 43 when I was diagnosed with ADHD. Do I not actually have ADHD? (As you say.) Or, perhaps, I masked my behaviors and lived in a house with a clearly ADHD parent who was never diagnosed. So I assumed my weird quirks, lack of focus, constant need to go go go, and forgetfulness, was somewhat normal.\n\nYou are wayyyy, wayyy too uncritical. Your experience or nature has nothing to do with general trends in the non-science world of therapists, hucksters, and self-diagnosis - or even normal human existence."

    "all_comment_text": "The Wall seems like it’s described as an abstract, and makes me wonder if they’ve ever hit it. When I’m 20 miles into a marathon I went too fast in and my per mile pace jumps an extra 2:30, it’s not some insecurities that are bringing me down. It’s a complete lack of energy stores and overly fatigued muscles. Sure, the blerch is there running through all the scenarios that would happen if I dropped out, but the Wall is the real issue in the moment.\n\nDude that wrote/draw it has some serious insecurities. It started so nice and very quickly fell into bashing everything that he is not doing/interested in lol.\n\nI never understood why people have to shit on other people who are improving themselves.\n\nHoly hell, I used to love the oatmeal and he actually did help to inspire me to run way back in the day also. But rereading his stuff now, you are absolutely right.\n\nYeah it pretty much fell apart on the gym page\n\nI feel quite sorry for the guy. I am happy he found something that makes him happy, but that apparently led him directly to being a huge narcissist…\n\nWow. Part 4 is pretentious as fuck.\n\nIt has the same energy as that tweet from a while back that was mocked relentlessly: \" \"each large muscle on a bodybuilder represents a language he didn't learn, a poem he didn't read, a fun fact he never memorized\"\n\njesus christ you're right\n\nI lift heavy ass weights and I run a lot, so I guess that's not possible since I can only be a gym tanning crunch obsessed gym goer? \n\nwhat the fuck\n\nRight? And also what's wrong about wanting to look good? I lift weights to look good. I run as a hobby. I also do a shit ton of reading and writing, I'm a polyglot, I maintain a good job, etc.. I don't think it's a crime to spend a bit of my time to look good. \n\nGod forbid. I'm sure he doesn't ever comb his hair and he just wears clothes at random because god forbid he participate in vanity.\n\nBuilding strength in the gym makes you a better runner as well. It's not one or the other.\n\nMeanwhile the author literally suggests they got into running to lose weight. And the first part is all about not being fat. Such a fucking hypocrite.\n\nLosing weight could have been for health reasons and not aesthetic reasons.\n\nAs can going to the gym, but the assumption he makes is going to the gym and doing bicep curls is only about vanity. \n\nAnd that also gets proven false in any case by the beginning of part 4 where he clearly says he expected that he'd have many muscles to show off and attract ladies with. \n\nIt's also funny that he's criticising people for doing *crunches* and claiming they do nothing. Crunches are for building your core muscles, which yes, include your abs. There are health concerns with them, but honestly I'd be surprised if the general public or casual gymgoer is aware of those. I'm sure given his demeanor, he'd hold the same opinion on healthier core exercises as well. \n\nThis is of course again ignoring that, it's totally okay to do something for aesthetic reasons. It also ignores the self-expression that is inherent in doing basically anything. A healthy, fit, muscular body is serves as a vessel of one's values and lifestyles in the same way choosing to be unkempt, having bad hygiene, etc. convey values as well. We live in a society. Aesthetic has meaning.\n\nI was pointing out why the author was trying to lose weight and therefore is not a hypocrite, not why others might go to the gym. However, I see your point that others going to the gym for health reasons is equivalent to the author running for health reasons, and fully agree that there was an expectation of increasing aesthetic appeal so the author is in fact a hypocrite.\n\nHowever I agree with your last point but with a caveat. Aesthetics has meaning, but it shouldn't. The meaning of it only perpetuates when people say it has meaning. And finally, I would disagree with your implication that a healthy, fit, muscular body has only positive connotations. Just like you judge the unkempt person, I would judge this person as vain and excessively self interested.\n\nTbf I don’t think it was aimed at you. There are plenty of people who go to the gym purely to try to look good, not for strength or fitness. \n\nSo ? How is that bad ?\n\nThe Comic isn't being a dick to you, he's being a dick to a different group of people minding their own business and bothering no one while they enjoy their hobby.  \n\nIt's totally better.\n\nIt’s not it’s not like muscle knows the difference lol\n\nHey didn’t say it was. Just that he’s not the target of the shot.\n\nBut why is there a shot at all?\n\nWhy can't the author defend his position without attacking anyone?\n\nIt's bad because people are using excessive time and energy on a purely selfish pursuit, instead of a higher ideal like their community or society. Now I know people born and raised in the western world will find no issue with selfishness, and I admit there needs to be a healthy dose of selfishness for self preservation but...it's also the reason why climate change is a thing and trump is so popular.\n\nFor example, multiply the millions of gym goers who waste hundreds of KWhs operating treadmills and stationary bikes when they could go outside and run and bike without the energy cost.\n\nOr the millions of hours accumulated to the hundreds of man years that could be put towards more productive projects instead of building muscle, and you get the picture. But maybe you don't.\n\nYou've been trained to think you shouldn't feel ashamed of your choices, but if each decides to think only about themselves, the world goes down a dark path.\n\nThe twist - looking good from the gym is the result of strength and fitness \n\nIt's strange because all the positives that he gets from running that he listed - the sense of accomplishment, overcoming a seemingly unbeatable challenge, silencing inner voices... can also all be derived from lifting weights. We should be encouraging each other no matter what form of exercise we prefer, not putting others down.\n\nHahaha, yes that part threw me a little too. What's wrong with gym people? Heck, what's wrong with vanity? Finding strength and clarity through running is also a kind of vanity. \n\nI loved the comic, it's cute and not all that serious, but this part came off a little 'I don't do strength training so strength training bad'.\n\nI liked the introspective elements of the comic which explored how the author's mind worked while revealing his vulnerabilities.\n\nI did not like the snide attack on other people's chosen activities. It might have been more fitting for him to explore why he's so defensively offended by the thought that others might think he's motivated by vanity, rather than to pursue superiority by dragging others down.\n\nDeflecting insecurity with attempted humor that puts that insecurity right on display, a tale as old as time\n\n(Otherwise I do like this comic, the Blerch is real)\n\noof I remember being 14 years old and writing stuff like that. I also remember loving the oatmeal when I was 14. So extremely cringe\n\nAgree, but oatmeal is GOAT.\n\nI fell into a tanning bed once when I was 18, will I ever find true happiness?\n\nIt’s so over \n\nI remember reading this when it came out, and now I that I reread it I find it pretty cringe. I suppose that's what happens when you get older (and that's a good thing). The Godzilla portion in part 5 is still good though\n\nI read this book about a decade ago and didn’t think too much of it then. Reading it back now it looks awful holy crap this is something they should’ve left out. Gives a lot of “I’m not like other people” vibe\n\nPeople can lift, do crunches, hell even get into a tanning bed, etc. to feel good too. Even then there’s nothing wrong with wanting to do things to look good either. Pretty patronizing read unfortunately\n\nThis is also a reach but I think this sets a negative precedent on how a runner should look and can do way more harm for the sake of a lame joke\n\nI like how in his universe it’s possible to exercise to look good but somehow not be strong, the only virtuous outcome of exercising. Also nice humblebrag on the his legs.\n\nYikes. Yes it is. Also really poorly informed - lifting is more important for your long term health than any form of cardio (in terms of maintaining muscular and skeletal mass / strength / density). \n\nI actually got into running because of the gym. I originally started lifting in high school athletics, but continued doing it precisely because I wanted to look good. I always included some cardio, which led me to running. I ended up falling in love with it, and after many years of my fitness journey am now more of a runner than a lifter. \n\nI primarily run these days, but I still absolutely lift, drink protein shakes, and look pretty good with my shirt off for a 40 year old. Lifting is good for you, and is something that anyone who cares about their fitness should do.\n\nI run daily because I love it. I wish I could enjoy lifting but it hurts so I hate it.\n\nI think that’s a big part of why so many people take issue with this comic. One person’s running is another person’s lifting…the point is to find the thing that you enjoy doing and do it, because your body is made to move!! \n\nActing like one form of exercise is superior to another like this comic does is just an attempt to yuck someone else’s yum, and that’s a pretty immature thing to do.\n\nTotally agree. Pick something you will actually do because you enjoy it.\n\nThis comic depics a person with an eating disorder or a mental illness, who runs in order to avoid treating the root issue, and who, in order to defend his point of view, attacks other people.\n\nI wouldn't find inspiration in that, but to each their own.\n\nI like in section 6 where he says he runs to calm the noise in his head.  That's definitely a big win for me.\n\nWhat made me started running was a meme that showed a mammoth seeing human that said : \n-monkey with pointy sticks are not dangerous \nAnd then the mammoth with big eyes realized that he is going to die because \n-they can run forever without getting tired\n\nI think about this a lot. I love to tell my partner that I could totally, maybe, probably, hunt down a mammoth by now.\n\nThis is my first time seeing this comic and wow, never have I read something so profoundly relatable.  These are my exact reasons for running long distances, every single one of them.  Wow, just wow.\n\nI really wish I could participate in the Beat the Blerch run, but I’m doing my first 50 mile on that date!  I hope I too lose seven pounds and all my toenails.\n\nGood luck on your 50 miler. I can’t imagine that distance. I have only run 26.2\n\nThis guy clearly doesn’t know what hitting the wall means\n\nYeah Complete depletion of glycogen in the muscles isn’t a lack of motivation\n\nThis entire thing is absolute tripe. Especially part 4, Jesus\n\nThis makes me sad. I embrace the blerch as part of being human.\n\nI’ve always loved that comic. There’s also a run that was started by the guy who drew it. [Beat The Blerch](https://www.beattheblerch.com)\n\nIt’s a fabulous run if you can do it! Lots of fun\n\nWhere is this run?\n\nWashington\n\nThey have multiple distance options! It’s one of the most fun races I’ve dive and people are so supportive.\n\nI have to look into this\n\nUsually in September. To add to your info: in Carnation WA about 30 min outside Seattle. Course is out and back with a slow uphill grade (lots of flats) for the first half of whatever distance. Aid stations have typical run stuff but also cake and Nutella. The Blerch mascots are present (pillow people) and have been known to give sweaty hugs or chase you. You are in wine country so you can get accommodations   and take a wine tour, hike, or go back into Seattle.\n\nThis sounds so fun! And any race serving cake and Nutella is 👌\n\nThis! It’s so much fun - the absolute best time I’ve ever had at a run. I’m volunteering at a run next month and would do anything to get a Blerch suit for it, to see how many people recognize it!\n\nIt sucks that he is missing out on strength training. It can be really helpful to improve endurance and avoid injury. Also it’s fun. Idk why he assumes it’s for vanity \n\nI saw that posted elsewhere recently and loved it!  \n\nGood luck with your running. It's a little annoying to get back in shape, but so worth it! One of these days you will be too old, sick, or dead to run. Enjoy your health while you have it!\n\nMy mom and spouse made a Beat The Blerch poster for my fourth half marathon! I loved it, and they got some many comments from other runners too. I re-read this book every time I need to be more inspired. Yeah, the oatmeal can be a little uncouth sometimes, but I love his frank honesty\n\nI actually just started to get back into running and my first race I signed up for is the Beat the Blerch 10k!\n\nWell done for getting back into running, and the Blerch race is a perfect re-entry point. You’re going to love it!\n\nI loved the book!  \nIt's nothing scientific and just the author's beliefs.  \nWe all have felt the Blerch and the Wall.\n\nBTW his stats are elite. He is seasoned.\n\nI think about this comic all the time! It really stuck with me even though I first read it when I was rather young.\n\nFirst time seeing this. Rings quite true. Thanks for sharing.\n\nHe had a blog post about running an ultra on Mount Fuji.  That was the one that made me feel like it was for me.  He had a horrible experience, but I ignored that part.\n\nIm ngl, running with the wind, the anime, is what inspired me\n\nThis comic is what inspired me to start running as well. I’m doing the Beat The Blerch 5k alongside with the BtB marathon this September, first time there and I’m excited!\n\nYou're getting some downvotes I think because a marathon is only 42.2km, you can't have a 5k marathon. Sounds like you might be new to it so easy mistake to make, hope you come to love running as much as the rest of us &lt;3\n\nAs much as I hate it, this has become a thing (“5k marathons “). I have a colleague in the Philippines who showed me a flyer for a 6k marathon that she was signed up to run. So some race directors are using this terminology.\n\nIn fairness that might be a language thing. Marathon may have morphed into just a general term for a running race\n\n&gt;Beat The Blerch 5k marathon\n\nThe WHAT ?\n\nYeah!! Just outside Seattle in September I think, there’s a marathon (5k, 10k, half and full) for runners. Google it, the race happens in Carnation WA and it sounds super laid back and chill. Lol I guess there’s even donuts and other stuff for racers like couches and such along the route or in the waiting areas.\n\nETA: Folks, you REALLY should read the comic and research the race before downvoting, the couches and donuts are all part of the schtick of the race. If it’s not for you then just don’t go, but it sounds fun!\n\nOnce upon a time he held it in Seattle, and the cleanup pacer wore a blerch outfit.\n\nOmg I LOVE that!!!\n\nDon’t know why you’re getting downvoted. Yes, there are couches and plenty of cake! It’s absolutely the best experience I’ve had racing.\n\nIt sounds fun and doesn’t seem to take itself seriously at all. 😋\n\nThere’s one big tall built guy who takes it super seriously and shouts at everyone to run on the right. Every year. I just laugh and continue on.\n\nLoved it, thank you\n\nI think about that exact comic every time I run. Thanks for this share. Made my night.\n\nI'd forgotten about this and I so appreciate the reminder!\n\nThis is awesome! Thanks for sharing - I immediately forwarded it to my family, who are going to think I’m weird.\n\nI too like to speak hyperbolically. I don’t see him bashing anyone. Life is a study in contrasts.\n\nYou can outrun the Blerch. I believe in you. Set aside the time, make it a priority, and don’t forget to do your strength training and stretching to reduce injury (so you don’t need to take as many breaks).\n\nSee you at Beat the Blerch in September?!\n\nCool. I started sprinting from few days back because after morning prayer I took a short nap before college and had a dream where I was running at a high speed on an empty road in the middle of the night and then woke up refreshed.\n\nThank you for sharing this. Somehow I had never seen it.\n\nCheck out Exploding Kittens on Netflix, made by this artist. It’s pretty good!"

    "title": "Run Through the Suck – How it Took Me Six Years to Love Running",
    "body": "TLDR: Running, for me, is a positive feedback loop. The more I run, the more I want to run. This seemingly simple idea took me six years to realize.\n\nI never was an athletic kid. I was the nerdy kid who was picked last to join the gym team, the one who would beg the librarian to let them read inside instead of roving the playground. I always felt clumsy and awkward in my body, especially when puberty rolled around with a vengeance. I hated exercise, because I found it painful, sweaty, and uncomfortable, and I didn’t understand how anyone else *could* enjoy it.\n\nIn college, I first started to exercise out of a sense of dreary obligation to improve my health, paired with a feeling of inadequacy I felt when comparing myself to my athletic girlfriend, who was president of our university cycling and triathlon clubs. I googled the bare-minimum exercise guidelines––120 minutes of weekly cardio, and some strength training. Like a reluctant student, I half-tried to put these guidelines into practice. On good weeks, I grudgingly jogged a few times each week, with each run never longer than thirty minutes, plus doing a few weightlifting sets in my college gym. On bad weeks, I would exercise barely or not at all, then blame myself for what I perceived then as my laziness and lack of discipline (as opposed to understandable antipathy towards an activity I actively disliked). On my jogs, I’d alternate between uncomfortable running and self-hating walking, disliking it the entire time, my brain stuck on a loop: *I hate this. I should slow down to a walk. How many more minutes until it’s over?*\n\nMy attitude first shifted a little when I studied abroad in New Zealand. On weekends my friends and I would pile into my shitty, beloved rust bucket Saab and drive four hours across the island to embark on some of the country’s “Great Walks”–– long, varied hikes with stunning scenery straight out of a Lord of the Rings movie. My lifelong love of nature birthed a love of hiking. I craved the awe I felt surrounded by snowy mountaintops or deep fjords, and the sense of accomplishment and wellbeing and comradery that came with a long day’s hike. But I always thought of my hikes as adventure, not exercise. I certainly didn’t connect my New Zealand outings to the tedious weekly jogs I endured at home. So when I got back to the states, I returned to my awful, bare-minimum weekly runs. The next year, COVID hit, and my world shrank even further. I’d run-walk masked in bleak circles around my local park like a rat in a cage, never seeming to get any faster, never spontaneous enough to try a different route.\n\nWhen I was twenty-three, my father committed suicide, and my relationship to running began to change. Running became a form of therapy, a way to press down and experience my inner hurt. I felt numb a lot of the time, but when I ran hard, I felt something in between pain and pleasure. At least I felt *something*. The angrier or sadder or more frustrated I felt, the harder I ran. I ran hardest when I felt nothing at all. Sometimes my grief would literally chase me into my shoes and out the door. But though the way I felt about running had begun to change, I kept to my old routine––rarely more than thirty minutes, at most four times a week.\n\nWhen I turned 26, my girlfriend and I moved across the country, and I began running on the beach path near our house. I don’t know what catalyzed the change that came then. Maybe it was the beauty of the ocean shoreline, the bracing sea air, distant mountains that reminded me of New Zealand. Maybe it was the happy tourist families on the beach, the young rollerblading couples, the bare-chested firefighters at the volleyball nets, the neon sunsets. Maybe it was just a natural evolution that had been sleeping inside of me for a long while, preparing to awaken. But one day, a half hour run became an hourlong one. The next day, I ran for an hour again. These longer runs soon became my new default.\n\nOn these runs, the strangest thing happened. I’d spend the first fifteen minutes in my usual discomfort, sinking into my pace. Then, after forty minutes or so, I started to notice a change. I began to enjoy the way my body was feeling –– my legs moving easily and automatically, my breath regular and working, my head buzzing. The running became easier, less uncomfortable, more like a pleasurable mystery I wanted to chase down, a state I wanted to enter. At the end of my run, I’d want to run longer. \n\nOver the course of the past few months, I’ve slowly built up to twenty-mile weeks. My fitness has improved––now I can string together thirty or forty uninterrupted minutes of running, when before I could only manage a few minutes of fast jogging before I surrendered to a walk.  Last week, I ran my first ten-miler, meeting my girlfriend for oversized breakfast burritos at the farmer’s market after. It was slow––it took me two hours. But I saw a pack of dolphins. And the entire time, I enjoyed myself. During my long weekend runs, I listen to my favorite podcasts and let my thoughts wander. My hourlong weekday runs help me detach from the work I’ve done and ease into my evening. Even on the bad days, when I don’t enjoy my runs, or they stir up difficult feelings inside of me, I almost always feel better after––calmer, more steady, more “me”.\n\nNext week, I’ll run my first half marathon. I’ve even started weekly yoga. I am running less than many on this subreddit, but I am running more than I ever have before. I am slow, but I am faster than I’ve ever been.\n\nI did not ever know that running could make me happy. I never knew I could fall for a hobby I once detested.\n\nBut looking back now from the outside, it seems so simple. Few beginner pianists enjoy plunking out boring scales or struggling to sight read. New writers don’t enjoy struggling through the basics of plot mechanics or detangling simple grammar. Amateur chefs rarely savor their first few months of oversalting everything and burning basic dishes. To enjoy any hobby often requires a period of disliking it, and not being good at it. But instead of realizing that I might enjoy longer runs, I spent six years in the “suck” zone––plateauing at a level of activity where I could tell myself I’d achieved the bare minimum, without actually improving my aerobic fitness or pushing past my initial discomfort to arrive at a place where I could find joy in growing fitter and in the simple movement of my body.\n\nIt took me six years to realize something simple, so simple that I know others have written about it. For me, running is a positive feedback loop. The more I run, the more I want to run. And more than that, it’s a positive feedback loop with a threshold gate––I personally didn’t enjoy running at all, until I started running for longer than forty-five minutes at a stretch. Your mileage may vary. We are all different. But I hope you can (safely, sensibly, and slowly) push past the suck. Try dipping your toe in deeper waters. You may find an ocean awaits.",

    "all_comment_text": "Thank you for sharing your story. I’ve been running on and off for years and didn’t understand how other people enjoyed it or could go so far. This makes me want to keep going\n\ni've been on and off running too so I totally feel you on this. \n\nMy goal for almost a full year now has been to run for an hour nonstop. It's been a slow and frustrating journey, but I was making great progress until suddenly last weekend, i had a miserable 35 minute run (the last 5 mins felt like my legs were made of lead) and I was unmotivated to run. it absolutely sucked. \n\nit's so hard to get motivated. you gotta find your inspiration from wherever you can.\n\nProbably not the most fiscally responsible but I find buying new running shoes/ running attire motivates me. It also helps if you sign up for a race so you feel like you’re working towards something, and telling people you’re doing it so you don’t back out\n\nWhen I have a bad run day, I tell myself that runners know that a bad run day just makes the good run days feel better, and I feel proud of myself for not quitting. It’s a bit trite but it helps me\n\n[deleted]\n\nnot gonna lie, i cracked up hard when OP wrote, \"Then, after forty minutes or so, I started to notice a change...\" \n\nSo that's how long it takes to actually enjoy it. \n\nIn all seriousness, this was a great read. Thank you OP for sharing.\n\nYou're a good writer. Sorry about your dad.\n\nI love your comparison with pianists. Just today I had thoughts of giving up, feeling like I wasn't meant to be a \nrunner.  Dealing with injury after injury, like maybe my body is just not built for this. But you're right - - it takes years and years of patience and dedication, with a lot of struggle in between, to get good at something. Thanks for this!\n\nYou’re an incredible writer and as someone who enjoys good writing (and writing as a hobby) I thoroughly enjoyed this piece. I related very heavily to so many aspects, starting from being the kid in gym class who was picked last and could not fathom how people could enjoy exercise for fun. In college I also began to do the “self loathing” type of runs—running because I thought I *should*, and similar to you, not ever more than 30-40 mins, and always doing the awkward dance of running uncomfortably hard and then stopping and walking for portions due to the suck. Then, as 23, I also discovered my love of the outdoors through taking up rock climbing and getting more into hiking and it forced me to be outside a lot more and learn to love being on my feet and learn how to “get comfortable being uncomfortable”. As I dipped my toes in rock climbing, hiking, fastpacking, and weightlifting to train for climbing more, I also did weekly 4-5 mile treadmill runs to keep up with my cardio fitness for climbing and hiking, but I never fully enjoyed running even then. \n\nIt wasn’t until age 26 that I just… began to run more. Signed up for my first half and did it with a surprisingly faster time than I imagined I would (btw welcome to the gateway drug that is signing up for races!). Then I signed up for a 50 mile ultramarathon which I trained HEAVILY for, but still DNFed due to poor air quality conditions. But the training block made me love running. Forcing myself out to run for hours at a time forced me to confront demons, become at peace with my own thoughts, and empty my head and shed my fears out through sweat on the sidewalk or trails as well… and honestly I don’t remember the one single run that “clicked” for me either. Like you also stated, I just sort of melted into it at some point and started to fall in love with how I felt on runs. \n\nAnyways I simply wanted to share my similarities because it was almost shocking to read someone’s story that aligned SO closely with my journey as well! Enjoy the process and journey and continue to embrace the awesome feeling of getting comfortable being uncomfortable…. A LOT haha :)\n\nI relate a whole lot to this, too! I was not the athletic kid, I was the little nerdy girl who always came in last. In college I started doing some running for health, but not a ton. It was never fun or comfortable. Somewhere along the way I realized it helped my mental state a lot, too. Even so, it took a long time to enjoy the flow and not have it feel like suck \\*while\\* I was actually on a run. I'm 40 now, running just under 20 mile weeks and faster than I've ever been.\n\nthe fact that this story of being the \"nerdy\" or \"unathletic\" person in school is so common (i've seen at least two other people say this, plus OP and myself) really just goes to show you how poorly PE class was taught when we were all younger\n\nLooking back, PE honestly felt like fucking hazing sometimes, and i think the negativity of those experiences gave me a lifelong disdain for exercise\n\nreally wasn't until I started doing it on my own when I started to hate it less (don't get me wrong, i still hate it...but even little progress is still progress)\n\nSo much emphasis on group sports and being good at them rather than as a life skill, yeah, that I just don't get. For me, part of it is I was just always more introverted, academically inclined (nerdy) and incredibly short, and that just doesn't translate well to most group sports, even if I'd trained well. And my elementary school PE teacher was absolutely \\*not\\* sympathetic if we were made to run around the field and I complained that my legs were shorter than everyone else's. But something like ice skating, that I could actually do and liked. Took those lessons on my own time though, of course.\n\nI was always very fast as a child…but I HATED running long distances or for long periods.  A few years ago I forced myself to start running because I wanted to be healthier for my children.  At first, a mile was brutal.  But now I run about 5 miles a day and crave doing so.  It’s funny how things can change if you put in the work!\n\nVery nicely written, your story resonated with my a bit. My whole life I have hated running, but I haven't tried nearly as much as you. I would try to run 1 time every few years and just give up. But, I loved lifting, climbing, hiking... So I always kept relatively fit. \n\n\nRecently, I twisted my ankle and I had to stay at home for 1-2 weeks, then I realized that I want to go running. After my ankle healed, I went running and I enjoyed it for the first time. It was a mix of me being fit enough to run through 5K on my first time and also my friend's advice to keep it really really slow. It's been 4 months and I am just running more and more.\n\nThat moment when, as a formerly unfit or fat kid, your body and heart start conditioning and it becomes enjoyable....\n\n\n... And then you have the furious realization that it ACTUALLY WAS EASIER for everyone else to run the mile, play tag, run away from/catch up to people, hang onto the rope, or play sports. It didn't hurt them in the same way, they weren't gasping for air at 100% effort in the first five minutes like you were.\n\n\nIt's not just a fixed distance/time bias either. As you get fitter you can literally sustain 100% effort for longer and recover faster to hit it again, there's no way to equalize it.\n\n\nIt's a weird reckoning, and I swing wildly between being awestruck that I was always capable of feeling this way about moving my body, grateful that I discovered it before my 40s, and bitter about the odd \"privilege\" that fitter people grew up with that don't understand the experience of being unfit and the qualia of exercise as real pain, not just strenuous effort.\n\nThis is beautifully written. Many of us are running from something, or perhaps towards something. When you find that middle ground where you can ‘just be’ running, it’s really something special. \n\nI appreciate this post. Running can be a very spiritual &amp; meditative activity that allows you to experience a wide array of feelings and emotions (physical and mental). You get it. Maybe it took you awhile but you get it. I gently try to spread running to friends and family but although some have dabbled in it...sadly not one person has stuck to it. Keep running!\n\nThis is lovely written\n\nI started running recently and it’s been super hard. Funnily enough, I’m also going to nz in a few months for studying and this has inspired me. Thanks for sharing!\n\nThanks for telling us your journey! I'm just coming back from a shitty run session and reading this as a newbie feels reassuring.\n\nI loved reading this. Thanks for sharing your experience!!\n\nThis is beautifully written. Thank you for sharing 🫶\n\nReading your story, that’s what it’s all about.  I started at 57 to run with my teen daughter and I just kept on running.  I’m slow, don’t cross train like I should, but I enjoy it and the benefits of it.  Now 63, yes, I suffer the first mile, but what is my alternative?  Quit and rot, or double down and work on improvement?  I chose to keep pushing.  Very inspirational and well written, sorry about your dad.\n\nWhat a fantastic read. Thanks for sharing! Whilst our stories are different - mine is nowhere near as 'exciting' (positive and negatively speaking) as yours I can relate to it on so many levels.\n\nHonestly for me with any exercise it only takes until I get my form down (be it weights, cycling or running) to enjoy it. With running it was an escape from work and being inside the house (work from home so there way too much) and listen to music that I normally only do during car rides. And just getting some sun, fresh air and a nice slow tan (wear sunscreen but obviously over time you will still tan).\n\nYou are an excellent writer. I almost skipped this and I’m glad I didn’t!  I’m with you:not fast nor far but we are out there. Just enjoying the run.\n\nVery similar trajectory for me, been running off an on for several years now bit I only realized this year that once I've been out for about 30 minutes I start feeling good, once I hit 40 I even start enjoying myself. I get bored around 60 right now though so I guess I still have some work to do lol\n\nThank you, beautifully written\n\nSo hey, that moment when movement finally \"clicks\" is totally what exercise is all about! We've all been there - awkwardly focusing on individual limbs until suddenly your core takes over and everything flows naturally. I've experienced this exact threshold myself, where practice transforms from conscious effort into something that actually feels good. Your body is literally leveling up from mechanical movements to proper integrated flow - keep crushing it!"

    "all_comment_text": "71 here and still run almost every day.  If you run long enough you will reach a point where there isn’t much difference between “all out” and “fun run”.  On the plus side, I won my last 5K because I was the only entry in my age group.  I like to think that being a survivor is more important than speed at my age.\n\nM66 here. Four decades+ and still going “all out” which, as you rightly say, about the same as “fun run.” But like you, I am now winning a lot of races as I’m often the only person in the 60+ age group. Got some race winnings gift cards burning a hole in my pocket right now. Training now for a Nov 23 Half—with dozens in my past. I can’t believe how fast the “slow me” at age 32 could finish those things! ‘-)\n\nMy Half times have decreased by five minutes each year since 2016, but my love for the sport has never diminished. \n\nUsing the Garmin coach plans has really been fun and helpful, too. I love the tech on my Fenix watch.\n\nThat is exactly my strategy. I know for a fact that I am not getting any podiums now or in the near future but if I play my cards right (consistency) I will 30 years later.\n\nIn my first Ironman I was competing (in my head) against the 70+ category while in my early forties. I didn’t win the category…\n\nAre you using Garmin coach plans to reach new time goals?\n\nYes. I can’t quite live up to the “race predictor” feature, but I like that it uses my actual numbers (HR, sleep, HRV, etc.) to customize the workouts. I find the interval days to be refreshingly strenuous, and it keeps me honest with those easy and longer mileage days. And it asks me to do the hardest workout of all:  Taking rest days. I think it’s a good tool and wish I’d had it a few decades ago.\n\nHave to agree. I’m 42 and just getting into running. Using the Garmin Coach for a 10K in Nov and it’s been great. I’ve tried to be a runner a few times over the years but would end up hating it. I would just run hard and had constant shin splints and calf pain. So I stuck to all the other sports I did where running was just a part of it. But I got all geared up hoping I’d get a London Marathon spot through work, that even after I didn’t get it I figured I’d pick a race and start the journey anyway. Using Coach Amy’s 10 K plan has been great. It keeps me in check. I just need to get better at balancing running with tennis/padel. All high impact sports.\n\nI'm confused about conflating fun run with all out. Can someone explain to me I am dumb\n\nI’m taking it as they’re not very fast anymore and they run how they feel that da, therefore, fast is as fast as a fun run. So, not fast lol\n\nI thought it was implying they don't have the ability to go all out even if they desired to, for health reasons\n\nGreat job taking care of yourself! What does Garmin say your fitness age is?\n\n58 and VO2max of 45. Thanks!\n\nMy mom always gets something in her age group (80s).  That is even though she walks some of it depending on the distance.\n\nI love this!\n\nSlightly younger here but you’re right. I just start running and if I feel fast, I run fast. If I’m sucking wind, well, it’s just going to be another one those runs.\n\nYou’re an inspiration.\n\nBeware an old man in a young man's profession\n\nThis is my plan also. Except there are several people in my club in my age bracket who are very very fast. So I may have to resort to sabotage if they keep it up 👀😈\n\nInspiring longevity in sport :)\n\n&gt; I like to think that being a survivor is more important than speed at my age.\n\n\nOnly mid 30s here and already adopting this sentiment.\n\n\nHave a neighbor who's constantly going all out with his training. Don't get me wrong, he's fast as fuck. But he's constantly fighting injuries. Just not worth it anymore imo. I'm going for the long haul.\n\nBetween age 52 and 60 I trained hard and ran all out at least once per year, trying to BQ and PR.  At 60 I ran Boston as a celebration of my 20th marathon, my birthday and retirement.  At this point I realized all my goals had been accomplished and I'd never beat my 3:32 PR.  Between 60-67 I still raced hard, and ran more mileage than before, about 2800 mpy, but I dropped most of my intervals and speed work.  Since then, after 35 marathons and 2 ultras, arthritis has limited my ability to run long and race.  I'm (age 73) now satisfied running 8 miles most mornings at an easy pace.  Next spring, however, I'm hoping to run a 5K with my 12 year old grandson if he will agree to slow down and pace me.\n\n8 miles most mornings at 73…hell yes! I hope to be able to still do that at your age. God bless ya!\n\nThat’s a lovely thought with your grandson. Hope you enjoy it!\n\nAmazing, just amazing\n\nOut of curiosity what is your pace for your daily 8 miler? Probably faster than my sprint speed 🤣\n\nNormally 10:00-10:30, but every now and again I’ll bust out a 9:00. The next day my right knee will remind me why I’m not racing any more.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThank you for your kind words to an old runner.  It is my wish for you that 49 years from now, you will be able to look back at 50 years of running and are able to say that you love this sport as much as I do.  All the best to you.\n\nHoly hell. I'm sure you get this a lot, but what's the secret?\n\nI’m sorry, the secret to what?\n\nBeing so healthy, capable, and I presume looking years younger than your age at 73.\n\nRunning is as much a part of my daily life as eating meals and sleeping.  I don't just run when I have the time, I run every day except for rest days.  I believe daily exercise (it need not be running) keeps a person healthier than one who doesn't exercise, both physically and mentally.  There isn't really a secret; it's a decision and a matter of priorities.  I don't know about looking younger, but my wife says she has four kids and I swear we have only three.\n\nI'll forever remember you, Silly-Resist8306! The guy who puts easy 8 miles in the morning.\n\nI'm in my 50's and every race I tell myself (and anyone who still listens to me) that I am going to \"take it easy\" and enjoy the race without worrying about my time or finishing position. Then the race starts and instantly I'm already looking around to see who else might be in my age group and whether I can stay ahead of them or catch up and pass them. Every time!\n\nAhahahah same. I have done so many “fun” runs at my absolute fastest pace. Can’t help it!\n\nHahahaha 49F here and SAME!! “I’ll just go easy” and then I start passing people who look like they’re in my AG, and the thoughts start coming: “what if I’m in 4th place? Don’t slow down!!” Never fails.\n\nI keep looking at the 50-5x results of my races to see how I’ll fare next year against my competition, and if my time is podium-worthy. I started training with regularity 10 years ago (triathlon) and I’m absolutely hooked.\n\nThe best birthdays are when you go up an age division 😂\n\nYou just got me looking forward to 50 😬😂\n\nFor real!!! I can’t even express how excited I am 😂\n\nAbout to turn 49 and have been hatching plans for a Boston qualifier. I think my 50th year is my best chance, so I basically have 2 years.\n\nHelp me stop... please... I want to stop doing that.\n\nThis is me!\n\nHahah this is me exactly.\n\nExactly this :)  I'm 52 and should know better\n\nI’m 56 and do not consider myself an “older runner”, LOL…\n\nI didn’t start running until I was 44. My best year for pace was 2019. I finally hit my goal of a sub 2 hour half marathon, and PR’d a marathon at 4:15.\n\nThen in 2020, with the pandemic, races all got canceled, my run groups that I trained with all got suspended, and I did a lot of short runs, put on a few lbs.\n\nIn 2021 I made an effort to get back on track, but I’m just not the same. So I still do 4 or 5 half marathons a year (more like a 2:30 finish) and 1 or 2 marathons (5 hr to 5:39 finish). \n\nI let go of caring about pace. I just do it for the experience. Do a half I’ve enjoyed before or a new one that looks interesting. I’ve done the NYC marathon the last two years and I’m doing it again next month.\n\nMarathons are the hardest thing I’ve done physically and they aren’t getting any easier. I enjoy the discipline of marathon training. But I just want to finish now and have some fun.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAt 40, been running for a long time and I don't care anymore as long as I finish under 3:00:00 lol. Just wrapped up a beach half at 2:38 and I'd like to stay in that area.\n\nThe thing doctors will tell you is shoes, stretching, and recovery becomes way more important. I can't emphasize enough to go see a PT you like (find one!) and pay cash for a few sessions of stretch coaching, it will last you a lifetime. I'm on the bigger end (6'4, 272 lbs) so I'm slower and my joints hurt.\n\nI was sedentary and out of shape until I hit 49.  52 now.  Everything seems new and my body is capable of so much more than I ever thought.  I definitely don't feel like an older runner.  I did one marathon and barely survived it (5:12 time).  Not sure I'll do another but the shorter distances are still fun and require a lot less training.\n\nA very encouraging and reassuring post. Have enjoyed reading the entries.\n\nI think this is one of the greatest things about running - it can be so many different things for different people, and all of them are wonderful and valid. There's something for the competitor and the happy go lucky runner at every level.\n\nI’m in my early 40s. I stopped going all out a couple years ago, both in training and racing. I finally realized that nobody cared but me and I was stressing my mind and body for nothing. Pushing too hard in a training session or not meeting a training goal was starting to take a toll. I would get down on myself for not hitting a time/pace and also struggle to recover appropriately. \n\nNow, I enjoy training runs much more, because I  am more focused on being present in the moment and enjoying my surroundings while out running. I set realistic goals for my races bc I don’t think I will ever be able to stop being a little goal oriented, but my days of going for a PR are behind me. \n\nMost races are intended to create a sense of community just as much as they are a competition, and I have started to enjoy the camaraderie much more.\n\nThe  \"nobody cares but me\" thing has been hitting me hard lately.\n\nNobody cares but me, but I care A LOT.\n\nHaha same. Sometimes I wonder why I take it so seriously, but I wouldnt be able to do it another way. Cheers.\n\nI lol’d. The only thing that maybe cares a bit would be my Garmin.\n\nAh, the new age tamagotchi that equates to just keeping yourself healthy\n\nFor me it’s the opposite. I don’t need to do anything, because no one cares but me. I do it all for me. Enjoying it is the only priority. As soon as that fades, I’ll change my approach\n\nOh don't get me wrong I do it all for me too. I'm very independent. But it crosses my mind sometimes that nobody really cares but me. And it's been crossing my mind more often lately.\n\nI'm sure there are some people (like me) that sees someone at a race and thinks to themselves, damn, I want to run like that when I'm older/ I wish I ran like that when I was younger/ this person seems to be enjoying this a lot, I hope it looks like I'm enjoying it as much as they are.\n\nI'm in my 50s and this is exactly how I feel\n\nI'm with you. I would hate myself and feel like a failure if I wouldn't meet a certain goal. I did okay in my 30s, but I was never going to be anywhere near elite at my height or build (6'5\", 190lbs). I kind-of stopped running half marathons, but still run a marathon per year. I would like to add a couple of 'fun' half-marathons during the year where I truly don't care about pace. Coming off a rough calf strain this summer that I am only now coming back from, I am sure I will disappoint myself. But that is something I have to eventually get over. I'm not going to get better from here.\n\nYour size is almost identical to mine, except I’m five lbs heavier.  I just started running last year and I’m 55.  Do think your height and weight made you more injury prone or even more likely to overstride?\n\nI’m learning this. What’s worse for me is that I ran track in college before completely stopping running for more than a decade. My brain is kind of broken when it comes to how fast I’m supposed to be. This year I’ve finally been able to just get miles as opposed to trying to run fast. The brain still doesn’t really get it.\n\nI'm turning 55 on Saturday and didn't start running until a couple of months before I turned the BIG 5-0.  I have a competitive personality and enjoy the challenge.  I do take each race seriously.  I have qualified for the national senior Olympics in the 800M and 1500M.  Hope to break 5:00 in the 1500M.  Currently at 19:XX on my 5Ks and am hoping to get that 18:XX in the next few months.  Always fun at a 5K when the HS kids say \"man you can really run for an old guy\"  LOL.  To me it just wouldn't be as fun \"just running\" but in general that is a fine attitude.  We are all different.\n\nI know an old guy like you he is 60-65 and does 18 minute parkruns. His calf muscles are like hams, I noted, as he lapped me at 3 something per km.\n\nI'm 45 (almost) and still getting faster and running further every year. Ran my first sub 3 marathon at 40 and am aiming to run 2:40:00 next year so no, haven't stopped yet.\n\nThese types of comments really assures me I’ve chosen the right hobby/sport. :)\n\nRegardless of your age, as a relatively newer runner I find it super impressive that you’ve spent 5 years shaving off 20 minutes. I know the PRs become smaller and less frequent as you progress, but man that is an impressive work ethic.\n\nGoing from 3 to 2:40 is a stubborn threshold. u/cpyrto80 would probably disagree with me, but getting to 2:40 requires a great work ethic AND talent. I don't think many runners have a 2:40 in them, but a pretty high percentage might have a sub 3.\n\nHell yea. What sort of weekly mileage are you putting in to get that low?\n\nWhat age did you start running?\n\nHow many years were you doing marathons over 3 hrs before the sub 3 at 40? And then what training did you do to make that next step?\n\nI’m 39, ran my first marathon at 20, my 3:12 PR at 28, and my 1:29 half PR at 33. \n\nI want to break through for new PRs, but I feel like the answer is to build to 70 miles a week, and I’m not ready to accept that, haha.\n\nThis is what I needed to read. I'm 40 and started racing again last year (post Covid) and after a few crap races I was worried I'd never beat my 2019 PB and maybe I should give up.\n\nI'm a bit younger, 37 but all my PBs dated from 2019. This year, I finally dialed in my training to pre-covid levels, and I had the best season ever. I beat all my road PBs, and on the mountains - I focus more on mountain running - I absolutely smashed my younger self. Like I am not even the same person. Some races, I manages to clock in 20-30 minutes PBs and I was still getting AC podiums with my previous times, so it's not like I was slow to begin with. I mostly finished races in the open female classification this year.\n\nIt depends entirely on the circumstances\n\nHave I trained specifically for this race, with the intention of aiming for a PB? Do I feel great on the day, like I'm at a peak in my fitness, and the weather is perfect? Then yes.\n\nIs this just a race that I'm doing for fun? Do I have a niggling injury, had disrupted training, the weather is too hot or too cold, or I'm running with a friend? Then no. I'll still put effort in, but I won't burst my lungs.\n\nI'm a similar age to you and have been running for almost 15 years. I set my 5k PB this year, and my HM and 10k PBs last year (and came within 4 seconds of that 10k PB this year). But I've also done several races this year where I was not pushing my hardest at all\n\nI enjoy running, I enjoy the atmosphere and theatre of races, and I enjoy earning the medal. Sometimes I push as hard as I can, sometimes I take it easy, sometimes it's a slog. But I love it all.\n\nHalfway to 90 and I still run them like a high school cross country race. I suppose it's part of the reason I still enjoy them. Pushing my body to it's limit. I do have to be more careful with rest and injuries. Oh, and the fact that I'm not going to set any PBs anymore.\n\nMy dad is 76, and he is going to master athletic competitions around the world, runs races and trains like his life depends on it.\n\n64M. I've been a runner most of my adult life but when I was working it was hard to find the time. Now that I'm retired I'm able to run when I want, as much as I want. My 5 Km times are back where they were 30 years ago and last year I ran my PB marathon. Hoping to finally fulfill my dream and qualify for Boston next year.\n\n&gt; I'm 50 and still train as if I am participating in the Olympics and am totally exhausted at the end of every race I compete in.\n\nNice😎👍\n\nNot me.  I push myself in races but not to the very end.  I have nothing to prove anymore. I am just grateful I can still run at 56.  I run for mental and physical health. That’s all I need.\n\nAge 65 here and I run just as hard and competitively as I did when younger. I usually win my age group unless it is a top level race. I am not as fast as I was before, but I love that it still feels the same.\n\nAt 77, I just pick a comfortable pace for the distance I’m running, and try not to react to the runners who pass me.\n\nMy dad is a upper 70s senior athlete. He often competes in the 200, 400, 800 at the national games. I hope to God I still can run \"all out\" like him at 79. Absolute bad ass. He's toast after and I love it.\n\nI'm 61. I can't run as much or as fast as when I was younger. And to be frank I don't really.want to. I like to do other things and I don't want to devote my life to running.  I have decades of listening to my body, and I know how hard I can run on any given race day. So that's how fast I run. The worst age group placing I've had this year was 2nd. Does this count as goimg all out?\n\nIn my 90s and still running and weight lifting almost daily. Flag nor fail\n\nI’m 51 &amp; PB’d my marathon 3:43 &amp; half marathon 1:28 this year. Consistency is key\n\nI go all out on 5k’s. Been running for five years and finally hit sub 22 at my Parkrun in April. Not bad for a 55 year old who never understood the crazy people who just ran for fun.\n\n51 and still all in here. PBed at marathon this year (2.35) and at 5k last year (16.15) so still plenty to motivate. Dealing with injuries and getting enoughrest are real challenges though...\n\nI’m 55 and have been running in races for the past 17 years. I know I’m not going to hit my PR’s from my 30’s and 40’s but I still have goals. The difference now is I listen to my body. There are some days you wake up and just don’t have it so I’ll adjust my expectations accordingly.\n\n64 year old and hell no\n\nIn Haruki Murakami's, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, he talks about getting older and coming to terms with his times get slower.  He compares it to a river that starts of as snowmelt rushing off the mountainside to a river that gets slower and wider before it drifts into the ocean.  I think it's a beautiful way to think of one's running career over a lifetime.\n\n51 here.  I have stopped caring so much about time.  I am in it more for the day out and running the same race with friends.  And figuring out what brewery we will be going to after the race!!\n\n\"older\" is just a word.  Older than what?  But I digress...\n\nI started running in 2017, at the ripe old age of 56, and am still running at 63. :)  I don't train for the Olympics - I'd probably drop dead from exhaustion or over-exertion.  I work as hard as my body will allow me to work.  \n\nI do HIIT workouts and lift weights for strength, a little boot camp for balance and stability, and climb stairs around my city just for fun.  And I about 3X a week, 4-5 if I have a race coming up.  I've never been fast by any stretch.  My best half-marathon time was 2' 35\", and I average between that and 2' 50\", so a 11ish minute mile.  I run, job, and walk as needed.  \n\nI'm definitely aware that I need more rest between really strenuous days , and I don't always listen but I'm getting better.  \n\nIMHO - if you're 'totally exhausted' at the end of every race, maybe it's time to go for a physical and get a doctor's opinion on your fitness level.  I did and it helped me be more aware of my limits, and when it's OK to push those limits.  \n\nMan, I hope this made sense.\n\n45M... Parkrun, yes .. all out every time. \nThe last half marathon I did , I ran a PB but it took so much out of me that I have realised that I will need to adjust my training for half marathons if I want to continue them. So, have been trying to slow down etc instead of burning myself out in training.\nI do find this hard though as the fitter I am the more I enjoy running all out as it's a great feeling. I guess I've learnt its not sustainable now though\n\nIm 47 and I still race with everything I have got. I run better now that I am older mostly due probably to cross training and just better knowledge and nutrition. That said I have noticed that I need more recovery time as of recently. Its a little worrying.\n\n63 here, did a Half and 10K this year, and already signed up for a half for next year. Older is a state of mind.....\n\nI push myself more on race day than in training, but I don’t know if I’m going all out. I have to manage injuries “at my age” and I already have two that compromise speed and distance as it is. \n\nRunning is my mental health break more than my physical exercise now. I can’t do at 48 what I could when I was 27 and just started. But I can still do it and I will until I can’t.\n\n50 - “favourite” distance is half marathon. Must’ve run well over 50 of them, including 23 consecutive Great North Runs.\n\nStill go off flat out like an idiot for the first 3 miles and am desperately hanging on for the last 2!\n\nI’m 64 and have been racing for 40 years. The nice thing about getting older is that it’s generally much easier to make the podium. I had a heart attack in January and have lost a minute a mile off of my 5k racing pace, so I’m presently at about an 8:40/mile pace. I’ve been getting back to the track the last couple of weeks. I find that the track work doesn’t make me much faster, but does keep me from getting much slower. I don’t know that I’ll ever get back to the 7:40 pace I was running in 2023, but under the circumstances I’m happy to still be competing after all these years.\n\n57 here.  Just did a 10k TT during Pfitz 1/2 training and matched a PR from 2013.\n\nI will go balls-out every time I toe a race line until I'm dead.  \n\nIt's a race, so let's fucking race!\n\nDepends on the person and health history. I certainly do not go all out. I’m just here for the vibes. I’m grateful I can still run hella long distance after several scary knee injuries.\n\n66 and have been running since high school.  Gave it all up until a few years ago when I was diagnosed to have kidney cancer; three surgeries later when I lost part of my left lung to this disease I had to slow down to a pace that makes me want to cry though I still can do a marathon in 7 hours if I push it!  Just have to look for events with a generous finish time!\n\nNo. I trail run rather than roads and its always quite relaxed. I don’t really care about my time and unless you are a top 3 finisher, no one else does either!\n\nI'm 58 and still turning myself inside out at races. I don't know any other way\n\n54 here and got my 5k, 10k, 10 mile, half and full marathon PB’s this year running like it’s my last, either give it all I’ve got or I’ll just give up\n\n50 here, PR's reset with new age groups, so why not \"run it like you got it\"\n\n50s. Heck yeah I still go all out. Two years ago I was 89 seconds slower than my 10k PR I set 15 years prior. And I stoped to walk 8 times during that most recent race because breakfast wasn’t sitting well with me. You can still improve. You can still go faster. \n\nI’m always going to give it my best all out shot in a race.\n\n62 here and just ran 6.2 miles :-)\n\nI raced 6.2 for my 62nd too!\n\nI run at a pace where I expect to have almost nothing left at the end.  During the final fraction of a mile,  I empty the tank if I have any excess energy.  I die at the end, the same as I did in high school.\n\n61 here. I’ve dropped long runs for shorter runs.\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nDylan Thomas 1914 – 1953\n\nTimely question as I’m pondering my race this coming weekend! 45M (is that older lol?). \n\nI started running during the pandemic so I don’t have many races under my belt, but I still feel the competitive needs of my younger self. I had planned on doing a half this weekend but some health issues slowed my training towards the beginning of the training block, so I don’t think I can beat my PB from last year. I decided to shift to doing the 10K since I’ve never done one for a race…but partially because I have a decent shot at medaling for my age group! 😄\n\n[removed]\n\nNo. I pretty much stopped after knees started to hurt consistently. I switch to other exercises and still run but lightly. My knees are much better!\n\nGood on you though.\n\nI’m 46 and all I think about is getting faster. I plan to go sub 19 mins on Wednesday for 5k. I only did my first parkrun in March last year, so still think there is plenty of improvement to come. To be honest I just don’t feel particularly old. Sometimes I use my age as an excuse, but really I don’t believe that. I’m just not as good as I’d like to be, so blame my age. The truth is I feel great, I’m just not that fast!\n\nIf you don't want to run all out then just run anything longer than a 10K imo. A marathon is just a really long tempo run basically.\n\nI'm a young boy of 52. When I compete I put it all inn.\n\n51M, starting running at age 45. Ran a 3:06 mara PB last week and definitely feel sub-3 is in my locker somewhere so I’ll continue pushing until I can’t any more\n\n(55M) I ran cross country during high school and picked up running regularly again and was in my mid forties.  I clocked some of my best mile times during the forced stay home time in 2020 when I got to run nearly every day.  During the last couple years I have not trained as hard or frequently so my times have suffered a little.  I run and bike. When I go out I still try to push myself as much as possible, but I have learned to listen to my body more than when I was younger, so I won’t try to push through the pain anymore when I can tell that I’ll be laid out for the next few days if I push it.  To me the better PR isn’t worth doing that.  With that said, I’ll still push myself as much as possible as long as the feedback coming from my body isn’t telling me that I’m screwing something up.  I do love that I can still do these things when so many people in their 50’s or 60’s are no longer able to due to prior injuries.  I’ll count my blessings and hold on to my relatively damage free body as long as I can.  Take care of yourself when you’re pushing your limits.\n\n50M and working harder than ever. Though shifted from road marathon once I hit my goal time to longer and hillier ultras. Possibly my interval reps slowing or I am just tired. Just rejoined the gym to get in some weights and uphill treadmill.\n\nTurning 50 and will attempt to BQ.  Once I get my BQ I will alternate as follows.\n\nSpring 5k, fall half marathon.\nSpring 10k fall full marathon \n\nPlanning on running as close to max as I can for as long as I can.\n\nYes, I’m mid 40s and still try to go all out.  I can’t get the same final kick at the end though for some reason.  I’m not sure if it’s physical or mental…like I’m kind of okay now with not doing that painful sprint at the end.\n\nI’m 52 and I’ll put it all out there until my body tells me to stop.   I’m fortunate that I can still train and race.\n\nStarted running at 30, 54 now. Crushed my PB on half marathon yesterday: 1:43:55. PB has been 1:47:45 since 2012. Am working towards a PB at the marathon in April 2025.\n\nUp to you if you consider 54 as old. But still going all out.\n\nWhat better way to check out from this life than crossing a finish line? Why stop going all out? (I'm serious!)\n\n51, and yes, I'm still pushing hard and breaking personal bests. But I didn't start running until I was in my 40's, it's not like I'm beating any fit young man times I set decades ago, lol.\n\nWhen I feel that I can't keep on getting faster, that's when I plan to change my mindset and look at running longer. Haven't run a marathon yet, just several increasingly faster half-marathons. I'll do that later.\n\n50 is NOT old.\n\nF 60 here! I'm about to find out how \"all out\" I go in the Grand Rapids Half Marathon this upcoming weekend!\n\nI'm really excited for it. My last race was a 15k in March and that went well.\n\nIn training I logged five 11 - 13 mile runs  in the last 2 months. Once I figured out I need to eat something half way through I finished the last 2 long runs without fatigue.\n\n  I've been running for 45 years, and I my pace is faster &amp; I feel just as strong as ever.  Hopefully this will translate to the race - which is a little longer in mileage than I normally run.\n\nI'm 43 and I go all out in races but just to compete with myself. Being timed and having goals have always helped me push myself. I know I am not going to win my age category but I learned to give that up and just know I am doing my best.\n\nLast year I paced my 62 year old friend for the last 40 miles of her first 100 mile race. She finished 1F… not for her age group. For the whole race!\n\nI paced her again for the last 30 of her next 100 miler. Much bigger race so 1F was definitely not in the cards but she was gunning for (and won) first in her age group.\n\nI say never stop pushing for your best.\n\nLooks like I'm in the minority here. I'm 44 and only recently started running in races and my goal is to finish, have a great time and meet cool people. I also enjoy seeing all the different towns, Vermont is quite pretty.\n\nI am 61 and I just ran the fastest 10K of my life at a pace of seven minutes and 15 seconds per mile, I love pushing my body to limit, and when I get to get first place in my age group, I find it extremely thrilling. The experience makes me full of joy and happiness not to mention the health benefits are not the worst thing to have.\n\nI don’t even understand the question.\n\nIf you’re not going all out, you’re not racing….you’re running.  Which is fine.  But for me, a race is a culmination of hours and hours of training.  Plus, there’s nothing better than feeling your superpowers once the cold weather comes and you’re fully tapered and energized, and then smoking people half your age.\n\nI’m 53M and am still getting faster (FM PR is 2:44 high from last October….knock wood I break it in 4 weeks). I average about 70 mpw and peak at about 95 mpw.  If I’m putting in that kind of effort, you know I’m leaving nothing on the course.\n\n50 ain't old unless you tell yourself it is.\n\nI'm 60 years old and always go all out in races. If not then, then when?\n\nI’m 78 and I still run. I had major abdominal surgery in Jan.  I had a stroke 2 months later. After I recovered I am back to running. I use a watch that is set for walk/run ratio of 1:3. I also so speed work on a track. Just be thankful that you can run and most of all, have fun!\n\n50F and I won’t even enter a race if I can’t go all out! I haven’t hit the “fun run” phase of life yet. It’s go big or go home for me 🤣\n\n48 here. Still go 100% and fall over at the line. The only thing that has changed is how long I need to sit/lean against something/lay on the ground at the finish line before moving again... At the end of my last race I must have looked bad as the medical staff came over to check on my as I sat in a chair trying not to pass out!\n\nI'm sure at some point I will stop going all out when I do I pass out at the finish or injure myself - but until then full speed ahead!!\n\n38 and shooting for a 1:30 half marathon. Current PR is 1:48.  \n\nJust did a 10k race where I PRd and the guy who beat me by one position was 51. It ain't over yet!\n\nI'm 49. I ran in races for about 10 years, but then I stopped running altogether for 2 years (ages 46-47) because of badly inflamed knees and I was in too much pain to run comfortably. It took a while to figure it out what was wrong. I had to cut out everything with processed sugars, alcohol, or wheat. Could be a gluten thing, a wheat allergy, a starch allergy, or maybe my body just had enough of glyphosate. I don't know exactly what the problem is/was, but I do know my body is having a much better time without wheat. I'm responding best to a raw vegan diet, so I've been doing that for a year and a half. I'm back, with knees better than ever. I don't run races any more. I think my competitive days are over. I'm just happy to be running again without pain, for my health. If this is you, try a keto diet or a raw vegan diet for a couple of weeks and see if you get better.\n\none of my professors started running at 40 and is still going hard (idk how old he is but he looks great)\n\nI'm 45 and wasn't ever planning on going all out again as I had a 5:28 BQ. Sadly, it looks like one last rodeo!\n\nI love running but I don't love going all out or training to go all out.\n\nThankfully my next BQ doesn't need to be as fast as the last. So probably my fastest marathon is behind me. Certainly not trying to run sub 1:25 HMs anymore.\n\nThat said I ran my fastest marathon last year so not feeling I'm losing it just yet. Not that I ever had it\n\n59M here. I've been running somewhat regularly for the past 6 years. While I just did my PR for a half marathon, 2h5m and my fourth half, I still need to do some walking to recover. My pace has increased some but not drastically. What I notice most is my heart rate. From my watch app, my resting hr has only dropped from 58 to 54 over the past year. And looking at Strava runs of folks I run with in Clinic Group runs, I feel like I'm 15-20 BPM higher.\n\n47 and still snatching marathon PRs. Just ran a 9 minute PR at the St. George marathon and snatched my BQ with a 2:51 buffer. I plan on improving that the end of January.\n\n52F, lifelong runner.  I give my best every race, but no longer feel the need to place.  It’s all about just staying healthy and enjoying it now.  I’ve placed many times in my life, and I just want to go as long as I can.\n\nYes. I’m 48 and ran the Double Dipsea a month and a half ago in Marin. My competitive juices have me pushing it and trying to keep up with runners half my age with mixed results. I’m just wired like that and I always end up completely emptied at the end (and sore AF!)\n\nI don’t run races anymore, I find more enjoyment running free\n\nI love beating all the old geezers that I can. I'm in the 50-59 slot but I still get after it!\n\nI am old and slow.  Despite my best attempts at following the 80/20 training, either I am going way too fast for slow runs, or I really suck at my \"all out\" pace, because there is little difference in race time. There is a bit of a difference in recovery.  During training runs I can come home, shower, and head off to work. Race Day involves shower, food and a nap afterwards.\n\nNot me. I stopped caring about my finish time long ago. Every race is a fun run. I also don't worry about training properly. I enjoy being out there and push myself during a race, but not past the point where the fun ends. Why did I stop caring? I guess it would take away some of the enjoyment for me if I was stressing over my training and finish times. Also, there's the increased risk of an injury.\n\nI'm 53 and can pretty much go all out in the 5K and 10K. But the longer races, I tend to take it easier. I find it is easier on my body to give it my all for a shorter race. I would say it started the last couple years. I don't have quite the same stamina I used to for the longer distances.\n\n42, 10th marathon coming up in December and I'm aiming for a 3:35.\n\nI did my first marathon at 39 at a time of 4:30\n\nI feel (so far) I'm only get stronger and faster as I get older. \n\nA lot of it has to do with knowing how to train better\n\nI don’t know what constitutes as old but I have more than 20 years of running behind me, with BQs and World Majors, etc. I am far off my once speedy paces and races and I know I will never get there again. That said, I aim for new goals now, where I push myself to the max of what I am capable of on race day. I don’t go in with time goals usually as I have a pretty good idea of what I can run. I start out at a moderate pace and pick up as I go. I guess you could say the only thing I push for is a negative split.\n\nHa, I ran conquer the bridge in LA. Believe it was 5 miles. I was about 53. At end of race I was near dead. This old guy goes trotting past me like it was nothing. At end of the race found out he was 85. Although conquer the bridge is tough and I didn't have to ride the van of shame, I felt awful. But must remember most people could never do it no matter their time.\n\nIf you have free time there is time to go to many races and competition places, if you don't have time you have to sacrifice more by resting less. Both formulas have a great sacrifice in both there are results. Runners are very poorly paid it is a shame to see footballers marching.... And athletes with difficulties in getting ahead, both professional and semi-professional.\n\nI ran competitively in high school and college. I was close enough to see the leaders but not good enough to get on the podium, save smaller races. I’ve been running to keep the pounds off and taking it easy now that I’m in my 50s. I definitely don’t go all out (had too many injuries, including one that sidelined me for a year) but still enjoy setting small but reasonable goals just for myself.\n\nKipchoge broke the WR in 2022 at the age of 38. That's a ways from 50, of course, but my point is that you can perform at a high level in running at a later age than in most other sports. (You'll never see someone at 38 who is the world's top sprinter or soccer player, by contrast.) It doesn't surprise me at all that there are middle aged runners who still train and race pretty seriously.\n\n47 and pushing too much for too long is the likely cause of my new friend Afib. I encourage any endurance runner to read The Haywire Heart.\n\nIf you're trained then heck, go for it! In the general case with years comes the need for longer recovery, but within extremes the benefits of exercise far outweigh any downsides (injury, etc.). I've never been too much a racer but a good race is its own reward.\n\nIm 68 and run about 30 miles per week. I might go in the odd race but I’m happy just getting out for a run each day. I run based on how my body feels some days are faster then others but I’m more concerned with just running.\n\nMid 50s and always been slow.  I just want to finish.\n\nI'm 45 and have only got back into running. I want to break the 3 hour mark by 50 and there's a long journey ahead. Then again, I still struggle with the fact that I don't look 25 anymore, so I guess reality has never been my strongest point.\n\nF45 here- I still run 25-35 miles per week but that’s a lot less than I used to do and I’ve stopped racing as a result. But I’m dealing with thyroid issues that cause extreme fatigue and make it very difficult to run some days. That started about 5 years ago and I see a real decline in my pace. It’s totally because I am not able to train enough.\n\nI run a local race here and there as a tune up or just for fun. I kind of always assume the older I get the easier it will be to win my age group. One thing I’ve noticed is the 50 year old age group is pretty fierce. I am not looking forward to aging into that. I can’t figure it out. Maybe it’s just my area but they will win the entire race. I wonder if these are former very competitive runners who just have been there done that and don’t sign up for huge races anymore. But they are sending it. It’s super cool to see. I need to train harder to be ready.\n\nM52 I stopped once my recovery was taking multiple days. It got to point after running I needed three or four days to feel back to normal. Plus I wasn't winning lol\n\nI’m 47 &amp; just PB’d my half mara on the weekend. I just pick &amp; choose when to go all out now. I know I can’t do it all the time like I used to &amp; it takes longer to recover but I still need to every now &amp; then to see where I’m at &amp; to know I can still go to that place if I need to\n\n48 M here . Still at the front few of local park run . It does proper training and a coach . Still do fast half marathon too.\n\nI’m 53 and my regular runs got a bit more relaxed, not always pushing it to 4.5 or 5 effort on the Garmin. Two weeks ago I did a 32k trailrace with 1700m climbing and yes, pushed it to the max. It’s still fun passing 35 or 40 year olds on the climb while whistling a song! But on training runs I’m struggling to push my Garmin anaerobic score above 2; intervals are harder and my max heart rate has gone down.\n\nM53 here. Came to running late-ish; started when I was 32. Started running longer distances with a 30k at 45. Have finished 4 marathons with my best time being 3:53, on my fourth attempt when I was 49 in 2020. The last few years I’ve been running more just 5-10 kms. The new goal is to be like my 72 year old neighbor who runs 5-10 kms 5x per week. Slow and steady wins the race for me, from here on out.\n\nI never started. I run for the enjoyment of it and any serious training ruins the whole experience for me.\n\n55m and just started running last year.  I started with Turkey Trot, and I looked up the previous year’s race to see what I needed to do to get in the Top 5 for my age bracket.  I really liked having a goal and beating people I knew had been running for much longer than me.  The training, which I also enjoy, leads to the races, where I want to do well.  It’s a race, after all.\n\nI ran for 20 years. I never raced or \"marathoned.\" I ran with a friend one time and it was awkward.\n\nM64 setting up for a marathon PB in London next April and hopefully in other distances during the process\n\n50 here! Go for it buddy!\n\nI thought about seriously ramping up my training so that 2 years from now so I’ll be at the younger side of when I’m at the 50 age bracket (I think I could actually be competitive nationally).  When I shared my plan with my partner, she said, “And then you have to pay all those entry fees, airline tickets, and hotels…basically everything you despise about racing.”  Oh ya.  So looks like I’m going to just keep running on my own and competing at practice against the kids I coach 😄\n\nIt depends, sometimes I run-walk if, sometimes I jog around, sometimes I go all out.\n\nIf I book a race during a vacation, it will be run walk or take it easy \n\nIf I do one of my local races, I'll try hard to see how I'm doing on the same course year on year.\n\nAbsolutely!  60M and I train 6 days a week. Peak weeks of 65-80 miles depending on the cycle. I ran a couple of 1:28 halfs this year and I’m still trying to get better at the marathon.\n\nAbsolutely\n\nI’m a runner and I think it’s all up 2 u. I’ve seen 70 plus runners go all  out while others walk. Both are just fine but if you have the urge then do it!\n\n65 and 800m runner. Still go hard but have become more cautious on the 2nd backstretch than I used to be and run for pace (then race at the end as able) rather than racing from the start as when young.\n\nI’m 65 and a lifelong runner… my times have slowed and my distances are shorter, but I still race, and still get the adrenaline rush at the starting line. My pace is about 30 seconds per km faster in a race than it is in a casual run. And as others have noted, the odds of winning an age group prize keep improving…\n\nM58. New to marathons. Last race was 1982. Been a consistent runner for the past decade. Opportunistic runner. No structure what so ever until this past May when I retired and said, “I’m doing this for me”. Spent the last 26 years dedicating my life to supporting and providing for my family. It was hard but successful. \n\nI wanted to BQ my first marathon. I put in a lot of time into my training, figured a high goal would help keep me accountable. This much time? Might as well do it right. I got my BQ this past Sunday. 3:23 \n\nMy philosophy is, “if you don’t use it, you lose it”. I’ve always maintained my fitness with that mindset. Every day do something no matter how small. \n\nYes I go all out. Why not?! If it matters to you, it matters. Do it for yourself because truly, save your closest loved ones, no one else cares. It’ll make life more interesting even if it’s just in your head.\n\nMid 60s here and I train about as much as I did in college but a lot more intelligently, and I race 15 times a year including masters championships and such. Still enjoying the process and having fun.\n\n44F. I thought I was slowing down up until the doctor realized I had anemia. Since then, I had surgery to remove the \"problem\", I recovered very fast and my training times have never been that good. I am able to do intervals I wouldn't have tackled a decade ago.\n\nI just ran my second fastest, and smartest (I had the habit of starting too fast) half-marathon at 1:57.  Sub2 is a goal I have struggled with in my thirties and this time around, it was easy.\n\nNow, I am going for the marathon. \n\nOld is for when I die. Maybe at 90 if I make it that far.\n\nI’m 26 chiming in with my own question! I know so many people that say their hips or knees eventually stopped them from running? That makes me so sad because I want to run for many years. Can any older runners give personal tips/anecdotes for how they continued running without an injury stopping them?"

    "all_comment_text": "Im a new runner, and i learned that running with a full fanny pack bouncing all around sucks 😅\n\nThat’s why you get a hydration pack. Not only will stuff not bounce but you look like a distance runner or at least someone who takes their hydration seriously.\n\nAnother option is a flip belt. Enough storage for phone, keys, wallet, gels, water bottle, etc. absolutely fantastic if you don’t want to wear a vest / hydration pack\n\nDear lord, what Flip Belt are you using? Mine has barely enough room for my phone and a key.\n\nhttps://a.co/d/5M1L9yi\n\nWater bottle in back, wallet / phone in zipper pocket, keys attached to the little lanyard then tucked in, and additional pockets for gels or snacks / whatever else is needed\n\nDo you use the special flip belt water bottles? I've thought of ordering them. I'm wondering how convenient it is to remove them from the belt and put them back in.\n\nYep, I have the larger one. It isn’t difficult!\n\n[deleted]\n\nI just purchased the large flipbelt bottle. I washed it out and have used it for one run. It did taste chemically and still smells it after another wash. I’m going to give it a few more uses before passing judgement, though.\n\nI got a flip belt and the bottles. They are sitting in my closet.   \n\nNothing bad about them, just not as convenient as a pack most times and the amount of water isn’t really enough for me on long runs.\n\nNot OP! But I do use the flip belt bottle, they are fine, a bit small but do the job. They are simple to remove than your phone, but I prefer my phone to be snug.\n\nNot who you asked but I have both sizes of flip belt bottles. There’s a bit of a learning curve but once you figure out where to situate them on your body and with regard to the openings in the belt, it’s easy enough.\n\nI use them, I have both sizes and depending on what my plan is I'll take one or both. It's a little awkward to remove them and get them back in, and the water does warm up quickly from body heat, but I still prefer to use them over a full hydration pack when I'm going on a run that's long enough to need water, but not that much.\n\nI have the water bottles with the belt and it does cause significant bounce so much that it gives me a rash on longer runs. I bought the correct size and tightness and if it's packed lightly with just a phone and a few gels it's fine, but once you add the full bottles and your other gear it will absolutely bounce , at least on me it does. Just pointing it out because I bought the flip belt based on many people saying there is no bounce, but it's most definitely not the case for me. The two smaller bottles it comes with are easy to get back into the belt, but the larger one can be a struggle especially while trying to run.\n\nI found positioning to be the key for the flipbelt water bottles.  When they're about half way between the front and the side, they sort of nestle into the hip bone and don't bounce at all.  Anywhere else, the bouncing makes them unbearable.   I keep my phone in front, and a water bottle on either side.\n\nI find it’s a two handed process and a bit of a learning curve. But with practice it’s ok.\n\nCompletely depends on body type though. As a woman with a smaller waist, but larger hips, flipbelts are bouncy as all heck no matter what I do if I put even so much as a cell phone in it, let alone water/fuel/keys/etc. And I’ve tried all sorts of different sizes and positioning too.\n\nSeriously THANK you for saying this because I see running influencers with very straight body types rave about their flip belts. I have a small waist and bigger butt, have tried multiple sizes and they do not stay out for shit. I'm glad it's not just me. It rides up into my waist every single time.\n\n[deleted]\n\nTIL there are people who don't sweat when they run.\n\nWhen I get back from a run with my hydration backpack the back part of my shirt is soaking wet while the rest of my shirt is just damp. It's like biking with a backpack. Sure, I sweat from everywhere, but when there's something consistently pressed against my back the sweat doesn't evaporate and my shirt just stays wet.\n\nYou need to try one of the ones that are made out of meshy material instead of backpack-type nylon. The Salomon vests breathe especially well. Soft bottles in the front are also way better than a bladder in the back (except maybe if the bladder is full of ice.)\n\nMy camelback was such a game changer. I can carry 50 ounces of water with me and don’t even notice it. Plus places to stick some gels and even my phone if I want.\n\nI highly recommend SPIbelt, I picked one up at a Best Buy on a whim years ago and it’s lasted through many thousands of miles worth of runs. It never bounces and is quite comfortable. I recently got a new one, but only because I run at night and wanted one made of reflective material\n\nYeah don't do that. You don't really need to carry much with you.\n\n&gt; You don't really need to carry much with you.\n\n\nWell, most new runners won't be running the kind of distance the warrants carrying stuff, but there are plenty of legitimate reasons to have a full pack while running.\n\nIf you want to tell me about the ultra you're running, just tell me!\n\nWell now that you asked...\n\nPain, mostly.\n\nDon't get old.\n\nHa my first reaction was “Achilles tendinitis”\n\nThat first step out of bed in the morning will never be the same.\n\nIt's worse with a little puppy dragging you down the steps in the morning.  I hate that crunchy feeling.\n\nIt's what finally made me stop carrying my twin daughters down the stairs in the morning. It just wasn't safe.\n\nI tore mine years ago and it reminds me every day. But it’s a great weather predictor so at least it’s doing something semi-productive?\n\nI feel that, my dude/dudette.\n\n*Literally*. lol...\n\nCalf raises....\n\nYeah man, progressive loading of the calf/achilles is the solution. Alfredson protocol should be a staple for anyone with calf or Achilles issues\n\nStrength training is so underrated. I pretty much fixed my Achilles tendinitis with rest and weighted calf extensions once it felt better. It’s not perfect nowadays, but so much better. \n\nUpvote for the username lol\n\nI dunno, getting old sure beats the alternative.  Plus I move up an age group next year.\n\nA stent in my lateral descending artery.    I find I can’t live without it.\n\n*Left anterior descending* \n\nyay for you exercising!\n\nYou are correct.   Thx\n\nMe too. Could you tell something was up from your running? I remember developing this small ache in my shoulder about a mile into every run, kinda like a small side ache. Didn't think much about it at the time, just thought it came with age.\n\nYeah for me I had taken about 2 months off for a knee injury and i was trying to get back into it and I felt sort of a full or heartburn feeling starting in the sternum and travelling up and the the right a bit.  Never to the heart side.   At first I thought it was like that burning lungs feeling when running in cold weather.\n\nUsually it happened when I ran hills at first...but then it got sort of like it was happening all the time.\n\nand one day I could only run a block or two before I had to stop and that's when I called my doc, who sent me to the ER, who didn't find anything and sent for a stress test a month later.....and they found out about half the heart was beating under pressure.\n\nGot the stent a week later.   Cardiologist said the running probably gave me some advance warning and being in shape may have saved my life.    On the other hand it could have killed me haha but I was lucky.\n\nNow I eat crazy healthy and take a number of drugs for life.  and not the fun ones.\n\nThe widomaker!! Are you my brother? \n\nHe went into cardiac arrest during a marathon when this artery collapsed and had to have several stents put in.\n\nI’m not but yep it was the widow maker.   I was 99% blocked.    Only had angina when running.\n\nVery lucky I am alive and got it fixed before a heart attack.\n\nSeriously!  It is scary.\n\nMy brother only survived because the only shuttle van with an AED on the course was a 100 yards away when he went down. He had pain and didn't feel good at mile 20 and thought about stopping but went on and collapsed at mile 23. \n\nHe finished the marathon the next year and took up cycling because of knee issues.\n\nMusic.  I ran for seven years without any music, because I am an urban runner who wants to be aware of my surroundings at all times.  When I got a pair of Aftershokz I was able to do both.  Now it's unheard of for me to run alone without listening to music or a podcast.\n\nThis is funny to me because I previously lived in a city, but mostly ran in a park or on a long waterfront boardwalk. So no real concerns about cars. Was a couple blocks from the park and like 7 blocks to the waterfront. I wore noise cancelling ear buds in the city.\n\nI recently moved to a suburb which is a mix of running on roads, and some sidewalks, so I've switched to Shokz for safety on the road.\n\nMy concerns were cars and dogs.\n\nHearing little feet start running behind you is the worst noise to hear while running 😭\n\nI run with my dog and this is one of the main things I listen for. We’ve been attacked so many times by other dogs that I carry mini stun gun that I have in my hand all the time. I hate people with off leash dogs.\n\nUnless I'm listening to Little Feat...\n\nI'm probably the opposite. I had to have music or a podcast, but nowadays I have been less likely to wear any, especially during races and speedwork when I need to be in tune with my cadence.\n\nI agree with you on the no music for races or speed work.\n\nThis was me and add in my phone now. I used to run with people and had conversations but that fell off. I then enjoyed the silence but 16 mile runs by myself got boring and music/podcasts made it more enjoyable. \n\nI usually run the first half with a podcast/book and then when the sound of voices talking gets irritating I switch to music. It is enough of a distraction but allows me to focus on the run.\n\nI will say that my marathon strategy was to find someone to talk to the first half to distract myself before the race started in the 2nd half. That worked up through 2018 then I didn't run a marathon until 2021. In the next one I noticed the landscape had changed. It went from a few people with headphones to just a few without headphones. I couldn't find anyone to talk to because they all had music on. I surrendered in my next race and listened to music the whole way.\n\n It is fun to create a playlist and try to anticipate what music you will want to hear at certain parts of the race. Sometimes I want a soft sound that is relaxing and lets me forget about the pain and then there is the moment of needing a pick me up or intensity to push through. I have 90s rap to country to classic rock to heavy metal to punk/ska punk. Every race starts with \"I'll be Missing You\" by P. Diddy to honor my son and dad.\n\nI love running to music or podcasts, but I personally ensure that I don't get too dependent on it that I forego a run due to not having headphones, so once in a while I go without headphones!\n\nThis is how I used to be, I'd skip a run if I didn't have my earbuds. But several weeks ago while heading out for an early morning run I discovered my right one would no longer power on so I just went without. Haven't ran with music since. I may get new earbuds in the future, but currently I enjoy just being present in the moment, focusing on my stride and my breathing.\n\nRunning without headphones was what kept me calm and grounded.  It was meditative and allowed me to think through problems or just be mindless and in my run, while also having a connection with the world around me.  There’s so much noise in the world, literal and mental. The chance to get a break was one of my favorite things about running.  My knees are shot now and I haven’t found a good replacement.   I truly feel that anyone running with headphones is missing out.\n\nI have after shocks head phones they are great for running and let you hear what's around you. Also I hate that heart beat sound with ear buds when I am running really hard.\n\nHow do the aftershokz sound? Is it like having a speaker near your ear, or more like headphones. If you’ve tried AirPods, how would you compare them to the transparency mode? \n\nI just go with one of my wireless earbuds and leave the other ear open. Keeps me very aware of what's around me and I don't feel like I'm missing much.\n\nMy albuterol inhaler. My asthma acts up when running in the cold, and when you puff it on a run, you get to imagine other people thinking “Oh that’s why that guy is so slow. Well good for him for getting out there.”\n\nThis used to happen to me. I now instinctively take 2 puffs before every run regardless of temperature and it works a treat.\n\nBut then how will I telegraph my excuses to strangers?\n\nHahaha *did I write this*\n\nSame!  If anybody asks about it, I just say, \"don't smoke.\"\n\nPepper spray. 🙄 Because some people decided it was open season to be terrible.\n\nThis is as important for dogs as it is for people honestly! I got chased and bit by a chihuahua a few months ago and it put the fear of god in me anytime I run by an off leash dog\n\nPepper spray and a pocket knife just in case, because some people and dogs are not completely neutralized by the pepper spray.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat’s why I always make sure to bring my flame thrower because you never know. The extra weight makes it a really good workout!\n\nYou think that’s going to stop a determined chihuahua?\n\nI typically run with my nuclear codes at the ready. Nothing deters like MAD.\n\nI never ever leave the house without first giving notice to the AI operated space lazer I have in orbit\n\nAbsolutely. I run with my pointer, and we have had three incidents in the last 6 months where off-leash/ loose dogs chased us. Twice it was the neighbor's terriers, but one in December was a pitbull that got loose from it's back yard. After that instance I have carried pepper spray ever since. I know how to fight off a dog, but my baby girl doesn't.\n\nYep, just added pepper gel to my arsenal due to some weird human interactions that reminded me how vulnerable i am out there, and also I've noticed people's dogs are more of an issue lately. Lots of semi aggressive off leash situations. Just seems smart enough have some sort of deterrent on board.\n\nThat is terrible to read, hope you're still enjoying running though\n\nYup. I wasn’t personally in a bad situation, but there were several reports of people being awful to other people (all of whom were physically unharmed/able to get away) and I thought, well, I want a little insurance beyond being faster than the average person who might chase me.\n\nJust *please* don’t spray yourself in the process/be aware of wind blowing it back at you bc pepper spray hurts like hell\n\nYes, I got the gel (which I’m told is much less likely to do that) and have practiced. I also wear glasses, so I have a little defense from myself.\n\nSame here. Had two cyclists threaten me for running in the proper pedestrian lane last weekend. The roided out meathead quickly got back on his bike when he saw I wasn’t messing around and would spray him if he didn’t turn around. \n\nWhy can’t people read the signs? There are also pictures of where to be every quarter mile. Jeez.\n\nThis. Just got cornered by a dog in my neighborhood a few days ago and run in an urban area with a few incidents in the past.\n\nMy phone to check my glucose monitor, extra extra sugar in case of hypoglycemia, and really long runs an insulin vial and a syringe. Maybe in the future it'll be a pump instead.\n\nProps for getting out there despite the extra stuff that lots of people don't think about. I hope technology makes things easier for you in the future.\n\nA fellow type 1! I don’t know how I went so many years without a cgm connected to my watch!\n\nIt changed me from being only comfortable with 10k's or less, to being comfortable at 20k plus.\n\n15 years ago I was doing up to 20 miles runs while marathon training. I was severely under fueling because I had no idea what my blood sugar was doing during those long runs. I would carry gels but only eat them if I felt like I was going low. I’d between zero and two gels the whole run. \n\nNow I fuel with around 100 carbs per hour during long runs and it has completely changed the game for me. I feel so much better during, but especially after my runs now. Having a cgm connected to my watch and being able to easily bolus with my pump has been nothing short of amazing for my running.\n\nHello T1Ds!    Now go back to the stone ages (just a few years ago) and run with a meter and test strips.\n\nPump is the way to go.  Tandem with Dexcom is life changing.\n\nYeah, it's just a hell of a process to get a pump where I'm at if you're an adult on MDI. I still manage an A1C of 6.0, TIR around 80% or greater though.\n\nI have a freestyle right now because I have been having low blood sugar (not diabetic) and I have to run with my phone now and it drives me crazy!\n\nMine is a Dexcom G6 so I have it paired to my Forerunner and can check it on the go without digging out my phone. But it doesn't pair directly with the watch, it pairs to my phone which sends data to the watch. \n\nWorth it for me though, and I've gotten used to it. A low for a Type 1 Diabetic can quickly go from annoying to life threatening.\n\nSame here! Except I’m g6 to phone to fenix. Sugar displays on home-screen and in activity have changed my life. \n\nIt recently helped me finish a 50k which I would have never thought was possible shortly after diagnosis. \n\nSafe sugars out there bud!\n\nDude, I can't even imagine that extra challenge. If I haven't had enough carbs throughout the day and run in the evening it's awful. I always try and run before 3 for this reason. Can't imagine dealing with chronically low blood sugar.\n\nA snood thing round my wrist.\n\n Perfect for wiping sweat from my brow if it's hot,  or putting on my head if it's cold\n\nI'm upset that I've never thought of this...all those runs wiping my sweat with the bottom of my shirt and getting gross sunscreen/salt stains...\n\nidk how these influencers run with a camera. I tried it once and it was terrible. If I didn't like tracking my runs I wouldn't even have my phone.\n\nThe real work of running does't happen until you take the time to post it to instagram.\n\nTry a watch\n\nSince I got my fitness watch, I often leave the phone at home, or in the car, at best. The only times I missed having my phone was on a few nice sunsets.\n\nYou know there's a camera on your phone\n\nI mean I could also run in flip flops but I choose running shoes.\n\nIf I go for a trail run, I have with me coban bandage and two painkillers. If I trip I can at least give myself first aid.\n\nLighted vest. Early morning runs are much safer, my family isn't as worried that I'll become a speed bump, and it's fun to be a weird glowy green guy sometimes.\n\nI agree.  I run about half the year with my noxgear.  After having several close calls I was happy to drop the cash on this.\n\nLiving in bear country (the Yukon) and they are waking up from hibernation now. Good to pack bear spray if running trails outside of urban routes.\n\nI visit family in grizzly bear country every year.  Running when the bears are awake is hours and hours of terror for every mile run.  I don't pack bear spray up there but also won't run on trails.  I also sing every now and then to let them know I'm coming their way.\n\n...what's your go-to number for deterring grizzlies?\n\nThe lion sleeps tonight is good.  You gotta make sure to hit the high notes though.\n\nThere was a video of some fellow on social media complaining about folks running with vests on short runs and now I take my vest on more runs.\n\nI started training more consistently in late 2020 (as so many folks did!) and I remember going on several fairly long runs without carbs or water- I definitely take both with me on any run longer than 60 minutes now. \n\nSometimes I'll take toiletpaper in a ziplock bag and a nitrile glove as my sanitation kit on long runs that start early in the day.\n\nI bought a watch with cell phone capability because I prefer not to take my phone but my spouse needed peace of mind.\n\nAlmost always sunglasses and a hat.\n\nno matter the length of run or walk I’m going on, I wear a vest… Carries my phone, some varying amount water for dog and me, dog baggies, keys, airpods. I give zero fooks if anyone thinks it's overkill 😂. So much easier than putting all that in pockets.\n\nHow would anyone know you're out for a short run in your vest?\n\nAnd why on earth would they care?\n\nAnd why on earth would you care if they do care? \n\nImportant life mantra: *those who matter don’t mind, those that mind don’t matter.*\n\nSome runners become elitist about what others can and can’t do or what is and isn’t cool. \n\nI learned that apparently I’m an ugly weirdo for wearing calf sleeves on my long runs and races. I don’t care, I feel like they help my legs feel just a bit less fatigued and I also wear them to keep my legs just slightly warmer when it’s cold but not cold enough for pants.\n\nI'm gonna flip the coin and say what I now run without. Headphones.\n\nCompletely agree! My whole time at home/work I am surrounded by noise, the radio, TV, YouTube, music, etc, etc. Running is the one time I can get away from all of that and have some peace.\n\nI went on a recent run without headphones. Turns out, i can be a horrible person, willing to destroy the whole planet when i am suffering through an interval workout.\n\nThat's funny because I'm the opposite. I prefer music, podcasts and audiobooks on the slow, easy or long runs. During workouts, I ditch them after the warmup if I wear them at all because I feel like I lock into the workout better and am able to more accurately execute it. Also, I focus so hard on the workout even if it's not a VO2 Max session that I miss parts of audiobooks and podcasts, which is super annoying.\n\nI switch to music when the workout gets intense because I have blocked out whole parts of a podcast/book and have to relisten.\n\nI just started doing this for my shorter runs. Without my headphones, I don't need my phone either. I can get out the door quicker now.\n\nI started doing this more lately and it feels amazing.\n\nAgreed!!  Running is my time to disconnect from devices and be alone for a bit\n\nChapstick\n\nI learned yesterday that if you get a blister and it's hurting, chapstick can double as anti chafe balm\n\nAm I the only runner on earth that doesn’t get the shits? So many comments about emergency TP haha\n\nRunning cap/hat. Spent way too long not having something on my head and sweat running into my eyes.\n\nYour future dermatologist endorses this.\n\nJust curious, why is this better?\n\nAs a bald dude, I worry about those dark spots showing on my scalp so I wear a hat for sun protection along with sunscreen, usually just on my face. I also sweat a lot so it’s double for that.\n\nRoad ID on my watch band that lists my name, address, emergency contact, and allergies. I moved from a pedestrian friendly city to a suburb full of aggressive drivers and prefer not to run with a phone or wallet.\n\n\nI assume somewhere in NJ.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is something that I run with now that I didn't do before \\[when it is raining\\].  \n\nI am suspectible to chafed nipples. I have to be particulalry careful and tape 'em up when there is a chance that my running shirt will get wet and rub my chest the wrong way. I recently discovered that if I wear a hydration vest when it is raining, it holds my running shirt down tight against my chest and there is no rubbing and consequently no chaffing.  \n\nTo be clear, I don't carry any hydration in my hydration vest.  I'm just using the vest as a fancy strap to keep my shirt from swaying.\n\nI know you can't see me right now, but rest assured I am tapping the side of my forehead with my finger indicating I'm a genius.\n\nUnfortunately, a knife.\n\nI’m a female who has recently been followed on my route and even in my own apartment parking lot. I don’t like running with weapons and I use running as a way to feel free and de-stress but sadly in the world we live in I have to always be looking over my shoulder and make sure I have a way to protect myself.\n\nAn Apple Watch that can make phone calls so I don’t have to carry an actual phone.\n\nI like having a camera on me (my phone). Never know when you'll need photo evidence of something 😲\n\nRecently picked up a stress fracture, so that's been an interesting addition.\n\nGolf balls. I have had a few close enounters with coywolves (coyote / wolf hybrid) that have moved in to the greater Toronto area.  Throwing golf balls at them is a good defence.\n\nShorts with a drop-in phone pocket in the liner. Always swore this would be uncomfortable and that the phone would fall out or otherwise distract me. Turns out it's a lot more enjoyable for me than a phone armband.\n\nNow, the hard part is primarily finding shorts with liners that include phone pockets...\n\nOn longer runs: cash. I once wanted to stop at a pub to get a soft drink but I couldn't pay.\n\nthis is why you set up your google Wallet/Apple Pay on your phone :)\n\nI like getting stoned to the bone before, during, and after 🤷‍♂️\n\nA fellow stoner runner? I didn't know we existed! Lol\n\nThere are dozens of us.\n\nTens of dozens!\n\nIn one 2019 survey, 1 in 4 runners, cyclists and triathletes said they were cannabis users. In another one, 80% of cannabis users said they mix weed and working out.   \n  \nOne citation [here](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2019/04/30/new-runners-high-80-cannabis-users-mix-weed-workouts).\n\nBong rip or 2 and some headphones and I’m set\n\nI did this for the first time in two years yesterday and had the best run!\n\nI never ran with my phone until having a child and needing to be available in a pinch.\n\nI didn't take mine either until one day I came home to about a million missed calls from my wife when she had car trouble. That wasn't good.\n\nPain\n\nSunglasses. Even when it’s dark or I’m in low light on the trail. I’ll swap out to clear lenses if needed. So much gunk ends up in my eyes otherwise. Picked it up from when I did a ton of cycling. Protect your eyes.\n\nPepper spray.  Attacked by 3 dogs at the park a few months ago. Would’ve killed to have any weapon of some sort.\n\nRage.\n\nI started running in covid because I got cheated on and the bars closed down, so no going out and making bad decisions! Rage and redbull got me through my first six months of running.\n\nDateline podcast. The perfect amount of entertainment while still letting me zone out.\n\nWater. I used to tough it out, but I mouth breath when I run and turns out doing that without water fucks up your teeth.\n\nGel pepper spray. Have had more than a few encounters with aggressive, unleashed dogs over the years and the pepper spray has become peace of mind. Particularly on long runs when I'm very far away from my car or home.\n\nMeanwhile, I've ditched my phone, music, and lights. I'm a very early morning, pre-dawn road runner and have learned that running with a light is both annoying and useless for safety. The best way to avoid getting hit by cars is paying attention and proactively moving somewhere safe. Do not assume someone sees you because you have a light.\n\njoy\n\nr/runningcirclejerk I hope mods keep this one up.\n\nalready there!\n\nIf I need toilet paper, the run is too long and I'm not doing it. Mostly kidding but I was surprised running my first 10k that people were curious where the bathrooms were. Currently training for a half marathon so perhaps I will discover why the toilet paper is necessary soon.\n\nI think a lot of people run for years without ever needing to stop to go to the bathroom. I know my husband has never once had any issue at all with his stomach or gut while running. But some people, like me, have sensitive stomachs and have more frequent bathroom issues during runs. If you haven't had any problems yet, there's no reason to think you'll start. Just be sure to try out any fuel you might take before hand and you'll probably be fine.\n\nI've had to stop to use a toilet on a 30min run, if you gotta go then you gotta go.\n\nRaces have port-a-potties along the route for a reason.  It is not uncommon for peoples stomachs to get upset especially if people decide to try a gel for the first time on race day.\n\nHaving said that I've never had to do the #2 on runs from .5 to 26.2 miles.  I must not be a real runner.\n\nGenuine question, how far do you typically run that shitting yourself is a real threat?\n\nI've trained for a 10k, I typically run a 5k every time I run, if not more, and never once have I even come close to shitting myself lol.\n\nHonestly, I think most people never come close to shitting themselves. It's just that people don't often post about NOT pooping during their run. You're more likely to hear people asking for advice when they have issues so it seems like a bigger deal than it is. It's possible you'll start to have problems as your runs get longer and you start having to take in fuel, but chances are you'll be fine and never have to worry about it.\n\nThat said, I am jealous of every single one of you who doesn't have these issues! After a lot of trial and error with my diet and fueling over the years I've gotten much better, but I used to have bathroom problems as early as 1-2 miles (like 1.5-3 km) into a run and often multiple times throughout a run. I still know where every public bathroom is along every route I run, but now I don't have to use them nearly as often as I used to.\n\nThe poops can come at any time for any reason unexpectedly. There are so many factors that can affect this. After 12 years of running all distances imaginable, the shits have come to me on a 5k run, they have come to me 25km into a long run….\n\nI’m gonna admit this has happened to me twice when running long distances but only when I just got to my house after like an hour of holding it in. Happened to my husband once as well.\n\nI have heard taking an Imodium for a half or marathon race is pretty common, if not just to relieve some anxiety about that happening, but you will find me in no other colour shorts than black\n\nAs others have said, it isn't necessarily distance-related.  I have IBS, so my stomach can be pretty unpredictable.  I had to stop running 3 miles in on Monday because my stomach started feeling funky but have done much longer distances with no problem.  I also take Imodium before any race, no matter how short because mornings are the worst time for me.\n\nIt only takes one misadventure to make a person wary of the possibility. I went home shirtless one morning and don’t plan on doing that ever again😂\n\nMy dog.\n\nGood boy/Girl.  I love running with my pooch.  She loves it more.\n\nprobably 90% of the time I run with nothing except the following:\n\n1. clothes (shorts/tights, t-shirt/long sleeve, hat, socks, gloves in the winter)\n2. sunglasses\n3. shoes\n4. watch\n\nOn runs of 16+ miles (or shorter if it is exceptionally hot), I will carry a handheld with a gel or two and 20oz of water or electrolytes. Occasionally on an easy run, you may find me with headphones.\n\nPepper Spray and other forms of self defense\n\nFoldable Cup, that allows for better drinking at water sources. Specifically, the DECATHLON \"Kiprun Trail Running Folding Cup X-Light\", 5 Euros. Slips easily into running belt or clothes pocket.\n\nThe extra 20lbs from COVID I put on 2 years ago. Kind of plateauing right now. Still running but, feel like I'm in a funk\n\n2 Belgian Malinois. To be honest, I wasn’t originally a fan. But as a female runner, I feel a lot safer running with them. They’re brilliant. I often now carry pepper spray for dogs who want to come after us too.\n\nToilet paper, you mean my left sock?\n\nConfidence.\n\nGum!! Call me crazy but I when I chew gum (orbit sweet mint) it helps me keep my pace and I never get dry mouth. Especially anything above 6 miles - gum is a must\n\nA bunion\n\nMy daughter in the running stroller!\n\nA Gun. Pit bull owners in my area love to leave their psychotic inbred murder machine loose to attack random people. Also my area is infested with drug addicts. Concealed Carry running does suck tho\n\nGarmin. Wouldn't go back to phone/smartwatch now.\n\nBecause I live in a densely populated city I bring a whistle with me. When I’m tired of zigzagging through a row of slow walkers I whistle like a coach to make them move\n\nIt's a public space, they have as much right to be there as you. Run in a park or on a track if you want to run uninterrupted \n\nJust got an apple watch. So I can track my times and listen to music while leaving my phone at home! \n\n[deleted]\n\ndo you run with a whole roll of toilet paper? or how do you pack it?\n\nI just leave it on the roller and pull it along behind me.  When I get to the end of the roll it is time to turn around and go back home.\n\nA limp, a bad back, and painful knees! But I'm zoned in and moving forward at my slow pace.\n\nIt's all good.\n\nGum. Seriously. Helps to not feel so thirsty on long runs between water stops, especially if gels or gummies aren’t great on your stomach.\n\nI went the opposite way. I use to run with my phone, water bottle, ID card, chapstick, and a few  other items. Now I’m down to running belt with my building key fob in it.\n\nSnacks lol some of my runs are hella long and snacks are a must! Also wool socks. I thought they’d be absolutely terrible but turns out wool is impeccable at wicking away moisture (keeping me cool and blister free)\n\nA sense of doom.\n\nZiploc bag. RIP phone (okay, nearly *two* phones)\n\nThe absence of underwear. It's like a whole new world has opened up.\n\nA stroller"

    "body": "Some of you may remember Nedd Brockman from Australia when he ran from Perth to Bondi (3953km journey) across 46 days.\n\nHe is now trying to break the 1000-mile record of 10 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes and 36 seconds, set by Yiannis Kouros in New York in 1988. \n\nIn classic Brockmann way, he is doing it on a 400m track - talk about the head noise. Around 400 laps a day for 10 days straight.  More info here --&gt; https://www.instagram.com/p/C6dXG9dLz_3/\n\nAll money raised through donations and sponsorship goes to a charity to combat homelessness.

    "all_comment_text": "I did 12 miles on a track once. ONCE. And even then, I only counted up to 24 and then counted down from 24 on the back half because counting all the way up to 48 sounded too depressing. 4,000 laps? I can't even imagine.\n\nThere are many things I’d rather do than run 4000 laps. Dying is a competitive choice\n\nI can just load up audiobooks and I’m barely even at the track. I obviously prefer a nice running route. But I can zombie a track a long time.\n\nYeah I did a half marathon on a track once and my brain started to short circuit and get the straights mixed up. I’d look up and my surroundings would be nothing like I expected.\n\nAlso felt like I was going round a track all evening when I was at home.\n\nI don't mind 10-12 miles on the track if I'm doing a bigger workout. There's enough going on that it doesn't feel like 48 laps. But steady state running? I'd lose my mind after a couple hours.\n\nSo, no 10 mile treadmill runs for you all? I put on an audiobook and just get in the zone for a while.\n\nI’ll do a treadmill half marathon at the gym on a Sunday evening if it’s absolutely fucking it down outside.\n\n&gt;absolutely fucking it down outside\n\nGotta love the British... lol\n\nIt’s such a beautiful language we’ve developed from everyone that invaded us.\n\nNah man, rain running is so good for the soul I find. Something about the pure misery of it. \n\nTreadmill running I simply cannot do. That meme about “1 second here is 40 years on earth” applies.\n\nIn all fairness I haven’t given much of an effort to trying to get acclimated to a treadmill, but the rare times I find myself in one, I really struggle to do more than a few miles.\n\nMost my brother and I did in marathon training was 20 miles on a track. So 80 laps. It wasnt too bad really!\n\nSounds some serious ground hog day ..\n\nIf he sleeps 8 hours day and runs continuously the other 16 he has to run a 10 minute/mile pace for the duration.\n\nNo one sleeps 8 hours in multiday races.\n\n[deleted]\n\nspeak for yourself, sounds utterly impossible to me\n\nI can wrap my head around like a 200mi race but this is... more than that\n\nI was going to say.  This is...truly impossible for me.  Would not be able to come remotely close if my life depended on it.  Dead.  I'd be dead.  \n\nI couldn't do 100 miles in a day, which would require moving my body at 14.4 minutes per mile for 24 hours straight.  \n\nBut I can also barely survive a half marathon in a 2 hour 45 minute window.  So yeah lol\n\nIt sounds extremely doable, and extremely pointless.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI run a lot, but I don’t do ultras because I enjoy having at least some toenails. I was also being sarcastic, but Reddit is full of idiots who think I’m the idiot because I said an obviously crazy thing without indicating explicitly that I wasn’t entirely serious. I guess I’m a masochist, because I post stupid shit like this despite knowing I’ll get downvoted and told how stupid I am. But I’m not enough of a masochist to run more than a marathon, at least for now. But on some level I find this really funny.\n\nBro you forgot the /s so negative internet points for you\n\nFuck the terminally online.\n\nHe won't do that. No person can eat enough while running to not have to eat when they stop. He's gonna have to shit at many points and probably won't do that while running, at least hopefully. He'll get blisters at some point, need to change socks. Most likely, he neither sleeps 8 hours nor runs 16.\n\nMultidays are a very established race format.  He'll do much more than 16 per day.\n\nThe track seems a smart move. Food can be brought there, blast music over the sound system, supporters can cheer. In addition, a track is more efficient and level, conserving energy.\n\nI'd be worried about those corners, doing it 4000 times I can imagine that's some weird loads on your body. Unless he's going to switch directions occasionally.\n\nThank you for reminding me to occasionally run the other way around for my usual routes.\n\nHe's doing a turnaround every 12.8kms, every 32 laps.\n\nHe’s obviously going to switch directions.\n\nThis isn’t the first time one of these time based ultras has been run on a track. See, e.g., [Killian Jornet’s failed attempt at the 24 hour world record.](https://runningmagazine.ca/sections/runs-races/what-happened-to-kilian-jornet-during-his-24-hour-attempt/#:~:text=On%20Friday,%20a%20cold%20and%20icy%20day%20in%20Norway,%20Kilian)\n\nWhy choose a 400m track? There are park loops that are closer to 5K. Why not a larger track?\n\nHe is sleeping under the grandstand right next to it, doesn’t have to go anywhere\n\nI hope he alternates his direction … I’ve done 100 miles around a track over 18.5 hours before and ran anti-clockwise the whole time. \n\nMy left foot and right knee (or was it the other way round? I’ve repressed the whole memory) ached like hell. \n\nMentally the best thing was that there happened to be a softball tournament in the middle of the track so had some banter from the parents. \n\nThis, however, just seems like mental insanity.\n\nHe is rotating\n\nAlternating\n\nHe's doing a turnaround every 12.8kms, every 32 laps.\n\nI have run a number of multi-day events on tracks. Sometimes there were shorter events on the track while our long race was on; relays and so on. It made for a nice distraction from the monotony.\n\nHe's a fucking mad man, I followed his journey and read his book. Haven't kept up with him though, anyone know how his training went? \n\nBecause for the cross Australia trip he actually didn't train much, and it went very badly. The guys just in the top 0.1% of will powered human beings. He doesn't know the meaning of the word quit.\n\nHe has been locked in training wise. Gym regularly, and had months of over 200km weeks I believe. Several 100+km runs, including 160km on the track and then backed up with 45km the next day. \n\nWhether that training is enough I’m not sure but he is in great shape\n\nI’ve been watching his live man , he is a different breed , it takes a lot to still have the spirit whilst going through that shit 😳\n\nFor some context, obviously very few people try to run 1,000 miles as quickly as possible. So how hard is this as an ultrarunning record? Well, the longest competitive distance is the six day race, and only 8 people have run &gt;600 miles in six days. Brockmann will have to maintain close to that pace for four more. \n\nIt's bold.\n\nI'm not a runner - this fact, though, mKes me INCREDIBLY suspicious of this 1000 mile record thats stood for 36 years.\n\nIt doesnt pass the eye test to a layman.\n\nThe dude who set it is a legend, pre-Dauwalter era so most of you youngin's haven't heard of him 😉\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiannis_Kouros\n\nKouros is like an absolute legend.\n\ni am almost at a 1000miles for the year (6 to go) and my legs feel tired.\n\nholy crap, I cant even run on the track for 20 mins without getting bored\n\nThat’s because you’re a degenerate ADD screen addicted porn addict! Embrace the true power of nothingness and enlighten yourself 🧎🏾‍♂️\n\nI salute the courage and the sheer audacity of anyone bold enough to even attempt this. Not like the other kids.\n\nFor those not on IG or tik tok and local to the area.\n\nHe will be running on the Sydney Olympic Park ﻿athletic track, meaning he needs to run 403 laps of the 400m track every single day.\n\n\"October 3rd 2024, I'll be attempting to break the world record for the fastest time to cover 1000 miles (1610km) on foot, while aiming to raise 10 million dollars to help Aussies experiencing homelessness in the process,\" he said in an Instagram post in May.\n\n\"The current record stands at 10 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes and 36 seconds.\n\nAnywhere to watch that isn’t Tiktok?\n\nWill he alternate between running clockwise and anti-clockwise on the track? It's very bad to just run and turn one way.\n\nI have run 600 km on a 400m track. we alternated between clockwise and anti-clockwise every eight hours.\n\nHe alternates every 10km and runs in every lane twice\n\nWhat does \"face down ass up\" mean in AUS?  \n\nI don't think it has the same meaning as here in the States.\n\nIt means hard work\n\nNo it doesn’t.\n\nFace down ass up has a very different meaning to me than head down bum up and I don’t know why\n\nWent through 1000km in 7 days 6 hours.\n\nHis daily updates are a bit haphazard (not always saying what he ran for each 24 hour period), but I have him running something like this for the first 7 days\n\nDay 1. 161km\n\nDay 2. 161km\n\nDay 3. 161km\n\nDay 4. 152 km\n\nDay 5. 110km\n\nDay 6. 121km\n\nDay 7. 105km\n\n+ 30km in 6 hours to start Day 8\n\n\nIn other words, not on track to break the record (in fact, not even close)\n\nDid not break the world record. Also doesn't look like he'll break the Australian record of just under 12 days. He'll probably complete the 1000 miles in somewhere between 12-13 days. \n\nHe's gone better than I expected him to, assuming the timing/distance is accurate. But Kouros is a legend for a reason. \n\nAnd he's raised AUD1.8M and counting.\n\nUnfortunately the nature of running on a track for this distance has aggravated some pre-existing injuries and caused some new ones, some of which are pretty gnarly (the pre-existing ones). The long sweeping turns aggravate hip/knee/ankle injuries which is why he’s been alternating direction to minimise impact to one side of the body or the other. Official advice from his medical team is to alternate between a 200 meter walk and a 200 metre very light jog. I think he would’ve been closer if he’d done it the same way as Kouros, but nonetheless it was a massive task.\n\nTrack idea sounds awful. On a flat surface the muscles that you use won’t vary at all. I would think that rolling hills mixed with flat ground, and some sort surfaces, would be much more likely to lead to success.\n\nAll the routes I use to do PRs avoid intersections as much as possible, and then avoid intersections without 4-way stops as much as possible, so I don't have to deal with pause/start and the inevitable slowdown leading up to and away from a stop.  \n\nIf you can find a bike/pedestrian trail with no crossings at grade, that's gold. If you can find one with a loop in it is even better. With two loops so you can alter your scenery without stopping and turning around, that's the best of all.  \n\nI'm pretty good at disappearing into my own head and I don't think I could mentally handle 400 laps of the same circuit. I'm not sure I could handle 100.\n\nHe’s an absolute legend and it’s for a great cause. Very excited to watch and see how he goes.\n\nThis is pretty remarkable. Did a 50 miler on a 1/4 mile track last year without music and it took my mind to many places. Idk if I’d want to do it again.\n\nI’m watching the live stream on tik tok and he’s struggling to say the least, he’s on day 3 with about 60km to go but he needs to sleep at some stage before the next day starts.\n\nI lose track of laps around 5.\n\nGerry Lindgren green with envy at this mileage \n\n16 hrs a day at 6 mph for 10 days. Up at 6am done by 10pm.  I think I could do it for a prize of $57\n\nHaha. Do 100 miles in less than 20 hours first then say you think you could do it.\n\nIt’ll take a MAMMOTH effort to beat Kouros’ record, but it’s good to aim for the stars.\n\nThis is utter insanity! \n\nAnd I hope he breaks the record.\n\nWhat does the master lap mean?\n\n30 laps, 2 in each lane going from lane 8 to 1 then back or vice versa. 12.8km cycle.\n\n8-8-7-7-6-6-5-5-4-4-3-3-2-2-1-1-2-2-3-3-4-4-5-5-6-6-7-7-8-8\n\nIs the only livestream on TikTok?\n\nYeah apparently. I'm not downloading that app just for this.\n\nHellllll no! I’ll just have to deal with daily updates on here. That’s good enough for me\n\nCan I watch it without tictoc? I'm 40 and really don't want to get that app.....\n\nTry clicking on the livestream link on desktop. It seems to work.\n\nClearly a tactic to increase TikTok followers\n\nHe finished the 1000 miles in 12 days, 13 hours and 16 minutes.\n\nHe's obviously got a lot of physical and mental resilience, but his finishing time makes a mockery of the \"world record attempt\" talk.\n\nIt's like a marathoner saying he's going to have a crack at Kiptum's WR and then running a 2:24. Impressive time? Yes. Delusional goal? Also yes.\n\nAlthough I suspect the WR talk was simply to boost eyeballs on his run and he never seriously thought he could break it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI wouldn’t say he has crumbled yet. Bear with\n\n[deleted]\n\nI don't think he will break the record either nor do I think it matters,  but you have to admit when this bloke looks broken he does somehow just keep going..\n\nLove what his doing for the homeless community &amp; respect. Very much dislike his personality though.\n\nWhat’s the problem with his personality? Genuinely curious…\n\nAbsolutely fucking legend.  Get it down brother!\n\nI wonder what Kouros thinks about this.\n\nRemindMe! 11 day\n\nI will be messaging you in 11 days on [**2024-10-15 00:45:01 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2024-10-15%2000:45:01%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1fv5mj1/nedd_brockmann_has_started_his_world_record/lq88dg7/?context=3)\n\n[**3 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Frunning%2Fcomments%2F1fv5mj1%2Fnedd_brockmann_has_started_his_world_record%2Flq88dg7%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202024-10-15%2000%3A45%3A01%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Delete%20Comment&amp;message=Delete%21%201fv5mj1)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&amp;message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&amp;subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|\n\nCommendable attempt, Id have to switch it up and run the other way round the track just for a change or scenery! Isn't there a similar type of run in New York where you run around one block again and again for as long as you can? A\n\nHoo.. not for me but good luck if that's your calling\n\nHow on earth did Yiannis Kouris do it? Back in the 80s without all the physio and recovery aids, not to mention sports/energy supplements that exist today and this Brockman kid was still two days off the record. Not saying it’s not impressive regardless (no way on earth could I do that) but I doubt Kouris had people pushing him in a wheelchair between runs …\n\nNedd is an absolute weapon, I can’t even imagine having 10% of his mental *and* physical resilience.\n\nRemind me! 10 days\n\nOn 3-4 days of the week I have the same running mileage,, but each of those day has to be a different route or I'll go insane.\n\nRunning a billion loops around a single track would just break me after the first 10 laps.\n\nEDIT: LOL, okay, I can see how people misread my comment. I'm not saying I run the same mileage as Nedd. I'm saying I run 16 miles 3-4x a week, hence the same number of miles 3-4x a week.\n\nYou run 100 miles 3-4 days a week?\n\nUgh, okay, I see how people misread that.\n\nI don't run the same mileage as Nedd. I run 16 miles 3-4x a week, hence the same number of miles 3-4x a week.\n\nHoly smokes Batman!"

    "title": "Race report - my first marathon in Paris - Negative split and no wall encountered... did I start too conservatively??",
    "body": "Hello to all of you runners !\n\nFor the context, I am a 47-year old woman, and I live in a small northern European country. I have two teenager kids, which leaves me with more time on my hands than ever before (all they ever want to do is spend time on their screens...), but at the same time I have entered pre-menopause, which means getting used to a different body, energy and recovery.  \n\n\nI used to run competitively from age 10 to 16, and I loved it. I was ranked in the top 10 nationally for 800 meters. But as I got older I got burnt out from all the training and decided to prioritize studies. Fast forward to my adult years, where an occasional run would appear once in a while, but never any race or any structure in my training.   \n\n\nThen after my divorce a few years ago I decided to run again at least twice a week, and last year I ran the 20 kms race in my city. This renewed my love for the sport, for the competition and the electric vibe during races. I then ran 2 half marathons, the last one end of November 2023, which I completed in 1h46 minutes.  \n\n\nI do not know how this idea slowly crept in my mind, but somehow I decided, foolishly, to try and do a marathon. The distance before seemed so unattainable, so scary and only reserved for the crazy, runner high addicted and lanky athletes hahaha   \n\n\nI believe muscles have a memory, and I used to have good endurance in my youth. Why would I feel like an imposter? A boost in my confidence was necessary, I needed to believe in me again, even though I am an older woman and could obviously not return to my youth fitness level. But I could maybe manage to run a marathon under 4 hours? Was I being not humble enough, and too greedy? ;-) I must admit that I have kept from my youth a competitive spirit (against myself, not the others), and I used to push myself and be strong mentally to manage the suffering that comes along.  \n\n\nI started in September 2023 training 4 times a week, and in January 2024 started my marathon training. Always 1 long run, one speed/interval or tempo run, and 2 easy runs (of 10 kms each). An additional training on the elliptical, doing sprints. The average week would be around 55-60 kms, and peaking at 72 kms.   \n\n\nThe long runs were a delight to me. I would put on a podcast and completely enjoy this time for myself. A sort of bubble where I would come back home devoid of stress and appreciate the present time. I was also lucky not to experience any injury. I started to appreciate my body again, for its capacity to run and be healthy, and not just for vain pursuits. I was hungry all the time and even gained a few kilos ;-)  \n\n\nThe taper was however a horrible experience, where my heart rate would be much higher than previously and feeling totally unfit. I was a pain to be around and was anxiously and nervously waiting for the marathon.   \n\n\nThe day of the marathon arrived, and fortunately the weather was perfect, 14/15° and cloudy. I was however scared as hell, about the wall, about having digestive problem during the race ;-), about not being in a good day, about the hills etc etc..\n\nBut waiting in line for a bathroom stop made me relax a bit and even laugh when I saw some women on the side peeing freely, as the lines were way toooo long and not enough bathrooms were provided. ;-)  \n\n\nI read everything I could about the wall, so I decided to start very prudently the 5 first kms, at 5'40 pace. I was also ingesting a maurten gel every 30 min, and bananas at the feeding points. \n\nThe first kilometers were the hardest, mentally and physically. Wtf, still 38 kms to go? Will I ever manage to keep on? Then I slowly accelerated, feeling that going faster was easier for me, enjoying the quieter parts in Bois de Vincennes and I arrived at the half marathon in 1h58. Perfect for a sub 4 marathon.   \n\n\nReaching the half marathon was a huge mental boost, knowing that from now more than half is already done. I kept on accelerating as the kms went on, going through the Paris tunnels (which I had read were difficult, but to me they were surprisingly short haha). Then the 30 kms mark arrived and I was scared shitless, thinking that the wall would descend upon me and that my legs would turn instantly into wood. But this did not happen and I continued accelerating, not even realizing that I had passed the dreaded hill at the 35 kms mark.   \n\n\nMy legs were on automatic pilot, my mind as well, and I was just trying to slalom around the sea of people who were slowing down or walking. The sheer amount of runners was overwhelming and to me this was the most tiring mentally. I had to run through people or zig zag continuously, as the spectators crowds were narrowing the roads once we returned into central Paris. I was determined to reach my goal :-)  \n\n\nReaching 38 kms was great, I knew I would manage to end this marathon, and better than the expected 3h56. I began running at a faster pace and launched a sprint in the last 2 kilometers... I was violet red at that point, but so happy to finish my marathon in 3h50:36.   \n\n\nAs soon as I stopped running my legs turned into wood, but I felt so serene and so proud of myself. Even as a older woman I could still run and even get better with time. I was happy I did not experience any wall (even though I was really tired in the end, I will not lie !) or have an unhappy bathroom situations. Hell, I did not even need to pee once, me who normally goes to the bathroom every hour ;-)\n\nAccording to my boyfriend, I was smelling like death ;-) when we managed to find each other again and it took me ages to walk back to the metro.  \n\n\nThe day after the marathon, my legs were feeling better and I started thinking that maybe my strategy to start conservatively was maybe too conservative? My second half was done in 1h52 minutes, way faster than the first one in 1h58. Should I have started faster? Should I ? Could I reach 3h45? blablabla my mind has not stopped racing since Sunday haha  \n\n\nHere is my race report. I am so proud of having accomplished this marathon and so scared of boring my coworkers and family that I needed to write to a bunch of strangers. Hoped you enjoyed it :-)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "all_comment_text": "Great race report, and great race! That’s a fantastic time, especially given the apparent challenges of the Paris course.\n\nDon’t spend time worrying about what could have been faster — we aren’t alive to maximize perfect efficiency outta every single thing we ever do. You didn’t experience a wall, you didn’t have stomach or bathroom issues, and you negative split the race. It literally couldn’t have gone better; in contrast, if you’d pushed the pace to even splits, maybe one of those things could have flared up into an issue. Who knows! So bask in the glory of a job well done, and for your *next* marathon, you can thing about pushing a little more aggressively during your first half :) But this sub is *littered* with stories from people who get overambitious during their marathon, and pay for it in ~2 hours of misery in the back half of their race. You’re lucky to not be one of them!\n\nThank you so much for your kind and wise words ! You are so totally right about everything and your comment made me realize indeed that I just need to stop and enjoy this precious moment of post marathon glory :-)\n\nYou can go under 3.45 but it doesn't matter that you didn't this time.\n\nTraining, getting your nutrition right and determination stop you hitting the wall.  \n\nPeople say the first 20 miles is just the warm up and the last 6 miles are when the work starts\n\nThank you ! and yes, at the 30kms mark the race really started in my head ;-)\n\nI’m pretty sure that 3:45 would be doable, given your description. Or, given the Boston qualifying threshold for women 45 to 49 is 3:50, a 3:42 race sounds like it would secure you a spot in Boston, if you want a stretch goal!\n\nThanks for your comment ! To be truly honest, that is something that I have been contemplating !\n\nEveryone talks about the negative split, but very few people achieve it. I keep stats for my road runing clubs, and specifically for London Marathon, and in 20 years less than 5% have achieved it, the vast majority women. So you've done really well - you've got your training and nutrition right, and run a sensible race, which is better that most.\n\nCan you run faster? Almost certainly, if only because you'll use what you've learned to improve your training and stategy for the next marathon. Add the cumulative fitness effect of marathon cycles and I think most people don't start to reach their potential until their 3rd marathon.\n\nWaw, thanks, your comment is reassuring and I am very pleased to be in the 5% ;-) \n\nIt definitely helped to have run slower the first half, as I did not feel like I was ran over by a bus during the second half like I have read in some race reports. Those reports made me really scared to be honest hahaha\n\nEver notice the number of people who say 'I was on schedule to 20 miles then it went wrong'. What most of them should be saying is 'I went too fast for the first 20 miles' or 'I ignored what my training told me and set a target that was too fast'. Read the reports from people who hit their targets - they're often quite dull because if you get it right then it should be dull - you simply run 26 miles at the same pace then attempt a little sprint at the end with varying degrees of success!\n\nExcellent race report ! Thanks for sharing ! \n This year the Seine was overflowing so for safety they moved the portion usually run in a tunnel under les tuileries to a higher road segment that was open air (the long park alongside the  Louvre). This year there were only a couple of short tunnels afterwards. This may explain why you felt very different to what you read online. Having done  '23 and '24, clearly the '24 itinerary is better, the tunnel is super long, gets the gps all wonky and the darkness can be difficult to manage mentally for some (myself included) so far into the race. \nCongrats on your time, managing negative splits is very impressive  in such distance !\n\naaaahhh thanks for the info, now I completely understand why people were so afraid of that tunnel ! I actually did not like the feeling in the tunnel with the neon lights, so I would have not enjoyed the longer one you described. I hope you had a good marathon too ! The crowds were so supportive and amazing, I did not expect that at all !\n\nWas there a DJ in the tunnel? The year I did it there was a dance party!\n\nYep there was indeed!! With some neon lights\n\nOh man, there was??? I only saw the neon lights ;-) I must have been completely spaced out in my head hahaha\n\nI would not blame you for being spaced out with those rolling hills 😅\n\nThanks for sharing your report! You can absolutely run faster. But please thoroughly enjoy what you just accomplished, because it is fantastic! \n\n I ran a marathon when I was 31, and had a 10:10 min/mile pace.  In general though I was not running races at all, until now.  I'm 59 F  and my pace is improving. I added in core workouts &amp; take a 4-5 day break of no running about every 5 weeks.  Muscle memory is a thing. \n\n I just started adding in races. My 15k was a 9:40 min/mile pace and the 5k portion of that race was 9:15 min/mile which is not fast, but for me, kind of a shock. \n\nI'm glad you didn't hit the wall (I didn't either in my marathon).  It sounds like you're on track for another amazing race in your future!\n\nThank you so much for your comment and for showing me that we can still improve, no matter what age we are, as long as we put the work. You are doing amazing as well, we can do this ! :-)\n\nYes!! We can do this! : )  I love knowing how resilient and responsive our bodies are when we put in the work. : )\n\nI love this and what running has done for you! Fueling and starting conservatively saved you from the dreaded wall! Congrats on a great race!\n\nThank you, you can be immensely proud of your achievements! Well done!\n\nWell done, you obviously trained the right way!\n\nYou sound like someone destined to be hanging out in /r/ultramarathon in about a year.\n\nHaha who knows?\n\nA good runner who has more time these days was made to sign up for their first 50k :)\n\nThank you OP and well done! I’m inspired by your story!\n\nthank you so much !\n\nCongrats on an awesome race! Fantastic report!\n\nFantastic time for a first marathon - congratulations! You must have excellent biomechanics, among other things.\n\nAnd to answer your question - it's *much* better to finish your first marathon with a little \"in the tank,\" than the opposite, i.e. \"running out of gas\" with a few ~~miles~~ km still remaining.\n\nThank you ! I definitely think that having started running in my childhood has made it easier (re. developing muscle fibers, tendons, etc) than for someone who started running in their adult years.\n\nMany childhood athletes either burn out, or develop serious overuse injuries - at least in the US. You seem to have found a good middle path.\n\nThat is so great! Well done! I feel inspired.\n\nCongrats! This is really reassuring to someone running their first marathon like me. Would you mind if I ask you what's the longest long run you've done? I've done 30kms once and am wondering if that's sufficient or should I go further.\n\nHello !\n\nThe longest distance I have run was 29 kms once. I also ran 27 kms once, one 25 kms, and two 24 kms. So not a whole lot, and this also caused me to worry that I was not enough prepared, especially when I saw that some people ran twice 32 kms.....\n\nBut my plan did not let me run more than 3 hours for the longest run, saying that running longer was not beneficial. I would therefore not worry. We have ran those 29/30 kms on tired legs, and on your marathon, with fresh legs and adrenaline, you will find the resource to finish your first marathon !\n\nBest of luck ! 🤗"

So despite not necessarily feeling qualified to contribute, I thought I would. For context, I very much see myself as an average runner - not a huge amount of natural talent. I started running in 2018 when I got a spot to run the London Marathon. It was a hot day and my inexperience showed as I ran over 5 hours (my goal was 4:30 at the time). Since then, I’ve trained consistently and whittled my marathon time down over the years - going sub-4:30 then sub-4, sub-3.45, sub 3:40 etc.\n\nAnd then yesterday I had a unicorn race and ran 3:27 in London.\n\nI’m still slightly in shock.\n\nThroughout the race I struggled massively with imposter syndrome - ‘who do you think you are trying to do this? Everyone knows you’re not really a fast runner’. But somehow pushed those thoughts to one side and actually achieved my sub-3:30 goal.\n\nHere’s how I managed to pull it off.\n\n# Training\n\nI came into 2024 after a really strong year of running. I’d ran PBs in every distance and could feel that I was reaping the benefits of training properly for a number of years. At the end of 2023, I’d used the Runna App to train for the Valencia Marathon (where I ran 3:34:45) but hadn’t been very ‘on it’ for the first month or so and only really used it to inspire my sessions rather than as a full plan. So I thought for London, I’d do it properly and do a full Runna training plan for 16 weeks.\n\nI would say I followed the plan to about 85%. Averaging 50 miles a week and maxing at 62. I was sick twice during the training cycle and although I only had to take one week off, there were 3 weeks where, although I hit the prescribed volume, I didn’t get any intensity in.\n\nReflections on the Runna plan. I think it was good and pushed me to run paces I never would have braved alone. But their easy run pace is way too fast and some of the long run sessions are really hard (e.g. 21 miles with 16 miles MP in week 12).\n\nI knew that sessions like that would likely destroy me so I would break up the MP sections - e.g. if it said 9 miles MP, I’d do 3 x 3 miles instead. This worked better for me. The longest section of MP I did mid-long run was 10k and that felt more than enough considering the other volume and intensity in the week.\n\nIn all honesty, my training felt like a solid 8/10. I’d not had any magical sessions where everything clicked, no PBs in the run up, and no single run that made me feel invincible. But I’d ticked all the basics off and not had a single ‘bad’ run - just a consistent string of average to good ones.\n\nI did a final session on the Wednesday before marathon day, 2 x 2k @ MP (7:55/mi for block 1, 7:52/mi block 2) - it felt reassuringly smooth. I was ready, I felt good.\n\n# Race plan\n\nI’ve done a number of marathons now, and my best performances have come when I’ve ran on effort and tried to break up the race - so that was the plan for London.\n\nI decided to keep HR around 165 - 168 until about 20 miles where I’d let it naturally creep up past 170. My thought was, if I’m on pace at that HR, great - if not then reassess. I find the psychological impact of blowing up at mile 20 worse than being slower than planned but having a strong, evenly paced race. I also decided to break the race up as 3mi steady, 4 x 5 miles @ pace, 3mi progression to finish (if possible).\n\n# Race\n\nThe pen: I found the pen incredibly stressful. I somehow picked the wrong toilet queue and ended up waiting for 45 minutes. I almost missed bag drop and had to give my bag to the wrong lorry as my assigned one had already locked up despite the fact that there were still so many runners in the pen yet to start. It wasn’t ideal. I had a bit of a wobble but had a brief chat with my partner who was spectating. He told me to not let it psych me out and just relax. I listened to him and took a deep breath.\n\nMiles 1 - 3: As planned I started steady and clocked the first 2 miles at just over 8 mins each. This was good. The first 5k felt more undulating than I remembered but I kept my effort steady then on the big downhill to Woolwich I noticed pace drop to 7:40s. I didn't panic, I just kept the same effort as I knew I’d slow down once on the flat again.\n\nMiles 3 - 8: These miles were cruisey with nothing much to report. The crowds were insane and I got all emotional running through Cutty Sark and past my old flat. It really is a magical part of the course.\n\nMile 8 - 15: To be honest I didn't enjoy miles 8 - 14. It felt too hard early on. But my HR was steady and well within the limits I set myself.\n\nOn reflection I think it was mental rather than physical. I was starting to realise that this was actually quite hard and I had waves of self doubt and imposter syndrome. It was pretty miserable.\n\nAt mile 10, I saw a group of 3:30 pacers and decided to stick with them. I just tagged on for the ride and let them set the pace.The power of the group for pacing was great, but it was so crowded - lots of near misses tripping over feet and I almost missed a few drinks stops as I was on the wrong side of the road. Not sure I’d choose to run with one again unless I needed a peloton style boost.\n\nJust before mile 13 we went over Tower Bridge which was amazing (if a little overwhelming). I’m a bit annoyed with myself that I was wallowing a bit as we went over so I didn't actually take it all in - especially as I was wallowing over nothing…\n\nMile 15 - 19: At mile 15 I was still with the massive group of 3:30 runners but noticed I was starting to naturally move through the pack. Not aggressively, but steadily - I was getting a second wind. I decided to go with it, and see what happened.\n\nThe miles around Canary Wharf (again insane crowds) still felt hard but no harder than it did at mile 9 in reality. This has been a method I’ve used in past races - when your brain tells you it’s hurting, tune in and ask, is it really any more painful than before? Often it’s not, it’s just you're getting tired of hurting. That means there’s no excuse to stop or slow down as you’ve got this far at the same pain level. Tough love.\n\nMiles 19 - 23: I still felt like I was running strong and was really trying to focus on the crowds at this point. I loved the vibes on Rainbow Row with Rundem Crew - such a fun part of the marathon if you’re able to tune out how you're feeling! There were lots of people around me starting to slow and walk but managed to keep going and dodge around them.\n\nIt’s also at this point that you pass runners on the other side of the road who are later in the pack. I saw the 4:15 pacer on the other side go past and enjoyed passing the time trying to spot anyone I might know. I didn’t!\n\nMile 23 - 25: I went through mile 23 in 3:02 and knew sub 3:30 would be on even if the pace slipped a little, but was determined to keep it as long as I could. I was feeling stronger as the race went on.\n\nWhen you get onto Embankment, it starts to feel like the race is done, but it's really not. I forgot just how long that stretch is! There were lots of people stopping around me but I was determined to just press ahead - not looking at my watch - just run. Taking in the atmosphere and loving the crowds.\n\nAt mile 25 I saw my old running club supporting on the sidelines - just before Big Ben and the tiny uphill to the finish. It gave me the boost and confidence to press the pace into the 7:30s for the final mile.\n\nThe last mile: As we turned the corner at Big Ben, I was really pushing as much as I could, although aware if I went too hard I could burn out. I knew the next marker would be the 600m to go sign - which felt like it might never arrive. But then it did and was shortly followed by the 350 yards to go. I looked at my watch, tried to do some quick maths to work out what I needed to run, but completely failed. The strategy was - ‘just go as fast as you can’.\n\nOver the line in 3:27:38 - a 7 min PB in 4 months and most importantly a strong, well-paced race (18 second negative split).\n\n# Post-race\n\nI'm obviously over the moon. I never would have dreamed I was capable of running a time like that a few years ago.\n\nMy dad always says, ‘Hard work always beats natural talent, when natural talent doesn’t do hard work’. And I think my trajectory is proof of that. By gradually building cycle upon cycle I’ve ran times I thought were unattainable. And I’m actually so proud of myself.\n\nAs for the rest of the year, I’m booked onto Valencia again in 2024 and will see if there’s more time to squeeze out of my 3:27 - so I guess we’ll have to wait and see. In the meantime, I’m looking forward to having fun at some shorter, local races near me - maybe even some fell racing as I’m based in the Peak District. I’m absolutely loving racing and training though - and looking forward to what the future might hold.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

    "all_comment_text": "I jusy want to say I think your imposter syndrome showing again, you are definitely not an average runner. Every single one of your 5k splits is faster than I've ever run 5k, and you've got a GFA time for next year.\n\n\nWell done, you absolutely smashed it. \n\nThank you, that’s kind of you to say. When I say ‘average’ I suppose I mean physically. I’m not naturally fast and was not remotely sporty growing up - I just put the work in and trust the process\n\nThis gives me so much hope! As someone who only found sports at 25+ years, and then running at 30+, and who is not AT ALL a fast runner, I am so inspired by you. I hope that can be me someday!\n\nAwesome write up, and hugely inspiring for someone like me who would love to hit that sort of time.\n\nThanks for sharing. As a current 5hr+ runner I'm inspired that there's a chance to cut my time by such a large margin. But then again I'm over 40 so maybe that window has passed? Anyway, I'm aiming for sub-5 at the end of the year.\n\nLove this, congrats!  It's race week for me, so emotions are high - I found my eyes welling up reading this!\n\nGood luck!\n\nThis is incredibly awesome and inspiring. I've been running for years (slowly - I am still chasing that 30 minute 5K) and never really thought I even wanted to do a marathon, much less be able to do one - but all the content coming out of London this past week is making me think crazy thoughts. You absolutely smashed it! Congrats!!\n\nGreat write-up! As a female runner myself, it's inspiring to see what can be achieved with some hard work. Btw, you are definitely not just an average runner. Loved the tough love mentality!\n\nCongratulations, you killed it!\n\n\nThank you for sharing this! I have a marathon Sunday and it was nice seeing a female race report and bonus....we have the same goals! I don't think I'll hit the 3:30 mark but hoping to get my 3:45 or strong race goal. Congratulations and good luck on your future races \n\nGood luck!\n\nGreat report! Congrats on the PB!! It’s actually uncanny how much it feels like I could have written this too, so many similarities, including with using Runna (and finding the easy paces WAY too fast, and pushing the harder paces way beyond what you think you can do). I also ran 3.27 at London last year!!\nYour splits are obscenely good. I think you vastly underestimate how hard it is to run that consistently for the marathon. You should be incredibly proud, a tonne of people would love to have that sort of stamina. \nYour openess around imposter syndrome really spoke to me, I struggle with it too as a female runner. It doesn’t go away, but the strength you cultivate by being in those spaces is unlike any other. Please keep going and standing on those start lines, because seeing other women there gives me strength too. \nCongratulations, I’m so pleased for you.\n\nThank you for this. And congrats on your continued progression as well. It’s great to see other female runners hitting goals and lining up on the start line\n\nImpressive!! Congratulaions and thanks for this very nice Report!\n\nThank you for sharing!!! I’m also a female runner and am running my second full marathon on Sunday and going for a BQ + 5 min buffer. \nI was not a gifted athlete growing up and find myself having doubts that I can run the 3:45 that I need to get into Boston (my previous and first full marathon last October I ran a 3:53) so I need to shave off 8 minutes. I’m very inspired by your report and will remember that quote from your dad!\n\nGood luck! Trust yourself and your training and I’m sure you’ll have a great time out there. My dad will be delighted his words of wisdom are getting traction online 😂\n\nThank you 😊\n\nCongratulations! Thank you so much for writing this. \n\nI've run one half marathon and I think I'm probably a similar speed and situation to where you started out. I always keep an eye out on reddit for stories of what women my speed accomplish over time and often don't find much - often the ones I see are from people who clearly had a natural talent starting out or chose to keep things casual very long term. It's incredibly inspiring to see what you've been able to do with years of consistency and hard work, and I've bookmarked this as inspiration.\n\nReally nice write up and big congratulations on the great run 🥳\n\nFantastic! Thanks for the insightful race report. I appreciated all of the mental gymnastics you were playing. I also ran a 3:27 a few weeks ago after dealing with some major imposter syndrome. I read a book called The Confident Mind by Nate Zinsser and it really helped me get into the right mindset before my race. Maybe it could help you on the road to Valencia\n\nThanks for the recommendation - I'll have to look at that!\n\nThank you for sharing :) \n\nThat’s fantastic!!! Well done for pushing through and completing it in such a great time 🥰 I really enjoyed your race report. I’m just an amateur who recently took up running (and is currently suffering from an ankle injury so I haven’t been able to get out there for a few weeks) and I’m miles off ever being able to run a marathon, so I’m amazed at your performance!!\n\nCongratulations! Great race report and a really impressive performance - I hope you feel proud of what you have achieved here!\n\nThe thing about this sub is that everyone is qualified to contribute.  We're all equal here!  Amazing, amazing job, your race is inspiring!  Enjoy basking in the glow of a job well done!\n\nGreat running and writeup!\n\nGreat achievement and write up, congratulations\n\nloved the writeup! Any more feedback around Runna? Im pretty new and its the app ive chosen to help with training.\n\n(Yes ive considered books and whatever else. ive chosen Runna already!)\n\nI think Runna is a really great tool and definitely helped me to run this pb. It had me running tempo and threshold paces much faster than I would have dared set myself and it made me feel much more confident. The reason I went for Runna was that a year ago I had just ran 3:37 in the marathon, ran a 1:38 half and thought about getting a coach to help me achieve the ‘next level’. \n\nRunna seemed like a good halfway house to getting some external input without the cost or commitment of full coaching. I never struggle to get out the door, or have issues with accountability, so I was really just looking for training inspiration. I think I benefited from my past experience of training as I knew if Runnas sessions would be too much (and how to tweak them), and knew when to skip runs, move things around etc. \n\nOverall I would recommend it as a tool but would advise not being a slave to the app and use it as a helpful guide rather than a source of ultimate truth. And whilst they were pretty much correct with the predictions for my finish time in the marathon, the other race predictions were way too optimistic (it’s going to take a hell of a lot of time before I run a 19 minute 5k…)\n\nwow, amazing. thanks! i was a little taken back by the price but it sounds like its worth it. Just finished week 1 and enjoying it so far!\n\nI think with these predictions you have to take some distances with a pinch of salt because you haven’t been doing race specific training for them.\n\nIn your case, you have obviously put a lot of effort into marathon training which would focus more on endurance, and less time into shorter, very fast workouts that would help bring a 5k time down.\n\nI have been the opposite, my 5k time is respectable (but not 19 minutes yet!!) and I would trust my Runna predicted time, but I wouldn’t be able to hit my marathon predicted time at the moment because my longest race has been 10k.\n\nI reckon you wouldn’t take too long to get down to 19 minute 5k if you trained specifically for it.\n\nedit: I forgot to say, congratulations on a solid marathon time!!\n\nI know I’m not the OP but I’ve used Runna for over a year now. I’ve done two marathon cycles with it and the training took my marathon time from 3:41 &gt; 3.27 &gt; 3.12 in 18 months. \nIt’s really easy to use, it’s challenging, I really think it’s the next best thing to a personal running coach and a fraction of the price. I’d recommend it to anyone and everyone.\n\nahh amazing, thanks for the feedback! its a little pricey so i was in two minds about subscribing but this is really helpful!\n\nI use Runna also. Beyond the coaching it has mobility and strength exercises part of the app which I’ve really enjoyed and think it’s made me a stronger runner (good for recovery too).\n\nGreat write up! Just to note it says 2023!\n\nOops! Good catch 😅\n\nHow old are you? Any thoughts of doing Boston?\n\nI’m 29 so this is technically a BQ but not sure if there’s enough of a buffer to actually get me in the race. I need to have a think about what I want to do next. I’d been so focussed on going under 3:30 this year, I hadn’t really considered what to do if it actually happened! \n\nI suppose I can always put in for it, see what happens and then make a decision if I need to!\n\nLondon Marathon was my first Marathon and reading this it seems like we had very similar experiences! I ran a 4:14 marathon though so a-lot slower. I want to ask, what did your first marathon look like? How long has it taken you to shave down the time and up the pace? I could only dream of running at your pace rn, but I want to get there eventually!\n\nA lot of hard work and a big payoff, hope you feel good because you deserve it!\n\nThanks so much for a great race report ! It is so helpful and hopeful to see how much you can progress, just by doing the work, not deviating from your routine and being disciplined. It is strange how we women go through this imposter syndrome so much, for no apparent reason.... Well done pacing in an intelligent manner and for pushing through when things got difficult ! You can be really proud of yourself, and you have an amazing future ahead of you !\n\nWell done an amazing time, which start were you at? I was at Blue and it did feel slightly chaotic at times plus that wind was freezing\n\nI was in yellow and I think I was pretty much the last person in the toilet queue in the end despite joining well before the race start 🙈\n\nCongrats on the PB! I was also racing London on Sunday and the last few miles felt like an age, especially since I couldn’t see the ‘1 mile to go’ sign! \n\nI also trained for London using the Runna app and I agree that the easy paces are far too fast and times shouldn’t be in the app at all. I also had a monster long run within the app around the same time as you and same kind of splits, which was quite hard as a first time marathoner."

I was actively discouraged by my parents from any physical activity because they thought it was a distraction from academic pursuits. As I learned more about health, I realised that I needed to make changes – for me this mostly revolved around better eating habits as my study and work made it difficult for me to commit to sports and I hated running due to bad experiences at school (dead last in every annual  compulsory school cross country run).\n\nThe geek in me became curious in the Nike+iPod Sport Kit in the late 2000s as a way for me to passively log steps/jogging and eventually I decided to sign up for a half marathon for the “achievement”. Achievement unlocked, completing this in an incredible 1:51 hours (goal was to complete the course before it closed off behind me).\n\nA decade later, I realised that I had not pushed on with the positive habit, and fell back into a sedentary job and life. Keen to avoid health complications, I signed up for the same half-marathon event in my city and again surpassed all expectations (thanks Coach Bennett and Coach Cory!) to complete this in a faster time of 1:48. I started to get into more running events and decided to do the Queenstown half-marathon. However I fell in love with the full marathon course and decided to change “never” to “maybe” and eventually signed up for the full distance.\n\n \n\n**Training**\n\nI looked online at the wealth of available training programmes. Many coaches were willing to guide me – at a cost – and I decided I was prepared to pay. However the hard sell was really getting to me, especially the evangelical followers from some coaching programmes. A kind coach reached out to me and told me I seemed to possess enough knowledge and intelligence to do it myself. While I did not end up compiling my own training programme, I felt that the Nike Run Club base knowledge that I had acquired from Coach Bennett, combined with common sense, would allow me to tackle Pfitzinger 18/55 as a first-time marathon runner (previous Redditors had done the same successfully as long as they were sensible).\n\nIt's true what they say that the work of the marathon is in the training. The reason I had said “never” in the past for doing a marathon was the time involved as a slower runner. Long runs on Sunday took up to 4 hours out of my busy schedule, and I ended up spending much of Sunday afternoons eating, drinking, toileting, eating, drinking and toileting on constant repeat.\n\nFurthermore, I had started to do Intermittent Fasting aka Time Restricted Eating in the period before my marathon training started 18 weeks out. I had intended to stop this if needed but found a way to continue this. I’m not sure that this was the smartest idea in the world nutrition-wise, but I now have an unbroken streak of 16+ hour fasts for the past 183 days and going strong – including marathon race day.\n\nThe hardest part of the training was ironically not the training itself. It was actually fitting in the training around my life. In the end, it was like picking up another part-time job. It threw my life upside down but because I had committed to the training and the race, I had to find a way. Not being a morning person, I suddenly had to change my body clock for morning runs to ensure that I could get my training runs in before work because I found it too hard to do runs while tired and hungry. Eventually I hit a period where some Sunday mornings I would need to be ready for work by 8 am. Getting up to start runs at 3 am was completely out of my comfort zone, but I had made a commitment that I needed to uphold. I switched from Apple to a Garmin watch last year and I paid close attention to hydration and sleep in order to support and sustain this intense training programme (and never once became sick, due to looking after myself so well).\n\nI had to overcome many mental barriers as already outlined. Another one was running in the rain. I HATE running in the rain. “But what if rains on race day?” Of course I would run if it rains on race day!\n\nObviously it’s logistically challenging to plan 4-hour training runs around days of the week, work, and weather. I got wet – including getting drenched on some 20-mile runs. I learned how to clean and dry running shoes.\n\nCoach Bennett and everyone knows that training never goes perfectly to plan – and that’s ok. Somehow I managed to get through 18 weeks of Pftiz “perfectly” – every run was completed as I had no injury (I made sure all easy runs were done easy, with a chest strap HRM to help guide me) and no illness (I put this down to ensuring I had plenty of sleep and I tried to increase my intake of healthier foods).\n\n \n\n**Pre-race**\n\nPerfection ground to a hard stop on the eve of the race. I was scheduled to fly into Queenstown at 5 pm, allowing me a few hours to settle down and early to bed for a 4 am breakfast for the 8:20 am start. We were delayed and went to touch down just after 6 pm.\n\nWe had been warned about heavy winds in Queenstown. What I was not aware of was that this was enough for our landing to be aborted. After what felt like 5 minutes or more, the pilot informed us that they were “not confident” to try to land again, so we were heading back to Wellington (a 10-hour drive away after a 4-hour ferry ride).\n\nI was getting set to hold a pity party for myself but moments later my thoughts instead went out to the many on board who, like me, had been training for months and who had just had their dreams crushed. What made my situation any more special than theirs?\n\n“Find a way” is a recurring theme when it comes to marathons, training and preparations. I was fast running out of options as our flight was due to return to its origin at 7:23 pm and there were precious remaining flights connecting Wellington to the South Island of New Zealand where the race was taking place.\n\nMy outside hopes of making the 7:45 pm flight to Dunedin (a 4-hour drive from Queenstown) became a reality when I discovered upon landing that this flight had been delayed. I reached out to random strangers who had been on the same flight and found 3 marathoners (2 first-timers like me) who were prepared to take a gamble on me and I managed to get them onto the same flight.\n\nMy father delivered a car to Dunedin airport and we commenced our impromptu road trip, getting to know each other for the first time as we had not been seated together on the flight. Driving safely and within the road speed limits, the time passed in a flash and very soon we arrived in Queenstown at 1:30 am. I gave myself a precious extra 15 minutes of sleep and got up at 4:15 am to fuel and prepare for what was to come.\n\n \n\n**Race**\n\nOut of curiosity, I checked my Garmin in the pre-race zone. It said 9% and “no sleep detected” from that morning. I felt exhausted but not tired. I had worked for months for this and was one of the lucky few from the aborted flights to have made it this far. I told myself that I could not waste this chance and would dedicate the run to all those unable to make the starting line.\n\nI listened to all the helpful pre-race advice from everyone here. I started slow, pulling myself back if my pace crept up. I drank at every aid station (except the one with a full table of empty cups……). I got into a good rhythm and felt strong.\n\nI have never felt cramp before, so was surprised when I started to feel minor cramping at 12 miles. \"Mind over matter,\" I told myself. Don't waste your mental capacity thinking about it.\n\nThe running coach who had helped me along the way said \"run a series of 5km\" rather than 42km. \"A series of 5km bites is far easier to mentally handle than 42km in one gulp\". At 15 miles, and feeling strong, I decided to dial up my effort very slightly. My average pace of 9:22 min/mi made sub-4 a realistic possibility with my splits starting to pick up speed. At 18 miles I was still feeling strong with plenty in the tank, and I passed a lot of runners who had stopped due to cramp. Unfortunately at around 20 miles, my legs also started to seize up.\n\n“A marathon is a 20-mile jog with a 12-mile run at the end,” they said. I had a 20-mile jog with a 12-mile \\*limp\\* at the end. I had to push through a lot of pain to keep going. I knew I had to hydrate but also knew I could not stop – every time I slowed down at the aid stations to get electrolytes, I could feel my legs cramping up badly.\n\nBy 21 miles I knew that I could not get sub-4, so told myself just to keep putting one foot in front of the other. I quickly did the math in my head and even though I had slowed down to 11:15 min/mi, I would still be able to get under 4:15 hrs – that was the goal time all the way back before I had started training and would still be a huge achievement given the events leading up to my arrival to Queenstown.\n\nThe final 3 miles were the worst. Not only because of the obvious, but because there was little to no atmosphere on this section of course. I have seen others post about this too. While there were supporters along this section, most were quietly waiting for their loved ones to cheer on. This section knocked the wind out of my sails and it was mentally brutal as my left ankle also decided to cramp up. Mile by painful mile I struggled through the final section at a progressively slower pace. I could hear music and cheering ahead of me in the distance, and desperately powered forward yearning to once again receive encouragement from random strangers.\n\nAs I arrived at the playground on Queenstown Beach, I looked around to see families and children engrossed in their own activities. I would need to push on further for the support I was so desperately seeking. Road cones were set up on the esplanade, and as I looked up I saw crowds holding up support signs and making noise. That noise gradually built up as I progressed, and very soon I felt no pain in the legs. I have gone from last in every school cross country to researching running online and watching two Olympic marathon races this year.\n\nThis felt like running at the Paris Games and I threw my arms up in the air in celebration, which fuelled the crowd noise even further. Garmin says that my final 0.5 miles was completed in 9:01 min/mi.\n\n \n\n**Post-race**\n\nAt the finish line, I picked up my phone from the bag collection and quickly logged in to see how my new marathon friends Louise, Doug and Elaine were doing. \"No Timing Data\", each reported. What had happened? Had they slept in? Had the travel overwhelmed them? I was reluctant to reach out to them in case they were feeling any shame in having made the epic journey to Queenstown only to DNS. This kept gnawing away at me and eventually I plucked up the courage to TXT Louise in the late afternoon with “What happened with your crew today? Are you all ok?”\n\nLouise quickly fired back a reply saying that they had all finished and were at the Speights Ale House – just around the corner from where I happened to be! Within seconds we were reunited in each other's arms. Afterwards, Louise messaged to say \"Meisha our friend was almost in tears seeing you with us in the restaurant\", later adding \"Can't believe we all did it considering the circumstances.\"\n\nAt the end of the weekend, I transited through Wellington and looked for Lucy from Air NZ who had helped secure us all on the last-minute flight to Dunedin. She wasn't working but I told our story to her colleagues and they sent her a photo of the finisher's medal. Lucy was thrilled to hear the ending of the story, and hopefully, this story inspires some of you in the same way that other runners’ stories have inspired me.\n\nWhy did I restart running? It wasn't to race or achieve any PBs. It was purely for physical and mental health/well-being. While I still haven't fallen in love with running, I cannot deny that I have never regretted having gone for a run – even those \"bad runs\". As Nike Coach Cory says – we end each run as a more elite version of ourselves. Remember that you are only in a race with yourself. Embrace the supportive running community and be kind to each other. Help each other along the way as we never know whether one day we ourselves will need to rely upon a fellow runner to get us to our next starting line.\n\nI do believe I have been changed for the better. And because I knew you, I have been changed for good.",

Great job getting through it all in tough circumstances.\n\nThis is quite possibly the best race report I’ve ever read here on Reddit. Bravo, OP! \n\nwhat a thread title!\n\nCongratulations, this is a very inspiring post!\nShows how mindset is important. Personally the Garmin body battery data is often accurate for me and I can’t imagine what it must be like to run so tired. I will keep that in mind next time I feel off and I have a long run planned.\n\nWild. Makes flying in a day early seem like a really great idea for this reason.\n\nNot something I would have thought about. Day of work etc etc. But this really does make me think especially if I have been training for 6 months for it!!\n\nI was pretty gutted hearing about those cancelled flights. Well done making it regardless!\n\nI think you deserve two medals for the effort.\n\nWonderful adventure, wonderful post\n\nExcellent report, and way to persevere both to the start line and to the ffinish!\n\nWell done!\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf you are in Australia/NZ, then I’m lead to believe that this is one of the most beautiful in the world/at least the region. So being accessible, it is definitely worth considering. I’ve looked around the world (as naturally one does when curious lol) and many big city marathons are entirely within city bounds (of course). Making Queenstown somewhat different. I’ve also started looking at the more exotic locations. \n\nI’m still undecided if I can continue to consider 42km. 21-30km is much more achievable with less training load/less taxing on the ageing body. Things to think about! All the best with your personal running journey ☺️\n\nAhhh! Ran my first 10k today after recovering from an injury and I’m just sitting here bawling at your story. Congratulations on your tenacity- that will take you far in running and everywhere else too!\n\nLove this race report.\n\nWill add to what everyone else is saying - this was an excellent race report, and really inspiring too! Running my first official marathon next weekend, and so was really happy to read this post today. Full credit to you - amazing effort given the situation! Way to be.\n\nAll the best for your run! This is just a very small way that I can give back to the supportive running community that has given me so much health and knowledge. As I said, your hard work is getting to the start line so next weekend once the gun goes, ENJOY yourself as much as you can 🥰\n\nComing back to this post to say: thanks! I got the sub-4 I was hoping for, and I did think about your ordeal in the days / hours before (\"If that person can do it, with everything they had to deal with, surely I can too\"). I enjoyed \\*most\\* of it. Now to rest!\n\nCongrats and thanks for reporting back in! Enjoy your rest ☺️\n\nGreat report, thank you for sharing. \nYou sound like the embodiment of discipline and positive mindset, an inspiration to follow.\n\nI’ve been inspired by those breaking barriers before me and am doing what I can to give back to the community as we all move forward positively 🥰\n\nGreat report and read! Congrats! Also this reinforces my idea of coming in a couple days ahead of time for Berlin next year. lol\n\nGood luck for Berlin! Yes for international and “important” events it will really make me think about arriving 2 days ahead at least now!\n\n&gt;Louise quickly fired back a reply saying that they had all finished and were at the Speights Ale House – just around the corner from where I happened to be!

    "all_comment_text": "I carry pepper gel and a safety alarm. the alarm has a pin and when pulled it makes this *awful* screeching noise and doesn’t stop until the pin is replaced. I have a lot more faith in the alarm than the gel (I can’t stress enough how horribly loud it is), but carrying both makes me feel at least a little better. I’m so sorry this happened to you!\n\nYes! I got one from Amazon... it's a terrible noise!!! Just for  attacker to stop 2 seconds to worder what that is can be enough to get away\n\nThey’re called sound bombs for anyone looking. They are impossible to ignore, especially if animals are around.\n\nis there a brand you recommend?\n\nis there a brand you recommend?\n\nLink?\n\nHonestly, don't use the alarm. People will just filter that noise out in the background. Scream HELP I'M GETTING ATTACKED, HELP. Nobody can ignore that. Even if they are afraid to help they'll probably call the police\n\nPor que no los dos\n\nUSA?\n\nWhy wouldn’t gun be the sensible answer here?\n\nRunning with a gun?  Sounds terribly uncomfortable, difficult to carry in running clothes, and frankly dangerous.\n\nDangerous. A person is being attacked, and them carrying a gun is dangerous?\n\nNope, there are plenty of small firearms that can easily be stowed comfortably while running with a proper holster.\n\nHighly dependent on the state's laws and trying to run long distances with a firearm seems pretty difficult.\n\nBecause fuck off with your guns. They’re not the answer to any of these questions\n\nWhen a woman is trying to fight a man 3 times her weight then a gun is very much the only way she’s winning that.\n\nA gun is the way she's getting shot, with that gun.\n\nIn this corner, we have a woman with a holstered firearm who has already been attacked and physically overpowered by her assailant. And in this corner we have her assailant who now has an unholstered sidearm and... yep fight's over.\n\nlol you’re delusional. No way in this situation the woman isn’t getting shot\n\nMost of the major cities in the US are in states that have pretty restrictive gun laws, likely OP can't get a CCW. (New York, Chicago/IL, and LA,SF/CA all come to mind.) It's hard to know for certain without knowing which city were talking about.\n\nHonestly it's depressing seeing all these people against a firearm for a woman's safety, all speaking for her. \n\nIt's for the OP to decide if they want to use one to be safe, not random Redditors that have never touched a gun in their life. \n\nMy wife and I both run, we also both carry in an Enigma holster just fine.\n\nHigh quality pepper spray for non firearm people is the only other option.\n\nFormer cop here\nPepper spray is good but don't get the foam kind. It can actually be wiped off and thrown back at you.\n\nWhere I am from it’s illegal to carry 😭 we need “wolf/cyote or bear mace”  but I can’t imagine someone throwing the shit back at me 😭 awful\n\nProtecting yourself is illegal?!?  You need to move asap!!\n\nJust Canada things\n\nWe just play the “it’s for wildlife” game 😂\n\nI’m so sorry that happened to you but I’m so glad you’re okay!\n\nI would say yes to the pepper gel (go for gel, not spray, because it’s less likely to blow back in your face), but no to anything like a knife/“stabby ring” since if that gets turned on you it could be deadly, especially if you aren’t well trained on whatever weapon you’re carrying.\n\nOne of the best things you can do is have someone watching your location tracking (my husband can check on me via find my for example) and make sure someone knows generally where you will be and when to expect you back. Don’t ever get too into a routine of the same routes/times either so you aren’t predictable if someone is watching. And of course always stay alert. I do wear AirPods but I make sure they’re always on transparency mode and my head is constantly on a swivel.\n\nI also always have my watch handy that is capable of emergency alerts. If I hold down a button on my Apple Watch for example, it’ll send my location and an SOS to all of my emergency contacts immediately. My phone is always on me as well, tucked into a pocket in the back of my sports bra, but my watch is also cellular if I were to be without my phone for whatever reason.\n\nI’m sure there’s more I’m not thinking of but I hope this helps!\n\nTo add to this, both Android and iOS have a 911 emergency feature that everyone should be aware of, I'm pretty sure it's the same in both. \n\n\nIf you press the power button 5 times it should automatically call 911 (at least on Android), and I believe you can set it to auto text emergency info/location to selected contacts.\n\n\n I didn't even set it up on my Android phone and accidentally triggered it because I thought I was turning up the volume 😅\n\nSame way to activate the safety feature on iOS! I almost accidentally set it off in my pocket at work the other day trying to do the same thing, luckily it has a count down where you can turn it off if it was an accident\n\nI accidentally did this and since I didn’t know it was a feature of the phone I had no clue what was happening. Emergency services were suddenly on the line and were nice about the situation luckily. It’s nice to know it’s a feature that actually works! I’ve set it off a couple more times but got it in time during the countdown. Since my newer phone is bigger the button seems to get pushed if I put it in my hydration vest the typical way so I’ve had to change that. Anyway, great feature!\n\nJust here to say yes to location tracking but also point out it does nothing in the moment. Have a plan: make noise, draw attention, get away.\n\nIf your partner is checking for you on location tracking because you never came home, it’s far too late.\n\nI can't offer any suggestions, and I'm sure you will get some helpful comments in this post, but wanted to point to an older post that has some good suggestions albeit with a lot of unhelpful comments too.\n\nEDIT: https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/ng9rlx/what_safety_precautions_to_take_as_a_woman/?sort=top\n\nFyi if you intended to have a link I don’t see it\n\nWhoops!  Thanks for the heads up.  Added the link in.\n\nUgh I’m so sorry this happened to you, so scary and glad it wasn’t worse. \n\nI don’t have safety tool recs but I love my bone conducting headphones (Shokz) for better situational awareness - they leave your ears open so you can hear background noise and your music at the same time.\n\nSorry to hear this. I have a background in combat sports and self defense, and you are right to be thinking about this. It’s unfortunate, but necessary. \n\nThe single biggest tool is situational awareness, which means foregoing headphones or other distractions. You’re right that sometimes tools/weapons can be turned on the victim.\n\nPepper spray is not a bad option, but you really almost need to have it in your hand/on your wrist to be able to use it in time. I carry a lightweight folding knife on my runs - in my situation, because of the prevalence of loose vicious dogs in my area. \n\nBut, truly, situational awareness, knowing the areas you run in, and always thinking about what you’re going to do in potential situations is the biggest thing\n\nI also come from a martial arts background and am 5'2\".\n\n\nSituational awareness and the ability to get away (ie run) is #1 the safest option, always. \n\n\nNever stick around to fight. Don't rely on anything that forces you in close proximity (eg knives).\n\nYeah. It’s really a bad situation to rely on deadly force. Even the best case scenario isn’t great. Awareness and flight are the best option every time. I carry a knife, but it’s primarily for non-human threats, and I’m trained to use it. Even self defense classes are often dangerous, as people get it in their heads that they can knee someone in the junk, or use some technique they will half remember in a split second situation, with what is likely a person more adept at using physical force. The best self defense classes focus on not getting into bad situations, fleeing bad situations, and escaping and fleeing bad situations - in that order\n\nThey say during a knife fight, the loser dies at the scene and the winner dies at the hospital.\n\nI like the general martial arts advice: do whatever you can to never have to fight. If there is no other option, be prepared to make the fight end quickly; a war of fatigue is not advisable.\n\nPepper gel, run with an alarm bomb in your hand. But I'd also encourage looking into running groups. Don't have to run with them, but find out when they run and where, and go run on your own in the same area if you need to run alone.\n\nI worked retail for years. One store I was at had a lot of assaults on employees when leaving/locking up for the night. A few of us took some self-defense classes.\n\nThe instructor told us, \"The best block is a city block.\"\n\nThat actually saved me from something one time.\n\nI bought a super slim whistle on a long cord; I shortened the cord to tether it to the loop on my watch strap; tuck the whistle itself under my watch strap and I don’t even think about it when running.  [https://www.rei.com/product/130213/vargo-titanium-emergency-whistle?redirect-pup=false](https://www.rei.com/product/130213/vargo-titanium-emergency-whistle?redirect-pup=false)\n\n[removed]\n\nAway from the suggestions for arming yourself I'd recommend a pair of open ear headphones. I've just bought a pair of Shokz bone conduction headphones , primarily to boost my awareness around traffic but they would also help from a personal safety perspective.\n\nI have a flashlight/taser from Sabre.\n\nYou got that backwards.  Use the pepper spray. Anyone can easily take a scratch and disarm you of a stabby thing\n\nNot everyone wants a dog obviously, but I find running with my pit mix is a huge deterrent. I have way less interactions with people in general as they tend to avoid her, and she's picked up on the couple times I was sketched out by someone and told them in no uncertain terms to back off.\n\nThe flipside is that she thinks every rabbit we see is a chance to PR the 100m dash, lol.\n\nI stopped running after I stopped having dogs. They were such a source of security. I also ran with a pepper spray that was strapped to my hand.\n\nGentle reminder that the tools can be used against you. No matter what you pick, practice using it before you carry it with you. You want to be familiar with its use because if anything happens again, you don’t want to freeze or fumble when you go to use it. \n\nI am so sorry this happened to you. Everyone should be able to run when, where, and how they want to run without the fear of being accosted.\n\nYikes-- I'm glad you're ok, and that you were helped quickly.   My heart goes out to you for having this happen.\n\nI would be cautious about carrying anything that can be taken away from you-- stabby ring might be a good idea, since it's on your finger and you can clench your hand around it.  \n\nHave you looked into any self-defense classes?  It's been a number of years since I've taken one, but I do still remember most of it.\n\nI did a self-defense class that was based on realistic scenarios where they actually attacked me full force and I had to figure it out. It was intense, emotional, and scary but also worth it for the sense of situational awareness, de-escalation strategies, and sense of choice I could make even in an attack (i.e. they said sometimes you might choose not to fight back and that's ok). It was really about getting yourself into an adrenalized state and not completely freezing up and knowing what options you had plus training the muscle memory to respond. Because of that class I'm wary about carrying any weapons with me. Google Impact Self Defense, their NYC chapter has links to other chapters. And they were willing to work out a payment plan for me.\n\nIf you look into self defence courses I highly recommend ones that place a strong emphasis on escape and defence maneuvers designed specifically to take advantage of your typically smaller frame. We have several courses in the city I’m In that are put on by one of the martial arts companies and they include situational awareness, sound/noise practice (because yes, the type of scream you use can make a difference) etc. it’s best to look for one that is certified to provide that training. \n\nAlso, I’d also suggest mapping out your route in advance (or knowing where you are going) and the closest businesses/gas stations, fire halls, police stations etc. this helps you to be able to react quickly to any hint of something off - trust your gut - if you get nervous for any reason even if you don’t see anyone, move to a more populated place - best to adjust your route than to think to yourself that you’re being too cautious. \n\nAlso - check and see if there are any run groups in your city! You don’t even really need to talk to the people much, simply having a group around you will help too! Most cities have several groups, etc. \n\nI’m struggling in my city too because I don’t drive and the routes I typically go have had several attacks on them recently, so I’ve avoided going after dark or early morning, and always run with my phone and wear bone conducting headphones so sounds don’t get blocked off. My sister is my emergency contact on my iPhone and my garmin etc. I live in Canada so it’s actually illegal to carry items for self defence that are weapons (ie: pepper spray etc). I’m gonna get a whistle necklace I think, though, cuz at least that’s something lol\n\n100%. Self-defense classes are far more useful than self-defense tools.\n\nAnd I feel the same way about first aid - taking a first aid class is more important than having a first aid kit on you. With training you can improvise and you know what to do. With a kit you're left fumbling around trying to figure out what to do.\n\nSelf defense classes tend to be bs to give mental fortitude. It's not going to help a woman in her 40s from winning vs a much stronger attacker\n\nThey often teach you situational awareness tips and how to escape certain types of holds.\n\n\nHonestly the physical stuff they reach isn't much use unless you practise them regularly for an extended period of time (like weekly for a year), but the advice can be solid. \n\n\nI haven't done martial arts consistently in almost a decade but the muscle memory of years of doing the most basic skills (like what you learn in your first year) is still with me - and none of the stuff I learned later and practised less has stuck around.\n\nand how to escape certain types of holds\n\nok so a McDojo and you learned genuinely nothing useful\n\nNice generalization.  You don't know that, and suggesting otherwise is NOT HELPFUL.\n\nNo. I know that. It's absolutely useless. And anyone with any experience with non-simulated combat will tell you the same. Same with the stabby ring. Won't help for shit. Get a gun or a dog.\n\nYou’re getting downvoted but you’re right.\n\nIf you’re not consistently practicing combat techniques and sparring, you aren’t prepared to defend yourself in a real world situation.\n\nExactly. Self-defense courses for women just tend to sell traumatized women an illusion of preparedness so that they become mentally resilient enough to go outside. It's very difficult to come to terms with the ugly reality that a 170 lbs+ horny or aggressive schizophrenic meth head won't be stopped by a weird kick-in-the-balls-and-give-an-elbow combo, plastic alarm (??) or stabby ring. It will just antagonize him further.\n\nI did a self-defense class that was based on realistic scenarios where they actually attacked me full force and I had to figure it out. It was intense, emotional, and scary but also worth it for the sense of situational awareness, de-escalation strategies, and sense of choice I could make even in an attack (i.e. they said sometimes you might choose not to fight back and that's ok). It was really about getting yourself into an adrenalized state and not completely freezing up and knowing what options you had plus training the muscle memory to respond. Because of that class I'm wary about carrying any weapons with me. Google Impact Self Defense, their NYC chapter has links to other chapters. And they were willing to work out a payment plan for me.\n\nI am so sorry you were attacked and I’m glad you’re ok. I have one of the stabby rings but to be honest I never really felt confident that it would protect me, or that I’d be able to use it correctly. So I have pepper spray instead and I too have heard that it could be used against you, but I’m hoping just having SOMETHING will be a deterrent. \n\nI have the stabby ring still and if you want to try it I’d be happy to send it to you.\n\nBear mace works better than pepper spray\n\nRegardless of what “tool” you choose, make sure you get the proper training.\n\nI have a safety alarm with flashing SOS light, which is very lightweight to bring while running. I take it with me when I go for pre dawn runs. If pepper gel were legal where I live, I would buy it as well.\n\nSimilar to this one:\nhttps://a.co/d/3FPoA6t\n\nAny groups you can join . Running with people is good.\n\nI'm not going to go through all the comments, but my self defense tool in the dim/dark hours is an insanely bright flashlight. It's 1500 lumens with rapid strobe and if you have dark-adjusted eyes you will be fully blinded for about 30 seconds and disoriented for a minute or two. It easily fits into my palm, around the size of an extra long d-cell battery\n\nThrunite t1 on Amazon I think it was\n\nI have a few options I use, G17, P365, P365x Macro, fixed blade knife (maybe less than ideal) also they make bright colored pepper ball guns, hurt on impact, less than lethal, and won’t blow back toward you. Lastly AXON offers a small single cartridge taser which is effective in the summer when people aren’t wearing so many layers as long as the perp isn’t using meth or pcp or tweaked out of their mind.\n\nI always assume a would be attacker will have a weapon and will likely be tweakin\n\nPepper gel and a fixed blade knife are good items. The knife doesn’t need to be big but sharp and pointy.   The pepper gel is to minimize your exposure to the irritant. \n\nDon’t wear in-ear earbuds if possible.  Keep situational awareness with your ears as well as your eyes. \n\nThe hardest part is gathering the will to use your items in self defense if you’re ever in a bad situation.\n\nWtf? Why would ANYONE recommend someone to carry a knife to an untrained woman in her 40s for self-defense? You're going to get people killed or severely injured.\n\nu/surreptitiousmu the uncomfortable truth is that no method will keep you 100% safe since you're presumably physically weaker than your attacker. Many weapons also suddenly increase the stakes and escalate what could be a non violent but threatening situation. Not to forget a  crackhead trying to rob you might end up killing you with your own knife. A rapist might overpower you and then use the weapon against you.\n\nYou could carry a gun. Generally just seeing a gun scares attackers away. But will you see the attacker coming in time? What if he grabs you from behind and successfully wrestles it away from you? What if he powers through a taser or the pepper spray doesn't effect him as much as you thought?\n\nSituational awareness is honestly #1. And keep working on your screaming skills. When in doubt, leave. All the rest is honestly just a false sense of security.. or even detrimental to it.\n\nEdit: maybe get a big ass dog. That might honestly be the best option and train with pepper spray. Don't be afraid of using it pre-emptively, since it is not perma damaging\n\nWhat situation between a woman and a strange man could be “non-violent” if the woman isn’t armed w/ some sort of weapon or deterrent? We’re talking about attacks by strangers or stalkers who’s goal is to do us bodily harm, not just take our money. Ppl who want to rob have a far different approach than those who want to harm. I’ve been in both situations myself. There’s no confusing the intent. The only possible situation that could be made worse by not cooperating is in a stranger rape situation. But in that situation u never can tell if they’ll let u live when they’re done assaulting u. I have gotten out of several bad situations all because I had situational awareness and refused to cooperate. My stun gun and switchblade are my friends. Never knifed anybody for the record. The stun guns zap has worked as a deterrent… did smash some guys arms and legs in my car door once in order to escape their grasps.\n\nDo NOT carry a knife as self-defense.\n\n\nA knife is a TERRIBLE weapon for self-defense.\n\n\n1. It is very easy to disarm and use against you.\n\n\n2. It is very easy to inflict an injury on YOURSELF especially if you're panicking or shaking.\n\n\n3. Most people are not psychologically prepared to actually knife someone, and if you're going committing to knifing someone, see point 1 again. Easy to take it off you.\n\n\n4. **A knife ESCALATES the situation to life or death and will make your assailant also escalate force.** You become the assailant now.\n\n\nI actually trained for self-defense against knife attacks (with simulated weapons, in a safe martial arts environment), and they are very, very easy to disarm.\n\nI’ve thought a lot about wether or not to carry a weapon for defense… I have come to the conclusion that it is for me. I keep a small switchblade hidden in my hand while running so it can be used as a surprise attack in the worst of situations. The goal is to surprise and distract the assailant long enough to get out of his grasp. He won’t know I have any weapon to take from me and use against me until I’ve already used it on him. I’d also assume anyone who is going to assault me likely has a weapon of their own…. I figure if my stabbing doesn’t allow me an opportunity to run, then I’m dead anyway. Who cares if they use my knife, their knife, their gun etc. I’m taking a piece of them with me if they’re taking me out… and that thought in itself makes me feel better out in the frightening world. At 4’9” tall, I have almost zero chance of escaping from any assailant. Any strange man who is trying to assault me, is likely to try to kill me too, so I’m ok taking my chances w/ fighting to my death trying to get away then cooperating and passively getting raped and/ or murdered. My philosophy is in line w/ the saying “never bring a knife to a gunfight”\n\n&gt;I actually trained for self-defense against knife attacks (with simulated weapons, in a safe martial arts environment), and they are very, very easy to disarm\n\nThis has got to be one of the stupidest fucking things Ive ever read on Reddit. I agree with your other points pretty well, but knives are absolutely not easy to disarm and can do such serious damage to someone attempting to grab it away.\n\nYou don't disarm a knife by grabbing it.\n\n\nYou make them drop it. \n\n\nKick their hand, throw something at them, tackle them, distract them.\n\n\nEspecially if the knife wielder is scared and jumpy already, they're not going to have a good grip. This is especially true with a small knife.\n\nKick their hand? LOL\n\nThrow something at them.... My god\n\nTACKLE THE KNIFE WIELDER?!?!?!?\n\nDistract them... solid fucking advice dude. LOL\n\nThis is mall ninja advice that is going to get you or someone else killed. \n\nAnyone else reading this comment chain, under no circumstance should you engage with someone holding a knife. You WILL NOT disarm them and you WILL GET STABBED. You should FUCKING RUN unless it isn't a viable option.\n\nMaybe consider reading the context of my comments?\n\n\nRemember that in this situation the knife wielder is a scared female runner who is carrying a knife because Reddit told her it would make her safe?\n\n\nI DO NOT THINK you should carry a knife for safety, or that you should engage with a knife wielder.\n\n\nHowever, carrying a knife is NOT GOOD FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY because it is easy to self-inflict damage and easy to drop it (be disarmed) if you're not committed to knifing someone.\n\nDeath is already on the table during a physical assault.\n\nThe potential victim must establish he/she will not be an easy target.  There is no rule of equal use of force in an unprovoked physical assault.  The potential victim must use more force to survive and escape.\n\nIf you find yourself in a fair fight your tactics suck.\n\n&gt; Death is already on the table during a physical assault.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nAnd what will a physically larger attacker do in the 5 minutes it takes for him to bleed out while you are up close after stabbing him? What if the blade gets stuck on a non-lethal body part and you can't retract it, while he realizes you tried to kill him? You will be killed. Brutally. \n\nAdvising an untrained woman in her 40s to engage in melee combat with a sharp object is fucking stupid. This is not about 'fighting fair' this is about 'staying alive'.\n\nMost people who may assault a stranger are not actually out to murder them. If you bring out a knife, they will turn it against you in their own self-defense.\n\n\nThe \"potential victim\" should NEVER be sticking around in close enough range to use a knife anyways.\n\nAmbush much?  I agree with running away.  There's a lot of \"what ifs\" involved in this whole discussion.\n\nI relish the idea that if somebody’s gonna take me outta this world, I’m gonna do everything in my power to take part of them with me. 😇\n\noh yeah just haul a bowie knife with you on your morning runs\n\nMight as well carry two for improved balance.\n\nKnife hands FTW\n\nBe the weapon. Take some Krav Maga classes.\n\nI'm sorry this happened.\n\nI think most safety professionals agree that the best thing is a whistle, alarm or something that makes a loud noise.\n\nAny kind of weapon - including pepper spray - has the possibility of being used against you and you mentioned that. And the spray could just blow back in your own face if you use it.\n\nRunning dog may be helpful, if you have living conditions for it. I think that possible assaulters will reconsider targeting person having dog and some medium/ big size dogs are pretty good runners. And it's among very few things that can protect from sneak attack. On specialised forums you can probably find some bred great for both. \n\n\nIf you go with pepper spray, buy one extra. Get out, get used for concealment &amp; using of one, look how it's range &amp; spread works in pracise. You don't want to practice in real life situation.\n\n\n\nI am male, but I cannot imagine stabby ring being very efficient on brutes. Someone used to violence will probably wouldn't be that suprised or hurt by that small cut/ stab to give you any real help.\n\nStay away from:\n1. Deadly weapons\n2. Close range weapons\n\n...unless you've received specific training on combat with those things. Deadly weapons can put you in legal hot water a lot easier than pepper spray, and anything that is only useful at close range defeats the purpose. Additionally, both of those things have a much higher probability of making the situation worse if you're not well trained and practiced in their use.\n\nPepper spray would be my recommendation. Be mindful of wind direction and weather conditions, as both can render it ineffective, but it's fairly straightforward: aim for the eyes, spray across the face, and run in the opposite direction while calling 9-1-1.\n\nAs others have said, your best safety tool is situational awareness. Pepper spray works at a distance; if you run right into somebody holding a knife, you won't have time to get it out and deploy it.\n\nI’d rather face legal trouble and be alive than killed on a run.\n\nVery few jurisdictions would indict a woman who defends herself against an attacker with a legal firearm. Not that I think you _should_ run with a gun, but legal ramifications isn’t a strong reason not to.\n\nI carry my stun gun or pepper spray in one hand… mostly as deterrent… and a hidden switchblade in the other to use in close contact situations in case of sneak attacks or kidnapping. The idea is to keep the assailant from knowing I have it until I’ve already used it on them… which I would only do as a last line of defense of course. \n\nSorry that happened to you and frustrating to see this still happens so often.  My running circle is probably like 5:1 female to male.  We try to run in groups as much as possible but the weekday am/pm runs are tougher given everyone has different priorities.  A lot of the ladies I run with carry pepper gel in their tights or flip belts.  Following this for other suggestions. Be safe!\n\nI'm sorry that happened to you. 😭\n\nGlad that you are safe and will be running again.  Pepper sprays are good but you have to be aware of your surroundings and be ready. I've seen people with earphones/headphones and unaware of people coming from behind. I only run with one earphone so I can hear bikers and other runners passing me so I wouldn't be so startled.\nBe safe!\n\nOh, as a fellow runner and human, I am so sorry this happened to you. I hope you regain some feeling of safety eventually, and find some good suggestions here.\n\nRunning partner is a great tool.\n\nI run with an I watch and it has various emergency alerts you can activate.   Since I do a lot of trail running around cliffs and mountains.  I worry more about falling and never being found.  But before I go on a run I practice the alerts I can trigger.  Siren, emergency, 911.  I can activate in 1 sec.    Think that would be enough to distract someone to run away quickly.  Most likely they won’t be able to catch you.\n\nSo... Self defense classes.  Wear your keys as wolverine claws. Take self defense classes again. Get a rape whistle for your runs. Carry mace. \n\nUnfortunately as a female you live in a dangerous world, and I am very sorry for that. \n\nThe big equalizer is a well trained woman with a firearm. Beyond that, what I've already said are your options. \n\nPeople suck. I'm sorry again. I wish I had better advice, but I'm drunk and wishing I hadn't had to read this. \n\nGet some help. Assault is no joke and can mentally fuck your life up. *experience*.\n\nI came back because I wanted to add. If you run with an iPhone &amp;/or AirPods and you have any clarity of thought in the moment, you can say out loud “Siri call 911”\n\nI like that! Hadn’t thought of a threatening talk to Siri as a deterrent. Totes gonna use that next time I’m threatened… though the zap noise of my stun gun has done the trick in the past. Ppl don’t seem to particularly want to get zapped \n\nI run with this pepper spray on my wrist for easy access. I bought from Amazon: https://a.co/d/8nk9ozm\n\nFirst, so sorry this happened, and glad you're OK, and not going to back down (just be smarter). Another option to consider is a tactical flashlight. They have two things that can be useful.\n\nThey are so bright they can blind someone long enough to punch/kick them and run away. The second feature is the part around the lens is typically somewhat jagged, almost like a a serrated knife, but not sharp. A solid blow to someone's crown with this, after being blinded/disoriented, will buy you a lot of time.\n\nDefinitely look into some self defense classes. Look for something that focuses on simple, fast, effective to allow you to get away.\n\nThey make jewelry rings/bracelets that have serrated and pointed edges so if anyone tries to grab you they’ll get sliced up. \nNoise Alarms are great. \nPepper spray works great, just don’t get caught in the over spray and already have it in your hand as soon as anyone becomes a threat. Don’t be afraid to run w a small rock in your hand.\nChange your run schedule time/place up a little bit as well so You wont be so predictable…. \nDont be afraid of offending people, turn around and run the other way if it doesn’t look right.\nWe know predators are out there. Be Safe. Everyone is a predator until they prove to not be. It’s a sad outlook but this world has a sad outlook! Stay prepared, Stay Alive!!\n\nI recently saw tactical hair clips/ barrettes…. They are also serrated… I don’t think I’d have the time to get them out to use them in time though\n\nI'm amazed that no one suggested not running alone when it's full dark in a city park. Check in to running groups in your area that meet up early if morning running is your jam.\n\nAs a male of the species it makes me sick that some jackass assaulted you. Just one time I’d like to catch a prick like him in action and leave him wondering why he did such a thing with his nose, zygoma and jaw fractured!\n\nGuy chiming in so take this with a grain of salt - some crazy dude tried to physically prevent me from passing him the other day and started saying some pretty awful things to me. My first instinct was to get physical with him since it took me so off guard, but he was so unhinged I ended up just jogging away from him and he didn’t follow. \n\nIt got me thinking about how confident I am in outrunning most people. I can keep a fairly brisk pace for a while and that lends a feeling of security.  \n\nAll that to say, in addition what others have said, perhaps some speed work might help you feel like you have another arrow in your quiver.\n\nIt's probably unpopular opinion, but if your city/state allows it and you can find the time to train and become proficient, a concealed smaller firearm could work well.\n\nThe problem with many other options is that they rely on physical strength. Your effectiveness with a firearm is 99% training (i.e., range time and practice), not your physical prowess.\n\nDepending on the intensity of your run, you could be at a huge disadvantage using a blade.\n\nIf you are interested in the firearm route, I can not recommend the Sig Saurer P365 more! It's small but not awkward and has a good capacity for around 500 USD.\n\nThis isn't an end all be all guide, but if you have any questions, us folks over at r/CCW would be happy to help!\n\nEdit: typed on phone so a few words were autocorrected erroneously, fixed them.\n\nAs someone who owns firearms and runs daily, I can't fathom running with one daily in my running gear.  There are so many issues - chaffing from the holster, sweat repeatedly inundating the firing mechanism/rounds, corrosive salt residue building up on everything, the added weight, escalating reactions when people see you running with a firearm, etc.  I have a Glock that is largely indestructible and I still don't think it would hold up well to a summer of workouts with me without a really strenuous cleaning schedule.  My running clothes are essentially incompatible with carrying firearms in an effective/comfortable way while covering long distances, although I'll admit it would be easier in the winter than summer.\n\nI think most responsible firearm owners would agree that the overwhelming best way to have a positive outcome to a violent encounter is to avoid that encounter entirely.  In a running context that would mean running alert without noise-cancelling headphones, being thoughtful about routes, running in groups when appropriate, running at times of day when you are less likely to have issues, and so on.\n\nPhlster enigma sports belt, it has a leg strap that keeps everything in place.  For a smaller female the Ruger LCP in 380 caliber will more than enough.  The LCP is also Colion Noir’s choice for runs, mailbox and gym.  Tessah is a smaller female runner that talks about all different options she’s tried\n\nhttps://youtu.be/94M3-h6Y4ts?si=fyYnuQRy8tTPT5Mq\n\nPersonally I run with a S&amp;W Shield M2.0 in .45 ACP, extra mag and Ka-Bar TDI knife for backup and don’t have any issues with salt corrosion.  I do maintain it and use CLP oil on it often.  Admittedly the .45 Shield is a bit heavier than the LCP by about a pound but it’s nonissue. I am considering loosing the extra mag as most of the 2 million annual defensive uses of f¡rearms only a tiny fraction actually are actually fired and of those all end within one mag.\n\nIt's also not as easy as \"just buy and carry a gun\".\n\nIs OP going to train enough, often enough to reliably hit a target?  Know how to clear a jam quickly? Are they going to be training such that they can draw the gun and fire it accurately with sweaty hands and a high heart rate?\n\nI agree, but I think the commentor above gave that a fair shake with:\n\n&gt;Your effectiveness with a firearm is 99% training (i.e., range time and practice), not your physical progress.\n\nHaving said that the reality is that after my 6th 1200 repeat @ 5k pace I'm barely able to think coherently.  Everyone's idea of what constitutes \"running\" is different, but that's why I would focus more on avoiding potential situations as a first line of defense.\n\nNot that I'd recommend it, but my Ruger LCP disappears into my hydration vest.\n\nDon't think I'd feel comfortable with one in the vest personally, but obviously more clothes/pouches make this more plausible.\n\nDuring the summer I usually run in shorts or half tights and... a hat?  For 15m+ runs even a flip belt or singlet chafe me brutally when I'm sweating 1-2 liters of fluid out per hour.  There's just not a reasonable place to carry on that kit.\n\nDuring the winter when I've got multiple layers on and am dry I could manage it.\n\nI agree with everything stated here. Probably should have mentioned how it would actually be carried. An appendix inside the waistband holster would be a terrible idea. It'd give all the problems you stated.\n\n I live in a rural area and used to do trail running in game lands where encounters with dangerous animals are not uncommon. I found running with my 5.11 FannyPack Holster and FN 509 to be a solution to most of your issues. Besides, it kinda screaming \"tactical\" to anyone who is paying enough attention and the added weight, albeit not being much.\n\nAlso, if my comment was to be a more complete guide, I'd have to go into situational awareness. This is always your first line of defense. But you did a great job of elaborating on that!\n\nNot just morally, but legally as well. I dread the idea of pulling that trigger.\n\nOverall, you have great points!\n\nI thought about this, and I’ve read it’s really trending among women purely for jogging… I’m more afraid of a sneak attack or being grabbed by someone and taken away, since I’m 4’9 tall and the weight of a pre-pubescent child… taking me on would be like taking on an 11 yr old. Makes me feel like a quite vulnerable target too. If I was a man looking to hurt a woman I’d totally choose me as my victim. I have decided for defense at a distance when jogging to carry pepper spray or a stun gun in one hand. I carry a small switch blade hidden in the other just in case I get grabbed or my pepper spray or stun gun doesn’t deter him. I’m going for the element of surprise in hopes I can inflict enough pain to distract him and get away. And yes, I know he can take my knife from me.. but he’s prob got his own or a gun anyway. At least w/ a knife I can inflict pain wherever I have access to his body. A stun gun and pepper spray both require accurate aim and the opportunity to do so. Besides, I’m not sure I’m ready to shoot somebody and a gun removes the ability to use the element of surprise… which for someone my size, I think would be my most valuable tool after situational awareness. \n\n[deleted]\n\nBased on the score of my comment it turned out not to be unpopular, but rather controversial, this was pleasantly surprising and I'm glad my comment was able to spark a nice informative discussion with a few other redditors on this niche topic.\n\nIm not here to argue the politics of firearms ownership. There's a time and place. A post about harassment on r/running isn't really the place for it with OP going through a sickening situation. \"Guns are evil\" is a pretty politically charged statement, and respectfully, I'm not going to engage with it.\n\nOP asked a question, I gave an optional solution, and I left it at that. Not here to change anyone's mind or push someone to do something they are uncomfortable with. I want to be very clear about that!\n\nI agree! 2 joggers were attacked a few years ago and ever since then I carry when I run. I have a belly band holster that holds my firearm when I run just fine. A good cleaning prevents any buildup or issues with the gun. My firearm is also really good quality, not a cheap one, so less likely for it to jam or hand an issue. I’ve been charged at by dogs and there’s also lots of coyotes in my area so I feel much better running with it than not.\n\nGet friend into running.\n\nCheck out Damsel in Defense - I have run with their products for years.\n\nGlock 43x and some practice. You’ll never have this problem again.\n\nGoGuarded has a pepper spray/stabby combo.  [https://goguarded.com/product/go-guarded-hand-held-with-pepper-spray/](https://goguarded.com/product/go-guarded-hand-held-with-pepper-spray/)\n\nPepper spray, not gel, is most effective for the exact reason folks here are saying it is a bad idea: it’s wide blast radius. Sure you may suffer a secondary exposure but that will mean you are still better off than the guy you sprayed down.\n\nSorry to hear this, and glad to hear you're ok. If you're willing to share, which city / metro was it?\n\nSo sorry this happened to you. I second the recommendation for Shokz headphones. I don’t carry pepper spray (even though my partner keeps buying it for me and asking me to run with it), but I do carry my keys when I run in sketchier areas, in case I need to stab someone with them.\n\nDon’t run parks period. I’d rather run a track with other runners or, run along the most traveled road. Some people should be driving to work at that hour.\n\nOr drive to a safe area and do your run there. I’ve run laps in parking lots or a single block over and over if I’m afraid to venture out any further.\n\nWhen I was a young woman in my 20s and in that time of life where I attracted a lot of attention, I would go to a local track and bring family or dogs or a friend/boyfriend. have them sit in the bleachers or walk the dog on the he track while I ran so they could keep an eye on me so I was not alone. \n\nJoin a running group?\n\nI’m a little more concerned with coyotes at that time of day so I try to run a loop on sidewalk along a well traveled road. Sometimes people I know drive past me and see me. I try to be visible and not put myself in positions where I’m alone in an open space\n\nAlso I always warn my family that I’m about to go on a run and keep their phones ready because there have been times I have wanted to get picked up mid run. I had a weirdo on my loop tonight. I do make eye contact with weirdos and let them know I SEE THEM. I will stop and TURN around and watch them. I will run backwards to keep an eye on them. I don’t want anyone thinking that I am not paying attention. I was a block from my house tonight and running backwards watching the weirdo. I was about a second away from dialing my family for a ride. But the weirdo seemed to be intently examining some plants in someone’s yard (maybe it was his own? He didn’t look familiar to me). \n\nBetter to have to call back and cancel the ride than risk getting into a hairy situation. I don’t care if I come off rude. Being polite gets women killed.\n\nI have a Birdie alarm from She’s Birdie. You pull the top out and it makes a high pitched shrill alarm noise.\n\nGosh, some men are just so sick in the head. See if you can get a running buddy for safety.\n\nI came here to say I’m so sorry for what happened to you. I was assaulted a few years ago running and it was an extremely destabilizing experience. \n\nI looked back for a very long time on that experience and tried to think if I could have done anything differently. My truth is that I did all I could in the moment. \n\nA few things really helped me as I started running again: \n\n1. The first thing I did was take some BJJ classes with my cousin. I wasn’t really sure about this at the time. But it was actually very helpful for a few reasons. I was in a situation where I was “pinned” again. But this time, I could find new solutions to get out of that position. Some of that was helpful for me, but there was also something therapeutic about being in that position again and then in a strange way “role playing” solutions. \n\n2. The best thing was therapy. Therapy helped me to accept that this wasn’t my “fault” there was nothing I did  “wrong” that allowed this to happen. It helped me to sort out my complicated feelings, and it gave the ability to love running again. \n\nI am sending you good vibes for running in the future and that you find the right combination of things that allow you to release anything you experienced. I’m really sorry someone did that to you.\n\nJust a note for everyone in the group, at the time I was attacked I had pepper spray and I was aware of the person who attacked me. \n\n1. Pepper spray- the experience happened incredibly fast. I truly can’t express enough how quickly it went from me running to something else. There just wasn’t time. \n\n2. Unfortunately, I was very aware of the person that attacked me. I saw them. I realized they were there. I was running on a concrete park trail and they were behind me. I didn’t think of them as a “threat” because nothing about them seemed threatening to me. They presented like another person on the trail. They didn’t look the part of an attacker.\n\nMy ex used to run with a run with a ring knife/blade. It was covered with a silicon sleeve, but she cut herself a few times while running with it. The thing was sharp!\n\nI’m sorry to hear about your experience. I was assaulted while running several years ago and it’s been a real journey getting myself back on the running trails. Be patient and don’t push yourself into a situation where your nervous system gets overwhelmed and you are then running in a “flight” mode mentality- it’s utterly exhausting. Slowly reintroduce yourself to areas where you feel safe with the support of a friend or with a group where you will have safety in numbers. Eventually you may reach a point where you can feel safe and be on your own, or you may not, and that’s okay. \n\nI’ve found that carrying a good stick with me is helpful for my own sense of safety, even if in the moment of attack it might not be helpful. You just never know. Be aware of who is around you and trust your gut! \n\nIt’s really unfair to carry this burden while just trying to mind your own business and exist in this world. Sending you positive energy and peace through your recovery process, however that looks for you.\n\nPractice the mindset of using the spray and taking the initiative - violent people have it, you might need it too.\n\nDon’t show it or threaten to use it before you do. \n\nAs a non rapist guy - i’d rather have you spray me innocently once than you being attacked.\n\nDog running buddy. Tools in the meantime, but an athletic mean looking dog is a great deterrent.\n\nIf you can make the time for it, I would also 100% recommend training martial arts. I started training Krav Maga for this very reason. \n\nIt teaches how to defend yourself in similar situations, and also about situational awareness etc. if you have it in your area, I would recommend trying it out!! Stay safe\n\nDamn I am sorry something like this has happened to you. Some people are barely people. \n\nIn an emergency you can use your keys between your fingers.\n\nElse there are these really loud alarms japanese children have when they are in danger, something like that would also be good 👍\n\nI’m so sorry this happened to you! Everyone has great suggestions that I’ve read so far but I also want to add that you can also share your location. I do jiu jitsu and it helped me feel a lot more confident if I had to protect myself. A lot of jiu jitsu places offer free intro classes. Gracie also offers a women’s only class if you prefer not to train with men. A lot of major cities have a Gracie jiu jitsu. Stay safe 💕\n\nThat is so scary and I’m sorry that happened to you, good for you for wanting to rise above it. I recently bought one of those sound alarms like others have stated. I bought it because one time I was trail running and I tripped on a root and broke my leg in two places and on the trail with no one around it was scary. Luckily I had my phone with service and I was able to call my husband and he was able to pin my location in the woods with Find My and get me to emergency. But the sound thing is good too if no cell service etc and I’m sure would freak anyone out trying to cause you harm.\n\nPom pepper spray is best if you’re not willing to carry a gun. I usually carry both.\n\nI’m so sorry that happened to you. Times are a changing and I decided to change along with the times. If I have to run in the dark I now chose my treadmill in the safety of my home. I still run outside frequently but I run on populated suburban streets during daylight hours vs less populated trails, even though I’d much prefer the trails. My husband is a former boxer/experienced martial artist and we’ve role played many times. It takes him mere seconds to disarm and immobilize me and that’s when I know it’s coming. FWIW I used to work for an oculoplastic surgeon and he would remind me frequently, go for the eyes. A fingernail tearing through the eye. Eyes are easy to damage, it’s excruciatingly painful and you don’t rebound very quickly.\n\nI do this in all my nightmares! \n\nI'm glad that you were helped!  This is so scary, but happy to hear it is not going to make you hide away. Be sure to get counseling.  Effects of an assault can appear months later and affect your mental health.  \n\nAs far as defense.  If you're thinking of a gun, be sure that your o.k. with yourself potentially taking another person's life.  That's most likely the end result if you use it.  Be sure to practice target shooting with it regularly.  \n\nThere are check-in alarms that you can get on some fitness devices.  Garmin has incident detection, apple has something, I think fall detection and there are also shrill alarms that you can get. \n\nPepper spray is another alternative, but be prepared that you may get yourself in the process of using it. \n\nBest of everything to you.\n\nDont get a stabby thing. You need to be so close to use it you could easily get overpowered even after you stabbed someone. If that happens chances are you wont survive.\n\nPepperspray is by far your best bet. A good hit and they be rolling on the ground crying blind.\n\nComing from a self defense background I think short term the loud sound devices are great suggestions because it is easy to deploy with no training. The main issue with self defense tools is people buy one and think they are automatically safe. You need to practice with it, and often generally know how to fight to properly deploy and utilize the weapon. Best option is learn to fight (boxing, kickboxing, a little bjj) and also have weapons/tools to run with but that takes a lot of time to become proficient.\n\nDepends on the US State.  If you live in a city or state that somehow believes that the \"police will save you,\" it's time to leave town.  I live in Seattle WA which despite wonky politics has more-or-less reasonable self-defense options.\n\nI am a 5'10\" 170 lb man with a bitchy resting face.  Very few f\\_\\_k with me.  I carry one legal, non-lethal self defense item on most runs.  Not all.  I have practiced in training with this system in simulations.  Unf, I have used it twice in 20 years in brawls where my safety was directly threatened with bodily harm.  I have also used another method, different but also legal and non-lethal, once.  In the latter, I involved the police afterwards. I was absolved on the spot of any wrongdoing and filled out a report.  No one was injured permanently, just made uncomfortable.  No one died as a result of any of these actions.  Situations requiring lethal force are extremely rare and serious.  That's another story and I don't plan for extremes, only the most probable when running.  The probability of encountering any situation even requiring legal, non-lethal force is quite rare...fortunately.\n\nMy objective is only the following:  1) stun those offering me felonious levels of violence who do not respond to verbal commands to \"get away from me.\"  2) assumes I cannot run away 3) assumes I am surprised: most conflicts are brawls at close range that escalate fast, unf!  Bottom line is I need to buy seconds to run away.  We are runners, I can run faster, longer, and with greater enthusiams than 99% the population by-definition as a Boston qualifier (funny but true).\n\nYou need to find something that is fast, legal in your area, stuns your opponent, and become proficient so that you fall to your training.  You can never rise to the occasion, it doesn't work that way.  I am proficient in the two systems mentioned.  Deploy, GTFO of there!  Call police later if needed (I recommend it).  When the police arrive, you must know what to say.  Any deployed system must pass muster with local laws.  If choosing to deploy lethal force, the aftermath has a dramatically different procedure.  Few / if-any want to be involved in that so choose wisely.\n\nGood luck.  I don't live or even run in places where I \"cannot\" do the above due to screwed-up politics / laws.\n\nI can't really add more than what has been said other than this: be aware of strangers (especially men since they are a much, much bigger physical threat) around you but do not make eye contact, smile, or stop to talk to them. Best to wear polarized sunglasses you can see well in. Better to be judged as rude than beaten, raped, robbed, or murdered. You do not want to be 'approachable'. 'Approachable' means you are an easier mark. I'm also white/Asians and lot of weirdos bank on the stereotype of Asian women being more polite. \n\nAlso, I generally run alongside roads on sidewalks in the morning. It's a lot safer to be around other people, even if those people are in cars.\n\nEdit: In addition, avoid areas with high meth usage like the plague. Meth heads are extra nuts.\n\nI’m 4’9” tall and about 85 lbs… I’m also blonde and non-threatening looking in about every way. I have always assumed I would be seen as an ideal target for any would be attacker around. For jogging, I’m doing a small but powerful stun gun in one hand.. keep my finger on the button ready to use in a surprise attack. It’s also a deterrent because it’s easy to see I’m carrying it and nobody wants to get zapped. In my other hand I’m carrying a small and concealed switchblade knife. This way an attacker would be focused on my other hand’s stun gun and would be  totally surprised by my knife blade. This also gives me a weapon in each hand that I can use to defend myself. The stun gun has thwarted two likely attacks in the  past just by the attackers realizing I had it when I zapped it at them in warning. I also have taken self defense and learned how to throw a large man over my shoulder to escape… and my short stature is actually helpful for that move. I recommend u learn it, if u haven’t already. Also, be sure u listen to music at a low volume and only in one ear when u run so u can hear the movements of others around u. Also, be really aware at the gas station. I almost got taken at one. For safety, I always get back into my car and lock the door while the gas pumps. On the day of the incidence, if I hadn’t gotten back in my car as fast as I did, had left the passenger door unlocked, or hadn’t smashed the attackers arms w/ my car door, I’m not sure I’d be here today. Glad ur ok! Stay safe out there! \n\nOne more bit of advice I got from a friend who was a former military sniper and cop: If an attacker has a gun on you, you have two options.. and both are thought to increase ur odds of survival compared to cooperating. 1. If possible, get urself between the attacker and the gun. I was told this reaction is so surprising to an armed gunman that it’s taught as a best line of defense in the military. The point is that it’s almost impossible for someone to pull a trigger with their hand pointing at their own body… AND what stupid attacker wants to shoot towards his own body at a squirming woman? … If option 1. isn’t possible, option 2. is to run as fast as u can away and to the left. Running to the left forces the shooter to have to keep readjusting his stance to aim at you. This is apparently much more effective than running in a zig zag etc. Also, most assailants u encounter won’t be exactly expert marksmen and likely have little to no practice hitting moving targets. My friend said you want to surprise / disorient the gunman long enough that u can get at least 20 ft between u two, so u can be likely to run away unscathed.  \n\nMaintain situational awareness at all times and run in well lit areas.  Change your routes often and do not be predictable.\n\nAs go gear, a bright headlamp to shine ahead and temporary blind threats.  Ruger LCP, it weighs less than a pound and the 380 caliber is ballistically sound to stop a couple of attackers.  Pair it with an Phlster Enigma Sports Belt, it was designed for runners by runners.  I also carry a Ka-Bar TDI Law Enforcement knife.  Here’s a smaller female runner Tessa going over all the options she’s used as a runner.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/94M3-h6Y4ts?si=fyYnuQRy8tTPT5Mq\n\nTake classes, get trained, familiarized and comfortable with both weap0n systems.  Then take your local state’s CCW class and get licensed for concealed carry.  Once you have your CCW license get a simple low cost CCW insurance in advent of having to fire it in a defensive situation.  However of the more than 2 million defensive uses of f¡rearms very few actually have to fire them, most perpetrators simply flee and find an easier target.\n\n\nhttps://ruger.com/products/lcp/models.html\n\nhttps://www.phlsterholsters.com/shop/enigma-sport-belt/\n\nhttps://www.kabar.com/category/law-enforcement\n\nhttps://panthervision.com/collections/powercap-led-hats-beanies\n\nBlinking nora, if you have to carry a gun just to go for a jog, move far, far, away\n\nA compact .22 Derringer is small, light, and aimed right, will do the trick.\n\nI have a dog but carry a tazer gun to protect myself and dog should someone still chance it. I think it shoots out 3 meters. Also looks a little like an actual gun, but I've never had to use it, still makes me feel safe on trails\n\nI run with a small pocket knife clipped on my shorts and I have a watch that will alert my emergency contacts.\n\nAwareness of surroundings, loud noise deterrents, location tracking, let someone know where you are, where you will be, when you will be back. For every run. \n\nNot all self-defense courses are built the same. BJJ would be ideal if you have one in your area. \n\nA dog would help if you could get one. Only get one if you can handle the responsibility and your situation allows for it, of course. However, they will be alerted often before you are. Even at home, I always felt safer with a dog. Aside from safety, they are incredible in regard to emotional support, and I think that will help you greatly as you recover from this experience. You may even be able to borrow a dog for runs if you aren't able to keep one of your own. \n\nThey do make holsters for running, but that is a personal decision you have to make as to whether you feel comfortable and safe running with a firearm. You could check out a self-defense gun course as well.\n\nCurrently waiting on a well reviewed chest pack to come back in stock so I can carry my pistol while running. Can't think of a better tool.\n\nWhat are the gun laws like in your city? Can you concealed carry?\n\n\nI'm not sure how practical that is while running though.\n\nA gun. You need a gun\n\nA small concealable pistol will do more than a rape whistle.\n\nIt's a good idea to have something.\n\nPersonally I have a CCW and carry a small .380 pistol in a belly band. Although I do understand that's not practical or feasible or politically correct for everyone. But at the very least I'd definitely want to have some sort of pepper spray or tazer, some kind of noise generation device (personal alarm), and a communication device (phone or satellite messenger) with me - particularly if I'm running in a higher crime area or somewhere aggressive wildlife might be a concern.\n\nI wouldn't recommend a knife unless you're trained with it. It's just not a good self-defense weapon. The chances of it getting pulled from you is very high. Often even if the party with they knife wins, they'll still walk away all cut up and have lacerations. Things get bloody really quick with blades, and the blood will get all over your hands and knives, causing it to possibly slip out of your hand and get sliced. Very easy to get disarmed. \n\nThis is probably not going to be a popular opinion on this sub, but I would strongly recommend just buying a micro pistol. There is a huge market for conceal carry these days and you can buy a very compact gun that holds several rounds. Many of them can fit in your fanny pack. If you go through your states conceal carry class, that should give you enough training to feel like you know what you're doing. This would be a perfect gun for running because it's lightweight and very small. It's really only meant for threats that are directly in front of you. \n\nhttps://www.basspro.com/shop/en/Ruger-LCP-Semi-Auto-Pistol\n\nAin’t no assailant sneaking up behind you to knock you over gonna wait for you to unzip your fanny pack and pull your micro pistol.\n\nYou’d better train unholstering and firing accurately after intense physical activity if you’re going to CC while jogging too.\n\nI have no problem with owning firearms but in this situation, using one effectively takes a lot of practice and mental fortitude. And a little luck, too.\n\nConsider a treadmill.\n\nMy wife financed a Peloton tread and I scoffed because we live in a beautiful part of the world, but I'm a 6'1\" white guy covered in tattoos.\n\nThen I tried it, and I had a really great winter training on it. The content is fresh and the coaches are actually not annoying.\n\nIt wasn't cheap, and it'll be a headache when it eventually dies, but we were able to finance at 0%. We've gotten our money out of it compared to a bicycle of the same price.\n\nDon't have to worry about assholes other than each other when we don't wipe it down after.\n\nI carry a stun gun from Axon. It's a bit bulky and pricey but it comes with an app that if the device is used it contacts the reps there - they'll call you directly - and they'll call the police for you if you don't answer. I carry mine in a Lululemon cross body pouch, it fits well. I'm sorry you had to go through that! Glad you're ok though!\n\nCan you please share the link!\n\nSorry bout that I knew I was forgetting something lol\nhttps://taser.com/search?q=Stun+gun&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last\n\nAnd in the US, stun guns are legal in all 50 states, per SCOTUS Caetano v Massachusetts (2016).\n\nBut now you need both the stun gun and your phone, right? Is there an Apple Watch app at least?\n\nI'm not sure about an app for Apple. I have an android. But yes I think you need to have your phone. I carry mine anyway for music so it wasn't anything I looked into tbh.\n\nget a glock 43. very compact and easy to use\n\nTake a look at [GoGuarded](https://goguarded.com/product/go-guarded-hand-held-without-pepper-spray/) - this looks like it might be convenient to carry while running\n\nThere are some very small, lightweight pistols under 14 ounces that would do a good job of protecting you in the event you were unable to evade a threat.\n\nHonestly, it depends on your local laws and if you're willing to abide by them if they're super restrictive.  Guns, with training, practice, and the will to use it (no warning shots), can be the answer.  On the other hand, they're heavy (you're running, after all), and if you aren't willing to use it, the gun's simply waiting to change owners.  It's not a magic totem.  Same goes with knives, but they require even more practice and training to not get hurt while using.\nThere are other \"less lethal\" devices, but in some areas, even those might be forbidden.  Worse, stun guns and tasers don't always work when you need them, especially if the attacker has thick clothing.\nMy recommendation is to check with your local runners for advice.  Running in a group is probably the safest, plus you get the benefit of a support team on \"off\" days, even without extra tools of defense.\n\nThat all said, I carry when I go out, especially with my family.  My little one has had a restraining order against someone for years (she's just 14 now) and it's just a piece of paper vs the peace of mind that dad can protect her if the bad guy makes another bad choice.\n\nnot sure what the laws are like in your state but getting your ccw might not be a bad idea if that's possible.  As the saying goes  “God created men, Col. Colt made them equal,”. ;)\n\nI’m not sure how you feel about firearms but you can fit a compact sized pistol within a fanny pack or in a holster that will fit inside your leggings. In my carry concealed weapon class there were women who spoke about this subject and I learned that there many ways to fit a firearm in a running kit. Good luck.\n\nEdit: gammer\n\nCarry a gun, if it’s legal where you are. They are many lightweight options available these days, like the p366, as well as running friendly holster solutions, like the Enigma system.\n\nSecond the Enigma.  However I stopped running with mine because of the cleaning necessary after every damn run to keep it from rusting.  It would probably be worth it in OP's case though for the added safety.  I'd say she needs a stainless revolver and it would be much better for running.\n\nPepper spray, stabby ring, taser (I usually carry this to scare away, the sound has been enough to deter off leash aggressive dogs and some dude coming at me on a walk), a big ass dog and some self defense training. Always share your location.\n\nThat's great you had a bad ass cop help you, bring the department cookies! Outmates are looking for easy $ &amp; easy pray. \n\nSome kind of martial arts, self defense class, hell you can think of it as x-training, it's all about muscle memory. \n\nHave a running buddy, we use to always say 1 is none, 2 is 1 in my last career. \n\nGet a bad ass dog, Outmates hate German Shepherds and Doberman Pinschers.\n\nGet a brass whistle will work 100% of the time, can get a little clip to attach it on you shirt/sports bra to be closer to your face to blow.\n\n+1 for OC pepper \"spray\" MK-2, you need the good stuff for law enforcement (when a suspect sprayed with OC yells that should be illegal, you know it's working) and need training to use it properly. Running shorts with built in pouches could work well to store it. \n\nElectronic gizmos may not work well when your in a fight or flight situation.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a good % of registered sex offenders in the US, your best defense is to be bad ass :)\n\nIt won’t let me edit, but appreciate all the responses and read through them!  The reasonable consensus seems to be (assuming things like dog and another person aren’t possible) 1) awareness 2) a whistle maybe 3) self defense classes but not letting self defense classes negate #1. \n\nI signed up for a defense class for next week as a first step!\n\nStay safe out there and far too many people have stories of their own- that’s the biggest tragedy. ( I definitely choose bear. )\n\nYou need a ruger 380"

    "title": "So you wanna make your own gels? (An update)",
    "body": "Hi All! It's the guy that made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1axmkr4/a_guide_budgethomemade_running_nutrition_gels/) budget nutrition guide. Well, after plenty of trialing and testing I have finally managed to re-create the Maurten 100 style gel. My previous recipe was based on the 320 that was then used with significantly less water to create a gel. That is a MUCH easier recipe to use and I would not necessarily recommend using this recipe unless you MUST have a maurten 100 style gel. I do prefer this gel, its easier to slurp down but its definitely a little more involved to make. So like I said, if you are happy with the other recipe - **do not proceed**\n\nSo without any further ado, here is my recipe breakdown for making 24g carb gels, plus a full batch for 10 gels, with mixing tips, portioning, and caffeine options. Costs are still significantly lower than store-bought gels, especially for those in marathon training and trying to fuel during your long runs.\n\n  \n*\\*ChatGPT, write me a reddit post.\\**\n\n\n\n**Single Gel Recipe (24g of carbs)**\n\nTable Sugar: 24g (more on different carb sources later)\n\nSodium Alginate: 0.2g\n\nCalcium Gluconate: 0.065g\n\nWater: 16g total\n\nTotal weight: 40g\n\n\n\n**10-Gel Recipe (Expect Yield of 7-8 Gels due to Product Loss)**\n\nTable Sugar: 240g (more on different carb sources later)\n\nSodium Alginate: 2g\n\nCalcium Gluconate: 0.65g (or just go with 0.6 if you don't have a scale that does hundredth gram measurements)\n\nWater: 160g total (80g for syrup, 60g for sodium alginate solution, 20g for calcium solution)\n\n\n\n**Cost Analysis per gel**\n\n|Ingredient|Amount|Cost|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sugar|24g|$0.13|\n|Sodium Alginate|0.2g|$0.07|\n|Calcium Gluconate|0.065|$0.03|\n|Pouch|1|$0.12|\n|Water|16g|Free?|\n|Total||$0.35|\n\n  \n**Ingredient Purpose**\n\nTable Sugar: Supplies carbs for energy. If you want to mimic Maurten 100’s carb profile, use a 0.8:1 ratio of glucose powder (13.3g) and fructose powder (10.7g) per gel. This ratio is especially helpful if you’re targeting 80-100g of carbs per hour for better absorption. For me, table sugar has worked perfectly at 2 gels per hour.\n\nSodium Alginate: Key for forming the gel structure.\n\nCalcium Gluconate: Helps set the alginate into a gel. Without this it's more of a thick syrup. The calcium gluconate (which is calcium carbonate neutralized with gluconic acid) allows for free calcium ions to bond to the alginate and form an actual gel. This prevents a thick film from forming on the inside of your mouth and was part of Maurten's goal when designing their gels. It's almost more chewable than drinkable. If you used only calcium carbonate, you would actually not form a gel as the carbonates are too alkaline which actually will reverse the gel formation and make it liquid.\n\n**Maurten 100 Ingredients List**\n\nWater\n\nGlucose\n\nFructose\n\nGelling Agent: Calcium Carbonate\n\nGelling Agent: Gluconic acid\n\nGelling Agent: Sodium Alginate\n\n*So let's break this down*\n\nTable sugar is 1:1 glucose and fructose. Maurten used a 0.8:1 ratio for their target. Kinda splitting hairs but they have scientific data to prove why they chose that, especially when targeting higher carb loads.\n\nCalcium Carbonate + Gluconic Acid = Calcium Gluconate.\n\nSodium alginate is sodium alginate, a standard gelling agent.\n\n\n\n**Where I bought the ingredients**\n\nTable Sugar: Local grocery store\n\nSodium Alginate: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Alginate-Calucium-Luxurious-Desserts-Meatloaves/dp/B0C55JRQCX/ref=sr_1_4_sspa?crid=34K7PQQTT11Z7&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.eixhudLw9EOJLJuiynYwMW7LFPD1mvwWyt33w-Vb3kruV4JlfZdmBc-EsQSKBY0rWYmcR41bjD9BsL7rAJ5pOLvOmyRl9LxuBOBJpMoOp6RPjaBKGY3uSJm_64d8r6K2lUvamlk5P3tlwAfKiu7dujjlSdHp7hsKUtlsP39kJH5o8QQzhT51rot6D4zv4G5IzTV8hMpTJDspjXuHw0qzpq8pZp-UjXVfOJeGxqrA5ZN5q2PFbrnH06A7DwXqdaFZY4KIWCf96bUPsmTsLQ2_XwLjR8qxGckPdJbXRXyWY7w.B9ethH8ol_h8LZsbFKFR1u-MI8DTaS_qBG1jZ5h1j9I&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=sodium+alginate&amp;qid=1730312567&amp;sprefix=sodium+algina%2Caps%2C225&amp;sr=8-4-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;psc=1)\n\nCalcium Gluconate: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3UGEHL?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k0_1_13&amp;amp=&amp;crid=D77TSOKMH21K&amp;amp=&amp;sprefix=calcium+gluco)\n\n\n\n**Recipe Instructions for 10 gels**\n\nStep 1: Prepare Syrup\n\nCombine sugar with 80g of boiling water. This dissolves the sugar to form the base syrup. We are right on the brink of where sugar will or will not go into solution. In my testing, 80g will still allow for sugar crystallization. That's okay, we will finish dissolving the rest when we add the alginate solution.\n\nStep 2: Make Alginate Solution\n\nMix 2g of sodium alginate in 60g of water in a small container. Shake vigorously and leave it for 24 hours to properly dissolve.\n\nStep 3: Prepare Calcium Solution\n\nMix 0.65g of calcium gluconate in 20g of water, shake vigorously and let sit for 24 hours to properly dissolve.\n\nStep 4: Combine\n\nAdd the alginate solution to the syrup, mix well, then add the calcium solution, stirring thoroughly. I use a powered hand mixer when doing this step.\n\nStep 5: Portion and Seal\n\nUsing a dispensing syringe ([I use this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QQVMSB?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)), fill single-use pouches ([I use these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089GQB7KS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1)). I fill and seal using a flat iron (I use my wife's and make sure it's clean when I am done) halfway. If you desire a caffeinated option, then add optional caffeine if needed ([I prefer using 100mg caffeine](https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Caffeine-Pills-Serving-Capsules/dp/B01MY5CW7S/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.a472wmxdNsnL9o9ZRihAvFs3Z_LDlA1DwxxH9CcI5aKOzJfZsm35KXIJKdX0jrpl0AyrYkOPTiwI12_71ogCZ-yumL8b26cObgsqcLnXlhT_ZxpNwhUvyMsMx-2UvAXsaNQk3VJgsZujf5rriF_gjqWHdhKK0n5CoaP78lSje1mT34TRhgkvQCK1lgjHiGzDhf31ILR8jYU1oqo00abVKbwR5Bt9RbazCNOqOUIcdm3C9C4ruYU1nAXkqIE0qihNoZnvdheSLkivJqG6xn2xn45YmVdoRyWIxxQJkFb1-UY.DLg_XXD3DTdcA_c_eggmwQ6E9Gd0Bl6rA3rVHf5_lyI&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=100mg+caffeine&amp;qid=1730311520&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;psc=1)). When making a caffeinated gel I will fill halfway, pour a single caffeine pill into the mixture (just the powder not the whole pill) then top off with the remaining amount, and seal with a flat iron for long storage.\n\n\n\n**Tips &amp; Tricks**\n\nShortcut Mixing: If you’re pressed for time, combine the sugar and alginate dry, then pour 140g of boiling water over and mix with a blender. Using a hand mixer will not break down the alginate enough to go into solution. You will end up with little clumps of alginate all throughout your solution and its terrible. A small blender solves this issue. Dissolve calcium gluconate with 20g of boiling water and shake, it will go into solution fairly quickly. Then combine ingredients and voila.\n\nGel size: I prefer to do 50g of total weight per gel, this provides 30g of carbs for a total of 60g per hour (1 gel every 30 minutes). You could fit more in the linked pouches if you desire (or less).\n\nCarb Profile Options: Using sucrose (table sugar) is easy and affordable. For those targeting more than 60g of carbs per hour, the 0.8:1 glucose to fructose ratio (13.3g glucose powder + 10.7g fructose powder per gel) might help with faster absorption and lower GI stress. Avoid maltodextrin with this recipe, as it thickens the gel too much with the other gelling agents, making it hard to consume. You will really have to turn on your mouth vacuum to pull the gel out of the pouch. Not ideal at mile 20 of a marathon you are trying to PR.\n\nStorage: I keep gels in the fridge for 1-2 weeks. For longer storage, freeze the gels. There are no preservatives and without a nitrogen flush to scavenge oxygen out of the package before sealing there is potential for biological growth after extended periods, especially when left at ambient temperature for extended periods (days or weeks).\n\nWater Source: With this recipe, you may need to be careful about your water source. If you have too much calcium hardness in your water you could begin to activate the alginate immediately which could be a mess. I use my tap water without issue, but for high hardness water you may find distilled or RO is what you need.\n\nWhy I chose 24g carbs: Maurten gels have 25g of carbs per gel. I did 24g. Why? Because I wanted to deal with easy numbers. Increasing to 25g then changes the amount of water we have for the solutions to make as we are targeting 40g total weight. Totally splitting hairs but if you want it exactly at 25g then adjust the water amounts you use accordingly to 15g of total water per gel for a total weight of 40g per gel. \n\n\n\n\n\nI hope this helps someone! I will try my best to answer as many of your questions as possible. Good luck &amp; enjoy :)",

    "all_comment_text": "Maurten HATES this one trick.\n\nnah, this is really cool though. I'll definitely give this a try.\n\nLmao\n\nBig gel gonna come after me with all the work I’ve done on this subject lol\n\nLuckily you can now keep running indefinitely when they come after you.\n\nOP just chanting and taunting them as he runs away  \n  \n\"You can't catch me, I'm the Maurten 100 man\"\n\nPretty crazy that all the gels are is sugar, water, and agents to create the desired texture, and then put into a convenient pouch and sold individually at $7 (where I live). Must be huge margins on these. Thanks for sharing, I will try this in the future\n\nGlad to share!\n\nDamn, $7!? They’re “only” $3.60 each for the 12 pack on maurtens website, or $5 for the gel 160. Gus are $1.60 each.\n\nFood items usually have high margins, but keep in mind they also have other costs, such as packaging, labor, equipment, factory space, and shipping, plus R&amp;D, overhead, and marketing. And then they sell to retail shops who also have to make a profit.\n\nYou’re paying for the convenience of not having to do it yourself. For example, if you save $40 on a batch but it takes you 2 hours to make them, then you’re basically just paying yourself $20/hour for your labor.\n\nI've always maintained that energy gels don't do much that food/drink can't, and people are only downing these things because elite athletes are sponsored to do so in races 🙄\n\nI mean there's nothing special about what's in it. You're paying for the convenience of having something in a pouch to minimize mess and ease of use.\n\nTHIS.\n\nIt's all about convenience and ease of carrying.  And not spoiling if left in your bag for weeks.\n\nWhile in theory you’re right, downing the equivalent of around 80 carbs an hour during a max effort marathon is hard to do with food/drink. \n\nAnd, nothing new on race day, so you need to train with gels too.\n\nBig Gel in shambles. Quality post OP!\n\nThank you!\n\nmaybe step 1 should be moved to after you mix steps 2 and 3?\n\nSure, however you wanna do it :)\n\nBookmarked, thanks.\n\nAnytime doggy!\n\nOh good idea, thanks\n\nHey so I make my own gels but my recipe is pretty much just 50% maltodextrin powder 30% corn syrup 20% agave nectar and a touch of vanilla. Maybe some pectin. Boil if using pectin then throw into 90ml silicone travel tubes.\n\nFor my marathon, iirc, I used ~300g maltodextrin. 160mL corn syrup, 120mL agave nectar. Filled 5 travel tubes. It mightve been more or less, idk. It worked great.\n\nAnd that was it. No added electrolytes because mine go in my bladder and no added leucine because it tastes nasty af\n\nLegend\n\nHell yeah doggy!\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt’s already on their website. \n\nhttps://science.drinklmnt.com/electrolytes/best-homemade-electrolyte-drink-for-dehydration/\n\nThats awesome that they just put their recipes out there for people to make their own if they wanted. Makes me want to support them by buying their stuff lol\n\nSee my linked post at the very beginning for an electrolyte recipe!\n\nRecipe: Salt 😂\n\nThe king has returned! 👑\n\n🤴🤴\n\nThanks for the read, but I'll stick to eating Welch's fruit gummies!\n\nHell yeah doggy!\n\nThat’s legit!  I didn’t read the whole thread but it’s cool you were able to reverse engineer and come up with a recipe. \n\nWill I make it…I’m lazy so doubt it. But good job nonetheless!\n\nThank you, much appreciated doggy!\n\nOnce this marathon block is done, I will try this. Thanks\n\nAs someone who uses your Maurten 320 recipe on a weekly basis, thanks for posting this.\n\nI’m thinking about trying this, because I’m on a budget and can’t justify the cost of gels/chews as I train for ultras. \n\nLooks like about $70 for ingredients in available ingredient sizes. \n\nAre you happy with the gel following the recipe?\n\nYes, it took a couple tries to figure out what works for me, but I’m happy with the results.\n\nI just saved your previous recipe to try as I prepare for my spring marathon. Thank you for all of the work that you’ve put into this. You are the mvp of this subreddit.\n\nAw thank you for the kind words! I appreciate that!\n\n[removed]\n\nYOU’RE WELCOME DOGGY!\n\nThanks for the recipe. Made these! Turned out well. I actually used MD/fructose instead of sugar. Turned out fine. Question, should the sodium alginate start becoming viscous at all when mixed with the water? My tap water must be too hard. I tried a bottle of water the 2nd time and it’s less viscous but still a little gel like.\n\nGlad it worked for you!\n\nThe more calcium in the water the thicker the alginate solution will be.\n\nCould I omit or reduce the calcium gluconate to compensate?\n\nPotentially, yes. That would take some trial and error\n\nThanks for this brother! Saving my bank account this year.\n\nHave you experimented with different carbs sources such as honey? How would you balance a different fructose/glucose mixture?\n\nHappy to help! \n\nI have not, I believe honey is mostly fructose. Maple syrup would probably be a better option and is actually quite a solid carb source on its own.\n\nThey had Maurten 100s at Frankfurt Marathon Last week.\n\nHow the fuck do people eat that gelly while running?\n\nI'd much rather have a \"hydro\" gel that's like super sweet water/syrup\n\nIt goes down so easy for me lol\n\nWhat ? They are extremely easy  because you empty the entire thing into your mouth it stays whole and you just swallow the entire thing. It is not staying on your teeth so this way it is much better at preventing tooth decay.\n\ntooth decay 😂\n\nWhats so funny about that ? I have never told my dentist that I do endurance sports but he asked me if I run marathons during my last visit he said that even though endurance athletes usually have perfect oral hygiene they still have their bottom molars damaged from having film of sugar on them during races/training and having dryer mouth.\n\nSo for me not even getting that gel on my teeth is a big plus.\n\nIt's funny because you drink water immediately afterwards so yeah… for me it's a non problem\n\n100% agree. I ran a 50k and they had Maureen at the aid stations so I figured to grab some to try. Opened it and started to slurp and immediate it out and was questioning life. I’ll stick to my Precision Fuel that goes down easy and next to zero taste that makes me want to gag.\n\nThis is lovely! Can I use it some how to make candy like gel? I know some brand that has some sort of eatables also\n\nMost of the chews I've looked at use pectin. Basically, they're just an overly-thickened jelly that becomes more solid as it cools. Pectin is a little touchy in that it needs to be dissolved before the sugar, it requires some acid (usually from fruit, but citric acid is the typical culinary one), and you have to boil it up to temperatures only reachable by having a pretty thick sugar solution, but basically you're just making a jelly recipe and putting too much pectin in.\n\nPrecision Fuel uses corn starch as a thickener instead--basically just the world's thickest gravy. Seems weird, but I kind of like them.\n\nAlginate-calcium gels don't really do well with making a more solid thing. If you use more thickening you tend to mostly get chewy snot-like consistency in some places, and runny in others.\n\nHonestly I’m not sure!\n\nwhat made you try making your own gel?\n\nTo save money and have complete control over my fueling. And because I like to nerd out on things of course.\n\nYou can just puree jello in a blender.\n\nNow THATS innovative!\n\nDid you try flavoring them at all? \n\nNo, I have not. I’ve never felt the need to flavor them to be honest.\n\n-slams the save button- \n\nLets get cookin’ 👩🏼‍🍳👩🏼‍🍳\n\nHell yeah doggy! Enjoy\n\nI've thought about it but I rather just pay the $2 than mess around with all this stuff\n\nI tried to make this and don’t know what I’m doing wrong. It came out more of a clear gu gel liquid than like a normal maurten chunky gel. Am i doing something wrong? Not enough alginate? Too much gluconate? What can I adjust for better results? Thanks.\n\nDid you follow the exact recipe? \n\nIf so, did you use tap water?\n\nIf yes to both, try distilled water and let me know if that fixes it.\n\nI want to ask about dextrose vs maltodextrin specifically in relation to the Maurten 320 replica mix. Sorry your older post on this mix is now archived so I cant ask this question there.\n\nI have read that dextrose is converted to glucose faster which also makes maltrodextrin longer lasting and for this reason some people mix 50/50 of dextrose and maltodextrin, have you experimented with this?\n\nAs I understand it, you are correct. My belief and I believe Maurten’s as well, the fructose is your faster digesting carb and maltodextrin is your slower digesting carb. By adding dextrose you would have two fast digesting carbs, so I don’t know if it would be beneficial. A lot of this is theory so I just followed what Maurten did.\n\nThank you for the response as well as all the work you put into this whole endeavour!\n\nWith the price of maltodextrin and fructose being so high how do you think table sugar would do in your 320 mix. I saw you mentioned that maltrodextrin acts as a bit of a binding agent so assume it would be more liquid?\n\nHonestly I think it could work great and be a great alternative option. It may be a little less thick but for most of us non elites it should perform just fine.\n\nSorry one more question if you dont mind.\n\nIf Im switching out sugar for the Maltodextrin:Fructose mix that the only other difference in ingredients between your two mixes would be the Pectin vs Calcium Gluconate (of course the ratios of all the ingredients are different as well but I assume that has more todo with the desired consistency)\n\nAnyways, can you speak to the differences between Pectin vs. the Calcium Gluconate? \n\nI saw the RCT you referenced by Joshua Rowe on the use of hydro gel from Pectin and Sodium Alginate. Do you think Calcium Gluconate and Sodium Alginate would have a similar affect?\n\nI would say, if you’re wanting a carb drink then the pectin + alginate is better. If you want an actual gel, the calcium + alginate is better. \n\nThat’s my personal opinion so far.\n\nKinda hard to find Calcium Gluconate where I live, is there any alternative to that?\n\nIn Europe it's known as the \"E578 additive\". Still hard to find\n\nJust came across your older post - thanks for this!\n\nDid you ever end up with a successful recipe for Maurten 225 Solid bar? Would love to see that if so!\n\nAny advise to add flavour to this in safe way ? Meaning adding a flavor that will be totally safe for ingesting it ?  \nWhat about cooking flavours / aroma ?\n\nSorry, I don’t have any advice on this as I don’t flavor my gels. I’m sure it can be done quite simply though!\n\nThanks anyway :-)\n\nCalcium Carbonate + Gluconic Acid = Calcium Gluconate.\n\nCalcium Gluconate is hard to find in Europe. It's frequently listed as additive E578.  \nAny advise on how it could be made using Calcium Carbonate and Gluconic Acid ?\n\nI don’t have much guidance other than you need 6mg of calcium per gel and the gluconic acid is used to neutralize the pH of your calcium carbonate solution. I would suggest targeting a 7pH and see how that works.\n\nJust made my first batch. Since I had already a large quantity of maltodextrine and fructose at home for Maurten 320 remakes I have made the gels with the maltodextrine instead of glucose power. I'll try it tomorrow during an easy long run.\n\nIf you want it still cheap (using table sugar) but also 0.8:1 fructose to glucose, you could split table sugar with maltodextrin at 8:1\n\nThat’d be 213.33g table sugar with 26.67g maltodextrin, to make up 240g (I’m sure rounding to the nearest tenth is fine, so 213.3g and 26.7g)\n\nThis is so cool, I’m definitely trying it! Thanks OP!"

    "all_comment_text": "Can’t wait to run Boston when I’m 60\n\nDon’t know how old you are but by the time I’m 60 the paces will be like … too fast…. \n\nI'm 58.  If in 18 months I can match my marathon time from last year of 3.43, I'll possibly get a Boston place.\n\nIt's a big if\n\nYou don't have to be 60 when you run the BQ, just by race day.  The window for the 2026 is now open, so you can run it now, not in 18 months.\n\nGood to know. Thanks\n\nI'm 43 right now, if I run a 3:15 can I use it once I turn 45 as long as it's in the window? Also, do I need to be 45 on race day, or 45 by 12/31 of the race year?\n\nPretty sure it’s the age you are on race day\n\nHope to be killing it like you when I'm there! Nice work!\n\nI have been perpetually stuck at the same qualifying time until I turned 45 and got the 5 minute bump. The first time I qualified back in 2009 the 18-34 time was 3:10. By the time I hit 35-39 range they dropped 5 minutes to 3:10. Then by the time I turned 40 once again it was down to 3:10. 45 I got the 10 minute gift of 3:20 which is now 3:15 so by the time I hit 50 I'll still be at 3:20. It's a crazy standard. They really need to consider the age percentages of qualifiers and adjust more on age.\n\n3:20 is a 68% age graded standard for a 50 year old man. That's significantly lower than the age graded standard for a 34 year old man. AFAIK the standards for all age groups are below 70%, so they aren't that wild.\n\nI’m right there with you. Needed a 3:10:59 when I first qualified in 2007, back when Boston gave those extra 59 seconds. 17 years later I need a 3:15 and probably more like 3:13 to be safe.\n\nI’m in my 30s, so I might be right there with you 🥲\n\nIt's pretty depressing how much you might slow down with age. I'm 57. It's really amazing how much I slowed down since I hit 50 or so. Granted, I'm not training nearly as much, or as seriously, but my paces at a younger age seem completely impossible right now, even for short stretches. My marathon PR from age 40 is 2:43, or 6:13 per mile. I don't think I could maintain that for 200 meters now. I typically plod along at 10 minutes per mile, but dipping below 9 minute pace takes a lot of effort. TBH, I never had any interest in running Boston, but I moved here for work, and now I'm kind of interested, but the standard suddenly seems very difficult.\n\nMy Grandfather did it at 60, it was a pretty inspiring thing to see as a kid.\n\nAt this rate at 60 I'll have the same qualifying time as I do right now \n\nCurrent PR is 4:05. I'm 56. I think 60 might actually be a decent goal. Maybe.\n\nYou’re definitely much closer to BQ than I am!\n\nI'm doing it for the first time at 55 next year!  I only really started running seriously (and did my first marathon) this year, so I don't know what times I would have been capable of in my younger years.  However, looking at the qualifying times, I certainly agree being older does have some advantages :-).\n\nMe too. I’m 62. I just started running in February. Trying to BQ my first race in October. Yup. We old timers get a massive break. If I don’t do it this race, I will do it in the next one.\n\nYeah no joke. As a 30 something dude with a full time job and travels a lot, I feel I would have to take a month off to train just to near this pace of my age group.\n\nI ran it when I was 60. It was a birthday present, my 20th marathon and a retirement present all rolled into one.  I had qualified several times before, but began to think I might not have another chance.\n\nThat’s amazing! That standard is still faster than the median marathon runner, so it’s an impressive feat at 60.\n\nI'm thinking the same thing. I'm 57 and hoping to retire at 62. In a strange twist of fate, I relocated to Boston (well, near it,) for work. I qualified in a past life 8 times, but was never that interested in running it, given the expense and hassle, but now it's my hometown marathon, so I'm suddenly interested. At least for the moment.\n\nCongrats, retiring at 60 is a rare feat!\n\nYeah, just another reason to run.  I saved a lot of money by not playing golf or joining a gym.\n\nmaybe 65, if everyone else stops running between now and then\n\nThat’s not too bad, I can finish a marathon in under 5 hours, let alone 7 /s.\n\nShit I limped the last ten miles of my last one and still finished in 6\n\nAs someone who hasn't ever looked at qualifying for big races like this, I was like, oh, shit, I could run this huh\n\nHeh, I thought the same thing, until I remembered the 3:40 thing.\n\nLucked out and got into Tokyo this year. Already accepted a while ago that Boston will be my last star lmao\n\nCongrats! I lucked out too and got it, will be a hell of a first marathon for me\n\nThat 5 minute adjustment makes a lot of sense after the last couple years. Better to just have the real standard in writing than smash people's hopes every year. Aiming for a 2:50 in February (M37 then) to make absolutely sure there's nothing to worry about.\n\nWell I mean, it'll still be -3:30 or -4 next year, it'll just mean some people don't get to call themselves 'qualifiers'.\n\nSure, but hopefully it's closer to a minimal cutoff. BQ isn't the standard, the cutoff is. It's just impossible to perfectly predict it every year, so people inevitably feel upset about getting left out when there's a discrepancy. They'll never get it exactly right, but it was clearly too lax the last couple years and this was needed.\n\nIn my view, if the qualifier time isn’t going to guarantee acceptance, why change it? All it does is change a somewhat standardized timing metric without providing a guaranteed time goal. \n\nThe BAA should just be honest and say the top X people will qualify (still including age/gender brackets).\n\nIf it's set appropriately, it's a good training target. They need to keep lowering the times until the cutoff is fairly minimal. It's not a huge deal to over perform the standard by 30s on race day to lock in a spot. That's just a gut check at the end. 5-6 minutes is enough to change your training focus.\n\nIf everyone over performs the standard by 30s, then we’re back where we started with too many runners. Implying that runners should just run 30s faster to avoid the cutoff is hilarious because if everyone took that advice, some of those runners would still not make it. \n\nAgain, the BAA just needs to take a reality check and admit they’re just admitting the top X runners and not all runners who meet a standard. \n\nSo given that the standard doesn’t guarantee acceptance and instead you’ll need to aim for some amount below the standard, they might as well keep the standard, you know standardized, and let us measure how much below the standard you need to be on a consistent basis. If\n\nIf the standard is appropriate, most people won't be able to meet it and the cutoff won't really matter. That's the point of lowering it. Make it hard enough that you don't really need a cutoff and you don't really have to over perform much at all. \n\n\nIf there's no published standard, nobody has a clue what kind of time to train for. Just make it harder every year until cutoffs don't matter much. Problem solved.\n\n&gt; If the standard is appropriate, most people won’t be able to meet it and the cutoff won’t really matter. That’s the point of lowering it. Make it hard enough that you don’t really need a cutoff and you don’t really have to over perform much at all. \n\nThis ignores the first part of my comment. If you only have to over perform a little and you’re implying that’s a reasonable ask, then if everyone does that reasonable ask, the standard will still be too high and the cutoff will end up being something that does require over performing by more than a little. \n\n&gt; If there’s no published standard, nobody has a clue what kind of time to train for.\n\nThis is just not true. You’d have the exact same information as you do today. You’d know what times would qualify based on the previous year. You would not know for sure if that time would qualify for the following year. That’s the exact same way it is today. Pretending otherwise is just trying to mislead people. \n\n&gt; Just make it harder every year until cutoffs don’t matter much. Problem solved.\n\nDo you think the BAA will be ok with racing at a below capacity level because not enough interested runners met the standard? Would the running community at large be ok with that? Because that’s what will happen when you finally low standards “enough”.\n\nMy point is that eventually, most people won't get close enough to the standard that the cutoff will be minimal and for those fast enough, most will get in with a slight over performance.\n\n\nIf I were trying to solve this, I'd just drop the standard by roughly the level of the cutoff every year until it was fairly small (a minute or so) and then just leave it at that until things changed meaningfully. It's not all that different from looking at last year's cutoff, which is what everyone does anyways, but at least now you don't have to deal with the people whining that they ran a BQ time and didn't get in every single year. The goal is for there to be parity between the standards and acceptance times. It's never gonna be perfect, but at least dropping the standards to be close to the typical cutoff stops most of the bitching and moaning this time of year.\n\n&gt; My point is that eventually, most people won’t get close enough to the standard that the cutoff will be minimal and for those fast enough, most will get in with a slight over performance.\n\nYou keep ignoring that if everyone has a slight over performance, the cutoff will still be more than minimal. No matter what standard of reasonable over performance you come up with, if everyone meets that standard, then no one will be cut off by the reasonable over performance and some will be cutoff by failing to over perform by a much larger amount. \n\n&gt; It’s not all that different from looking at last year’s cutoff, which is what everyone does anyways, but at least now you don’t have to deal with the people whining that they ran a BQ time and didn’t get in every single year. \n\nGlad we’re finally admitting that a top X runners cutoff and then publishing that cutoff time would work the same as the current system. \n\nBut regardless, this will continue to cause issues for as long as people train towards the BQ time. People aren’t running in a vacuum. As you acknowledge, the standards are used (or at least ideally should be used) as times to aim for. That means people will always train to beat them which will lead to too many people who beat them.\n\nYea agree on lowering it either way! \n\nWife got hit by the cut off last year and was 11 seconds short, crushed her . Then she ran her best marathon a week later and gave herself an 18min buffer, got accepted for the 2025 !\n\nLooks like my second rejection is coming soon!\n\nGoing to kill it in Chicago in a couple weeks though, so I don’t have to get another of these stupid rejections!\n\nFingers crossed for good weather.\n\nDid you fundraise for Chicago or get in the lottery? Hope to run Chicago in 2025\n\nTime qualified this year and just hit legacy status this year as well. Previous years have all been via the lottery though. \n\nThough, I think the lottery is much harder now. 2017, I think it was still a 50/50 chance.\n\nDo you know the statistics for the lottery? For London it's now about 50/1\n\nI believe around 30% of lottery entrants were accepted this year. That’s based on a field of 50,000 runners with 70% getting in through the lottery (which is the percentage of the field made up of lottery entrants that’s been reported in the past) and 120,000 lottery entrants!\n\nThis year, London had 800,000 lottery entrants  for about 20,000 lottery places. It's crazy numbers \n\nThere's also about 20,000 charity runners and a few thousand elite and club runners\n\nNot the commenter you responded to, but my partner and I are both also doing Chicago next month\n\nShe got in through the lottery, I did fundraising. If you end up doing fundraising, I did it through the Red Cross and the process was pretty painless with them\n\nI have a friend doing it next month through fundraising and I actually helped her out with donating. \n\nThanks for the feedback for both!!!\n\nI ran for PAWS Chicago last year and it was also a great experience. \n\nPlus, I had extra motivation. Couldn't let those cats and dogs down\n\nAs a fellow pet owner I’ll have to check them out too :)\n\nI also ran with Team Paws.  Simply fantastic organization.  Regular email communication (but not overwhelming), very clear reports as to how they use the money you raise, activities hosted by Team Paws leading up to the marathon, heck even their shirts were infinitely better than the official merch.  If you're doing a charity for Chicago definitely check them out\n\nI'll see you in Chicago. But not really because I'm going to run like a 4:30. I've been running consistently for 20 years and I still can't figure out how anyone gets in good enough shape to qualify for Boston before age 70. My yearly mileage is 1800-2100 miles and I'm aiming for like 4:30.\n\nSpeed work.\n\nOnce a week, take the pace you run your marathon at and run 30 seconds faster than that for some 800s with a minute rest. Do some sprint work, make uncomfortable. \n\nYou won’t get faster if you don’t push your legs faster than you’re use to. Run slow to run fast only works if you also run fast…otherwise you only know how to run slow. \n\nGive it a shot and see.\n\nI've done speed work once per week with a group on a public track for about 10 years. Every Wednesday night. Sometimes it's VO2 max and sometimes threshold. That's my hardest workout of the week. Monday I try to get in some marathon pace or threshold repeats during my run but I'm less consistent with those. Sometimes I'm exhausted by the end of the weekend with the long run plus dealing with my kids so I make Monday an easy day probably every other week.\n\nMy week is usually:\n\n- Monday: 8 miles: marathon pace or threshold intervals, but sometimes easy run depending on how I'm feeling\n\n- Tuesday: 6 miles easy\n\n- Wednesday: Speedwork: 8-10 miles total with 3-5 miles of hard intervals on the track. I live a little over two miles from the track so I usually slow jog there and back for warm up and cool down.\n\n- Thursday: 6-8 miles easy\n\n- Friday: Rest or 4-6 miles easy depending on my work/family schedule and fatigue level.\n\n- Saturday: Long run 14-20 miles. Distance dependant on where I am in training block.\n\n- Sunday: 6-8 miles easy. Maybe less mileage or rest if it was a 20 miler week.\n\nWith that routine I'm somehow slower right now than I was 10 years ago when I was only running 20mpw. Sleep is probably a big issue due to my kids and job. I never have a consistent sleep schedule and I routinely have to sacrifice sleep to run. Like right now it's 8:30pm and my wife isn't home from work yet. I'm home with the kids (they're sleeping) but I can't go out to run until my wife gets home. I'll likely be running until after 10pm tonight.\n\nWay to get after it even with the kind of hectic schedule! Your dedication to getting out there that late is impressive enough for me.\n\nI don't think I would do it every night because it really wrecks my sleep to run at 10pm. It's only like one day every week or two when mine and my wife's work schedules don't mesh well and I need to do that. I always make those nights easy runs too. I'll push off the workouts until I can run at a normal time of the day.\n\nI'm in the same boat. Demanding home and work life makes running a lot harder for us than the 20- somethings who have the time and energy to put a ton of focus into the hobby. Took me 5 years to get a sub 2-hr half marathon.\n\n\nI, for one, have come to terms that I'll never be as fast as my younger running friends, but if they're still putting in the mileage that I am at my age, then I'll be impressed. They may be faster, but I'm damn healthy for my age and it'll pay off not just for me, but for my family as well in the long run.\n\nMore unsolicited advice, but post-marathon I would replace the MP/threshold run with a 5k-10k race or race effort 2-3 times/month and maybe consider moving up a group in the weekly track workout for a few weeks. Strides every day\n\nIf possible, I truly recommend one on one coaching! With my coach I went from my first marathon at 3:54 to 2:55 in about 18 months. A mix of high easy volume and speed work is the key success factor imo. It is totally doable, trust me I started running with quite minimal fitness.\n\nWhat does one on one coaching provide that following a training plan doesn't provide? A big part of my issue is that I have a wife and young kids, so very often I have to adjust workout days or run at odd times of the night, or just don't have time to run on certain days so I make it a rest day. I also have zero time for strength training anymore since having kids. I'm hoping to get back to the gym once my kids are both in school full time during the day.\n\nI've always figured it would be really hard for a coach to work around my chaotic schedule.\n\nYeah I saw your further comments about your busy personal life after I commented. I would say one on one coaching will allow you to fine tune your training to your goals and current fitness. For me it helped take a lot of the guessing out of it when using a plan sourced online. Things like - should I workout today if I'm sore, did I go too tough yesterday for today's speed work etc. With a coach I can just chat with them to get an idea of what to be working on that week and I let him know my schedule in advance if I have time for bigger or smaller workouts. Around my busy season for work, we would tailor back to a few key workouts and go in to a maintenance mode. Lastly, I find the accountability of a coach really helps me stay on track when training gets tough or life gets busy! I don't think I would have been able to increase my times without my coach's help.\n\n&gt; Lastly, I find the accountability of a coach really helps me stay on track when training gets tough or life gets busy!\n\nThat's a pretty good reason honestly, because I feel the same way about group runs. I have group track workouts on Wednesday nights, and group long runs on Saturday. Pretty much no matter how stressed I am or how little sleep I get I'm always motivated to go to those group workouts. I think there are many many days where I wouldn't have gotten up at 5:30am to run 15 miles on a Saturday alone, but knowing I'm going to meet the group always pushes me to do it.\n\nDo you have any recommendations for how to find a one on one coach? Most coaching services seem to be kind of minimal where they just email you a plan. The accountability you're describing is probably what would really help me. Not just having a plan sent to my E-Mail once per month.\n\nYeah that is exactly how I feel about group runs as well. Doing a long run with a group makes it much easier to stomach. Honestly I am not too sure! I found my coach through my physio, and have been working with him for 3 years now. We text daily, and there is no monthly plan he sends me. I just know generally what type of workout to expect now on any given day. We don't do any in person sessions, he actually lives in a separate province from me - but I believe generally in person sessions would be extra for all coaches. If you're interested in chatting with him, I'd be happy to give you his info over a DM!\n\nThat’s my plan too! See you in Chicago!\n\nHow'd chicago go?\n\nDid you qualify\n\nOof. I qualified 5 years ago by 18 seconds and didn’t get in. It was a PR. Lowered my time by 15 minutes to do it. Then tore my meniscus the next year and haven’t been able to get back anywhere near that pace again. Really wanted to be able to run it once …\n\nWhen you have five you can join the Abbott lottery. In 2023 they had 150 spots for 5 star finishers. \n\nI’ve got three and lived in Boston as an expat. Boston marathon is on the absolute top of my wish list. But I’ll never run it. I was on a two year training plan to qualify. But my knee is so far worn out that several doctors advised to stop (long distance) running.\n\nIf you really want to run Boston, use your linkedin network to find someone that works for one of the sponsors.  Sponsors get an allotment of bibs and there's always someone that ends up getting injured.  \n\nOr just bandit it.\n\nI want to run Boston after earning it. Sounds dumb, perhaps, but I don’t want to bandit it, or get in thru other means. I want(ed) to run it after qualifying.\n\nDoes that mean someone at one of those companies could just give you a bid even if you don’t work there?\n\nI'm not sure exactly, I think that they're transferrable.  I ended up getting mine through a friend of a friend that knew a judge that was friends with some cops and all I had to do was pick up an empty Ford Taurus at a Steak House in Chelsea at 3:00 AM and drive it to a junk yard in North Attleborough and discreetly make my way home.  Then they put the bib under my name and I picked it up at the tradeshow.  Easy peasy.\n\nThey need to limit downhill racing. You can drop 8000 feet off the side of a mountain and BQ. Olympic trial quali limits to something like 450 feet of loss. That should be a similar standard.\n\nThe problem with that is that Boston itself is like a 460 foot net loss. And Boston doesn’t want to eliminate itself as a qualifier\n\nMaybe set it to maximum loss is Boston elevation itself.\n\nThat is exactly how the OTQ course standard was set FWIW\n\nThey can set whatever rules they like, so can easily just make an exception for Boston itself.\n\nIs the tougher qualifier really because of downhill courses or are runners just getting faster because they are running more and longer? \n\nThe people in my run club have gotten ridiculously fast over the past 2 years. Before, our fastest group aimed for a sub 3. Now, we’re aiming for sub 2:50 and even faster. I’m pretty confident that most of the people in our second fastest group can sub 3. And we run courses like LA, San Diego RNR, Berlin, CIM, Chicago. We don’t do the Revel courses. And I know other clubs in my city are also getting quicker.\n\nProbably partially running is getting faster at the hobby level. It definitely is. But I think the rise in BQ popularity is also leading to more people scamming out a 15+ min PR on a massive downhill course. \n\nLast Boston I found (2021), only ~8% qualified from the male 39 and under range. So that means 92% of the field is getting in on quali mins of 3:10+. Maybe the whole community is getting faster but you are also getting about 3-5k worth of qualifying coming from revel and other heavy downhill races (about 13.5% of the qualifying. So more people are qualifying from the downhill courses then are getting in sub from the sub 3:10 minimums from downhill or flat/rolling, any type of course.\n\nThis is the real answer.  The hard part is that some really major races are large net downhill (CIM).  Just like anything major, the answers are political.  \n\nAll that said, qualifying for a major is *supposed* to be hard, and people are getting faster.  So what's the goal?  Run a qualifying time or just run Boston?  If the former, then you gotta do the work; if the latter, just raise the money for a charity entry.  There is no wrong answer.  You just need to decide what your goal is in this situation.\n\nEDIT: CIM was a bad example.  I was thinking it was more downhill.  Tuscon or St. George on the other hand...\n\nThere’s a significant difference between a rolling course with ~ 300ft of net downhill like CIM (or Boston for that matter), and those courses that go straight down a mountain for 3,000+ ft. It’s not that hard to regulate it. Just look at the OTQ course standards.\n\nApologies, I was thinking CIM was more like 1k downhill.  Tuscon and St George come to mind, and I hear the new Las Vegas marathon is another straight downhill race.  \n\nPoint being is that I agree with you, and these huge net downhill races are bullshit.\n\nCIM is not an easy down hill course - very much rolling. Your quads are toast by the end\n\nCIM is really similar to the Boston course. There are some up hills in there too. I would argue that it's probably easier to qualify on something crazy flat like Chicago than it is to qualify at CIM. I'm fine with that one being a BQ eligible course. The real problem would be totally down hill races. Not just net down hill\n\nI’m glad I was able to run Boston back in 2022 when they had no time cut-off, lol, because otherwise I think it might be 10 more years before I could’ve run Boston. This year I had a 58 second buffer so I was already at peace knowing it wasn’t enough to make the cut.\n\nPersonally what I would like to see:\n\n- they reserve a certain amount of entries (say, 2000) for “first time Boston runners.” If you have a BQ time that doesn’t make the cutoff, but it’s your first time running Boston, you can enter a lotto and be randomly selected as one of the 2000 entries. That way, it at least gives first timers a chance (maybe not a high chance, but a chance) to still make it into Boston even if their time doesn’t meet the cutoff. (I would prefer this over other options people have proposed like “not allowing people to enter if they’ve already done Boston X times” because in my opinion if you have a BQ time and meet the cutoff, you deserve to run it)\n\n- revel courses and other downhill races should not be considered for BQ times. I might get some flak for this opinion but I think these courses are artificially inflating people’s times and allowing them to BQ when they normally wouldn’t on a flat or hilly course. I’m not hating on people who do run these courses to BQ (it’s allowed per the rules so by all means, do it!)… this is just my opinion.\n\nReserving 2000 slots for first time qualifiers just reduces the rest of the field size, which would drive the cut off lower and exclude more people who would have made it otherwise. I don’t really see how that solves anything.\n\nIt only reduces the field size of the repeat runners, but the overall field size stays the same. \n\nI think there's an argument to be made about letting people who qualify with their first BQ in and letting the serial qualifiers duke it out via buffer competition. Otherwise the bar just keeps going up and up incentivize people to do more goofy shit like abuse hyper downhill races set up to skum you in or to identify as non-male just to get an extra half hour.\n\nIf you have a field of 20,000 and 2000 slots are set aside, you’re now basing the cut off time on a reduced field of 18,000 runners. I don’t see what’s so hard to understand about that.\n\n“I think there’s an argument to be made about letting people who qualify with their first BQ in”\n\nWhat is that argument exactly? Serial qualifiers work just as hard to get there and I don’t really see why they’re less deserving of a place on the start line than someone who ran slower than they did. \n\nTo your last point, what makes you think less people will look for loopholes if qualifying one time was guaranteed entry?\n\n&gt; What is that argument exactly? Serial qualifiers work just as hard to get there and I don’t really see why they’re less deserving of a place on the start line than someone who ran slower than they did.\n\nObjectively, people who qualified a decade ago did not work as hard (assuming the standard for “work hard” is their qualifying time). \n\nIt really depends on what Boston wants to be/do. If they want to be the race of the fastest runners, then just get rid of the concept of qualifying times and pick the fastest runners. If instead they want to be a race that anyone can run if they meet the qualifying time (and are only restricting it due to capacity issues), then it absolutely makes sense to prioritize people who have a qualifying time but have not run Boston before.\n\nThat’s not objective at all lmao\n\nBoston has always been a race for the fastest runners, which is why they’ve implemented a cut off ever since the number of applicants outgrew the capacity. At this point the function of the qualifying times is to reduce the admin that BAA has to do by limiting the number of applications they have to process and certify.\n\n&gt; That’s not objective at all lmao\n\nOk, then you’re just admitting that your argument that serial qualifiers worked just as hard doesn’t mean anything either. Which is it? Does qualifying time equal hard work or not? \n\n&gt; Boston has always been a race for the fastest runners, which is why they’ve implemented a cut off ever since the number of applicants outgrew the capacity. \n\nThen let’s be honest about it and say the top X runners in each age/gender bracket qualify. \n\n&gt; At this point the function of the qualifying times is to reduce the admin that BAA has to do by limiting the number of applications they have to process and certify.\n\nYou can process and certify applications from fastest to slowest time until the field is filled up. This is not an impossible problem to solve. In fact, it would be a waste of time for the BAA to be certifying a submission that was only 1 minute faster than the standard as is.\n\nHonestly, I was going to give a detailed response to each point but you’re being so obtuse it’s not really worth my time. \n\n- Suggesting you can objectively quantify people’s effort is completely asinine (which is why entry is based on an actual measurable benchmark like time btw)\n\n- It’s a race for the fastest in each age group*\n\n- Yeah, that’s basically what they do now, but they can do it efficiently by sorting through 36k applications instead of God knows how many they’d receive without qualifiers\n\nEvery year there’s a cut off and every year people whine about how unfair it is. The truth is, granting entries based on pure merit is as fair as it gets.\n\n&gt; ⁠Suggesting you can objectively quantify people’s effort is completely asinine (which is why entry is based on an actual measurable benchmark like time btw)\n\n*You* were the one who initially asked why should someone who worked just as hard not qualify. Considering qualification is based on run time, that’s implying that effort can be related to run time. I was simply continuing that logic. If you want to agree that hard work doesn’t require run time, great I agree. But that means your argument that serial qualifiers worked just as hard means nothing because we don’t know if they have or not. \n\n&gt; It’s a race for the fastest in each age group*\n\nIf you’re going to be creating groups of runners, then you now have to justify why those groups should exist and not others. Once you move away from “only the fastest runners can run”, selecting the fastest runners who meet X criteria is par for the course. \n\n&gt; Yeah, that’s basically what they do now, but they can do it efficiently by sorting through 36k applications instead of God knows how many they’d receive without qualifiers\n\nKeep the qualifying times constant and you still accomplish that. \n\n&gt; Every year there’s a cut off and every year people whine about how unfair it is. The truth is, granting entries based on pure merit is as fair as it gets.\n\nAgain, it’s not “pure merit”. There’s already numerous slots given for age/gender/charity/etc based reasons. If it was pure merit, everyone who ran a sub 3:00 would make it. Now I agree with the BAA that a pure merit race wouldn’t be as good. But the fact it isn’t pure merit means simply saying “just be the fastest” no longer is a good argument.\n\nThat’s a fair point. I think it would be better if they added more spots instead, but I assume they haven’t gone with that solution as Boston’s infrastructure can’t physically support any more than the race currently has.\n\nYeah, I don’t think expanding the field is really an option. You could reduce the number of charity entries, but that’s understandably controversial. Ultimately, yes it sucks that people miss the cut off, but it’s 100% a meritocracy so you can’t really complain about it being unfairly exclusionary.\n\nYeah exactly. As much as I want to run Boston this just isn't just unfair it's completely unreasonable. It would ruin the prestige.\n\nI started running last July. I ran my first marathon in February, and qualified, but knew I wasn’t fast enough, so I turned around and ran another at the end of July. I PR’d by 6:26 minutes over my first attempt. Both were downhill races. The trail on the second was much worse than the first and certainly cost me some time. Did I pick those marathons because they were probably faster than a flat race? Yes. Did I also choose them because they were at the right time in locations that would have preferable weather? Yes.  \n  \nI totally understand with what you are saying, but it isn’t quite black and white. Should we ban plated shoes too? Or gels? If it is 52 degrees for a qualifying race should we adjust the qualifying time? Running 26.2 miles is not an easy feat whether or not it’s perfect weather, downhill, or with amazing crowd support.  \n  \nThe cool thing about running is it is a personal challenge. And I’m set to run my third marathon in December. It is not a downhill. You know why? Because I want to prove to myself that I’ve really got it. My goal time is 2:30 under my previous race to hopefully qualify for ‘26. When I signed up for my first half in July of ‘23 I made deals with myself. If I run my first half under x I’ll sign up for a full. If I BQ in my first full I’ll sign up for another to chase a time to get in. And now I’ve done that. And it’s not just because I ran a downhill race. It’s because I woke up 5-6 days a week and laced up my shoes, pushed myself past comfort and became a better athlete.  \n  \nI was feeling pretty burnt out before the announcement today. Just lacking a bit of motivation at the moment, and seeing that I achieved a goal I would have never even thought of having 18 months ago is going to push me even more.  \n  \nI definitely like your lottery idea though. That is probably the most equitable option I’ve seen proposed. \n  \nFinally, let’s not forget that Boston itself actually is a net downhill race 🤣\n\nMost of your comment reads like it’s off topic to me in regards to what you’re responding to.\n\nAdjusting times for race conditions is not the same as simply not including downhill marathons.  One is unrealistic, one is realistic.\n\nIt might be net downhill but it’s by no means an easy course.\n\nCan someone Eli5? Like is that the average mile time or the whole race?\n\nWhole race, but for Boston you have a qualifying time based on your age, and then an official acceptance to participate that in this case is 6 minutes 51 seconds less than that time. For example, if they say hey you need a 3 hour qualifying time to get in, you may qualify for your application, but the competition this year made it so that you won't have a guaranteed spot and subsequent invite to run it unless your time is 2:53:09\n\nAwesome, thanks makes sense\n\nMost major marathons are by age group right?\n\nIt is fairly common to divide it up into age increments in an attempt for equity among everyone. Helps keep really famous/popular races from being just a bunch of people in their younger years racing at peak fitness.\n\nDifferent age/sex categories have different total time cutoffs just to apply for the race. This year, anyone who beat their age/sex total time cutoff by 6 minutes and 51 seconds or more was accepted. \n\nhah glad i aged up. I'd be pissed if I were going to be 34 next boston. still waiting for my official e-mail though. because of age-up my cut-off was 10:31, without it it would have only been 5:31.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is off of last year's qualifying time, so 2:53 and under got in, which is still insanely fast.\n\nGive it 10 years and it'll just be the OTQ for the youngest age groups\n\nIt used to be!\n\nI missed the cutoff by about a minute and a half, but I am still so proud of myself and for achieving that time. I worked hard for it and put in a lot of miles and time at the gym to get the time that I did, on top of balancing a busy work schedule and other life priorities. It's something I never thought I'd do, and I've done it twice now! \n\nKudos to all who made it in. Have fun in Boston!\n\n[deleted]\n\nAw man. I’m 5:48 this is great!\n\n5 hours and 48 minutes\n\nSucks that runners like me who run nearly every day for 10+ years (50mpw this year) may never get to run Boston.  I can run around a 3:30 at age 39 but it's just not enough.  And I'm not even remotely close...\n\nI feel your pain. I've averaged over 1500 miles per year for 10 years, but my last 5 have been over 2,000. Last year I ran my PR of 3:31, but I somehow managed to get covid three times in one year since that race. This year I'm still going to hit somewhere between 1800 and 2000 miles run but I'm only targeting about 4:30 for the Chicago marathon in three weeks. Long covid is killing me.\n\nI had to peak at a 71 mile week to run the 3:31 last fall. I don't know how so many people my age run sub 3:00. I also have young kids so upping my mileage or doing more weight lifting isn't really possible until both of them are in school full time.\n\nI'm in the same boat... this will be my 5th 2,000 mile year and yet I'm only getting a tiny bit faster each year.  I've watched people my age run far fewer miles and get far better results.  It's depressing!\n\nI felt like I was starting to see results last year with a 9 minute marathon PR, and I was pretty close to my 10k PR. But then I got covid three times in one year. I'm still running, but the long covid has me running slower than I was 10 years ago. It's really depressing that one virus which only gave me cold-like symptoms three times can cancel out over 10 years of endurance training. I didn't get that sick any of the times I had it but my lung capacity and heart rate just won't recover.\n\nouch that sucks... I hope you recover!\n\nBump your mileage and use a different plan.\n\nI have 3 kids aged 6, 3, and 3.  Running 50mpw is nothing short of a miracle right now.  I already wake up at 5am most days just to get the miles in so I can be home by the time the kids wake up.\n\nI do tempo runs and speed work outs and long runs but there's only so much I can do.  I'm not trying to make excuses, I've gone very far out of my way to figure out how to get up to 50mpw given my current life situation.\n\nIt's fine, whatever, I'm not going to qualify and I'll just accept it instead of complaining\n\nYou're gonna have to get rid of the kids, I'm afraid.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think what you do is incredible. I only have myself, my partner, and my job, and getting the time to run is tough enough as it is. Throwing three kids into the mix would give me hourly panic attacks, lol.\n\nIncredibly impressive to get 50mpw with three young kiddos! I've got a 1yo and 3yo, and when I'm running 30mpw (which is only in the height of training... usually 15-20) it's a struggle. And at the expense of pretty much any other fitness activity or hobby. Do you do any weight training as well? Or is all your solo/exercise time just running? I can't imagine you'd have time to do much else!\n\nThank you it's definitely difficult to fit it all in!  I do pretty much only running.  Wednesdays I do some body weight exercises too but it's only like 20 min at most\n\nAnd that’s commendable to do what you’re doing. Don’t discredit what five more miles in a week can add compounded over time. If you just started running 50mpw then give it another cycle and you’ll probably see a shift. Volume additions take time and most importantly consistency to pay off. Maybe the way you are structuring your plan needs tweaked? I’ll be honest, while 50mpw seems like a lot, and it is for a casual runner, it’s in the very low end of what is needed on average to run a solid marathon time near one’s potential. That’s what has always been the allure of Boston, it’s attainable for the vast majority of they can commit to and put in the work which isn’t easy at all. Best of luck on your next attempt. Stick to it and I think you’ll surprise yourself\n\nThanks, I know 50mpw is on the low end but I'm struggling with it.  I've been doing it since March in preparation for the NYC marathon and my body is having a hard time recovering.  Before that I was doing 40mpw for around 4 years.\n\nThose extra ten miles will pay off if you can stick with it.\n\nI'm a bit surprised to hear you say that 50mpw is on the very low end of what is needed. I'm a 28 year old male and I ran my first BQ time in 2021 while peaking at 76km's. Although a bump up to \\~85-95km per week helped me drop my time to 2:48 in 2024.\n\nI don’t know why that’s so surprising, it’s what data shows on average. There will always be outliers that can do more with less but don’t let that skew your thought to mean it is the same for everyone.\n\n4, 3, and 3 for me. I’ll keep going out there once a year and giving it a go. I know I can’t hit the cutoff, but maybe I can beat my qualifying time. I enjoy the chase.\n\nWe're in the thick of it, for sure!  Good luck!\n\nI think it’s totally do able… you’re already aging in to the 40+ bracket and finding time to run 50 MPW.  Once your kids are all in grade school and a bit less dependant + a focused plan with a bit more mileage and targeting the required pace. I wouldn’t count myself out in your situation (if it’s even a goal of yours).\n\nWow! I think you should be hella proud of that! From my experience, there is such huge variability in how effort/training translates to race times for recreational runners that I tend to view my own success not from records alone but how much joy and fulfillment I get from running. Like, some people can easily hit a certain time/milestone after some solid training, while others will bust their ass for a slower time while having similar amount of miles and effort. Unfortunately natural ability/health and ton of other factors that we can't entirely control play a huge role in athletics, so for me at least, I think overly focusing on just times can be a bummer.\n\nFor me it's not the physical aspect of training or the walls I hit with pacing. It's just time. I work and have a kid. The fact I can run an hour or two a day is already pushing it.\n\nJust give up even MORE of your time bro.\n\nI mean…it’s the Boston marathon.  Supply and demand issue.\n\nJust shows the sheer number of people able to run at that level.\n\nThink sub 2:53 is a safe buffer for 2026?\n\nDepends on age group, sex.\n\nIf a 3:00 BQ?  Nope.  2026 is 130th anniversary,  so I expect an 8 or 9 or even 10 min cutoff.\n\nFor 27/28 year old male. I don’t think anniversary# will be a factor. I’d be surprised if it hit 8, and shocked if it hit 9. 10 I think is unfathomable for the foreseeable future\n\nWell they dropped the 2026 bq times already, so you're probably right, that will kill some delta.\n\nDelta from the old standard I meant\n\nMy unpopular opinion is that there should be a limit on the number of times you can run a world major in a defined time period. For example, you can run a tace up to 3 times in a 5 year period and then you have to wait x number of years before running it again. Elite athletes would be exempt from this rule.\n\nThere are so many people who are qualified to run it but never get the chance because there are so many people who apply. \n\nI have zero skin in the game because I will never, ever qualify for Boston.\n\nI live in Chicago. The start/finish line is a couple miles from my apartment. The Chicago marathon happens to be the cheapest easiest race I can possibly run because I don't need to pay for any kind of travel or hotel at all.\n\nThese races were started for the locals in their community to bring money and recognition to the cities. Setting a cap on how often we can run it just hurts the local community that the race is held in as most runners in the world majors are the locals who have guaranteed entry.\n\nAre they really qualified if they don't make the cutoff though? Part of the appeal of Boston is making the cut and earning your place. Anyone who can consistently do that year after year deserves a spot.\n\nI think there sure should be some churn though. I have seen proposals where something like 25% of each age group is reserved for first time qualifiers.\n\nOver 11,000 accepted entries this year are first time runners, per the news release about the cut off. That’s nearly half the qualified field and blows your 25% out of the water.\n\nI'd like to see the data on how far under BQ the typical person runs to get accepted. I have a feeling it's probably pretty close to the standard for most. Reserving 25% for first time qualifiers could potentially limit repeat runners to the aliens that can massively over perform their age standards. Ironically, that could actually exclude more legitimately qualified runners than a simple cutoff.\n\n&gt; Are they really qualified if they don't make the cutoff though?\n\nYes.  If you meet the set standard, then you are a Boston qualifier.  Meeting the cutoff is a different matter and is dependent on the number of entries they receive and the spots they have available.\n\nIt's a bit of a fuzzy area to me. The true standard is the cutoff, it's just been out of whack with the qualifying times for a bit now. Bringing it in line by reducing the BQ times is the correct move and hopefully goes a long ways towards eliminating that disconnect.\n\nMy unpopular opinion is that people should put the effort they put into complaining into training instead and just get faster.\n\nIt’s just performance based math, run faster. I was a terrible runner. Worked my ass off for 3 years and got in. Don’t lower the bar to your ability level. My marathon pace is now over 2 mins faster per mile than my first 10K pace.\n\nYup. In October of 2022 I was a 3:42 marathoner. In the decade since my first marathon, I'd only managed to cut it down 12 minutes from 3:54. \n\n\nIt took a lot of time and hard work, but once I decided to prioritize running and increase my time commitment substantially, I cut that 3:42 to a 2:52. Lowering the bar lowers the achievement.\n\nWhat did you do that helped the most?\n\nMore volume, more emphasis on regular threshold and long interval work instead of lots of steady state miles. The cycle that got me to 2:52 was 70 mpw with a threshold run or long 5k pace intervals every week and periodic MP segments on long runs with fast finishes if the legs felt up to it.\n\nThank you for sharing!\n\nWhat age and what did you do to drop that much in 2 years?\n\nI was 35 at the time. Ramped up mileage to 55 then 70 mpw in consecutive cycles with a much bigger emphasis on regular threshold work and longer intervals. 1k/1200 at 5k pace type stuff.\n\nRight now, I'm working on getting my mileage to 50mpw and doing 1k intervals once a week, and a \"race pace\" tempo run once a week. Do you maintain 70mpw constantly or does it go down between blocks?\n\nIt goes down a bit, but not a ton. I'll drop to 50-55 between unless I'm building up in preparation for a bigger cycle. Then it might be 70 or more, but it's mostly easy stuff with minimal quality sessions.\n\nDid you follow a guide or something like that? I'm at about 50 mpw. I'll use the winter to lose 10 lbs fat and build up more muscles and start those grueling 70mpw sessions next summer. I'd like a bit more guidance than \"2 quality sessions per week\"\n\nI like the structure of Pfitz plans. The 18/70 is brutal, but it'll make you *fast*.\n\nI tried to follow his 18/50 this summer but the brutal heat and work stress made me give up half way through. I do like the weekend long run with a speed component. It's brutal but it does make me feel so good.\n\nThis. Some people simply can’t qualify because of bad genetics but most can, they just don’t realize what effort is truly necessary. I have a friend that has DNF’d the same ultramarathon three times. Each year he says he is going to finish and I just laugh because he has never done the work required to finish that race which he is perfectly capable of doing.\n\nMy pet theory is that 90% of people are capable of a top 10% age/gender group result. It's not genetics holding them back, it's some combination of time, training, and priorities.\n\n\nDownvote away, but that's almost exclusively what it comes down to when people can't get faster. Not enough time to do more miles, too many conflicting priorities, other hobbies, or just an unwillingness to push harder. Very few people are actually bumping up against a physical limit.\n\nI don’t mean this as an insult, but from painfully learned personal experience. Most people don’t understand the level of suffering required to BQ. Most people can’t simply run a lot and get fast enough. The long runs can be fun with friends but the tempo and interval work have to be soul sucking life questioning affairs.\n\nIf you still want to BQ 5 miles into a 7 mile threshold block, you're a tougher person than me. \n\nI agree. I ran my first marathon in 2021 and have cut a half hour off my time since then. If all goes perfectly for my October marathon I might get close to my BQ time, but I expect my first serious attempt at a BQ to be Grandmas next year. I have put a lot of work in over the last three years, and will continue to work hard. Hopefully things will come together and I’ll be able to get into Boston 2026. But if I don’t because of bad weather, injury, or simply because other people were faster then it is what it is. That’s the sport. I’ll keep working until I get it or decide I don’t want to anymore. I want to run Boston knowing I earned my spot or not run it at all.\n\nI absolutely agree.  It should be tough to get in, otherwise the accomplishment doesn't feel like an accomplishment.  I want the best of the best to be there every year and i hope to be part of it someday.\n\nWorst idea ever. Nothing like penalizing the people that put in the work to qualify just because someone else can’t train a bit more. There’s loads of people like me (25+ minute buffer) that don’t even apply. Can’t make it, train more just like the rest of us had to do.\n\nYeah it's been well established for years that it's almost never enough to run the BQ standard and that you need to beat it by a safe margin to actually run the race. I ran a 2:56 in Berlin 2021 (iykyk) and remember being A. pissed off about getting wrecked by the heat and B. resigned to the fact that I was going to have to train for another year or so to meet the cutoff.\n\nI got lucky and they accepted everyone the next two years, but if the day after Berlin, you'd given me the option at the time to run Boston 2022 taking the spot of someone who'd run a better time compared to their particular cutoff, it would've felt like a pity entry, disrespectful even.\n\nIf you're good enough to run the BQ standard, you're good enough to beat the BQ standard by 5 minutes with another year of training.\n\nWhat does elite athletes mean\n\nThose are the people who are invited and paid to run it. Normal people have to apply.\n\nGet faster if you want a spot. Screwing over better runners is dumb\n\nSo would you be in favor of getting rid of gender and age brackets if spots should be solely based on performance? The Boston marathon would then be just a bunch of young men (basically a version of Olympic trials). They don't owe anything to anyone and yes, they can set whatever standard they want but the standard today is certainly not just \"better runners\".\n\nNo\n\nGender and age brackets screw over better runners. \n\nWhy are people acting like Boston is some international marathon championship of only the best runners? There’s already handicaps in place to encourage a diverse set of runners.\n\nWhy are people acting like it’s normal to tell someone they’re too fast for a major marathon?\n\n*Gasps*\n\n*lamentable shrieking &amp; wailing noises*\n\nDoes anyone have a link for the qualifying time per gender/age group?\n\nhttps://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/qualify\n\nCan someone ELI5 what and how this qualification works?\n\nTo qualify to even apply to run the Boston marathon, you have to run faster than the Boston qualifying time for your sex and age group.\n\nThen, once all the applications of qualified racers are in, which might be 30 or 40 thousand applications,  only 24,000 or so can race as there are only so many spots.  They check everyone pace, and there's a cut off time.  If you barely meet your Boston qualifying time by a minute, you might not beat the cutoff.\n\nI.e. your BQ is 3 hours flat.\nYou run a 2:58.   You apply for Boston.\nThis year, after all applications were received, cut off is 6:51.  So you'd have to have run a 2:53:09 to meet the cut off.  Your 2:58 isn't fast enough, you'd not be eligible to race.\n\nOk so now all I gotta do is train to be 1 hour and 37 minutes faster than my current marathon pace 😎\n\nI ran Boston once - I had a 7+ minute differential so I was pretty safe. I'd like to run again but, due to some health-related things, I don't know if I'm physically capable anymore... I intend to find out though.\n\nDamn I was soo close.\n\nRecently a 5:00 across the board reduction (except for the 60 and above age brackets) was applied for the 2026 qualifying times. I assumed that the thought was that this would get potentially rid of the need for a further reduction. Seeing as though 6:51 is obviously greater than 5:00, looks like there will still have to be an additional reduction for the 2026 race, albeit something perhaps less than 2:00.\n\nWell, rats.\n\nDoes anyone have an estimate for downhill course BQers? \n\nI know they get a ton of hate (and no offense, but I personally would never run one), but I sincerely would love to know if it’s known how many are qualifying through those races?\n\nCool.  Looks like I'm never going to Boston."

    "all_comment_text": "(can we make this a pinned post as I'm also looking to drop an ungodly amount of money for cheaper running clothes?)\n\nFor real\n\nI need base layers and wool socks badly\n\nCostco has some great base layer options with their 32 degrees brand. I got a 2 pack of tops and bottoms for $10 each\n\nEvery time I hear about Costco it's some awesome deal, but the closest one is an hour away so I've never been sure that I'd use them enough to get a membership\n\nI bought directly from the 32 degrees website\n\nI bought them on Costco.com and have it shipped to my house (free shipping with membership) $10.99 for 2 black long sleeve base layers\n\nTo be fair, I usually find that costco.com has higher retail prices which conveniently bridge the gap between buying in store vs. online with \"free\" shipping.\n\nSame, I liked the base layer with turtleneck (bought 2). Serves very well during cold weather, might buy a few more.\n\nRei has stuff on sale right now.\n\nYes, I am having a hard time not spending a thousand dollars on REI right now.\n\nSame. REI is like crack for me.\n\nOooh I have about $100 in gift cards. What's to look at? 👀\n\nif you live in a decent sized US city, goodwill will hook you the fuck up\n\nYep.. even a small city has great options!\n\nOr Savers!!!! Savers always has good athletic stuff\n\nSame\n\nI will, as always, be looking to buy multiples of shoes I'm loving in 2024 in preparation for those versions to be ruined in 2025, but ultimately will find the newer version is actually better and never wear the pairs I purchase around Black Friday. \n\nIn short, I'll be wasting some money.\n\nShoe brands love this one simple trick!\n\nI'm still working through my stash of Triumph 19s three years later 😅\n\nI intend to still be working through my stash of Triumph 20’s in three years.\n\nI’m on my last pair of 1080 v12s 🥲\n\nJust bought some 21s yesterday. My current 21s only half way done, but wanted to stock some before they're gone\n\n[deleted]\n\nLmao I do this every year 😂\nI have some brand new Gel Nimbus 24s under my bed if anyone wants them\n\nRIP Saucony Endorphin Speed 2s\n\nAnyone selling motivation-to-run? I have what I need to get back into running, but I always have these darn excuses that pops up.\n\nFor me I try to think of it as “getting to run”, not “having to run”. Idk if that makes sense but there have been times in my life I’ve been injured or for whatever other reason was unable to run, and I remember how miserable those times were, not being able to do it, or to even have the option to decide not to do it. So it’s not always easy but keeping that in mind has helped me stay motivated. \n\nThat, and keeping a race on the calendar that I paid money for and know I have to train for.\n\nThis is the real answer. Love it! Working 12 hours then getting home and going for a 5k isn’t all that exciting. Always reminded from the slight aches that I’m not supposed to be able to run. But I can! Makes me want to do it all the more.\n\nUsually after a mile those pains and aches go away for me. Then I could continue running for 10 more miles and feel good\n\nThe difficult part is to motivate my ass to get out. For that I usually eat a snack (high carb content) so it'll 1) motivate me to burn the calories and 2) get energy for the run\n\nI'm the injured one unable to run and wish I could go back and slap myself on those weeks where I was 100% healthy and hating my runs certain weeks. I wasn't making progress like I thought I would, and I was watching all of the fastest people on Strava day after day and let it get to me, and took weeks off at a time. Then I'd get motivation and push way too far beyond distances I wasnt training for through steep mountains. I think the long downhill runs are the main culprit to  why I'm injured now. My IT Band is flaring something fierce. Now I'm in the gym on the stair stepper, steep incline treadmill, and indoor cycling. It's keeping me sane, but barely.\n\nI'm injured and hating myself for ignoring the injury and trying to run anyways. It was miserable *and* made the recovery worse... And then I did it again...\n\nIt band sucks. That's what started the cycle of injuries I've been dealing with since April. I don't recommend trying to do a half when your IT band starts hurting at 2 miles.....\n\nFinally got the IT band sorted here, but now I have a glute issue on the opposite side, and plantar fasciitis on the side the IT band was on. :(. \n\nI need some motivation to actually do strength training. I hate strength training!\n\nRealising that life isnt about motivation, but discipline will allow you to recognize excuses as such the moment they pop up.\n\nIf you constantly rely on short term motivation, you will constantly fail the moment it runs out.\n\nputting the shoes on and just going outside/to the gym always does the trick for me. and Metallica.\n\nHealth did it for me. Specifically, watching my parents age. My mom is spry for her age, my dad is absolutely not. I take after him physically (sadly), so don't want to end up like that when I'm his age.\n\nRepeat after me - discipline beats motivation.  Forget about whether you're motivated or not and just do it.\n\nThe hardest part of a run are the first 10 steps\n\nThe hardest part of a run is strapping on a sports bra.\n\nOmfg this. 32H here so I wear industrial strength ones that look like they belong in an egineering museum not my closet. Its the WORST.\n\nTaking mine off after my run is even worse when I’m sweaty and tired. Lol I joke that it’s my cool down stretch routine!\n\nJust find great audiobooks to listen to while running. I'm to the point that I get out there just to see what's going to happen next in my book.  I'm currently listening to The Stormlight Archive series again to prep for the next book coming out.  Each book in the series is 50+ hours, so plenty of motivation!\n\nAnd the next one is coming out in two weeks. I'm going to run so much in December so I can listen to it.\n\nI'm still on Oathbringer!  75mi a week isn't cutting it to finish in time.  Luckily I have a 100mi race early December that should help get me through Rhythm of War.\n\nThis is hilarious that you mention that because my fiance keeps trying to get me to listen to it before Stormlight 5 releases but I've been rotating between my Stephen King audiobooks and Pod Save America (I work in politics, I unfortunately cannot NOT pay attention to it). I usually listen in the morning while I do my makeup for work and on my drive to work. But maybe this can be my run listen!! I've already read and re-read Wheel of Time via book &amp; audiobook and those are also 40-50 hours each. Are you listening to the regular audiobooks or his graphic audio versions? We have the graphic audio ones and I've heard a little bit of them and they're fantastic!\n\nListening to them for the first time. The first book got me through the last month of training for my recent race.\n\nI'm a sucker for a story XD I think the story in Zombies, Run! motivated me more than any of the other features. And I always pair it with listening to podcasts that I only listen to when I work out.\n\nWake up and go in the morning.  As the day and its activities overwhelm you there’s always a reason not to run.  If it’s fine before life gets in the way you don’t need to worry about fitting it in.\n\nLOOK OUT! THERE'S A BEAR BEHIND YOU SO YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR RUNNING SHOES ON AND GET AWAY!\n\nSomeone was airlifted to hospital last week from my town after being attacked by a bear near where I run. I am now terrified to go running\n\nI buy lots of running shit (shoes, apparel, etc) feel guilty if I don’t wear them to get my money’s worth. That always seems to motivate me. So go shopping\n\nI am available to run after you with a machete and ski mask anytime after 1730est m-f\n\nTomorrow you're going for a run, one mile! It has to be at least one. Any pace. But ONE mile minimum. I'll be expecting you to come back afterwards and tell us how it went!\n\nI vote for this but the opposite. You are only allowed to run ONE mile. Want more? Tough shit- gonna have to wait til tomorrow… I’m a fan of the “too small to fail” (re)starting program.\n\nWhatever gets you to just get started, you know?\n\nHospital food tastes terrible.\n\nJoin a club!!\n\nStart slow and manageable. If you have trouble breathing or you're gassed when you're starting off, you're going too fast, you will burn out and you'll hate it. Small improvements at a time. Once you start noticing speed and distance improvements, it's a never ending cycle of motivation and more effort. Then it gets fun.\n\nStarted running Halloween last year at 13' 47\"/mi and only 0.5 - 1 mi. Now I'm at 45 miles a week, have done 3 races, a half-marathon coming up next and 20 min 5K PR. Oh and I lost 65 lbs. You can do it!\n\nAbsolutely. The first few month of solid running kinda sucks. It hurts, you don't go very fast, you feel constantly out of breath. Recovery takes too long. Its easy to be demotivated.\n\nBut if you stick with it, I found that after 3 months of solid running everything changed. Not only was I running longer and faster, I recovered sooo much quicker. Being able to hold a steady pace for 10+km is a wonderful joy.\n\nset some easy goals and crush em (motivation to do that not included). make a goal to run half a mile or a mile a day like 3/4 days a week, i dunno how fast you are but chances are thats less than 20 minutes of your day! doesnt need to be a sprint, just an easy jog, which will progressively get easier. eventually itll be easy enough you wont even think to dread it\n\nI always just tell myself all I have to do when I get outside is walk and I can come back whenever I want. I always run lol\n\nEach day that passes is once less day you can run. When you're 70, 80, will you still be able to run? Be mobile?\n\nCan't buy motivation, but you can buy some awesome new shoes that give you a reason to want to go out and run. Even better if you tell your partner that you will run everyday if you get these new shoes, and get them to buy them for you. This will get them to pester you endlessly to ensure you go for a run.\n\nI try not to think too much. Thinking “should I? Shouldn’t I? But if I do … but if I don’t …”\n\nNike was onto it. Just Do It.\n\nI always feel better after it, or feel better that I did it.\n\nI don't worry about \"motivation\", I just think about the positives and ignore the negatives. \n\n&gt; e.g. I don't have to \"run/get sweaty\"'; I get to try my new shoes out and Listen to new music on my phone/music player.\n\nI also go my own pace, sometimes I can run an entire 5k without stopping, and sometimes it's mostly walking. I don't think about that when I get ready to run, I think about the fun of being a little better then last time.\n\nI have “turning 50” and “trying to prevent / delay what’s happening to my parents who didn’t exercise seriously” for sale.  Tree fiddy.\n\nSteal something at a shop\n\nI’ve got some free samples fatty\n\nGarmin has amazing deals on watches right now!!\n\npicked up the garmin 265 finally. such a good deal at the moment\n\nHad mine for about a year. It's a beaut\n\n$349? Or better elsewhere?\n\n349, stacked with Amex Amazon credit for a few more dollars off\n\nI’m not seeing the Amex offer in my list. Is it platinum card offer only? Or is it somewhere else\n\nSuch an amazing watch, love mine so much. The amoled makes it worth it alone. Went from 245 to 265 in mid April.\n\nJust picked up the garmin 255\n\nwhere and for how much?\n\nhttps://a.co/d/3ePpuY8\n\nAlready used a pre-Black Friday discount on Asos to get a pair of Adios SL 2 for under 100 bucks.\n\nWhat’s the code\n\nIt was KICKR25 for the shoes, I think. But not sure if it's available in all countries and they actually seem to change codes every day in their \"Black Friday warm-up\". Today it shows me 25% for body and face products. \n\nAsos website usually tells you big on top when they have a discount for any campaign.\n\nThey are 78€ without a code at the moment\n\ni bought it too, only like £60 or so. Regretting now that I only bought 1 pair\n\nI got the same deal, crazy good price.\n\nREI - Janji shorts (and lots of other stuff!)\n\nGoBros  - Darn tough socks 25% off\n\n  \nEdit: REI has more than just Janji shorts. I just like those shorts.\n\nLast year REI had a bunch of clearance Janji AFO middle shorts for like $15 a pair (normally $64).  I've been watching for months this year and nothing.  Great shorts, so I'll keep watching.\n\nBought 3 pairs of shoes with BF sales!\n\n- Altra Torin 7\n- Altra Escalante 3\n- Altra Escalante 4\n\nCan you tell me where, please? Thank you.\n\nAll on Amazon! Out of them, Altra’s site, and Running Warehouse (AU), Amazon had the best sales\n\nI'm looking for a deal on a 4 or 8L hydration pack that can fit both soft bottles and bladder. Ideally the Salomon Active Skin 8 or equivalent.  REI has the 20% coupon right now, but that pack doesn't qualify.\n\nJust FYI, the Adv Skin 12 is marginally more in weight, but can hold much more! I highly recommend that one too if there happens to be a deal.\n\nWhen backcountry runs sales for xx% off full price items, Salomon hydration vests are included! They’re running 20% off one full price item at the moment so I’d try them\n\nI did a 50km with a 5L pack and struggled to fit everything and I packed light (small gloves, gels, my glasses). For casual runs where you want to bring some water a 5L pack is great but if you plan on doing any longer distances, and especially if you will be storing a light jacket/windbreaker, you will be better off with a 12L\n\nUltraspire Bronco is on sale for $65.  I grabbed one and I'm liking it so far.  Only downside is that it doesn't come with bottles and doesn't fit Salomon size soft flasks which I had a ton of.  Super breathable pack though and pretty neat in that you can actually access the back compartment without taking the thing off.\n\nFeetures has 20% off site wide and 25% bundles according to their landing page (at least in the USA. Not sure if that’s world wide)\n\nShoe's. God please give me a deal on the speed 3's or 4's in size 11.5. I'll buy like 4-5 pairs.\n\nEvery time there’s a Saucony sale, I buy Endorphin speeds in bulk.  Last time i bought 5 at once and they’ve basically lasted me all year (I’m on my last pair now)\n\nI love these shoes! How long do you find these last? I just hit 100 miles on them and use them once a week or once every other week (rotating them out with my Saucony endorphin pro). Still feels like there’s a good amount of bounce. Deciding between those two shoes for my marathon in a couple weeks. 😁\n\nThey’re my daily trainer, I find they usually last me between 500-550 miles.\n\nI know REI is having a sale right now. Tons of stuff on sale and 20% off of all full price items; they do have the speed 4's in stock. You could get 20% off of them there. Not a huge discount, but a discount none the less. \n\nPro tip: you can use their promo code each time you check out, so if you want 3 pairs, make 3 separate purchases and get 20% off each time (free shipping, so you aren't paying for additional shipping each time either).\n\nFind a deal?\n\nJanji, Smartwool, and REI all have great deals on gear/clothing right now.\n\nUse the code CHEER at Saucony for 25% off.\n\nMy local massage place is doing a gift card deal - awesome gift for you or a loved one for race recovery!\n\nKeep tabs on Instagram/your email for any Black Friday race registration specials!\n\nThere is a pinned thread for Black Friday deals on r/runningfashion. I can’t crosspost  it here.\n\nOh god this thread is exactly what my wallet doesn’t need. 😅. Though I’ve already accepted I’m bout to grab afew pairs of shoes to go with the 30 I already have 😅\n\nI legit needed new trail shoes. And Adidas had the Soulstride Ultra on sale yesterday, marked down from $180 to $54. \n\nI didn’t need THAT trail shoe, but for $54, happy birthday to me. (I also got the Agravic 3 which is probably more in line with what I need.)\n\nIf anyone comes upon the Endorphin Speed or Pro 3 on sale, please holler.\n\nwow great find on those cheap Soulstrides; they're all out now\n\nBc looking the part IS the battle.\n\nOakley 30% off sunglasses and 50% clothes, accessories, shoes etc. starts 11/21 and goes through BF\n\nIs the 30% site-wide and different to the current promo?\n\nCan see they have an 'early black friday' sales on now which is a bit meh\n\nI got very lucky today and bought the last pair of Black and white Saucony Endorphin pro 2 size 13 for $61 on Walmart's website. I couldn't believe my eyes😆 !so just keep looking around, and you will find something.\n\nLiquid IV has 30% off site wide with code BF2024\n\nHyperice has a sale on Normatec boots, Hypervolt percussion therapy, etc. with code “BLACKFRIDAY”.\n\nStryd has a Black Friday deal of 15% off their NextGen pod. It only seems to apply to the single pod though. Not to Duo nor to the membership.\n\nBought my first stryd pod today!\n\nI’m buying the Apple Watch 10, Nike Pegasus plus, a hydration vest, and some socks\n\nCoros pace 3 and mizuno neo vista\n\n£99 if in UK on neo vista - https://shop.profeet.co.uk/products/mizuno-neo-vista-mens-road-running-shoes\n\nNo size 10 for me :( had to settle on £135 for a pair\n\nNoxgear is having a sale, and if you subscribe to their email you get extra discounts.  I'm thinking of getting a new Tracer and maybe the speaker.\n\nI received the speaker for Christmas last year.  I love it! Very lightweight.\n\nDo you have any additional promo code? I subscribed but didn’t get any\n\nMarino wool running shirts! So much nicer than tech shirts.\n\nYes!!! I am creeping tracksmith for sales on their wool leggings\n\nRight! Seems they’re out of my size whenever a discount is offered.\n\nNew running headlamp since mine is 18 years old. \n\nMay try a pair of running socks but I admit I think  they’re mostly bogus and my mostly cotton socks have been working fine all these years, but my wife needs gift ideas. \n\nMay pick up a comfy cushion shoe to wear around town after long run days. Something like Ghost Max 1 or an older Nimbus model or something similar.\n\nFeetures has 25% off most of the socks. They’re great. Highly recommend\n\nIf you like cotton socks I suggest Thorlos. My favorite running sock. I don’t like the tech fabric ones.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI cannot recommend the Nitecore brand headlamps enough. Rechargeable w/usb-c and they last forever. \n\nI run with the Nightcore NU20 classic and it weighs almost nothing. They're also extremely affordable. I think I paid $22 a little over 5 years ago... \n\nhttps://nitecorestore.com/collections/trail-running-headlamps\n\nFor headlamps make sure to consult with r/flashlight. It’s a great community of true experts\n\nTrying to decide between Apple Watch Ultra or a Garmin. Waiting for a good deal to pop up\n\nGarmin 965\n\nOnly $500 on Amazon right now\n\nTheu'll come down ... patience\n\nSame here. And then if Garmin, which model…\n\nThere are so many to choose from. It’s overwhelming lol\n\nUnless you need to see streets on a map, Garmin 255 has everything you need. It does have navigation, it's just showing you a line you need to follow, doesn't show the streets, which is fine in 90% of cases. The alternative is the 955, which is like $200 extra.\n\nThe only reason I would advise against the Apple Watch Ultra in 2024 is because they released the ultra 2 in 2023 and for 2024 just added a new color. The internals are the same and the series 10 has a better processor which a similar sized screen. If you don’t need the action button (lap button) then I would get the series 10. I still love my series 7\n\nI have the Garmin 165 and its awesome. Does everything I need it to do and no more.\n\ngarmin every time\n\nI just bought a pair of Brooks adrenaline 23’s for myself fiancée and myself. They were $100 each, down from 140. I had just purchased the 24’s and liked them so I figured get on this deal.\n\nWhere did you get them?\n\nI’d love a new pair of running shorts. My RonHill pair has done the job well, but there’s only so much friction that cloth can withstand.\n\nBecause im just a sucker for a deal, I picked up the under armour velocity elite 2 for $113 USD. Never ran in an under armour shoe, let's see how she rides\n\n[deleted]\n\nUnder armour site\n\nif anyone knows good sales of Asics nova blast pls let me know!!!\n\nREI has Novablast 4 and 4 TR on sale, plus an additional 20% off if you are a member.\n\nI just checked and these are on sale but not eligible for the additional 20:(\n\nCiele hats.  They’re def the best but wayyyyy to pricey\n\nPeloton Apparel is 40% off everything.\n\nGot some novablast 4 for a $100\n\nSpoke to **Soar Running**'s customer support team and they've confirmed that there will be no Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions. That sucks!\n\nX-posting as a comment here, here’s an aggregate of the premium stuff with sales \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningfashion/s/146pCTVDpD\n\nGood treadmill for a beginner runner who runs maybe 10-15 miles a week.\n\nCheckout your local Craiglist or Facebook marketplace - your should be able to find something under $100. People keep getting them and dumping because treadmills take a ton of space and get very little of use.\n\ndoes anyone know leggings that are wind proof that does not expensive\n\nYou can use code: 20UTO2024 discount code for any Garmin products on utoverland.com/product-category/running/. Most backordered items ship within a week. Fenix 8 a little longer depending on model with some fenix 8s being into December / January.\n\nNike currently have their 25% off full price items with code SCORE24\n\nand 12% back on rakuten today\n\nI got the 10% sign up booster, total of 22% back on Nike\n\nGuess this won't work on Alpha flys??\n\nI’ve read it does not but it worked on vapourflys (did not buy just tested)\n\nNo for the Alphas, yes for some Vaporflys\n\nCan someone find a giant stash of Nike Lunarglides and put them on a deep sale? Thank you.\n\n[deleted]\n\nwhere is the superblast on sale?\n\nLooking for some men's winter tights for running in actual cold weather (-15C and below).\n\nHave you looked at Craft tights? They’re designed for Scandinavia winters, super warm.\n\nInterested in this as well\n\nDo you prefer tights? In usually wear a base layer from Costco (32 degrees brand) and then joggers over top. Maybe tech pants if it’s windier. I find my legs usually get cold from the wind in the winter and not necessarily just the temperature. \n\nJust asking as I’ve never run in dedicated tights myself\n\nI like tights, but I also have ran in that exact same base layer and shorts. My legs don't really get that cold, but the tights do a better job of keeping my legs warm when damp. I don't like wearing loose pants or joggers when I run. They annoy me. For what it's worth, I live in Western Oregon where we don't get that cold, but it aggressively mists without stopping from October to May.\n\nGore thermal tights have a 33% discount on the German Amazon: https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Gore-Wear-Thermal-Trousers-black/dp/B000PIX6F8\n\n\nThese are good for -15C weather. I'm not sure how much the import duty would be, but currently it costs more than double on the US Amazon.\n\nAustralia sales:\n\nSaw some Boa 1-inch men's split shorts on sale, any reviews on them? (galaxy print and chilli print)\n\nAlso saw the garmin  forerunner 255 music &amp; forerunner 955 on sale ($399 and $499 respectively), so might be time to upgrade from an apple watch. any thoughts on either?\n\nI have the 255 and I’m very happy with it!\n\nPlease Lord let there be shorts discounted\n\nLskd! 😁\n\nI should add, its tonight, 6 or 7pm im not really sure\n\nAmazon usually runs brooks shoes. I usually grab a few pairs for the upcoming year\n\nEdit: Lululemon sometimes runs flash sales on run shorts. Bought 2 for 1 a few years ago around the holiday season\n\nAdrenaline 23 are $100 on Amazon right now\n\nAdidas has some awesome deals on shoes and clothes. Got myself a pair of Adizero Adios 8's for a steal.\n\nI bought Nimbus 26 earlier in the year, I feel like i wanted to buy a new pair because they’re so good and they’re discounted now\n\nFor the few Polar fans out there, the Grit X2 Pro is marked down to a slightly less absurd $600 from $750 on Amazon.\n\nI'm looking at a garmin 255 for 212€, still not pulled the plug as I'm trying to find if I should go for the coros pace 3 for 250€ (released only last year and software wise seems more promising, maybe not hardware)\n\nDoes anyone know of a cheap watch that can be used just for timing runs/workouts? I don't need my watch to have GPS or bluetooth or anything fancy so I don't want to have to pay for all those features. I just want to be able to time my runs and hit \"lap\" during workouts so I can see how long each of my repeats took.\n\nShopping for running earphones. Anyone want to recommend a good one?\n\nI really like my Anker Soundcore x20s.\n\nI been a earbud guy but recently bought some shokz. It’s not bad but it’s going to take some getting used too. Some Black Friday deals on Amazon and at Best Buy. I would go to Best Buy to try them on first before buying it\n\nMy wife swears by her Shokz OpenRuns and pretty much wears them all day. I run with Jabra Elite 4 Active buds. It depends on what sort of features you're looking for! The Jabra buds can do ANC, they have a hear-through mode, and the microphones are really good if you use them for phone calls and stuff. I can take calls for work while I'm out running.\n\nAnother day of me waiting for Nike to release the Zoom Fly 6 mens in purple....\n\nGoogle is selling the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 for $150, includes NRC compatibility and can download music.\n\nUnder Armour usually has good deals.\n\nJust wanted to let you guys know that by double stacking discounts on Nike you can get their aeroswift dri-fit 1/2 tights (their best racing tights) for £44 (full price is £75) you can also get the takumi Sen 10s in the best colour way on adidas’s website for £119"

    "title": "Never thought cooler temps would get here, but time for the Annual cold / cool / winter weather running and gear thread",
    "body": "Now that Winter is quickly approaching (in the Northern Hemisphere, at least), it seems we are are getting more winter/cold weather posts which means it is time for the annual Winter Megathread.\n\n[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather#wiki_winter.2Fcold) the link for the cold weather info in our wiki.  I will add this post to that at a later date.  If you happen to be in the Southern Hemisphere and entering the season of the big fiery death ball in the sky, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather/) the link to the \"Running in the Heat\" section of the wiki .\n\n**Why should I run in the winter?**\n\n* Winter running makes you strong!\n\n* That person you really want to beat next year is out there training right now\n\n* Spring weather feels so much better when you’ve been training through the winter\n\n\n**Clothing**\n\nYou’re going to want materials that will keep you warm even when damp or wet. Think wool, fleece, and wicking synthetics. You’ll also want things to be breathable so you don’t get super sweaty (and even colder).  Layer up so you can adjust during your run.\n\nTrapped air is what keeps you warm and cozy in the winter. If your shoes are really tight with a couple pairs of socks on, or your gloves/mittens are too tight, you may have less trapped air and impair circulation, which will make you cold.\n\nHere’s an example of what works well for some in calm, dry conditions. Keep in mind wind or precipitation will make things colder, and that it’s always better to have an extra layer than to make do without.  This can also vary widely between people and how comfortable you want to be.  Use the table as a guide to layering suggestions factoring in how fast/slow you are running (for generating body heat) as well as how hot/cool natured you normally are.\n\n**Temp Range**|**Upper**|**Lower**|**Socks**|**Hands**|**Head**\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\n30 to 40F (-1 to 5C)|Long-sleeve (LS) shirt|Shorts or light pants|regular socks|Light gloves|headband\n20 to 30F (-6 to -1C)|LS shirt + baselayer|Regular tights|1x midweight wool|Light gloves|headband\n10 to 20F (-12 to -6C)|LS Baselayer + wind vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs|2x midweight wool|Mittens|Hat + light gator\n0 to 10F (-18 to -12C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket or vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens|heavy hat, fleece balaclava, eye protection\n&lt;0 F (&lt;-18 C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens w/ gloves underneath|heavy hat x2, fleece balaclava, eye protection (glasses or goggles, if windy)\n\nHere are some useful links to some guides that can help you choose appropriate amount of clothing:\n\n[Fahrenheit Pictorial Guide](https://i.imgur.com/GKwoDUQ.jpg)\n\n[Celsius Pictorial Guide](https://i.imgur.com/KKbJgwl.jpg)\n\n[Dress My Run Website - Quick tool to show what to wear based on where you live and weather](http://dressmyrun.com/)\n\n* Click on \"Settings\" in the bottom right hand corner to adjust your personal temperature preference (warmer or cooler)\n\n**Footwear**\n\nRoad shoes are fine most of the time, unless you're running somewhere that consistently has snow or ice-covered sidewalks. If you have good socks, your feet should stay warm even if damp from melting snow. Think more carefully about your footwear if there’s snow or ice on the ground.\nOn fresh snow or packed, but still soft snow, trail shoes (something with a low to moderate lug) work very well.  [Turning an old pair of road shoes into Screw Shoes](https://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/running-shoe-screws) is an excellent idea for ice, thawed and refrozen snow, and heavily packed snow conditions – the screws do a great job providing a bit of extra traction.\n\nYou can also look into traction devices (like Yaktrax) when icy.\n\nWhen running, direction changes and stopping are the most likely times to slip and fall on snow or ice. Slow down and be cautious around corners and street crossings. As you run, make sure you’re landing with your feet underneath your center of mass – even if you do have a slippery step, keep your feet moving, and you can usually recover and avoid a fall.\n\n**Safety**\n\nIf you work during the day, chances are your morning or evening run will be dark. Get yourself a good headlamp (to see and be seen), and wear a reflective vest over your other clothing. Know that motorists may be less likely to expect you to be out running when it’s 15 degrees and snowing.\n\nIf it's really cold, make adjustments or plans to ensure you can stay safe during your run even if you turn an ankle or something else happens where you can't keep running to stay warm. Plan your route along safe warm zones (friend's house, grocery stores, etc.), and/or carry your cell phone (close to your body, so your battery doesn't die). If you for some reason can't run, you will quickly get very chilled.  [Here's](https://www.weather.gov/bou/windchill) a Windchill Safety chart from the National Weather Service to help determine when things might be too dangerous to run or if you do, to take extra safety precautions.\n\nStart your runs into the wind - this will be the coldest part - so that your finish your runs with a warmer tailwind. This can make a big difference - if you get sweaty during your run, and turn into a stiff breeze to finish, you're likely to get chilled as you're heading home.\n\nHere's a good post on [Running in snow tips..?](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/zj8zhw/running_in_snow_tips/)\n\n\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nEven when it’s cold out, you’ll want to be sure you’re hydrated before and during long runs. You’re probably sweating more than you might think, it will evaporate quickly in cold dry air. Have a method to keep fluids from freezing when it’s cold out, either by keeping fluids under a layer of clothing (vest or hydration pack), planning a route around accessible water, or figuring out a way to keep your handheld from freezing up.\n\nGels and other foods can freeze too – tuck these items into a glove or mitten a few minutes before you want to eat, to thaw them out and warm them up.\n\n###**The comments below will be divided into some broad categories to try and keep things organized.

    "all_comment_text": "**TIPS AND TRICKS**\n\nIf your butt is still cold in your tights/leggings, wear a pair of shorts over top. Saves you having to buy a whole new pair of leggings, and it's more comfortable than wearing two pairs.\n\nAs a man with man parts who always wears shorts over tights...this should be required anyway.\n\nStrong disagree. I'm in the \"runners have neither modesty or common sense\" camp\n\nAs a bicyclist that also runs, \"What's this 'modesty' thing?\"\n\nmodesty just means making sure your shorts/bibs aren't see through in the sun. As a courtesy to the person in your draft.\n\nwear darker tights if you're worried about that\n\nOr a skirt, if you're of the skirt-wearing persuasion. I have a fleece-lined running skirt that makes a great extra layer. The only down side is that it gradually rotates unless I pin it to my leggings.\n\nThere are some brands now that make long sleeves that have openings for your GPS watch to poke through. Nike is one of them.\n\nI just embraced vibes based running all winter \n\nOr just wear your watch over your sleeves. Use a separate chest strap/arm band for heart rate.\n\nIf you live in a cold and rainy area - I find a merino wool long sleeve shirts work great when running in the cold rain, with or without a rain jacket (depending on how badly it’s chucking). Even if you’re soaked, you’ll still be warm while running. Same with merino wool running socks.\n\ntracksmith harrier long sleeve Shirt is the bees knees\n\nI’ve been using icebreaker but I’ll check them out - looks like there are a few places in Canada that have track smith\n\nBE VISIBLE! stay safe!\n\nSocks on hands club - never go back\n\n  \nEasy to hold your phone in the sock too\n\nHeck yeah! Except I wear toe socks and wear my pair of socks with extra long toe sleeves also known as gloves for my hands!\n\nI'm probably dumb and missing the point, but how is this better than gloves/mittens? seems inconvenient lol\n\nI find it more convenient to easily pull socks on and off hands than gloves but they certainly lack the convenience of using your fingers if that's something you need to do while you run. \n\nI guess a sock is basically a mitten without a thumb spot lol\n\nWait this actually blows my mind, I'll report back once we're below freezing on how it goes!\n\nI just found these which work pretty good with with some wool (touchscreen) liners: \n\nhttps://a.co/d/2sCIW3r\n\nI think they’re over priced, but one could pretty easily duplicate them with the most basic of sewing skills.\n\nI run through the winter in Michigan. \n\n* wool. I have a 210gm pullover. On days at the freezing mark I’ll wear a wool t-shirt under. I also have leggings and I’m fine (hat and gloves obviously, both wind resistant polartec). \n\n* on days below freezing I’ll swap the t-shirt for an additional 210gm long sleeve and my insulated leggings. \n\n* on “those days” I’ll have a polyester under armor type t-shirt, the 210 long sleeve and the 210gm pullover. \n\n* find some waterproof running shoes. I use Hoka Clifton GTXs for days I know I’m going to be hitting puddles. Nothing ruins a run faster than cold wet feet. \n\nAnyways stay warm, dry and safe out there!\n\nIf you’re a slow warmer-upper or you have a little soft tissue niggle that doesn’t like the cold, stick a thermacare adhesive hot pack on it. They’ll stay on for about the first mile. Do not put this directly on your skin.\n\n**HOW COLD IS TOO COLD**\n\nFor most people, you can run around 0F or lower if layered properly. Its the wind chill that will determine whether or not psychologically you want to run. 10F with no wind is amazing, 30F with 20mph winds is brutal. \n\nBiggest factor is if you're still super cold after 2-3 miles when your body should be in theory heated up to running temperature, you should return home and get more layers. If you are remotely thinking about a hat or gloves, then its a \"I am definitely taking my hat and gloves\"\n\nSometimes I think there's something wrong with me, it seems like the worse the weather is, the more I want to get my run in. I will put on ski goggles and a balaclava to deal with the wind if it's warranted. But the wind is definitely the major obstacle, I definitely agree that if it's 10F with no wind, its wonderful.\n\nAs an asthmatic runner anything under 15-10F is too cold for me and becomes a treadmill run\n\nthe cold is brutal with asthma. as a new runner this is my first winter and I'm dreading potentially being stuck on a treadmill, because doing so genuinely feels like torture to me. \n\non my bike I've had luck wearing a buff over my face, it's gross but my breath makes it wet and adds moisture back to my breath which helps a lot. might try with running too.\n\nMy benchmark is when my hat is wet from sweat and starts freezing. Then it is too cold to run. It happens around -8/-10C. Although winter is looooong where I live, it is usually just a few days a year below -10\n\nare there like armbands like Allen Iverson wears but are strictly used as a warming layer? Any suggestions? I swear I can run completely shirtless in 30F if not for my arms and hands. My body is able warm up by it's my arms that are cold.\n\nYup. Cycling arm warmers. I have several more expensive brands and prefer my pair from Pearl Izumi because they are thicker: they're warmer and stay up more easily.\n\nI've swapped out the normal sticked  **New to running? Or the sub? post** for this one so link is [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1fcsdwl/new_to_running_or_the_sub_click_here_first/) for anyone needing that post.\n\n**QUESTIONS**\n\nIs there anyone else who has Raynaud’s and runs in the winter? Would those self heated gloves be best for someone like me or just interested in others experiences winter running\n\nI have Reynaud’s. I don’t have any luck with heated gloves. I have found that doubling up with gloves over gloves or mittens over gloves is the most helpful.\n\nThis. My wife got me merino wool glove liners that go under my regular gloves and they help a ton. I also have hand warmers for after the run. I have Arc'teryx gloves that are probably my best for cold weather, and Janji Vortex gloves with wind mitten overs that do well too.\n\nAgree! I had Raynaud's a few winters ago (a post-viral syndrome that eventually went away) and I wore a pair of thin sweat-wicking gloves under a pair of snow mittens. I recommend a double layer of merino socks, too-- may need to size up your running shoes to fit.\n\nI don't have Raynaud's to be offer specific help, but I have had better luck with mittens when it's been super cold.  I have seen other Raynaud's sufferers also mention mittens  helping.  The plus side is that it is easier to put a hot pack in there to keep your fingers warm.\n\nAs a raynauds sufferer already having problems at 12 degrees, thank you for this!\n\nI use mittens. Or Oiselle has a pair of gloves that convert to mittens. I also find if my core is better insulated, my hands stay warmer. \n\nI have a pair of smartwool gloves that have a wind mitten pullover barrier. I also carry those little chemical pocket heaters. For days with negative wind chill, I use my ski mittens with cinch strings to attach them to my wrist. That way I can take them off when needed and not worry about dropping them.\n\nWhen it hits like 40f I wear heated gloves, gloves, and mittens layered over each other and that keeps me pretty good until like 15f or so then kt gets tough  again.\n\nWear mittens and put hand warmers inside and hold them 🙂 That’s what I do on the coldest runs.\n\nI also do have Raynaud's and best thing is to use wool/alpaca and other similar materials in mittens. Gloves are not enough for me Sometimes I through in a heathpack into my mittens when it's really bad.\n\n\nBut nothing helped my Raynaud's as good as running.\n\nI have mittens with merino wool liners and the mittens have pockets for hand warmers. I've only used them for skiing and snowboarding (because it does not get very cold in the country I run in) and my hands stayed warm for up to 2-3 hours, until the hand warmers turn off. They were a lot cheaper than self warming gloves. You can also just put a hand warmer inside the mittens I you wear liners as well.\n\nAnyone else struggle with ears super sensitive to cold? I need to wear an ear warmer in basically anything sub 60, because the inside of my ears get so inflamed from the cold wind whipping past that it’s very painful. This is tolerable but super frustrating and not sure if there’s anything that can help\n\nYes me too! I have ear warmers (like a head band) specifically made for running but they do not provide much heat. I sometimes go running with a wool hat but have to take it off like every 5 min, because it's too hot to wear during my complete runs. But very nice to have a wool hat with me if I enter an area with a lot of wind.\n\nBuff\n\nI love my wool buff. But, it's super annoying on the very cold days. My breath freezes it. How do you handle a frozen buff on a long run?\n\nThis happens to me and I don’t know how to solve it. Friends suggested bone conduction headphones that seem to help a little bit but looking for other tips as well.\n\nI have this very badly. I run with my headphones which are those big sennheiser over ear cans and they do a great job of protecting my ears while also letting me “read” my audiobooks.\n\nTry a combination of in-ear earbuds with the ear warmers. Mine are the type that give a good seal and can completely block out external noise, maybe that helps. I also used to get inflamed ears running in 35F but simply wearing earbuds to listen to music fixed the issue completely.\n\nOh my gosh, I thought I was the only one!\n\nHow do yall handle the cold air? I feel like I can't catch my breath at all :[\n\nA buff or balaclava over your face/mouth can help.  It will trap some warm air at your face.\n\nHow does one use bone conduction headphones like Shokz while also trying to wear headbands/hats? Do they get in the way?\n\nTilt the back band of the Shokz down so that it’s underneath the edge of your hat, and put the hat on over your ears. \n\nPut the headband around your neck first, then your Shokz. Then pull the headband up over your ears. Back band of the Shokz in the normal position. It will squish the back of your headband down a little on your neck.\n\nDoesn't directly answer your question, but last year I found a cheap beenie on amazon for about $20-30 that had bluetooth earbuds in them. It was warm and did the trick. Audio quality wasn't as good, but it worked if you don't find a better solution!\n\nI have a pair of these that I sleep in ... but don't they get disgusting and gross when you sweat all over them? And obvs, you can't wash them because they're full of wires and batteries and whatever.\n\nI hand wash mine and let it air dry, does the trick without damaging the electronics\n\nI wear a looser beanie and the shokz kind of sit underneath it. Never been a problem but it can feel odd for the first minute\n\nIs there any lighting system that doesn’t make one motion sick?\n\nI’ve tried headlamps and a light that goes across my chest, but the bouncing back and forth of the light always makes me dizzy and I start to feel sick. 🤢\n\nHave you tried the noxgear 2 light up vest? It has a light that attaches to the belt buckle sold separately. It works great.\n\nI’ll have to give it a go! Thanks for the suggestion! 🙂\n\nWhen the weather gets cold, my lungs start to hate me a little more (asthma). Any recommendations to keep running during my first winter?\n\nIs Buff or Smartwool merino neckwear (and any clothes) truly better than others? I live in Eastern Europe and they are a little pricey for me, any other alternative?\nI saw in Decathlon some merino stuff but they seem sooo thin. To be fair I get very hot after a while so maybe I don't need thicker material?\n\nI have both regular Buff and wool Buff, and I also have Icebreaker (like Smartwool) merino neck thing. \n\nRegular Buff: Amazing for 99% of uses\nWool Buff: feel luxe but it holds moisture really badly and starts feeling cold &amp; wet when you sweat.  Also, not machine laundry-proof and will get little holes after regular wear.\n\nSmartwool/Icebreaker: at least twice, if not three times, thicker than the merino Buff.  It's way too hot for running -- you *will* sweat -- but it's really awesome for lower intensity stuff (like downhill skiing, general outdoors stuff in winter, watching winter sports events, etc).\n\nI have a Buff one and it’s super thin too. I’ve worn it to about -30C and it was plenty warm. They’re really long so there ends up being a lot of fabric bunched up and it would probably be uncomfortable if it was much thicker\n\nI have a Buff and similar products from Eddie Bauer and Amazon. The Buff is the best quality, IMO. The others have pilled pretty quickly, and one of them isn't stretchy enough to be comfortable. I like the flexibility of being able to wear it differently depending on what I need. I wear it over my face when cold air irritates my lungs, and over my ears when they're cold. When I warm up, I move it to my wrist or just stuff it in a pocket. I can double or triple it up for more insulation. \n\n\nI have a somewhat similar item made of polar fleece, but it gets really warm, really quickly, even on incredibly cold days. \n\nThanks for the input! I will sleep on it but now I'm leaning towards buying a Buff, just have to math my way through my budget. Good to know about the polar one as well, thanks.\n\nWhen I was in Alaska, I used an older Smartwool facemask that I love. Buff was too thin with the wind which was usually 10mph. \n\nWhat is \"gator\" in \"Hat + light gator\"?\n\nI guess, it's for the neck (google \"neck gator\", \"neck ga**i**t**e**r\").\n\nHow do yall get yourself used to getting sweaty in cold weather gear again? It kills me every time D:\n\nWomen with short (non-ponytail-able) hair, is it possible to wear an earwarmer headband without looking ridiculous? Do I have to sweat it out in a beanie?\n\nWhat is an LS shirt? Sorry I just started running.\n\nLong sleeve\n\nHow do you warm up after a cold weather run? My body doesn't warm up well after the shower. I do sweat on runs, I wonder if my body stays in \"cool down mode\" for a while. It is like my body says \"hot shower? more cool down needed!\"  (but I am not doing amazing feats of exercise)\n\nWhat youth sized running pants or tights would you all recommend for a preteen boy? He grows quickly so I’m looking for something relatively inexpensive for the season. Should I be looking for leggings to wear under shorts?\n\nI've had good luck at Old Navy for myself and my tween/teen athletes. \n\nI struggle on long runs when clothing gets sweaty and then makes the wind feel even worse - I end up feeling very chilled despite the exertion. What kind of base layer material do I need to be wearing to cope with this?\n\nWool!\n\nDo Canadians have a different temperature feeling? I would dress about two categories warmer or absolutely freeze.\n\nYeah this chart is not for people who run cold, lol\n\nI live in the very cold Canada where -40 isn’t uncommon and -20 - -30 is the common mid winter temp.  I’m running in shorts and a t-shirt at 0c at -10 I got a long sleeve and tights.  As it gets colder I’ll throw on a sweater and that’s about it, I will rarely wear a jacket to run.\n\nDoes anyone have advice for continuing to train with just a treadmill? Where I live outdoor running isn’t possible for 3-4 months and I dont have access to an indoor track.\n\nShould I just try to stick with endurance/aerobic runs on the treadmill or is there a way to do VO2 max and LT workouts too?\n\nThe only reason you couldn't do VO2 max or LT workouts is if your treadmill doesn't go fast enough.  I regularly do them on the treadmill.  The only thing that is a pain are strides because the times are very short so switching speeds quickly is not easy.\n\nSo I’m looking to get back into running, I used to run XC so I’m trying to get back to that kind of regimen. I’m not too worried about price I just want to get the best fit for me. Looking at decent mix of road running some dirt/gravel/fire trails and occasional mountain running. Looking to run 3-10 miles whenever I do run. I don’t know if this is important but I do see some people talk about snow running but I am in SoCal. Would prefer Nike recommendations though since I have a gift card for there but if there’s a clearly better shoe from another brand I’m open to those as well.\n\nany good tips and tricks for someone who has had a previous knee (or similar) surgery and is affected by the cold weather? it’s been over 6 years since my ACL reconstruction and even longer since i last was doing any regular running and training, aka i have limited experience exercising in the cold with my repaired ACL, but i was already starting to feel stiffness and ever so slight pain in my knee while running in ~40°F weather this morning. i’ve only been running again since the end of september, so i’m def in the beginner stages and possibly my knee just isn’t used to this, but i’d gladly take any advice anyone has!\n\nHey congratulations on getting back into the mix! I haven't had the same injury journey that you've had with your knee, but my knee used to swell during long and speed runs. I found kneesovertoesguy on youtube and enrolled in his workout program because his focus is strengthening the ligaments around your knees, ankles, legs, etc. and within a month I didn't have pain or swelling in my knee.  \n\nHis story is impressive and may resonate with you. I believe he had to surgical fix his ankle and knee (opposite legs) and was told that he wouldn't be able to do any running or jumping movements again. Through his own studies and practice, he can no dunk a basketball off one leg, and the surprising part is he couldn't do that when he was a college athlete.\n\nBest of luck to you man!\n\nNew to running. What type of split is good and something I can do after classes? I have classes 7 days a week and want to train by running like 2-3 times a week\n\nWhat's the best way to handle warming layers as my body temperature rises on longer runs? I'm worried about starting off too cold, but also worried about overheating down the road. I've considered looping back around my house to shed layers as I run, but any advice would be appreciated, especially on race day when this isn't an option. Or do I simply bite the bullet starting off and just hope I warm up quickly? For context, I live in North Carolina so I'm not concerned about significant cold exposure (ie frostbite), more so a comfort question than anything else.\n\nI know this sounds kinda stupid but I’ve had great success just running with a zip up fleece jacket that I tie around my waist when I get too hot. I’m mainly a winter runner and I’ve experimented over the years with different things but this works the best for me. I just run straight out of my house onto a path and there’s nowhere for me to just leave stuff so I have to take it with me if I want to keep it. It works out well because I often get hot and then cold so it’s nice to be able to put the jacket back on if I get too cold.\n\n&gt; that I tie around my waist when I get too hot\n\ndo you not need to keep readjusting it every few hundred meters? I've done this once and only once because of this.\n\nNo shockingly I don’t have an issue with it. It might be the specific jacket I’m using- it’s fuzzy so maybe the arms don’t slide too much when they’re tied? I also double knot the arms and have it tied around my natural waist rather than my hips.\n\nDepending on the type of run, I typically dress a little under what is comfortable at the beginning knowing I will warm up some.  It can be tricky sometime as you don't want to be tool cold but also not get so hot you are sweating a lot.  Your idea of looping back is probably the wisest choice until you get a feel for that balance.\n\nThat's what I figured, unfortunately the route to my house is typically the only hilly portion of my runs lol\n\nI do a 5 minute warm-up on my elliptical at home before going outside. Before I had the machine, I did jumping jacks and squats to warm up. It reduces the need for layers.\n\nI like to wear quarter-zip long sleeves that have really long zippers (half-zips?)--as I start to warm up, I can un-zip and drop lots of heat\n\nYou can always do some jumping jacks and maybe a little higher intensity core work in your home before you head out the door in order to get the blood flowing and prep yourself to acclimate more quickly once you go outside.\n\nI lived in Cary for 15 years and ran through many winters.  The first thing to add would be light fleece gloves when it was below 50.  Even if I ended up with sweaty hands, I can always just tuck them in my waistband later.  I've found that if I follow the conventional wisdom to dress as if it were 20F degrees warmer than the air temp, I end up pretty comfortable.  So yes, if it's 40F and I go out just wearing a long sleeve running shirt and light gloves, and shorts, I may be a little chilly for the first 8-10min, but that's a lot better than overheating imho.\n\nOnly when it got \"really cold\" (for NC, so in the 20s) would I sometimes add a windbreaker over my thermal longsleeve, and then take it off after a couple miles.\n\nA half-zip or full-zip outer layer works like a thermostat. When you're warm, un-zip to release heat and increase airflow. If you get cold, up goes the zipper and up goes the temp. Works like a charm.\n\n**BEST / WORST EXPERIENCES**\n\nGot into running this past winter using Couch to 5K, and very, very early on (maybe two weeks in?) I had a run on a morning that was maybe about 20 degrees. I did NOT want to go out and do the run. Something in me told me though that if I sucked it up and pushed through it, I could commit to this running journey, but if I quit on that one run that I'd quit on the 5K program. Long story short I did the run (it sucked but I did it). 8 months later and I'm down 60 pounds and ran my first half marathon this week!\n\nHell yeah!!! Congratulations!  I love running in the winter- I hate being hot and I hate crowds and both of those things are prime in the summer but winter is so much chiller and fun and peaceful, I just love running in the cold!\n\nI love running in the cooler weather, but HATE running in the extreme weather, hot or cold lol. I also don't think it helped that I hadn't fully embraced running yet. Super excited for this season though, especially since I'm running longer distances! The idea of training for a marathon is much more enjoyable over winter than it is over summer lol\n\nThat’s fantastic. Congrats on the HM\n\nMy dog absolutely loves running in fresh snow, like she turns into a sled dog or something, bounding about like a deer, and our favourite thing to do after a blizzard is throw on the snow pants and boots and go for a run to the best our abilities before the plow comes. It’s hilarious\n\nI know this thread is old but my dog loves it too! Problem is she’s a pittie beagle mix and has like NO fur on her body. She has a snow coat but boots get chewed off immediately.\n\nHaha mine is a pittie/lab mix, she does balloon boots just fine but won’t wear a coat - she’ll rub up against a tree til she’s freeee\n\nRunning on hard packed snow through a Forrest is just so tranquil. The snow dampens basically any sound so it's extremely quiet and just soothing. The hard pack snow is prettygood footing and keeps your legs and feet dry. I strongly recommend everyone try it.\n\nWorst: Running a 10k on a blustery day when the temperature was right around freezing, and the pouring precipitation couldn't decide whether it wanted to be rain or ice or both. (It was mostly the last one.)\n\n**FAVORITE JACKETS**\n\nPatagonia Houdini ftw. Best wind breaker ever. Packs down to nothing, can tension hood and waist (recommend tucking in hood if not using it), can be tied around waist if needed, super light. Have had mine for almost 20 years and it’s probably been to a dozen countries with me.\n\nIt’s what I wear with a LS when below 45ish F. Contrary to the main post I think a windbreaker + LS is more important than a LS + base layer when you begin layering. Also, as someone that runs warm, I think the table guide might be for people that run very warm / run very fast. That being said it’s a good starting place.\n\nI have two, one for wind/water, and one for warmth.  I don't live in a particularly cold or wet area (bay area, California).\n\nFor dry weather &lt;45F, I'll wear a Nike dry-fit full zip jacket that's basically like a thermal shirt but with a zipper.  I wear it over a normal short sleeved running tee, and like that it's a double zipper so I can adjust from the top or bottom.  It appears to be a model they no longer make, so I can't recommend something specific.  I do recommend this *kind* of thing, though: a light thermal jacket with a full zip.\n\nFor wet and/or windy weather, I do wholeheartedly recommend the [On Weather jacket](https://www.on.com/en-us/products/weather-jacket-m-1me1031/mens/white-black-apparel-1ME10310462).  It's expensive (I found mine at a discount store for half price), but it really is pretty waterproof and has excellent ventilation for something so minimal.\n\nI've got a pair of New Balance Heat full zip hooded jackets that are excellent. I don't think they make this specific model anymore, and I'll be sad one day when I need to source replacements.\n\nLululemon down for it all running jacket\n\nChrist. That thing is $248 CAD plus tax.\n\nYeah you gotta wait till the black friday sales to buy it or via mecari/poshmark. I like to try items on in store to figure out the sizing and then wait for a sale or for it to pop on one of the resale sites.\n\nI don’t have the jacket but do have the vest. 11/10. Pockets for days. I miss it when it is in the wash and have considered getting a second.\n\nI just picked up the push your pace vest because I heard the down for it all is TOO warm 🫠\n\n**SHOE SUGGESTIONS**\n\nNot necessarily shoes, but I highly recommend nanospikes for running in snow/ice. They are removable for any long stretches of dry, which is important because they are more unstable on non-iced surfaces. They are great on ice, better than yaktrax imo. I run thru the winter in Alaska and bring them both on walks and runs.\n\n+1 for traction aids. I found a cheap costco version worked pretty well (icetrax here in canada - 2 pack for $20 canadian) - for those who don't want to bite the bullet on more expensive options.\n\nI just wear Saucony Endorphin Speeds and Pros year round, but when there's snow on the ground and my normal route is icy, I go to a grass loop and just run in the snow with trail shoes on. Mine are Hoka something or other, but I only do that maybe once a year.\n\n**FAVORITE GLOVES**\n\nSOCKS!\n\nAre socks really that popular? I have never seen this in my area, only actual gloves\n\nI wear simple glove liners which are fine most of the winter days as it doesn’t often get below 0c where I live/run. But the problem is if it is raining and cold then my hands get soaked and freezing to the point I can barely move them and have difficulty opening energy gels. Appreciate some advice.\n\nAfter reviewing prior iterations of this thread, I bought these: Craft Sportswear Hybrid Weather... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O3GI5W2?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\n\nSalomon makes these windbreaker mitts, that convert to fingerless gloves. They’re so light &amp; thin, but make a massive difference when the weather is borderline!\n\n**GENERAL THOUGHTS**\n\nRule of thumb I’ve learned for figuring out layers: Add 20 degrees F to the current temp and dress like you’d be sitting around. For example, if it’s 35F, dress with the layers you’d need to be comfy in 55F without running.\n\nAs a newbie runner, I’ve been using this site: https://dressmyrun.com/\n\nAWESOME! Just automatically bases this on location, this is perfect!\n\nIn the south cooler temps means we finally get actually good running temps! My runs were 20 degrees cooler this week and a minute per mile faster with no effort. So happy to finally have the cooler weather.\n\nThreads like these remind me that I should always dress a little warmer than what the internet recommends. I am genuinely shocked that the dress my run website recommends shorts and a t shirt for the 47 degrees/82% humidity that I ran in this morning. I was pretty cold throughout my entire workout while wearing leggings, long sleeves, padded bra, headband, and gloves. 🤦🏻‍♀️\n\nIt seems like it's only for runners that run door to door. I have to warm up outside and cross a few streets to get to my trail and no way would I have been comfortable in dressmyrun's recommendation\n\nSame here. I have to dress one or two levels warmer than the recommendations to feel comfortable or I’d freeze.\n\nI run in a singlet, shorts, and wear gloves when the temp is that low. No issues. You can change if you like being warmer/colder on that website.\n\nYeah, the warmest setting more or less matches up with my preferences. My point was less about how good the website is and more about how shocked I felt when it reminded me that I am insanely cold natured.\n\nOoooh gotcha!\n\nGo ahead and get nice winter running clothes if you find them helpful, but I find them overrated and just run through the winter in old hoodies and old pairs of sweatpants and have a perfectly fine time with it. I seem to save a lot of money that way and probably have basically the same running outcomes.\n\n**FAVORITE TIGHTS / PANTS**\n\nAthleta rainier tights\n\nAlso vouching for the rainier tights! I have a few pairs of them and snagged most of them on a really good markdown too.\n\nThis is my first winter running. Definitely just bought some of these leggings after reading this. lol.\n\nRabbit's Speed tights!  It has a zippered pocket in the back for a key and two thigh pockets for gels on one side and a phone in the other!\n\nThis what I need. Male who sweats a lot (even my legs (I'm very hairy)). What are good cold weather running pants?\n\nSerious question: if your legs are sweating, why do you want to cover them?\n\nI don't have any tights I'm really in love with, with one exception... but they're about 10 years old and no longer made. Salomon used to make a Windstopper tight that had vented knees and vent zips on each hip.  They're too hot to run in, but they're still my go-to for things like winter hikes or standing on the sideline of a cold soccer match.\n\nI sweat even when it's cold. The sweat causes my legs to get colder and can lead to cramping. With cramping as the alternative, I don't mind some sweat. But waterproof doesn't work for me because then it's just rivers of it, that just feels gross but also leads to chaffing and having to rehydrated more often. Getting old sucks.\n\nsquealing serious wrench angle sort detail coherent thumb rhythm sand\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nAnything that's not $90+ for us casual runners?\n\nWould love to see the options. I just bought a 2 pack of cheapos from Amazon for $25 total. Will report back after trying them this week.\n\nI'm going to get laughed at, but I bought a few pairs of the cold weather leggings that 32 Degrees makes at Costco. I wear them under my regular running shorts and they've been completely fine so far (down to about ~40 temp or ~35 with wind chill).\n\nI don’t have experience with them yet but I’ve seen quite a few recommendations for the Baleaf lined leggings/joggers on Amazon. I’m planning on grabbing a couple pairs once it gets colder\n\nI'm a man, but the Patagonia Peak Mission are my favorite for cold weather runs.\n\n**FAVORITE SOCKS**\n\nDarn tough \n\nSmartwool\n\nBalega Hidden Comfort all year. Zero complaints. GOAT running socks.\n\n**FAVORITE BASE LAYERS**\n\nThe 32 degrees thin base layer long sleeve tops work very well for me. Found at Costco for 2/$15.\n\nI bought some of these at Costco. They're part of my rotation but they aren't my favorite, my current favorites are actually the Reebok base layer from Walmart but they're double the price. They're noticeably softer and more comfortable though.\n\nAlso it looks like they're on sale right now at Costco for $11/2! [https://www.costco.com/32-degrees-men's-heat-tee%2C-2-pack.product.100507954.html](https://www.costco.com/32-degrees-men's-heat-tee%2C-2-pack.product.100507954.html)\n\nUniqlo heatech\n\nI know it is a bit pricey, but the Tracksmith Brighton is amazing.\n\nPick any mesh sleeveless base layer\n\nThen put Under Armour Cold Gear thermal on top and you're set down to about 30F/0C.  I've found the UA stuff to be perfectly fitted for tall, lanky guys, and they're just fleecy enough on the inside to be comfy without causing overheating, and they block most of the wind, too.  Bonus: they're much cheaper than \"premium\" running brands.\n\nIt's a tad bougie, but the Tracksmith Merino base layer is fantastic. If I'm not exactly sure what to wear in winter - how many layers, etc. - I go with that and it never fails me.\n\n**FAVORITE MID-LAYER**\n\nTracksmith Harrier tee\n\n**BEST SAFETY DEVICES (Lights / vests / etc)**\n\nNoxgear vest with attachable light\n\nDefinitely noxgear vest.  Depending on what I have on my head, my petzl headlamp or knuckle lights for ground visibility.   (I can’t wear headlamp on my bare head)\n\nThe Million Mile Light needs no battery.  It harvests energy from your vertical oscillation and flashes multiple LEDs. It’s great for “being seen”, not so much for “seeing”.\n\nNoxgear vest and Black Diamond headlamp. Black Diamond offers a variety of headlamps. Some have interchangeable AAA batteries and a battery pack, while others have a built-in rechargeable battery that isn’t removable to keep it waterproof. They have lights with multiple colors (including red, ideal for night vision) and strengths.\n\nYou can get inexpensive clip-on rechargeable red blinky lights on Amazon. I have a bunch, keep ‘em by the door , throw on one on my front and one on my back when I head out. A white non-blinky clip-on light can provide a bit of emergency visibility of footing in dark areas. (This is for city-ish running, grab a real headlamp for truly dark areas!) buy extras, you can always have some charging.\n\n**FAVORITE HATS**\n\nDoes anyone have a warm hat that works with the shokz headphones?  Last year my had pressing on those hard over ear parts really hurt my head.\n\nDid you end up trying anything? I just ordered Shokz this morning and am curious :D\n\nI find a buff works well.\n\nOn cold days I start off with it around my neck and pulled up over the back of my head.\n\nThen once I warmup I convert it to a headband.\n On really cold days I'll bring two buffs so I can keep one around my neck and one for ears/head\n\nMerino wool headband from smartwool\n\n**MUST HAVES**\n\nLights and safety lighting. Absolutely a must have if running on any sort of mixed use path for your own safety."

This is what I’ve been telling myself since January 2024, when I joined the Ronald McDonald House Charities team to raise money and run the Chicago marathon.  I’d never run a marathon.  In fact, before October of 2022 I had not really exercised in nearly 30 years.  I was a busy engineer, husband, and father, going through life like we all do.  But one small opportunity changed the direction of my life in a subtle way, and now the changes are anything but subtle.\n\nI had a business trip planned for November 2022 to India.  I have a great team of engineers there, and post-pandemic I was finally able to go and meet them in person.  I had a week of meetings planned, and one of my employees asked if I would be interested in doing a Himalayan Trek after we concluded all the work.  Of course I did, what an opportunity!  I knew I was in no shape to survive or enjoy hiking up 12,000+ feet of elevation or traveling 10-15 miles a day up a mountain for a week.  I prepared by going to the gym and doing lots of stair master.  At the time, I thought it was tough, but I did it, and I had an amazing time on the trip, celebrating my 49th birthday in Sankari with my trek-mates.\n\nWhen I got back, I continued at the gym.  I couldn’t really run more than a mile or so on the treadmill, but I persisted.  A good friend was going through a divorce, so I invited him to come to the gym with me as an opportunity to be there for him when he needed some support.  That summer turned into “Hard 75” which is a crazy internet challenge that involves exercising twice a day, every day for 75 days, amongst other things.  One of the exercises was required to be outside, so I started running in the mornings on July 4, 2023.\n\nOver the next six months, I grew to really enjoy running. I told my wife I was going to be “fit by fifty” as my 50th was next.  I ran some 5ks, and then planned a half-marathon in January 2024.  By the end of 2023, I had run 626 miles.\n\nI finished my January half-marathon (the “Chilly Willy”) in 2 hours, 10 minutes.  I had hoped to finish under two hours, but it was quite cold and I started too fast.  I set a new goal.  I would run a marathon.  THE marathon.  Was I crazy?  Yes.  The half was so hard, how could I run a marathon for the first time at 50 years old?\n\nAs anyone who knows me knows, I am detail oriented and I prepare for anything I do.  I began to read books on marathon training plans, on exercise nutrition, on physiology and injuries in older runners, and on the mental toughness needed to get through the race.  I went to a cardiologist and got my heart stress tested.  I went to a physical therapist and learned how to combat the “IT band” pain I’d been dealing with.  I settled on a plan, the “Hal Higdon Intermediate 1” marathon plan, primarily because the starting mileage looked like something I could do, but didn’t sound easy.  Week 1 would start June 10th and would require me to run 24 miles, including a “long run” of 8 miles.  My longest runs would be 20 miles during two 43-mile weeks, totaling 588 miles of training in the block.\n\nThe weeks went by, and I followed the plan.  I quickly learned that a marathon runner needs discipline.  Discipline carries us through when motivation inevitably fails.  There were many days I didn’t want to get up and run before work, but I had laid out my clothes the night before, and set my alarm, and by the time I realized I didn’t want to run I was already outside running up the hill.  Some days I was sore, so I’d do the check — could I run without so much pain that it affected my stride?  The answer was always yes.  Summer in Georgia is famously hot and humid, so I did most of those runs at 7, 6 or even 5 am to beat the heat and humidity.  Discipline was my friend.\n\nBy week 13, I had a 20-mile long run on a Sunday capping off a 43-mile week.  At this point a half marathon on a Sunday was a “de-load” easy day.  Perspective is everything.  Three more hard weeks, then I could taper and be fresh for the race. Of course, nothing in life is guaranteed.  I had a 1.1cm kidney stone that I had to have removed. The process proved painful and took me out of commission for over a week. Whe it was all done, I'd missed my second 20-mile long run, and it worried me.  I'd done the first one though pretty well, and practiced fueling all along, so I finished out the training plan and the taper.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nMy wife was able to travel with me to Chicago.  We arrived Thursday and settled into our hotel across from Grant Park.  We went to the expo, and I checked in with the charity and bought some swag.  The next morning, we went to the Field museum and explored the city.  We went to the Eleven diner (highly recommended!) and had a ridiculously good french toast.  I knew I wanted to stay off my feet Saturday, so Friday was for exploring.  Saturday morning we did the Believe In the Run shakeout, then we stopped for breakfast (Yolk!), and then I spent the day laying in the bed watching TV and eating carbs.  That night we went to the RMHC dinner, and back to the room to sleep.\n\n# Race\n\nI woke about 5am.  My body was cooperative on the bathroom front, so I didn't have to worry about #2 during the race.  I left the room about 5:30am, bundled up with 12 (yes twelve!) Gu Liquid energy gels tucked into the waistband of my T8 ultra sherpa shorts.  I spent a lot of time this summer trying to find the right solution to carrying so many gels, and these were the perfect solution for me.   I walked to Gate A, went through security, and then to the charity tent.  I had most of a bagel, a cup of coffee, and a Sprite while I waited for my corral to be called.  They took some pictures and stuff, but I sat outside the tent trying to keep my nerves calm. I used the porta-potty in the charity area once to pee, but the lines were long so I didn't get to go a second time.\n\nWhen it was time,I walked to corral J.  I knew I was slower than most of the corral, so I went to the back.  Eventually, it was time to go, so I threw my hoodie on the fence and we started off.\n\nI want to mention fueling.  Everyone knows it's one of the things new marathoners get wrong.  I trained my gut a lot all summer, so I knew I could take in a lot of fuel.  I'm a big guy with an iron stomach, but I brought gels and Tailwind with me all summer on long runs.  I took a gel every 2 miles.  It's a lot, but I knew I could handle it, and the liquid gels I use are much easier to get down than the regular Gus.  I also took Gatorade at every stop, and water at most of them.  At some stops I just washed my hands with the water to rinse the salt off of me.\n\nThe first 10 miles were the easiest, most-fun run I've ever done.  It was beautiful, and the crowd was amazing.  I put my name on my shirt, and people cheered for me by name throughout the race.   I saw my wife at mile 1, and again at mile 12. It was a great boost to see her, and she made me signs.\n\nAt mile 14.5 I stopped at a porta-potty and peed.  My legs were shaking trying to stand still after running 14+ miles nonstop.  It shows up on my strava as my slowest mile.  It was worth it though, and I felt better after.\n\nWhen I passed mile 20, I knew I was in uncharted territory for my old body.  At mile 22 I started feeling the beginnings of cramps in my quads.  I shortened my already short stride, but I kept running.\n\nI ran, and I ran.  There was one point where  the wind blasted me from behind and I felt like Chicago was giving me a push to keep going.  Then I was on Michigan Ave with 2 miles to go, and I got the same wind in my face; Chicago wanted to know if I was tough.  I kept running.  When I got to the one hill, Mt. Roosevelt, I ran up.  I walked the last quarter to the top, then ran to the finish.  I finished at 4:59:57 -- three seconds before the 5-hour mark.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI was sore, and tired, and honestly more proud of this than anything I've done in the last 10 years.  All that work, all those sacrifices felt worth it in that moment. I can.  I will.  I do.  What's next?  I'm going to find out, but I can do hard things.",

There is no feeling like finishing a marathon.\n\nFit by Fifty!! This is exactly what I tell myself as I move towards milestone. Great to see you doing it!\n\nReading this on the train to Toronto to do my first full marathon tomorrow.  Thanks for posting your experience.

Well written and well done on the race.\n\nBravo! Great job and great story. On to the rest of the Marathon Majors? \n\nOne thing that really blew me away about your story was the twelve gels. Seems like a lot of weight to carry! Hey, if it works for you then go for it, but you might be OK with fewer. The magic number for me is four regular GUs.\n\nGreat work!

Still riding that high! I have resisted the temptation to wear my medal around to the grocery store, the office, etc. :P\n\nNot gonna lie, I bought the finisher jacket and wear it a lot.  \n\nForcing myself to rest two weeks before I start training for whatever’s next.  Looking forward to getting back in the gym.\n\nFunny you should mention that because my one regret (and it's a small one) was chickening out of buying the jacket at the Expo. I wasn't sure about finishing, which I now realize was ridiculous. I've since found one, but it's taking a long time to be shipped! I should get it about a month after my race and will then be able to wear it around. Too much to wear it at my local 5k?\n\nCongratulations! I did my first at 50, too. That sense of accomplishment is such a great feeling. I've done others since, but you never forget your first.\n\nSo inspiring and thank you for sharing. We can do hard things!!\n\nCongrats OP! &amp; Also running for RMHC ❤️ must have been so incredible. Such an amazing charity.\n\nLoved reading this! Way to go!\n\nCongratulations!! All that hard work and discipline paid off.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nSo inspiring! thanks for sharing. training for my first half and the part about discipline really hit home\n\nWow, where did you store all those gels?\n\nI got a pair of T8 ultra Sherpa shorts. They basically have a giant flip belt built into the waist. \n\nI could have carried more if I needed to.\n\nCongrats!"

    "title": "My first marathon - a year long lesson in endurance",
    "body": "Race Info\n\nName: Windsor Marathon in Windsor, Colorado\n\nDate: October 6th, 2024\n\nHow far? 26.2mi\n\nFinish Time: 04:20:12\n\nRace Split - \nHalf marathon split: 2:03:01\n\n\nGoals:\n\nA: Finish the course - yes\n\nB: Finish course without walking - no\n\nC: Finish in less than 4.5 hours - yes\n\nBackground\n28 Female 5’5 135lb\n\nMy running journey started back in college around 2014 as means to get healthy and deal with life transition into adulthood. I was casually running then 2-4 times a week up to five miles at a time after a couple of attempts to finally complete couch to 5k. In the spring of 2016 my sister and I decided to run the San Francisco Half Marathon. I followed a Hal Higdon plan for twelve weeks and completed that beautiful race in a time around 2:15. I continued to run casually through the next year, until I graduated. Once I transitioned into full time work with all the adult responsibilities, running and my overall physical health went by the wayside.\n\nFlash forward to May of 2023. My husband and I had a long conversation regarding when we wanted to start having children. We both felt emotionally ready but I knew I was not physically after neglecting my own health, especially during the pandemic as I worked as bedside nurse on a Covid-19 unit. That same weekend I downloaded a calorie tracking app and set off to get into a health BMI. In June I\nrestarted the couch to 5k program, using the 5k trail loop near my house. I slowly ramped up my weekly mileage and had no injuries. By October I was down thirty pounds and ran a half marathon in 2:26:50. \n\nI continued to calorie track, run around fifteen miles a week, and added in weightlifting in our garage gym on the days in the winter when it was too icy or snowy to run outside. \n\nBy January I was down fifty pounds, just shy of my goal of getting to 140 pounds. I also found out I was pregnant. My OBGYN would not see me until eight weeks so after incessantly googling I ate at maintenance calories and I continued my exercise routine but cut back on my weights by 20% and was especially careful on runs to not slip on any icy spots. I felt physically great during this time, matching how excited I was to become a mom.\n\nThe first week of February, I began to miscarry  my beloved baby we named Logan. It was truly the most awful week of my life at that point. Once I physically recovered from the bleeding and subsequent surgery I needed a way to channel my grief. I went from casually running to building a base so I could run a half marathon every month. I ran two in February and then continued monthly, improving my pace nearly every time.\n\nI ran while I was sad, while I was angry, while I was cursing the world for taking my baby. But after nearly every run, whether it be a loop around my neighborhood 5k route or up to fifteen miles, I felt a relief of emotions. Every run I did for months I would play Logan’s song as my cool down. \n\nCome June I find out I am pregnant again. My blood tests showed that my pregnancy was on track and I got the enthusiastic clearance from my OB to continue with my running and lifting routine. I spend some time being anxious regarding the fear of miscarrying again but most of this period of my life I was feeling so joyful to be a mom again. My July half marathon time with baby on board was 2:02:03, three minutes slower than my PR in June. \n\nMy husband and I went to the first ultrasound just after eight weeks, talking of plans to buy the baby their first onesie after the appointment. Instead, our baby has no heart beat. For the next two weeks we are in a horrible limbo, waiting to see if he grows on subsequent ultrasounds but knowing he never will. I miscarry baby Emile on August 7th. \n\nGenerally doctors do not do a miscarriage work-up until three losses but I begged my OB to start the process now as I cannot endure this again. It takes nearly a month to get all of test results back. I come back perfectly healthy but baby Emile had a trisomy incompatible with life. I feel less guilt knowing this, that whatever I did during pregnancy, including physically exerting myself didn’t cause my baby any harm. It was truly just shitty luck that our perfect baby didn’t come out perfect.\n\nLosing Emile was an overwhelming grief. I knew I needed something to keep me afloat so I didn’t drown in my own sorrow. Before getting pregnant with Emile I thought about training for a marathon as I really felt better through running after losing Logan. Now with Emile gone I had no reason to stop me from training for that marathon. \n\nKnowing I wanted to do just a local race I had limited options going into the fall for Colorado. Many of the options were trail races which I knew I would not be prepared for. And with the unpredictably of winter there are few road marathons scheduled past mid October. I found the Windsor marathon about eight weeks out from my decision to run. \n\nTraining\nI jumped into the Hal Higdon Novice 1 plan at week 9. I knew it was poorly advised to start a training program halfway through but I felt I had a decent base to pull from and the motivation to push through. \n\nI personally do not like wearing a smart watch. I prefer my runs to be based on feeling and total mileage rather than targeting pace or heart rate. I can see how having the pacing and heart rate data can make for better training but that was just too much to add on my plate at the time. I wanted to run to run, run to grieve, run to just survive and finish.\n\nGiven the little shade and low humidity here I use my running vest anytime I go further than 6 miles. On my long runs of greater than ten miles I would eat 30 grams of fruit snacks every four miles and drink Gatorade as much as my stomach could handle. I feel I have fairly strong stomach so this became my strategy for race day as I had no malfunctions with this plan during training.\n\nI ran four days a week following the recommended mileage. I cross trained by bike riding on the weekends with my husband and hiking with my dogs on my off days from work. My peak week of training was the week of Logan’s due date. That week I looked at my runs as celebrations for my babies. Friday night we had a birthday party for Logan. We did a beautiful six mile hike in the mountains of Wyoming on Saturday. And I capped off the weekend with my 20 mile run in the heat and direct sun exposure. I was fatigued but I proved to myself I can endure hardship too. \n\nI felt good physically during the build-up by frequently stretching and rolling. The taper tantrums hit pretty hard though and the anxiety of “can I really do this?” jumped in. My appetite really ramped up in this time too so I really tried to focus on recovery. \n\nPre-race\nMy final week of tapering did not go quite to plan. I was still struggling with the taper tantrums with left lateral foot pain and bilateral IT band tightness. I had to work Sunday, Monday, and Wednesday of 14 hour shifts that week. And with it being autumn in Colorado I did not want to miss out on getting a hike in with the beautiful fall colors. So on Tuesday I did my last strenuous activity for training with a seven mile hike with an elevation gain of 1,600 feet with my huskies. Looking back now, that hike really put me in a positive mindset for the race and enjoying the solitude.\n\nThursday night my sister came in from out of state to spend the weekend together. She ended up being the best support crew on the course.\n\nThursday through Saturday I focused on managing pre-race jitters, stretching, and rolling out sore muscles. I maintained my normal daily routine of walking my dogs two miles in the morning and evening, with that being the extent of my cardio activity. For my diet I pushed more water than normal and ate whatever I wanted for carbs. Saturday we had reservations for Casa Bonita, allowing me to carb load on delicious sopapillas. \n\nI packed all my gear the night before, including hat, running vest with 24 ounces of Gatorade with six packs of fruit snacks, headphones, extra Gatorade flasks and a change of clothes. I went to sleep around 9:30 that night after watching the newest episode of my comfort show of Great British Baking Show. \n\nI woke up at 4 a.m. to drink 24 ounces of water and eat a bowl of oatmeal with blueberries and peanut butter, my usual long run breakfast. I laid back down where I lightly slept until 5:30. The course was about a thirty minute drive away. My sister and I left the house just before 6. \n\nOnce finding the starting line I picked up my bib, got my race swag, and used the port-a-potty one more time. I started my five minute dynamic stretching video at 6:50 and lined up at 6:58. After a quick hug and a plan to meet my sister somewhere around mile four it was finally go time!\n\nRace\nThe Windsor Marathon was a relatively small race with 53 people running the course. There were no designated pacers. Events of 1 mile kid run all the way through half marathon distance allowed there to be a sizable crowd at the start/finish line as well as some crowd support on the areas where the marathon and half marathon tracks were the same. \n\nMiles\n1-3: The morning started out cool in the 50s with sunrise quickly approaching. The route began on a golf course with narrow sidewalks designed for golf carts. I intentionally pulled back on the pace I was wanting to move at due to excitement. It was a bit difficult to find positioning at this point with the narrow path but we all eventually stretched out to our given paces. I do a drive-by at the aid station at mile 3 and quickly find out that whatever orange electrolyte drink they have out tastes horrendous. \n\n4-7: With the sun fully up now my sister is waving for me at mile 4. Given that this is a small local event she is able to park right next to the course. I toss her my cup since there was no trash can at the aid station. She shouts good luck as I continue forward to the trail along the riverbank. I eat my first pack of fruit snacks and sip on my packed Gatorade. Along the river there are a lot of trees providing shade which makes it feel almost chilly while running. Here I pass the time looking at the rabbits and the ducks along this rural stretch. My mind is at the calmest it has been in months. I notice there are not any thoughts in my head and I’m barely hearing my podcast. I’m just in the zone moving forward. \n\n8-12: Now into direct sunlight I continue northward to a nearby lake. I feel I have a consistent pace but somehow continue to play leapfrog with a guy in green shorts. Once getting to the lake area the path changes from  concrete to soft gravel and dirt which feels a little less harsh on the stride. My sister meets me at mile 10 where we switch out my now empty Gatorade flask for a fresh one. At mile 11 I find myself thinking, “This really is such great fun”. I feel like I have settled into a comfortable pace with no soreness anywhere. My first podcast was now over so I switch over to my running playlist. \n\n13-17: I do a mini celebration in my head when my tracking app gives me notification that I’m at the physical halfway point. The course now mingles with the half marathon group and I now start feeling crowded. I slightly quicken my speed to navigate around the new crowd. Mile 14 had the largest uphill portion of the route, along a busy roadway. I am mentally and physically feeling great at this point so I move swiftly up the incline. My sister honks and cheers from the road giving me a boost. Once finally flattening out (after a disappointing false summit) the course continued now on sidewalk for another mile. The crowd support on this stretch was the densest. At mile 15 the marathon route leaves the halfers by heading west at a roundabout. This stretch now felt eerily quiet compared to the crowds just a mile ago. There were no spectators or even a single car that passed me here. At this point I could feel the muscles around my hips begin to tire. My sister meets up with me at mile 16 where we exchange an empty flask for a full Gatorade. I’ve now drank about 24 ounces of Gatorade and eaten a total of four packs of fruit snacks. She runs about a quarter mile alongside me where we do a quick plan of the next fuel stoppage.\n\n17-21: I stop at the aid station just past mile 17 to use the toilet. I immediately jump back into pace to begin the off-road portion, following a dirt trail through a large meadow of tall grass. There are very few of the blue flags we were told to follow so I have to often guess which trail to continue onward. Thankfully I guessed right at each intersection. This dirt trail has both gentle up and downhill portions so it felt nice on my legs to use some different muscle groups as previous three miles had been almost completely flat. After exiting the dirt path area it looped around to where the aid station at mile 17 was. I pressed onward, but noticed my pace to keep my same breathing was slowing. The guy I had been following since mile 8 was starting to get a good distance ahead. My sister meets me at mile 20 where we trade a Gatorade flask for water and she gives me my peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It was pretty difficult to chew and swallow so I only ate about half of it over the next mile. I knew I needed fuel but I couldn’t eat another fruit snack due to the flavor and texture monotony. \n\n21-24.5: After the snack handoff at mile 20 my sister could see I was slowing a bit. The sun was fully shining and this area had no shade coverage. The breeze of the morning had gone away completely. She meets me at mile 21 and runs two blocks with me, and again at around mile 22. Around 22.5 I get a notification on my phone that my battery is at 10%. Knowing now I’m relying pretty heavily on my music to keep me moving I decide to stop my GPS and mileage tracker to save battery life. At mile 23 the course turns onto a private bikeway with no street access. I’m completely alone in this section. My IT bands really start burning and aching. The mental endurance is suffering and I make a promise to myself just to finish. Around mile 23.25 I take my first walk break, sort of upset knowing I need to do so. Over the next mile and a half I take a total of four walking breaks, making a deal with myself to start running when I reach a various landmark about a 50 yards in the distance. I stop at the aid station at mile 24 after a decent hill climb to drink 8 ounces of water and four ounces of a grape energy drink. I jog slowly onward, with the goal now to just keep moving forward.\n\n24.5-26.1: my sister is parked nearby at 24.5 miles in. She jogs alongside me before I have to walk again, about 75 yards. She stays with me the entire time now, knowing I need the push to finish. We jog on through a neighborhood before having a beautiful downhill stretch into mile 25. At this point I make her promise that she won’t let me walk anymore. I adjust my playlist to the songs that make me feel close to Logan and Emile and just push through.\n\n26.2: the finish line was over a wooden bridge and along a sandy beach to officially cross. My husband and our two dogs were waiting for me where I was mauled by excited hugs and kisses from the pups. I heard an onlooker say it was the cutest thing she has ever seen. I wish I would have smiled for my finish line photo but the only thought on my mind was “let’s just get this done.”\n\nPost-race:\nImmediately post race I walk to the shade where my dogs are still excited to see me and lick the salt off my legs. My sister gets me a blue otter pop to cool down with. After ten minutes of laying in the grass my husband takes the dogs to bring the car close by since I can only walk very slowly at this point and he is parked a half mile away. My sister and I get my lunch box with another otter pop and head toward the parking lot. The award ceremony started at 11:30 but I was ready to be home, knowing I’m just an average runner and was just thrilled to finish. But it turns out I should have stayed as I was the third fastest female marathon finisher!\n\nWe find the car where my sister left it at mile 24.5 and then drive the thirty minutes home. I feel proud but relieved that it’s finally done. I drink about forty ounces of water and electrolytes on the way home, but the thought of food makes my stomach turn. I take a cool shower, put on some pajamas and relax on the couch for the next two hours. Sadly, my sister had to go back home to California that night so we leave around 3 for the airport. I am truly so grateful she was here to push me all the way through. Everyone needs a hype girl like her!\n\nNow the question is: Now what? I ran this marathon as a way to channel my grief when losing my babies. Throughout the whole training process I worked on my grieving in other ways as well, like talk therapy and painting. But still, even with this accomplishment, I still miss them just as fiercely. \n\nI plan to continue running but back to more casual 15-20 miles a week and get back into weightlifting as the weather shifts. I think the weight training I did prior to being a full-time runner for ten weeks was really helpful for the injury prevention.\n\nIf I were giving advice I would say that you will likely have better success if you really follow a training program rather than jumping into one halfway. But also, life is short so just prepare to learn from your mistakes. \n\nI can endure hard things. I run for Logan and I run for Emile.\n",

    "title": "Death by 5K - Waterloo, IA..... Because who doesn't love to pull an all-nighter?",
    "body": "**Death by 5K – Waterloo, IA**\n\n**Saturday May 18****^(th)****, 2024**\n\n**Race Details:**\n\nThe RunStrong event, Death by 5k, requires participants to run, walk, skip, scrawl TEN 5ks over a 24-hour period. Each 5k starting 2.5 hours apart beginning at 8:00 am, 10:30 am, 1:00 pm, 3:30 pm, 6:00 pm, 8:30 pm, 11:00 pm, 1:30 am, 4:00 am, and finally at 6:30 am. You will receive a single bib and each 5k is chip-timed. The 2024 races were held in Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee, Iowa, Oklahoma, Texas, and Alabama. This is the event’s second year at the Waterloo, IA location. I’m hoping they expand to the Kansas City location next year!\n\n**How I Got Signed Up:**\n\nTen years ago, I decided to be a runner and cover 1000 miles over the course of 2014. I barely made the cut and reached my goal in the second half of December. When the 9-year-old timehop photo of my charted miles reared its head in December of 2023, I knew what I had to do. It was time to revisit the 1000-mile challenge I had set for myself once again.\n\nLittle did I know that I would receive a text from an internet friend on December 29^(th) regarding Death by 5K. Friend was considering signing up but said that $150 sounded crazy for a 5k. I too thought $150 was a little steep… until I clicked on the link and read more. It wasn’t only one, but TEN 5ks. I browsed the site a bit and looked at the other race locations for 2024. Being from Kansas City, the race in Waterloo, IA seemed like my best bet. I also liked that it was taking place in May. Not too hot and not too cold.\n\nWas I really going to sign up for essentially running 31 miles over a 24 hour stretch after not having run for ten years?\n\nJanuary 4^(th), 2024 – Yep.\n\n**Training Before Race:**\n\nGetting back into the swing of running was easier than I thought it was going to be. After the beginning / middle of January I was averaging 35 miles a week. I continued to dabble in my other activities of walking the dog, strength training, and Peloton spin classes. I ran a few 5k races, a 10k, and even signed up for a half marathon in April with just 5 weeks to train for it.\n\nWhile I wasn’t always the best at stretching before runs, I did try to stretch afterwards. I even started incorporating some more lengthy 20 minute stretches most nights.\n\nI had tackled walking 50k and 100k steps in a single day before, it was the lack of sleep that worried me. That wasn’t something I was going to “train” for though, so guess I would just cross that sleep-deprived bridge when I got to it.\n\n**Best Surprise Ever:**\n\nMy husband was initially going just to support me, but ended up signing up for the race without telling me. Approximately two weeks before the event, he surprised me that he'd be running it too. While I was running \\~35 miles each week, my husband was running a wee fraction of that. It was bound to make for an interesting experience.\n\n**Course:**\n\nWaterloo, IA - George Wyth State Park – Canfield Shelter – Out &amp; Back on Cedar Valley Lakes Trail (PAVED!). The trail was marked with white signs with red arrows. 32 Feet of elevation. Wooded non-lit trail, along the side a highway, through more wooded trails. Very pretty trail. Saw turkey and deer the way in, but nothing really while running. Bugs were horrid during the 8:30pm run, but otherwise were not too bad (possibly due to the lower night temps).\n\n**Swag**:\n\nParticipants receive a Death by 5k event shirt, cup, koozie, temporary tattoo, and stickers. If you finish the 50k challenge, you will also receive a handmade finisher’s coffin. Also available for purchase were event hats, hoodies, tanks, t-shirts. Other products you could buy (in case you forgot to pack your own) were socks, saltstick chews, headlamps, sunglasses, and bib belts.\n\n**Everything Packed – Why did we pack it and did we end up needing it?**\n\n\\~Camp Setup\\~\n\n*Canopy, Zero Gravity Bench, (3) Chairs, (2) Yoga Mats, Towel, Snuggies, KU Blanket*\n\nA resounding YES. The canopy kept us shaded. The bench reclined so we could relax and “sleep”. The chairs provided a nice place to sit and eat our meals. The yoga mats kept at least a little separation between our bags and the grass. The Snuggies and blankets came in handy during the night when the temperature dropped.\n\n\\~Clothing\\~\n\n*(5) Sports Bras, (4) Running Shorts, (5) Pairs Socks, (5) Tops, Sweatpants, Sweatshirt, Junk Headbands, Hat, (2) Pairs Tennis Shoes, Running Waist Packs, Bibboards*\n\nI packed so many changes of clothing because the weather was predicting rain for the longest time. Luckily it never came. I could have gotten by with way less bras, shorts, socks, and tops, but I am glad I packed them in case the rain did show up. The sweatpants and sweatshirt were worn in between races at night and super great to have. The hat was NOT used (I packed it in case of rain). I only ended up using one pair of my tennis shoes but wanted a second pair in case one of them got wet. The running waist bags were used every single run to hold our phones. The Bibboards were used to secure our bibs to our clothing, however RunStrong provided bib ties you could have purchased. The ones they sold honestly seemed like a solid option too.\n\n\\~Electronical Devices &amp; Lights\\~\n\n*(1) Body Light, (2) Head Lamps, (2) Shoe Lights, (2) Flashlights, Reading Lights, (2) Headphones, Power Strip, (3) Halos, Fan*\n\nBody lights, head lamps, shoe lights were all used during the night runs. We could have used more light up stuff to be honest, but what we had sufficed. Flashlights were used traversing to and from our canopy. Headphones were used to listen to music every run. Two of the three HALO chargers were used in between runs to recharge our phones. We did NOT use the reading lights (didn’t want to attract more bugs), but I would have if we had a tent. We also did NOT use the power strip or fan. To be fair, those items were packed to use at the hotel the night before Death by 5k, and they WERE used then.\n\n\\~Medicine Cabinet Things\\~\n\n*Ibuprofen &amp; Aleve, Capsaicin patches, Voltarin, Band-Aids, Neosporin, B12, Sunscreen, Bug Spray*\n\n*Knee braces (small and large), Bug Bite Thing, Tick Remover, Deodorant, Body Glide*\n\nLuckily a lot of these things were packed just in case we had the misfortune of needing them. The good news is that we didn’t need a lot of it, but I would still pack everything listed above all over again. We did use the Ibuprofen and Aleve and boy did those come in handy a little over halfway through. We did not use Capsaicin patches, Voltarin, or Neosporin. I did have to break out the Band-Aids as I developed starting blisters on my toes during one of the runs. I would have been in some pain without them! We did pop a B12 for a little bit of energy, but it probably wasn’t needed. The sunscreen and bug spray were applied LIBERALLY throughout the entire 24 hours, and I would never consider NOT packing these. Deodorant and Body Glide came into good use, especially when the chafing kicked in. We did not end up needing the knee braces (yay), the bug bite thing (despite the ample number of bugs), or the tick remover (THANK YOU).\n\n\\~Miscellaneous\\~\n\n*(1) Foam Roller, Book, Football, Toilet Paper, Wet Wipes / Body Wipes*\n\nThe foam roller was used when my back ached during the later runs, and I did get a solid chunk of my book read. We did NOT use the football, but maybe we would have if we had gone with a group of people? While we did not use the extra toilet paper or the body wipes, I would still pack them. The porta-potties got dangerously low on TP, and that is not something you want to be without.\n\n**What we WISHED we packed**\n\nA tent with an air mattress. Being able to keep out bugs and fully lay down would have helped immensely. A tarp to separate us from the ground, and furthermore a folding table to keep our bags off the ground. We were shooing spiders and other bugs right and left. Lastly a bag for trash just so we didn’t have to trek to the trash can at the pavilion each time to throw something away. Overall, I think we did a pretty good job packing things we might have needed during the 24-hour race.\n\nFood Packed: Honestly, we came unprepared. I packed energy drinks, electrolyte drinks, lemonade mix packets, Peeps candy, and gum. While we were supplied with more hot meals, snacks, and drinks than we thought possible, I now know next time to pack some fruit! I could have really gone for an apple after any one of those runs.\n\n**Food Provided**\n\nHot meals were provided after every other race. Snacks and drinks were provided throughout the entire event.\n\nBreakfast #1: Pancakes and bacon\n\nLunch: Chicken and cheese quesadillas\n\nDinner #1: Pizza\n\nMid-Night Dinner #2: Chicken noodle soup\n\nBreakfast #2: Chocolate pancakes and bacon\n\nAssorted Snacks Provided: peanut butter crackers, trail mix, mini muffins, powdered and chocolate mini donuts, ruffles, applesauce, vanilla and chocolate snackpaks, goldfish crackers, Oreos, mini rice crispy treats, soft batch cookies, &amp; Nutri grain bars. We did NOT go hungry.\n\nDrinks: Water, Gatorade, and coffee\n\n**HERE’S A RUN DOWN OF EACH INDIVIDUAL RACE:**\n\n**Run #1 8:00 am – 34:18**\n\n*67F and clear sunny skies*\n\nFirst run done and not regretting my decision to sign up. Ran at a very manageable pace. Ate pancakes, bacon, and a pack of mini muffins. Read some of my book. A bit breezy in the tent, so I’m glad that we packed the Snuggies.\n\n**Run #2 10:30 am – 34:58**\n\n*76F still clear and sunny*\n\nRun was definitely hotter and we still paced slow. It is fully sunny out, but luckily about two thirds of the path is shaded by trees. Drank some Gatorade, ate applesauce, mini powdered donuts, a mini rice crispy treat, and a leftover chicken wrap with sweet potato fries from last night. Tried to read some more but didn’t get much accomplished.\n\n**Run #3 1:00 pm – 35:49**\n\n*88F and VERY sunny*\n\nPace has become even slower. Ryan got very overheated at the end of the run. He had to immediately sit down and then cover his head in some water. Chicken and cheese quesadillas for lunch. Ryan might currently be regretting signing up. I am still doing fine. Also snacked on another mini rice crispy treat, a chocolate snack pack, and some leftover pancakes from breakfast.\n\n**Run #4 3:30 pm – 38:05**\n\n*89F but finally some cloud coverage*\n\nPaced dropped even more. Ryan carried Gatorade with him this time and it seemed to help. He didn’t end this run overheated. He says he hasn’t regretted signing up (and neither have I). Talked with Claire, the race director, afterwards. Ate more leftover pancakes with syrup and a piece of chicken and cheese quesadilla. Went back to the canopy and snacked on a mini rice crispy treat and some Oreos. Outfit change into bra, top, and socks number two.\n\n**Run #5 6:00 pm – 37:54**\n\n*85F and partly cloudy still*\n\nPace roughly the same. Ryan carried a water bottle again, but this is getting rough. His knee hurt during the first mile in and then started to feel better(ish)? We got a call out at the finish line by Claire since we talked to her after the previous run. She was so friendly! Had pizza, Oreos, and soft baked cookies afterwards. At this moment Death by 5K is a 7/10 on the hard scale. My only saving grace is the slightly slower speed we are jogging at. Read a little bit in between races. HALFWAY DONE!!!\n\n**Run #6 8:30 pm – 40:03**\n\n*79F and sun was actively setting*\n\nThis run started moderately dark and ended dark. While this was the slowest run so far, it definitely wasn’t the hardest. There were a LOT of bugs though. Those are only going to get worse once we start using our lights for the runs. Still having fun, but I wish we had a tent. Probably not the best idea that both Ryan and I had eaten another slice of pizza approximately five minutes before this run. Grabbed a Nutri grain bar to snack on afterwards before heading back to the canopy. Took one Ibuprofen to dull some minor aches in my knees, feet, and lower back.\n\n**Run #7 11:00 pm – 39:09**\n\n*68F and nighttime*\n\nSuch a fun run! Not as hot so the bugs were surprisingly not as bad. Everyone is generally going slower now because of the low visibility. Pretty run with everyone wearing items that glow or light up. Haven’t been able to sleep yet. Had warm chicken soup and soft batch cookies for a snack. Tried to sleep, couldn’t. At least I was able to rest my eyes a bit. Per Claire, these late-night races are the ones when runners will typically drop out of the event.\n\n**Run #8 1:30 am – 37:54**\n\n*60F and very dark*\n\nNot too different from the previous run, except we were able to finish a little faster. The first two minutes of the run were a little chilly, and then what I was wearing (tank top and shorts) was adequate. Both of us are getting a little chafed from the repeated running. It is both believable and not believable that we only have two more runs left. Had a leftover slice of pepperoni pizza and two mini rice crispy treats. Will try to sleep again, but my lower back, hips, knees, and feet are really feeling it. SUCCESS! I was able to catch about 30-40 minutes of sleep.\n\n**Run #9 4:00 am – 41:13**\n\n*56 and still nighttime*\n\nChilly enough now to run in a light sweater. Slowest pace so far, but it was the penultimate race, and we are running on less than an hour of sleep. Feeling very accomplished with just the final run being less than 2.5 hours away. Probably won’t be able to sleep before it. Breakfast after this run was chocolate pancakes and bacon. Also had *another* mini rice crispy treat (these are a weakness of mine if you could not tell) and a Nutri grain bar for a snack. A dog from another runner wandered over for 25 minutes while their owner slept, so we got some pets in.\n\n**Run #10 6:30 am – 38:27**\n\n*55F and the sun is rising, but it is party cloudy*\n\nWE DID IT! Neither of us walked a single run. I wore my light sweater again, and that was a little toasty by the end of the 3.1 miles. It was nice actually being able to see the trail though. We got our handmade coffin trophies, ate a slice of pizza, and we’re back off to Kansas City (after a quick power nap at our motel in an actual BED)!\n\n \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nAll in all the race directors made sure we were well fed and that the trail was clearly marked, and the junior race director made sure we knew when it was time to go to the starting line. They’re expanding to more locations each year, and I’m putting all the positive thoughts I can that Kansas City is one of the next ones on the list.\n\n**10/10 would do again (just not anytime in the immediate future).**\n\n[https://deathby5k.com/](https://deathby5k.com/)\n\nWE FINISHED!!\n\n([https://postimg.cc/MnKcQNXn](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/postimg.cc/MnKcQNXn__;!!H6meKgS6!ILB4XOkkO2Eg6PIIpVMQBFKTpmKhkdwPaHEu50fe98SFw3eu626RYpv_f9S87mJdcE1IEvowAbosza7q-dMI6Zp_wxgjHKgBmA$))",

    "all_comment_text": "Thanks for the write up! Sounds awesome!  Is there anything you would do differently?\n\nTraining wise: I don't think so. I might have taken water on the runs in the afternoon now knowing how hot they can be. My runs were always early in the morning prior to the sun being balls hot. \n\nPacking wise: YES. THE TENT. Good lord did we just want to be able to LAY DOWN completely and not be attacked by bugs.\n\nWhoa wasn't expecting to see a race in my area on reddit today😂. I've thought about signing up for this race the last two years, but my work schedule didn't work out for it again this year. I was kind of glad though when we had those high 80s/low 90s Temps that afternoon 🥵. Congrats on the finish!\n\nSo highly reccomend it if you can get off work. That trail is flat and beautiful! But yeah, the 90s in the afternoon were BRUTAL.\n\nOh yeah for sure I run George wyth and surrounding trails at least weekly. Great to have nice paved trails within a 10 min drive 🙏🏾\n\nYou should get this published by a news site, it’s more in depth and readable than a lot of professional reviews out there, sounds fun!\n\nHah, if I knew how, I would! Honestly, what lead me to write this is I tried to find information on Db5k prior to running it and there were so very little reviews! RunStrong put on such a great event, so I not only want more people to know about it... but to better prep people if they are interested in signing up. ♡\n\nDo you have a local magazine? “Yourcity Life” or whatever. The sort of thing you’d find a fresh stack of in a community center lobby. They’d probably be very interested in publishing this!!! And are likely a small enough operation that you can get in touch with somebody pretty easily.\n\nwill look into it - although I'm in Kansas City and a good 5 hours away from Waterloo :)\n\nThat's ridiculous and awesome! I hope it comes to the east coast someday!\n\nI think they expand a little more each year. They're hometown is the south, so that is where a good chunk of them are currently\n\nThis sounds awesome! What an adventure. Great report!\n\nI love this recap!!! Thank you for sharing everything!\nAlso, amazing job to you and your husband!!!! 🥳🥳🥳\n\nThank you. We were so happy to earn our little completion coffins lol\n\nTruly that’s the best trophy they could give 😂😂 I love the concept!\n\nI have medals, sure, but I only have ONE mini coffin ♡\n\nWow incredible job and very thoughtful recap. Thanks for sharing!\n\nHow was your husband feeling post race? Sounds like you had way more training than him so curious how his recovery went vs yours\n\nHe took a full week off of running afterward (I took off about three days), but ww both surprisingly recovered very well. He's already run a handful of 5 and 10ks since then (as well as another handful of shorter runs). I think the biggest win was him not saying he would never do another  event like this again.\n\nYay! That is awesome to hear that recovery went well!!\n\nHey, I ran this race as well! Great write up! That afternoon heat was brutal. I live local and it hasn’t gotten near that hot since then so I guess we just got unlucky. I can see why others tap out during the night races. If I hadn’t been with friends, I probably would have as well, the sleep deprivation was rough and really not something you can train for. \n\nI thought for sure I would end up walking some, but managed to run (slowly) the whole way as well. Congrats to you and your husband!\n\nLOL! I remember looking up the average temp in waterloo in the month of May and it was around 50-70F. I was like oh cool, that's perfect. BOOM upper 80s. The lack of sleep was something i was not even going to bother training for. Luckily i think the adrenaline and overall fun i was having helped keep me awake for most of it. \n\n  \nCongrats to you running the whole thing as well!!\n\nThis sounds like a pretty cool race format. Similar to a backyard ultra but with a definitive finish line and more approachable distance over the 24hr period. Very cool write up. Thanks for sharing.\n\nExactly!\n\nThank you for posting such a detailed race recap. I had never heard of this type of event before. This sounds like it could be a ton of fun. I did a 24hr bike race last year with a team of friends and had a blast. Something like this with a group would be awesome too. Do you have have a rough idea how many people participated?\n\n\\~150ish were signed up I believe. There were a handful of DNS and less than 10 DNF. You're welcome for the recap :D\n\nLoved that you had your partner supporting you. When you were there do you know many that did it on their own? Do you think that would be feasible?\n\nAppreciate all the details in your post!\n\nI do not. Most of the other seemed either like they were locals, or they were in big groups. I'd say it is doable on your own. The ten runs wouldn't be the bad part.. it would be killing the ~2 hours by yourself in between each one. Unless your a super social person - then I'm guessing that part would be a cake walk.\n\nI love that so much!\n\nThis sounds like SO MUCH FUN!!!\n\nI'm glad you had a blast. Thanks for sharing!\n\nThis sounds like so much fun! Thanks for the awesome write up!\n\nCongrats!! This is such a cool race idea and so great you just decided to go after it from the time hop. Awesome and informative write up. I joked with my wife I should have done a Death by 5k this year with the new baby since it was perfect training intervals getting up with him overnight!\n\nI really am glad I just decided to sign up and do it, and same with my husband. You joke about your training intervals with the baby, but really that probably would have been a fantastic time to try this event out!\n\nThat is a hard way to run 50K! Seems much harder than just running it straight in one go.\n\nI've never run 50k straight before, but i've heard that multiple times now! Might have to give it a go just so i can compare.\n\n[removed]\n\nYour post was removed because of Rule #1.\n\nI’m doing the death of 5k tomorrow, I’m glad I found this post. So informative thank you\n\noh fun!!! i have a friend running the one tomorrow as well. Good luck in Tulsa. Claire, one of the directors, is very very sweet. \n\n  \nbut really - have a blast :)\n\nThank you, wish me luck 😬🤣\n\nBest of luck - PLEASE STAY HYDRATED"

    "all_comment_text": "I don’t understand why people keep signing up for a race whose claim to fame is its utter awfulness year after year and are then shocked when it turns out, completely predictably, to be awful again.\n\nOr why you would TRAVEL for the infamously terrible race.\n\nTiming. I've seen some posts about people pulling out of other recent races and want to nab a BQ while still fit. This race is easy to get to since Toronto is a major hub with lots of hotels.\n\nThat's true. Mississauga is the week before and a much better experience supposedly, but probably less obvious (not a major city). Same with Georgina, same day as Toronto.\n\nThose courses do not effectively launch you downhill to shave precious time off though, and would likely require a car rental and other logistics\n\nMississauga has a hilly course. Great race but downhill is always better if you are trying to qualify for Boston or other races.\n\nI have run this twice. It was my first marathon last year. Start is closer to my home. So I don't have to drive or take a bus to get there. Route is pretty good takes you down yonge and few nicer areas (full is not that great, also the waterfront in Oct also doesn't have great full marathon route).\n\nFor This race it's mostly okay for fast finishers. If you are looking at 2:00 hour plus half finish times or 4:00 hour plus marathon finish times experience gets really really worse. \n\nThe October one they manage races really well, like full and half start at same time and shorter distance runners are off the finish area by time longer distance runners finish. In this one it is all a mess\n\nThe Waterfront Toronto marathon is a part of the Canada Running Series. It’s a premier marathon that attracts international elites. The “Toronto Marathon” is not affiliated with them and is known to be a poorly organized bunch of garbage.\n\nIt never used to be that way though. And honestly, they probably suffered from the Toronto Waterfront Marathon forcing them out of their traditional Fall slot.\n\nSuch a shame because I actually preferred this race to the Waterfront race. I did both several times over a decade ago.\n\nYeah. It is unfortunate. I don’t think anyone’s happy to talk shit about it. It just is what it is. Things changed, people have complained and expressed clearly what’s wrong, and it hasn’t changed for the better in around a decade—even when it was sponsored by GoodLife.\n\nI’m not happy with the way Beneva ran Mississauga this year either, to be honest—and it seems like that marathon has become an afterthought after being brought back from the dead.\n\nIt’s a little surprising that Ontario can have so many people, and the largest city in Canada, as well as several other large cities, and have such a weak marathon culture overall. Vancouver and Montreal seem to be much better. Maybe it’s because if you live in Southern Ontario it’s easy to just hop the fence and go to Chicago, New York, Detroit, Philly…\n\nI live in the GTHA and I’ve never heard anything about it being this bad. That said, the runners I know all do the waterfront marathon races instead. I just assumed it was because it’s just objectively more pleasant to run along the waterfront.\n\nAny time you look up this race online (eg people discussing it on Reddit too) there's always discussion about the horrible organization. It's pretty infamous.\n\n\nIt's always \"the course is great but the organization is awful, buyer beware.\"\n\nI don’t think it used to always have this reputation, it’s only been a shit show for the last few years. \n\nAlso I believe there is a big difference between the marathon and shorter race experiences.\n\nOn the Toronto subreddit someone who ran the half said they didn’t notice anything wrong. Their route was clear, there were plenty of volunteers, plenty of water at the end etc.\n\nA lot of people who ran the half had issues. My friend was there and took a video of cars blocking the very first intersection the racers went through, right at the start of the race. Others who were slower didn't get medals.\n\nIt was ok — not great but not terrible — when Goodlife was the title sponsor. It has gotten exponentially worse since they pulled out.\n\nThere were some pretty bad years when Goodlife was the sponsor. Runners often used to get lost  in the section west of the Humber bridge. And one year, all of the baggage was left out in the rain. The medical support has always been weak, and the water tables often quite chaotic.\n\nFair enough. I only did the half a couple of times when Goodlife sponsored it and Glassman was the RD then too so it was by no means good. I just don’t remember it being this outstandingly bad. \n\nCan confirm. I ran it 15 years or so ago and it was an amazing event. The course was nice because it started at the North end of Toronto and carried you all the way to the waterfront, vs the Toronto Waterfront Marathon (which I also ran) that was mostly a giant loop with the second half running through ugly industrial streets.\n\nIt was a little smaller scale, more friendly and just an all around joy to run. It was my preferred Toronto Half/Marathon. I haven't been running races in more than decade due to having kids and other big life events so I'm sad to hear this race has fallen apart.\n\nI'm sure part of it's downfall was being forced out of it's original fall position to the spring because the city didn't want two Marathons back to back and Waterfront had more international pull despite Toronto Marathon being the older race.\n\nJust got into running recently so had no idea about the reputation for this.\n\nI just ran this half, bathroom situation at the start was a disaster (45 minute wait with only four stalls) and they ran out of medals by the time I finished. The route was otherwise good and they said they’ll send the medal in the mail.\n\nThere were a lot more than four stalls at the start line. Like a lot more.\n\nIt’s been treated this way in the running community for at least a decade.\n\nI ran the half this past weekend in Toronto and the route was fine for me. I was mixed in a bit with a full marathon crowd a bit but didn't throw me off. Just the end of the race was a little disorganized as do real direction of where i was supposed to go for medals and refreshments.\n\nIt’s been bad for a long time, if you search you can find angry reviews going back to 2013\n\nIt's well known that it's terrible. It's a shitshow every time. Run Mississauga or Georgina instead.\n\nWeird. I was supposed to run the half this year but I injured an ankle tendon. I transferred my number to a friend who paced someone running their first race, he never mentioned any of these problems - not meaning they didn't happen of course. \n\n\nI've only ever ran the Waterfront half\n\nI don't even run marathons and I knew about this race.\n\nI ran Vancouver on the weekend (which is great) and I learned that it is the largest marathon in Canada. Everyone I said this to was surprised Toronto isn’t the biggest and I just said “oh, the course is not great and the marathon is kinda famously a shitshow.” \n\nI am kinda happy that there are articles I can just send to people\n\nWell there’s two marathons in Toronto. The spring one is a shit show. The fall race is great. Still surprising the fall one isn’t bigger\n\nHonestly... Waterfront course is kind of bad. It's a big loop, which is okay for the waterfront part but if you're doing the full, you're basically running through some industrial streets. The Toronto Marathon (the one in this article) has a much nicer route that shows more of the city.\n\nFall one isn't bigger because they design it that way to be. They hard cap the full to 8,000 participants on purpose to keep it manageable - which I really appreciate\n\nThe course is both better and faster than the larger fall event, so there's that. \n\nThis year I spectated a friend who finished in the top 10, and one issue not mentioned by the article is that this year, the top runners ran into a sea of slower runners for the final third or so. That shouldn't happen.\n\nFor the marathon it's a very fast course in the spring. It's also in the middle of the city and the routes good. Basically the only reasons\n\nIt’s a good course\n\nWhen I first did this race, I didn't know anything about its reputation. I didn't have any idea about how badly it was organized, or any standard to compare it to, or any contacts in the running community who might have warned me about it. Like many others, I learned the hard way. I haven't run it in the past ten years, and won't again until major changes are made. Most of my running friends feel the same way.\n\nThis was by far the worst half marathon I’ve ever done. Will never run this one again. Very unorganized.\n\n12 Km down hill to start. Just flying bud\n\nThe course was fine , it’s the organization. \nOnce you crossed the finish line it was a nightmare to do anything. Soaked from the rain , now freezing because you’re just standing around trying to shuffle through hundreds of people.\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/cancel-toronto-marathon-due-to-unsafe-conditions-for-runners\n\nRan the half 5 years ago, the city has to stop issuing permits to these guys.\n\nIt’s definitely not a good look for a city that has a really strong running community (and a weird coked-out one on the periphery but that’s another thread).\n\nDo you mean Hamilton?\n\nWe also have a strong running community (including Olympians!). The Toronto running club that’s allegedly up to no good is apparently the [Midnight Runners](https://runningmagazine.ca/the-scene/toronto-run-club-under-fire-amid-allegations-of-harassment-drug-use/).\n\nI’m aware of running communities in both cities, but I don’t follow the online drama. I find this pretty stupid, to be honest. If people want to do cocaine and lead group runs of adults, those adults can make their own minds up about whether to continue participating or not. Likewise, if the size of the runs is unwieldy, people can choose not to attend.\n\nI ran the 10k (had to transfer from the half due to health reasons) and even it was terrible, easily the worst race I've run. What I haven't really seen talked about is the 10k started 40 minutes late, which meant it wasn't well staggered with the longer distances and it contributed to insane congestion at the finish as you also had the 5k runners and walkers, as well as some of the elites from the longer distances. I had heard the organization wasn't great last year, but I figured how bad could it be...I wish I'd done a little more research but I won't be back. Luckily I live in Toronto, but even then I had a hell of a time getting to the starting line in time (and giving myself an hour and a half to get there for what should be a 45 minute trip). If I'd known we'd be waiting 40 minutes in the rain before actually starting I wouldn't have been so stressed on the way there.  \n\nI found the water stations were very small and crowded (if I even noticed them at all, as at least once I didn't see it until I was already basically past it), the route was very narrow (running on a multi use trail by the waterfront rather than the actual closed road except for at the very end), not very well marked, and again, the congestion at the finish. A lot of that I think could have been mitigated with proper starting times because there were too many racers of different distances finishing at the same time. \n\nDefinitely glad I didn't travel for this one. I was bummed I didn't get to run the half because I think the course is great, but maybe I'll just run the route one day on my own for fun instead and avoid the headache of that mess. I still managed to PR my 10k, which is especially rewarding with the health related curveballs I've been dealing with, so I'm still glad I participated but I can't believe this is normal for this race.\n\nYes!! I also ran the 10k and the finish was horrible. So crowded and then they started announcing the marathon runners were finishing and felt so bad that they had to run right into the chaos with no fan fare for them. \n\nI arrived about 40 minutes early and by the time I checked my bag (after wandering because there was no signage) and waiting in line for the bathroom I had no time to warm up. I was genuinely concerned about a crown crush in that area between the chutes and the portapotties. \n\nWhy anyone thought the queen Elizabeth building was big enough to handle tens of thousands of people is beyond me\n\nI couldn't get over the lack of signage and lack of designated walkways between the queen Elizabeth building and the starting corrals. Getting to the corral was absolutely dangerous and you're right, it could've absolutely been a crowd crush. Just total chaos. And then for the finish line to be so close to the entrance of the building again, I'm surprised the line (more of a hoard really) to get back in for medals and bag check didn't go all the way back to the finish line itself.\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/cancel-toronto-marathon-due-to-unsafe-conditions-for-runners\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/cancel-toronto-marathon-due-to-unsafe-conditions-for-runners\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/cancel-toronto-marathon-due-to-unsafe-conditions-for-runners\n\nI ran the 10K at the Mississauga Marathon. Everything started on time and they had all the race distances staggered out for this very reason. It can be a bit of a trek to get there, but they do offer free parking. It's a good suggestion for next year if you're trying to make the switch. The experience alone makes it entirely worth it!\n\nThey also don't mention how the 10k was delayed 40mins but it was only announced via one (shitty) speaker all the way at the start line, so a bunch of 5k people who were supposed to start 20mins after the 10k ended up starting WITH the 10k and it was mass confusion.\n\nI was running the 10 and didn't hear the announcement and I had honestly thought the 5k started with us intentionally. Oops. So chaotic.\n\nAlso there were no real corrals. Tonnes of 1h20min goal 10k runners at the start line along with the 40-50min runners. \n\n(As someone who lives in Toronto) I have heard horror stories from last year and between that and all the drama between that marathon and the one in October, while the medal looks nice, there is no way I would ever sign up for it. What a joke.\n\nThe one in Oct is supposed to be better, right? I was planning on signing up to it as my first full?\n\nI traveled from Texas to run the full Toronto Waterfront marathon last October and would recommend it\n\nThe Waterfront Marathon in October is very well organized, but it's huge. The only downside to that is traffic (but coming from the north, pretty easy to book a parking spot and jog in) and lines for the porta potties (I always end up stuck in line forever at the beginning and then miss my warm-up).\n\n\nBut the portapotty at the beginning line is standard to pretty much all big races in Toronto.\n\nYeah I live out west so I'd likely just get a hotel near the start!!\n\nYou might be able to streetcar/bus in. I've seen a lot of people biking in as well.\n\nOh I mean out west as in, in BC. Probably wouldn't bike from here hehe\n\nRide a tandem bike and pick me up on your way through Moose Jaw.\n\nFor what it's worth, when you said out West, I imagined somewhere west of Winnipeg.\n\nOh yeah haha. Just get a hotel, enjoy downtown after the race too.\n\nAny hotel tips for the fall one? Looking to run a fall marathon as my first and would be coming up from buffalo. Traffic and parking is my nightmare. Buffalo is wonderful in the traffic and parking aspect compared to Toronto\n\nWhat worked well for me is, I got an Airbnb about 2km away from the start for less than $100USD and jogged to the start as a warmup.\n\nI stayed at The Rex Hotel last year. 10/10 recommend for the location (2 blocks from the start line). Do not recommend if you want to sleep - there was a live jazz band the night before and the walls are paper thin so you can hear all the socializing in the adjacent bar XD\n\nI live in the city so I don't have any experience with hotels but there are lots within easy warm-up distance, but not going to be the cheapest. \n\n\nThe problem with all Toronto Sunday races is that the subway doesn't open until later in the morning.\n\nI have only run the half not the full, but it is run SO WELL. Highly recommend!!!\n\nI have done both and October is way way better\n\nAwesome! That'll be my first full! And it'll mark about 1 yr of running!\n\nI'm running the 5k that weekend, im really looking forward to it.\n\nMe to I'm doing the half marathon. Did the 5km last year and it was awesome.\n\nI did the full about 10 years ago and it was good - I wasn't 😅 - but the race was fine\n\nThe one in October is the better one (as a bunch of other people have also said) it also starts in the city vs the may one which starts farther north.\n\nThe waterfront marathon in October is a complete separate event and well run..it's TCS after all.\n\nThe organizers for waterfront are clearly much better but what I was trying to say is the organizers for both marathons hate each other and is the reason why there are two. They used to be back to back but the city threatened to cancel one so they somehow managed to compromise by moving one to spring.\n\nI learned about the poor organization of this after signing up for the half, but gave it the benefit of the doubt. My own experience was OK aside from the crowded finish area, but I don't think I'll sign up again next year.\n\nIt was my first HM, and I was happy with the outcome at least! Looking forward to the waterfront half in October.\n\nThe Watefront even in the fall is SO MUCH BETTER. You’re in for a treat :)\n\nThis was my experience last year, there were moments that just sucked but other moments that were fine, the finish line was a disaster. There was an apology sent out to everyone after the event. \n\nI thought, maybe it will be better this year, but ultimately decided I’d rather not go. I’m glad I did not. \n\nIn my experience the October Marathon is much much better run.\n\nCongrats on your first half!\n\nAre you me?\n\nMy bib didn’t scan when I crossed the start line and so my recorded time (1.59) was ~15 mins longer than my actual time (1.44). Had me starting at 8:30am (gun start time) not at 8:44 when I actually started the race. Hoping they will change it as I was pretty proud of my actual time.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was another person that thought that paying an extra $20 to get access to the shuttle bus to the starting line would be a good idea. Never again.\n\nI kind of blame myself. Multiple people told me this race is shit and I signed up for it anyway. I’ve learned my lesson.\n\nI’ve ran this event a few times and it is terrible and I highly doubt they will ever improve the bathrooms at the start. Thankfully I found a better spring race\n\nWhat’s the better spring race? I ran this event and don’t think I ever will again…\n\nNot who you replied to, but I just ran the BMO Vancouver Half and it was run super well. Beautiful course and a very easy route. Would recommend!  \nIt was my first race, though, so I don't have much to compare it to.\n\nRunVan puts on a great event. I've done tris, marathons, Gran fondos all over North American and BMO Vancouver marathon is easily one of the best organized events start to finish\n\nAh damn, I set the bar high for my first run I guess! Next race is an inaugural trail half marathon.. I'll have to recalibrate my expectations!!\n\nCongrats on your first race!\n\nAgreed, Vancouver's BMO Marathon/Half is a super well organized race, and usually on the same weekend as the Toronto race. Hopefully they improved the sandwiches at the finish though. Ran this last year and the sandwiches (I think provided by Bread Garden?) were ... not good. That I'm complaining about the quality of the sandwiches at the end though sort of speaks to how smoothly everything else went.\n\nTo be fair though, Vancouver's race is also significantly bigger than Toronto's, and it really shows especially with the logistics.\n\nThanks! I set a big PR compared to my training runs. It felt really good!  \nThe sandwiches were bad lol. I got a mid bun with a slice of turkey, cheese and some strangely colored iceberg lettuce. No sauce. I'm never too hungry after a run, though. I mostly grabbed food for my kids who were waiting at the finish line haha.\n\nHaha was the bun a kind of mini ciabatta that was in a sealed plastic bag? Might be the same kind that I had. It was really sad, with a single thin slice of turkey and cheese. I don't recall there being any greenery in mine. I remember it being dry AF, and I was washing it down liberally with a bottle of water I was drinking.\n\nHow was the finish area? I thought it was pretty great that there was a place where runners and their friends could hang out. I didn't check it out much when I ran it as I was booking it out of there to make it to lunch with a friend.\n\nProbably the same sando, yep haha. Didn't seem bread garden quality, though. Super dry for sure. The finish area was great. Lots going on. I have a 4 and 6 year old that met my wife and I at the finish, though, so we took off pretty quick.\n\nPersonally I like the High Park Spring Runoff, though it's like a month earlier and there's a gamble of the weather not being great. \n\n\nThe park and race are awesome, the final hill... is not\n\nOttawa Race Weekend!\n\nI literally drove to Ohio last weekend for a race in Toledo so that I had a good spring race to look forward to. I did this to avoid giving a single cent to the asshat who organizes the Toronto race. \n\nFor anyone who’s looking for a great spring race next year, check out glass city! Amazingly well organized! \n\nI haven’t run in a few months due to injury (hoping to start again soon!) but having experienced this last year - basically the same disaster, followed by an apology from the organizer - I can’t believe this happened again. Last year there was no water at the finish line because some awful people (mostly 5k or was it 10k runners) who finished early took home CASES because it was “free” and no one was doling it out. Getting a medal was a free for all mosh pit. Oh, and there wasn’t nearly enough security on the route and I almost crashed into a pedestrian who decided he could walk across the route because nothing was marked to block him. The  whole thing was so disorganized. When I saw this article I thought it would say 2023… but nope. \n\nToronto needs to cancel the permit and take back the name. The same guy has been organizing it for years and I think he has proved his incompetence by now. Of course he will be out soon blaming everyone else. But the other Toronto race, which he openly hates (the Fall Toronto Waterfront Marathon, formerly known as Scotia, now TCS) is so vastly superior… it’s not the city. It’s the organizer.\n\nHe has connections with City Hall hence permit despite pandemonium!\n\nYa it was bad. Waited line for 30 minutes just to get a bottle of water and medal. No snacks anywhere. Last year was bad and somehow they topped it this year.\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/cancel-toronto-marathon-due-to-unsafe-conditions-for-runners\n\nI ran it and had fun. It was my second half marathon and any race finished is a good one! The course was nice and I set a PB so can't complain then. \n\nHowever, I agree that the Toronto Waterfront in the fall is way better. The Waterfront is way more organized and has much better crowd flow. I particularly was annoyed at the end of the Toronto Marathon how I couldn't get water for like 20 min after I finished because the crowd was moving so slow. I wasn't offered food and didn't look for any because the crowds were so ridiculously packed... Just tried to find my girlfriend who was picking me up so I could get out of there ASAP. On the other hand, the Toronto Waterfront had a cool festival/fair at the end and ample food.\n\nI nearly signed up for this. This level of disorganization is a slap in the face for all the runners training hard for the marathon.\n\nI ran the full last year and that was how I felt after. Like I travelled. For that? There was zero chance I was signing up this year, this post definitely validated my judgement!\n\nTravelled from out of town for this half. Ran a great race and course was amazing, but everything else left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nThey had a typo on the bib pickup address (got a little lost but not a huge deal just had to walk a bit further down the street). Mid pack runners had to wait 30 min in line to even enter the finish area and wait even further to use the bathroom, get their medal, go to medical if needed, etc. Bag pickup didn’t have enough volunteers and no one knew where to line up. Got so chaotic that people pushed down the barriers and just hopped over to get their own bag. And the layout of finish was so congested and the layout was awful, runners had to circle the building to meet up with family/friends\n\nThey had 9,000 participants, the most they’ve ever had. Didn’t seem like they accounted for more people this year. Won’t be running it again\n\nThis was one of my favourite races of the spring, and I ran it from 2011-2016 when GoodLife sponsored it. The medals were just like they are now and the shirts actually fit &amp; they had the year of the race on them. Whoever is organizing this now just has the generic race logo &amp; looks like they’re using the same shirts year after year. I don’t know if they’re guessing people run this race once &amp; move on, but when I find a race that’s convenient &amp; familiar I’m gonna sign up again and again. Not this one. \n\nI did this also during Covid virtually &amp; I’ve never had such an impolite, downright nasty person to email with from that race. When I encountered that attitude I thought ‘well, even when they have it live again there’s no way in hell I’ll ever run this after the race director talked to me like that’. \n\nI’ve heard stories of this race running out of medals, and also specific sized shirts, and runners never got them. While that might seem trivial and petty to some, we pay good money for this event. I expect to get what I paid for. \n\nNow I just do waterfront, and if I get a chance to get away I’ll run Ottawa.\n\nFinish area is the main thing they need to address. Water should be available immediately after the finish line. Better, if they hand the medals too, with the water.\n\nIt is just dangerous. Last year I honestly thought I was going to pass out in the throngs at the end no water anywhere and couldn’t get into the building because it was blocked by people leaving with boxes of drinks and goodies.\n\nI agree. I finished the marathon last year and didn't get any fluid for another 20 min. I ended up taking a half drank bottle off of the ground because I was desperate.\n\nFrom a local - STOP SIGNING UP FOR THIS RACE.\n\nI feel bad for people that don’t know, but also if you don’t do your research and find the abundance of newspaper articles, Reddit posts, blog reviews etc about how terrible this race is every year then maybe that’s on you.\n\nI commented above but yes you don’t have to look too hard to see the encounters people have had with this race director (and/or staff). I would never speak to people that way; they sure don’t care if runners ever sign up again. They are dead set against any suggestions or tips from those of us who’d have been more than happy to help make this a good event. I did it every year when GoodLife was putting it on. I stopped running this in 2016 because I checked out Ottawa &amp; had a lot more fun doing that one.\n\nThis was my first year, I did the October race and honestly thought they were the same. I won’t be doing this one and will also be submitting a complaint to the city. This was so disorganised and crowded it could have actually been dangerous (I ran the 10k. The start was complete chaos I was worried there would be a crowd crush)\n\nI agree. On an especially hot or cold day they do not have the resources to keep everyone safe, and we already know they don’t do much to keep runners safe from car traffic.\n\nThis year was better than last year. There is still a lot of room for improvement. I assume I missed a lot of the nonsense because I ran a 2:55 full and avoided the crowds.\n\nYou should look at the extremely low effort and dated social media presence. That level of effort is reflected in everything they do: planning, communications, operations, post-race setup, kit pickup, shirts, medals, etc.\n\nI agree with all of this except for the medals, they are awesome and MASSIVE.\n\nThe problem is they ran out so not everyone got them.\n\nI think its due them not having a way to identify who opted-in for the green bib option (no medal) and at the finish line they just gave everyone a medal so they ran out as they didn’t order for all the participants\n\nLiterally the size of the bread plates in my kitchen.\n\nI ran the 5k. It was my very first race ever. Glad to hear they are not all like that.\n\nIt was my first race ever too, and I was wondering why I would ever do this again over running on my own. I think I’ll give the toronto waterfront marathon a go.\n\nWith 100% sincerity, I hope you continue running races. With this as your benchmark, every single finish line you cross from now on will be nothing short of orgasmic.\n\nSounds like this half that I just ran (which made news recently for having the marathon winner disqualified, but this thread is about bad logistics, especially pre- and post-race): https://reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1ckxns6/oc_marathon_is_trash/\n\nI read that article this morning. I was thinking of signing up for this race. I'm glad I didn't!\n\nThe Mississauga marathon a few weeks earlier is a super incredible race! Idk why people don’t come for that race instead.\n\nBecause until recently the two races were infamously run on the same day, and Toronto gets a ton of accidental signups from people who think it's the equivalent of the Toronto Waterfront Marathon that happens in the Fall. International runners also typically have no idea what \"Mississauga\" is, and that race is basically a local fun run. You could win it with a 2:30.\n\nLife is too short to run bad races.  I've not run this race but skipped a local race that measured short 2 years in a row and then didn't provide medals due to 'supply chain' issues.  I don't understand why people sign up for a race with a bad reputation.\n\nThanks for the heads up on this. I was looking forward to this race in the future.\n\nThe worst part was they had a line of porta potties outside of the finish… WITH PADLOCKS ON ALL OF THEM. No other bathrooms in sight. \nIt took me 20mins of fighting through a sweaty crowd to finally find my people it was awful.\n\nI didn’t run this year but it was awful when I ran last year. I remember calling my friends asking if they could bring any form of hydration along the course. Let’s not talk about the shit show at the finish when getting your medals. I suspect the organizers will be sending another apology email promising to make it better next year?\n\nI liked the apology email last year that doubled as a threat claiming that they would hunt down bad actors via security cam footage.\n\nDid anyone running the full notice the 14km marker was around 100m further than it should be? Or am I a bit crazy.\n\nOmg I thought this too! Only because I told myself I would take a gel at 14km but that marker did not come when I expected it to LOL!\n\n&gt;\"We were stuck in a congested swarm of honking horns and runners jaywalking left and right, just two blocks from the start line.\"\n\ni'm sorry, what??? runners doing their warmups near a marathon start line is now considered \"jaywalking?\"... what kind of car-brained assessment of the situation is this?\n\ni get it, the organizers screwed the author over with inadequate bus service and they opted to drive to the start line, but to then blame fellow runners for slowing her down is idiotic....\n\nthis was my first time running the spring toronto marathon. it was not a great experience, but personally, i never experienced anything as bad as what is posted on reddit. i guess it is a bit easier being in wave 1 of the full marathon before the chaos starts. the finish was a total shitshow though.\n\nMe too. She didn’t say it was shuttle bus or the ttc shes taking. There were also 30 portapotties near the baggage drop off area, which was stated on the website.\n\nI thought it was fine. There were like 30 porta potties diagonally across young shepherd center near the baggage drop off area. The worst part was the narrow bridge around the 37km mark of the marathon course. The bridge was literally shaking noticeably from all the runners. They should have also made some distinctions between people who opted in or opted out (green bib option) for the medal. Cuz i heard that they ran out of medals to give.\n\nMore than half of the complaints in the article could be blamed on the TTC and/or not planning for an earlier arrival. The race has problems and areas where it can/should improve, but come on. I ran the half. Had no issue with using the ample porta potties, had time to warm up on the side streets and run some drills, found space in my corral. \n\nThe post race area was a shit show - but again - that was due to literally looting at the finish line last year. So they added security and restricted access to the finish area. \n\nSome people just want to bitch.\n\nI thought the drop bag loading could have been a bit more organized; everyone was just swarming the trucks. \n\nPost-race was dreadful. I finished the half fairly early on and got my medal/drinks/snacks, but my friends who finished 15-20 minutes later only got water.\n\nThe exit out of the QEB was a shitshow as well. Tons of spectators crowding the exit and slowing down traffic to a crawl. It took me 8 minutes to walk a 20 meter stretch beside the finish line.\n\nAnytime I run a race downtown Toronto, I either take transit super early and/or park far away from the event and use the couple of km as a warmup. Not to mention hitting bathrooms further away. \n\n\nThis is good practice for any major event downtown, I'm guessing in most major cities.\n\nI second this sentiment.  I ran the marathon and had a great time.  Loved the course.  Showed up at the start line at 7:15am found the ports potties no problem.  Start line was as it always is.   The finish line just needs to be wider.\n\nAgreed\n\nAgreed. Ran the marathon 9 years ago. That last 15 k has always been on trails open to the public. And no medals? Boohoo. What are you, 6?\n\nWow.. that's a lot of bad things. How sad.\n\nThis was the first organized running event I took part in-- did the full marathon, since I didn't have anything to compare it to I didn't think it was that bad. But good to know there are ones that will run smoother\n\nYou should try the Mississauga Marathon. It was really well organized! My friends and I did it and we had a blast.\n\nAbsolutely awful organization and embarrassment for the city. You’d think after the disgrace last year they would have gotten their act together but looks like they’ve doubled down on it to become a caricature of themselves. Even transferring a bib was an administrative nightmare that could have been done online but for some reason needed to be done in person, where it mandated a 30 minute wait to complete an online form… completely non sensical organization team. They should be embarrassed to do this every single year. Agree with everyone who is telling the city to revoke the permit from these clowns\n\nI ran the full marathon this past weekend. After reading not so good reviews of years past, I came prepared with water, race fuel and arrived early. My experience was quite different than that of the author.  I had no issues with access to washrooms, and the water stations were exceptionally good. The start line was easily accessible and no different than anything I expected. As for them running out of 1/2 marathon medals, I imagine that’s due to all of the last minute changes from participants. Overall I think that the event was well organized.\n\nI saw some people on twitter talking about this but all their experiences were positive\n\nThis event is a complete shit show every year.\n\nPoorly managed.  It's a very amateur organization.  Not nearly as organized as the fall Toronto waterfront marathon event.\n\nIt's operated by Running First \n\nRunning First Ltd.\nPO Box 1240\nUxbridge, ON L9P 1N5\n\nI ran it as my first full and honestly was pleasantly surprised after what I had read online. The start was a little chaotic for the size of the race, but I started on time and enjoyed the course. I used the restrooms inside the shopping center, on the lower level, and had plenty of time. I had brought my own water because of what I had read about the aid stations, but they all seemed to have water/powerade when I ran by them. When I finished (4:14:xx) the finish line wasn't too crazy- I got handed a medal right away and water, didn't bother seeing if there were more snacks in there.\n\nThis was the first marathon or organized event I ever ran so I have no reference to how these things should function. Only real complaint I have is bathrooms at the start were non existent I was waiting in McDonald’s and missed the start, the first water station was very bad. Everything else was pretty straight forward was able to grab water at every other station easily, route was easy to follow was able to get a bottle at the end after finishing the full, didn’t wait around for anything else just left so can’t comment on that. Overall fun event.\n\nI ran the half last year and did it again this year. They did a better job this time but I can only say it was acceptable. The three things they absolutely must fix for next year:\n\n1. Start on time and fix the damn speakers. We were standing in the cold rain for at least 10-15 minutes. I couldn't understand anything the guy was saying on mic. He just kept yapping and all I wanted to tell him was to shut the hell up and start the damn race.\n\n2. Post race is still a shitshow. No water, no medals, just standing in line to get inside where everything is. Even when you enter, it's like a maze. Luckily, I got my medal and water but I read they ran out of medals. This happened last year too smh.\n\n3. Non participants walking and crossing the course. I had to dodge a few people crossing. Don't forget the incoming traffic and some cars actually attempting to drive out of their apartments and onto the course. Unbelievable. \n\nIt's like night and day when comparing this to the waterfront race. Also, the race shirts are so oddly shaped.\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/cancel-toronto-marathon-due-to-unsafe-conditions-for-runners?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaa7wp_2JYF-3NzYSPeyQS25brk8qpal3cZ9WNAEIplyv0caTJqiQtxhDJE_aem_Afr1JkusqPsZpyqn2k1LwfR5kiDfKuyJfK6mf55OM-03UILCpFD5yTisAzuEknKnlnDSe7IDtsZl8ZKkqeAfk_sZ\n\nDrake curse"

I really enjoyed getting an email letting me know race day was soon a few weeks ago.\n\nIve never even entered the lottery and I just got an email from them congratulating me for running Chicago and where to purchase my race photos.\n\nThey have no clue how to segment their list lol.\n\nI enjoyed every single one of the Berlin updates I got for a race I wasn't going to run\n\nSeriously! Those emails were just salt in the wound after finding out I had a single digit chance of getting in.\n\n😂 this is my first time entering and I know I'm gonna be low key crushed when I don't get selected\n\nSometimes you get first timer luck. I entered NYC in 2018 and got in, it was my first time trying.\n\nFirst time luck is real. I applied for my first marathon lottery last year and ended up running Tokyo '24\n\nI got in my first time I tried for Chicago! Good luck!\n\nI just finished a C25K plan and was joking to myself that I'd enter the marathon lottery for a laugh since I wouldn't be selected anyway, but now I definitely won't be doing that! Save my first timer luck for when I'm actually prepared!\n\nsame!!!\n\nI got in my first time and ran this year.\n\nI got in my first time, so who knows? Of course, every other race has been a polite rejection. You don't know until you try.\n\nApparently Chicago has the best odds right?\n\nIt’s my 5th time entering, so the odds have definitely not been in my favor. Lots of majors this year are hitting record registration numbers as well.\n\nI ran it this year.  Honestly not worth it.  My local race was more fun and didn't cost &gt;$3k including travel.   Chicago was well organized, but there's no way to make it streamlined for 50,000+ runners. \n\nOof 3k?? Are hotels that expensive? I live close enough to drive but im assuming that cost is both flights and hotels?\n\nHotels in the city were outrageous even six months out. I highly recommend to anyone who’s traveling for it, book that shit as soon as you can once you confirm you’re running it.\n\nbook fully refundable before the results come out\n\nThat’s not a bad idea.\n\nThis is why I am grateful to have college friend that lives in Chicago now\n\nYes, it was about $380/ night after taxes via the marathon partner travel program and that was a good rate.  Eating out and other activities was the rest.  It could be about $1.5-2k if you just 100% focus on the race and skip any sightseeing time. \n\nNo idea why you're being so downvoted! This is a valuable perspective to consider while everyone is getting caught with marathon major fever. A lot of people do one of these as their first marathon.\n\nI've seen complaints about Berlin, Chicago, Amsterdam, etc being over-crowded this year, and it's not a bad idea to suggest that folks consider many other non-major races the world has to offer.\n\nI say this as someone who signed up for the Chicago lottery and kind of regretted it when I saw all the add-ons they charge for and realized it may not be fun to bump elbows the entire time.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, I believe Chicago was essentially 50/50 odds of getting in. I’m sure those odds have gotten worse post covid but it’s the same for all the Majors; so I still think Chicago is the “most likely” to get accepted in the lottery out of the 6 majors.\n\nMaybe before pandemic. \n\nSame!\n\nsame\n\nSo how does it work? You pay $250 just for a chance??? Or if you don’t get selected they don’t charge you?\n\nThey charge you when you get accepted only\n\nlol me to friend\n\nExpecting to get shut out of Berlin and Chicago, or have to run Berlin, Chicago, and NYC all in 5 weeks!\n\nI was thinking of applying for Berlin as well but was thinking on the off chance I got in for all three, I would be dead lol. When does the NYC non guaranteed open for 2025?\n\nI'm in for 2025 with 9+1, so maybe I would defer if I wasn't 100%. Would definitely do both Chicago and Berlin as those would be my first time.\n\nYou’re so lucky you can do the 9+1. I live in Canada and am planning a move to NYC so until then it wouldn’t be feasible to submit for the 9+1 as a non resident. But rooting for you!! Hope we both get in for Chicago!\n\nFingers crossed for you!\n\nI've also entered into Berlin &amp; Chicago for next year. If i miraculously get into both (which i highly doubt) at least its only 1 training cycle?\n\nIs the Berlin lottery still open? Their web page confused me.\n\nyes\n\nSame! Berlin would be my 3rd star if I get in. But I’m 0/1 on the Berlin lottery, 0/3 on the Chicago lottery. Don’t love those odds but who knows\n\nI got into Berlin and Chicago this year (via lotto) and ran the Dublin marathon to maintain my guaranteed entry.... it was 3 marathons in 31 days. All on one training cycle! Tapering, while recovering is a craft I've yet to fully master, but got faster in every single one\n\nI left my 2025 marathons up to fate. Signed up for Berlin and Vhicago lotteries. Got Berlin (which I wasn't expecting), still waiting for Chicago. Is it safe to assume if I haven't received an email yet that I didn't get it? (Posting this midday on the 12th). \n\nJust got the rejection.\n\nThe $250 fee is only charged if get selected right?\n\nPeople usually find out the results from their bank faster than the acceptance emails lol\n\nI have my credit card (Amex) set up to notify me of any \"card not present\" transactions. Good for fraud detection, great for lottery results.\n\nYep!\n\nIs that for international registrations too? I populated everything and then exited because I assumed otherwise 🙄\n\nYes\n\ncorrect\n\nIt's strange this isn't way more clear on their site (I had the question)\n\nIt’s taken me many hours of googling to find this thread for clarity!\n\nWas that $40 insurance few unnecessary? I thought I had to pay that to get my registration back if I don’t get in.\n\nInsurance is for if you get in, but then can’t run the race. You only get charged if you get in.\n\nGot approved through the time qualification application within 15 minutes. So much more efficient than Boston.\n\nLast year I entered the lottery by mistake, when I meant to enter by time qualification. If it seems too easy, make sure you didn't do the same...\n\nOuch! I made sure to go through the time qualification prompt.\n\nIt was for the best, I have my first NYC but I wanted to speedrun the Abbott drawing (BOS-CHI-NY). I got picked in the general for Tokyo next year so no complaints.\n\nThat's awesome -- congrats!\n\nToday? Wow I submitted guaranteed and haven’t heard back yet.\n\nHave you run it before?\n\nYeah, in 2023.\n\nAh that makes sense! So cool how fast it is!\n\nHas anyone who deferred this year gotten the email about claiming guaranteed entry yet?\n\nGot my email at 11:12.  Currently crying over paying the fee again but hey, get to run it next year!\n\nGot mine about 30 mins ago from distance series\n\nStill anxiously waiting to receive that email haha\n\nGot mine this morning about 10 minutes after entries opened.\n\n[deleted]\n\nOne tip from a local is that if you get accepted, book a hotel with a refundable rate as soon as humanly possible. Hotels for the marathon weekend fill incredibly fast and while there's an option to coordinate through the marathon, you have a lot more flexibility booking on your own.\n\nWhat about the car situation? I'd likely be driving in and city parking can be a nightmare.\n\nEither find a hotel with parking available, park at one of the long term airport lots and take the train downtown ($15/day) or use the app SpotHero to find spots. I'd highly advise against bringing a car if you can avoid it but SpotHero is pretty solid. Some people also drive to the most accessible Amtrak or Metra station and park in those lots when staying downtown. If you're staying downtown you absolutely do not need to bring a car into the city, but I understand if you're driving into town you need somewhere to put it. If you don't want to pay hotel rates for parking, I'd really consider dumping your car somewhere outside the city like the airport lots for the weekend.\n\nOkay. We have friends outside the city (fox river area). So possible they can drive us in for a hotel (they hate going into the city though). Unless there's a decent way into the city that area on race morning? The few public transit routes I've looked at seem to be a multi hour trip which would be....sub optimal...to to the race that early.\n\nFox River would be kinda far and the traffic marathon morning is insane\n\nYeah that's pretty far. I'd probably get a hotel in the city and leave the car at your friend's place if possible.\n\nAt least I can tell my wife I have a concept of a plan if I manage to get in!\n\nI live close enough to Chicago to drive there sometimes and have great luck with the parking apps.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'd just get off at Union Station unless you're staying in the burbs. It's really the only Amtrak station in the city proper.\n\nMe, tonight after dinner: you know, I think I just need to take a step back from running. I feel like I'm having a hard time doing strength and the number of hours per week running, maybe I should take on less miles and lift more in the winter this year\n\nMe, two hours later seeing this posted: oh fuck yeah\n\nHave the non-guaranteed applications opened too? I don't see a link for that yet.\n\nEdit: The site has been updated! Fingers crossed!\n\nBerlin 2025 and Chicago 2025 signup completed! This time i can add an actual marathon time (woohoo!)\n\ncan't wait to be 0/5 on the draw lol\n\nIs Berlin lottery still open? I couldn’t figure out where to enter\n\nYup. Registration deadline is 11/21\n\nhttps://www.bmw-berlin-marathon.com/en/registration/registration-information\n\nWow the website is very bad on mobile\n\nDo you need to buy cancellation insurance if you’re not buying anything beyond the registration for the lottery?\n\nsame! hopefully I hear good news today!\n\nAnyone from outside the US applying? It keeps asking me for a State &amp; Zip Code, which I don't have!\n\nDid you select the right country? I’m just saying this because I was in the same situation and realized I had US selected as the country\n\nMake sure you select \"Non-US\" at the very beginning\n\n[deleted]\n\nAnd a random state?\n\n[deleted]\n\nChicago is faster/easier than NYC, so that's probably the right approach. Especially with the abbreviated recovery window between.\n\nI did that a few years back, LOVED the back-to-back experience. I actually knocked 9 minutes off my time! Make sure to prioritize recovery between the races and I would recommend picking one to push hard in instead of both. If the weather is right, Chicago is easier to stretch your legs and the crowds are incredible\n\nI did it last year and will again this year. Last year I ran 2:52 in Chicago and tried to break 3 at NY (ran 3:04) but bonked around 18. I took terrible care of my body after Chicago. I think the double is super doable. Keep it light the weeks in-between. I love Chicago (I live there) for racing purposes and the crowds are great, but nothing compares to NYC.\n\nDoing it again this year but running NYC with a friend who is around 3:50 pace. So I’m really going to enjoy this one.\n\nJust put in for my guaranteed entry for next year! Had to cancel 2024 due to some stress reactions in my tibias. Really hoping 2025 is gonna be my year. It’ll be my first marathon, doing it as part of their athletes with impairments program. Husband is coming along for the ride as my support runner :)\n\nDid you get an email from Chicago Marathon? I had mine deferred from the hurricane destroying our home and I haven't received anything\n\nYes I did around 11:10am eastern. But my deferral was for a different reason so I wonder if maybe you need to reach out?\n\nI did thank you\n\nLooking forward to my fourth rejection! I know so many people that get in first try….:shrug:\n\nI had a friend last year that wasn’t even really a runner that put in for Chicago on a whim and of course got in\n\nWhat are the odds for Chicago?\n\nIf you're an influencer then it's pretty decent imo\n\nUsually between 40-50%. Might be higher for 2025 due to the new qualifying times.\n\nIm annoyed. Philly 2024 is after the period so I won’t have a guaranteed time.\n\nAbout the time qualifier... I ran a qualifying time last week. Does that mean you get in 100% or is it still a lottery against others with qualifying times?\n\nGuaranteed entry with qualifying time, including in this year's Chicago.\n\nWell I’m doing MCM this weekend because Chicago rejected me last December, what will I sign up for when they reject me this December?nobody knows, maybe CIM? Any other big (as in fun crowds, lots of participants etc.) fall marathons with a guaranteed entry?\n\nI have run Corning Wineglass and Philadelphia and would recommend both of them. (NYC this, Chicago or Berlin next year).\n\ni’m doing MCM too!! best of luck this weekend :)\n\nDid you get your “e card” for bib pickup. I haven’t received one and am nervous.\n\nEdit: I went to Haku and realized I signed up with a different email. We’re all good. Good luck!\n\ni did but they also said in the email you can use license for bib pick up\n\nWell with the new qualifying times being as hard or harder than a BQ, I suspect there will be a lot more lottery slots.\n\nI somehow got in my first year in 2021, no luck since.  Keeping the positive thoughts, good luck everyone!\n\nSame for me in 2019. No luck since.\n\nJust applied for non-guaranteed entry today!  If I don’t get in, which charities are recommended to run for?\n\nWaiting on results like 🫣🫣🫣\n\nLast time I ran it in 2016 there wasn’t a lottery, so I’m new to this cliffhanger. Is there usually a time when they inform us?\n\nHopefully me saying this will be my first marathon will have the lottery balls bounce in my favor\n\nIs it possible to register for Chicago, and then register for NY only after getting rejected? I would like to register for both, but I'm not tough enough to run both of them in case I somehow get selected for both.\n\nYes. NYC lottery registration opens a few months after Chicago lottery results are announced. Good luck!\n\nI believe you can defer Chicago but not NY, so if you get picked in both run NY then Chicago the next year (you end up paying Chicago twice).\n\nWoohoo!! Looking forward to my second Abbott Majors rejection!!\n\nJust got the notice that I got accepted (guaranteed time entry). Amazed at how quickly they processed that.\n\nWell, anybody seen an email come through yet?\n\nEdit: just got my “not selected” email\n\nStill waiting! 🫣🫣🫣\n\nNothing here.\n\nNothing yet!!\n\nNothing yet. But heard our CMO saying \"I will be running Chicago marathon next year\" on a call this morning. Not sure if she got the email already or she's guranteed or charity. \n\nDoh! Got a rejection email!\n\nWont let me pick a shirt size so i cant register. Will check back later!\n\nI have the same problem! Did you find a solution? Thanks!\n\nChicago doesn't have the balls to accept me. They are threatened.\n\nthey only take the money if you are selected right? it’s not a hold on the card?\n\nCorrect\n\nPatiently waiting for my Chicago Distance Series email\n\nGood luck everyone! Just applied\n\nHey! I tried to fill the form for the lottery and got stuck in the shirt size...\n\nLooking to run this for a charity. Does anyone know how the application process works for that? Do I sign up and select which charity I want to run for and hope they have room? Any advice is helpful!\n\nhttps://www.chicagomarathon.com/get-involved/charity-teams/ \n\n\nClick on 'charity index'.\n\n\nPick from the list.  \n\n\nSome let you sign up online. Some require phone or email.\n\nDo the “qualifying time” standards automatically get you in if you’re even 1 second under, or is there a buffer below the qualifying time if too many people apply (like in Boston?) sorry if this is common knowledge/dumb Q lol\n\nI wouldn't think so. If they have more people qualifying than they anticipated, they would just take less people from the lottery. They are experienced at this and they will have prediction models to give a good idea of the people entering.\n\nEntered the lottery! This will be my first marathon if I get in. Chicago is my hometown, this has been on my list for a long time. \n\nAnd now to read up on odds…👀\n\nWoohoo!! I just sent in my pre-rejection application 🙃\n\nHey! I can't finish the form since the shirt size part doesn't show any size... anyone with the same problem?\n\nIts amazing and positive how popular the big and not so big marathons are now - Dingle marathon (whihcI ran this year) here in Ireland opened and was sold out in one day this year.   Valenica next for me and that was nearly a full time job to get a place in after missing the entry window as as for most marathons you enter 12 months out and you have no clue if even interested then and of course the potential for  i-n-j-u-r-y as well.\n\nBut glass half full running has never been more popular so all good.\n\nYes! Yay! I entered yesterday. Good luck everyone!\n\nWill they charge now? What if the lottery is rejected?\n\nOnly charge if you’re accepted\n\nThank you\n\nI’m entered\n\nAny marathon lotteries (besides Berlin) allow for a couple (or more) to register together.\n\nDecided to go the charity route so I can be sure I get in. Here’s hoping I stay injury free until next year 😅\n\nThanks for this great community \nDidn’t register for Chicago, went straight for Berlin \nFingers crossed, 12mo hardcore training if I’m accepted\n\nI applied for Berlin and Chicago. My luck is weird. I might get into both first time or have to wait 10 years to get in to either.\n\nHi everyone, I'm trying to enter my cell phone number to register for the Chicago Marathon Lottery....but I just can't understand how they want the cell number🤷‍♀️😫!!!\nSomeone kind enough to give me the information 🙏🙏🙏??? \nThank you 🤩\n\nIs registration closed already u/tellar8 ? online it says registration runs until today but I can see any apply link on the page.\n\nI see the banner:\n\n2025 Bank of America Chicago Marathon applications: The general application for guaranteed and non-guaranteed entries to the 2025 Bank of America Chicago Marathon is now closed.\n\nIt’s closed\n\nJust got accepted, God is good.\n\nWell done ! By mail ?\n\nUntil when do they send the invites? Do we still have a chance?\n\nI was wondering the same.\n\nGot the acceptance email! 12:12pm est\n\nWhat’s your last name initial?? I wonder if it is alphabetical\n\nIt's B, it could be alphabetical! good luck!\n\nGood question!! Mine is an S and I've not heard yes or no.\n\nJust got my rejection letter!   I hope this is really random,  but I doubt it.  They can admit anyone they want.\n\nTake off the tinfoil hat\n\nWhat is the qualifying times for 45m and do you have a link to then lottery?  It’s worth a shot?  Thanks (:\n\nThis is dumb."

    "body": "I love to run long distances, especially at a (for me) slow pace. I follow a training plan and usually do 1 interval and 1 tempo run per week. I usually run 6 times per week and the rest of my runs are easy runs. \n\nI have no issues when an easy run is scheduled, I don‘t care if I have to run 25K… as long as I can run at my slow pace. Whenever an intervall or tempo run pops up I get nervous and I have to force myself to do the workout. I‘m afraid of failing. I don‘t know why I put so much pressure on myself when it comes to running. I know it‘s ridiculous and I keep telling myself it‘s just a hobby and I won‘t qualify for the next Olympics - although I would love to! 😆\n\nI told myself my entire life that I can’t run fast and this got stuck in my 🧠.

I think speed stuff is supposed to be tough.   \n\nI don't look forward to them either because i know that i will be pushing myself and its going to be hard and uncomfortable.   but that's how you get results i suppose.\n\nExactly! And that’s why I keep doing speed workouts. It‘s a struggle from the beginning to the end though.\n\nAre you saying you hate speed workouts because they're soul-destroying torture sessions (which lots of people feel), or you don't mind the workout and are just worried that you won't make your times (which is the first time I've heard that)?\n\nI don’t enjoy speed workouts but wouldn’t say that I hate them because I know how important they are. \nBut before every session there is that fear inside of me that I will not make the times. For example when I have an interval session with 8 repeats, nail 7 out of the 8 but don‘t hit the target pace in 1 I will finish the run telling myself I failed the whole workout. I know it is stupid and ridiculous and makes no sense at all but that’s the way I think…\n\nThis might be fluff, but I mean it sincerely -- *just by the fact that you're out there, you succeeded*!  I mean, you *could* stay home, sit on the couch, and destroy a bag of Fritos instead, ya know?\n\nI say this as an experienced runner who still feels that anxiety you describe, even when the speed workout is stuff I've done before.  You're good, and keep on truckin', and try not to let all that get into your head too much.\n\nCan you maybe change your training to other metrics, like perceived effort or heart rate?\n\nBut I understand the struggle. While I run fairly casually, I follow a plan for lifting, and it annoys me if I have to reduce the weight I lift on a day because I have an off-day.\n\nI get it Miss G.\n\nPersonally, I set goals I know I can reach. For example, once a week I run a \"fast for me\" 5k where I want every mile to be sub 8, which is hard but I know I can do it. I'll keep that goal until that one special day comes around when I'm feeling pretty good and I'm able to run 2 of the 3 miles sub 7:30... now that's my new goal. Rinse and repeat.\n\nSo basically, I manage my goals to make sure they're achievable and I progress at my own pace \\~I'm not trying to make the olympic team here. I still feel dread because the workout is hard, so I'm not sure if this approach would be helpful or not.\n\nHave a great day and happy running!\n\nI subscribe to the idea that if you're working at your absolute limit, you'll more than likely fail the last rep and that's OK. If you know you couldn't have gone any harder then you did a great job!\n\nHey OP, the thing to remember about many of these workouts is that they are designed to push you close to failure. Sometimes they will get the best of you, and sometimes you will nail them. It’s part of both the mental challenge, and ensuring your training load is adequate to get your body to make the right adaptations. It sounds like you’re training right! When I do a particularly hard interval or tempo, I mentally remind myself that the point of this effort is to be tough and make me tougher. but I’m tough too and I can meet the effort. If I can’t meet the effort I chalk it up to one of those runs that doesn’t go my way, and look forward to the next.\n\nTrue that! If I nailed every workout my training wouldn’t be adequate. It‘s part of the game. That‘s something I really need to remind myself…\n\nI am right there with you. I did a tempo run today and missed my goal pace by about 15 seconds 🫤 I really did feel like a failure until reading your post and these comments. Running at all is a success and a celebration of our bodies. \n\n\nEdit: typo take instead of really\n\nWe should be more proud of ourselves! 💕\n\nYes, Comfortably uncomfortable  hahah\n\nYep! This is 100% me. Hours of long, slow running? No prob! 8x400m @ threshold? 🤢\n\nI call it « taking the medicine that is good for me ». It might taste like shit, but if I wanna get better…\n\nIf 8x400 at threshold is really hard, maybe you’re going out a lot faster than your threshold? Probably your workout is fine, as these would typically done at ~1mi race pace, and it should be hard, and usually faster than VO2max even. \n\nbut it’s maybe not what most people would understand as “threshold”, which is usually 30-60 mins of “comfortably” hard running broken up into several chunks with some rest in between.\n\nThat's how I feel as well. I do 12x400m and it's killer. I do hill runs on the treadmill if the weather is poor. Start flat going up to 6% incline then back down to flat. Can't even finish the last 400. \n\n\nI have noticed I'm substantially more relaxed running for longer after 2 months of doing hill sprints.\n\nA little bit, but I actually really enjoy intervals and speed sessions. It might be because I was a sprinter back in high school. I feel like I get into a far more natural gait when I'm running at those paces. It feels freeing and powerful to go fast.\n\n100% agree with you. I used to absolutely hate running (no real athletic background), but got more into it last year and started doing speed sessions. I realized they make running more fun for me -- being able to blast it at really fast paces is a great change of pace vs steady runs, and since they're super quantitative it's a great way to measure your improvements over time (without having to do a full race).\n\nFor me, I equate them to trying to hit new PRs on weightlifting (which I'd been doing for years) -- the competition with yourself is what makes it interesting. The main problem I struggle with is going out too hard, which makes the later intervals a struggle. Need to get more disciplined about what my capabilities really are and not stretch too far.\n\nSame - I’m new to running and running slow feels awful to me but I can’t run very far if I try to run a pace that feels natural to me. So speed runs are a break from that dilemma lol. \n\nI live for easy runs that won’t break my body and absolutely dread anything resembling a speed workout, particularly in the summertime. This summer has been particularly tough with little injury issues and aches and pains, but the thought of having to run at max effort or close to it while also having to deal with hot temps is always tough to overcome. Can’t wait for the fall and cooler weather. Hoping that’ll help motivate me to kick up my training a little!\n\nTrue that! The heat doesn’t make it easier. I live and work in Japan and it‘s super humid there. I tried to follow my training plan and stick to the paces but failed nearly every speed session until I finally adjusted the paces. That was super frustrating!\n\nI get that. I’m a stickler for following my training plan to the T, but sometimes it’s better to make adjustments to the conditions, whether it be listening to your own body or dealing with less than ideal weather.\n\nSounds like the paces were indeed too high. To become a better runner it is best to train at the level you are currently at, not at the level you strive to be.\n\nI feel this comment so hard.\n\nI did once a 1 km PB (4:02.1) with &gt; 40 C heat index, my heart rate skyrocketed to 205, never again.\n\nPersonally, I find speed runs fun, especially the tempo runs. I like to “run till the wheels fall off”. That way, I know where my limits are. And they’re fun because every now and then, I make it past my old limit and set a new one. For me, it’s not failing if I can’t hold a certain pace for a certain distance- it’s just learning what the limit is.\n\nI love your mindset and I‘m working on mine to get there because I think that‘s how it should be. Sometimes I go out of the door and tell myself to give it all but I actually never really do it. No idea why.\n\nI just started mixing in intervals ~3 months ago. Going into one of those, I never feel like I'm going to succeed. What works for me, is I tell myself that doing anything is better than nothing and to go out and just do 1 or 2 intervals. When I'm doing it, before the interval, I tell myself to just go as long as I can, and it will be the last one if I can't do it. During the interval, I just focus on finishing the next 200m.\n\nSo far, I have completed the workouts, but it is hard!\n\nGreat mentality to have, getting in any speed work even just a couple of intervals is still much better than not doing any\n\nI started making a one mile distance into a speed training session. I first just ran a mile in a time I knew I could do it. Then the next week increased the pace (on the treadmill) by a just little… .1/.2/.3 to see what my true pace was. I kept getting a faster time and it was rewarding and then eventually a  bit challenging but in a good way. \n\nAfter the mile I walk and then try to do another sprint for half a mile, walk and another sprint for a quarter mile. And similarly increasing the speeds of those the next week. I jot my times down in my notes on my phone to see progress and that motivates me!\n\nA mile can be very long when you try to race it! 😅\nWriting down the times is a great idea. It visualizes the progress which I sometimes just don‘t see…\n\nFor me is the other way around, I love going fast, I love trying to surpass someone if is running in from of me, that's why usually if I'm doing 15k, for example, I end up going above my normal rhythm (5:30 min/km), with that one I can run without getting tired for long time, however, as soon as I'm reaching 10K when I see my pace (with strava) and I see that I can do the 10k in less than 50 min I speed up the last kilometers, and end up not doing the 15 but 10K.\n\n  \nI would suggest to try to look more at your pace gamify it and running with high tempo music, I almost feel it like a game where I want to to go in a close number rhythm, and then go to the next one (start with 5:15, then 5:10, then 5:00, etc)\n\nThanks for the tip with the music, I‘ll put a playlist together, it‘s worth a try!\nI actually tend to slow down at the end of my run, thinking „it will be over soon anyway“. It‘s very difficult for me to push myself through. Although once I finished the workout I‘m angry with myself why I did hold back.\n\nI struggle with this mindset too. I hardly ever do speedwork but sometimes I'll cut my run short and later I'll be so mad at myself. it helps me (a bit) to forcefully remind myself in the moment of exactly that. \"keep going – you WILL be glad you did this later.\" it's always true!\n\nThat‘s very true. Afterwards it‘s always like „I‘m so happy I did it“.\n\nI second making a playlist just for speedwork. It helps with mindset and as a bonus, you can incorporate some of those songs into your race day playlist for later in the race when you need a boost. \n\nAlso, it helps me to not slow down in my speedwork when I think about the last intervals or the last bits of a speed workout as the most important parts. Like I remind myself that I just did 7 400s to get my body to number 8, and pushing in number 8 is where I have the opportunity to make the most gains. So when I’m getting ready for that last interval I think to myself that I just worked so hard to create this opportunity to get stronger, let’s go.\n\nI like to do math shenanigans when I'm finishing my race, if there's x distance left and I'm able to do it in 5 min let's try to do it in 4:50, or something like that. It's more fun than it seems\n\nThat’s something I really need to work on!!\n\nNot a good runner in any way shape of form but what helps for me is doing it on a treadmill. It helps me maintain the speed since I just have to follow the speed of the machine. Maybe that would help you?\n\nI actually tried to run on a treadmill the past 3 days. It is easier when it comes to maintaining a pace but I do prefer to run outside!\n\nI'm right there with ya, except my anxiety about speed has nothing to do with being worried about my performance (I love distance, don't care how slow/fast I am) but because something about the speed makes me really anxious. I actually think it's a very primitive/unconscious sort of thing, the pounding heart and bounding down the street full speed makes me feel like there's some sort of danger or like I'm running away from something? Lol anyway, it makes me feel very much on edge. It lasts for several hours after the run, too. Go figure.\n\nOh that makes sense too! Your brain probably thinks why is the body moving so fast there must be something dangerous going on! \nOnce I started the workout I‘m fine, it’s more what’s going on in my head until I get out the door…\n\n[deleted]\n\nI do.  I did a few months long speed challenges with a group last year.  Easy runs, I was out the door and enjoying myself.  Speedwork days, I had a few extra cups of coffee, watched tv for a bit longer, opted to walk the dog first… anything that would postpone the workout.  \nI’ve never found a way to think differently 😔\n\nThis is exactly what I meant!! Looking for excuses and trying to postpone the workout. Although I love running. I sometimes feel so nervous like I was in Highschool before an exam. 🫣\n\nFor me, it's before long runs. I get so nervous Friday nights before long runs, almost every time. I don't know why, but it is a source of anxiety for me that ends as soon as I step outside to actually start the run.\n\nOh I love my long runs. But speedwork… I look at intervals and paces days before the workout is scheduled… multiple times a day… trying to convince myself I can do it.\n\nI wish I were good at easy runs like most here. I dread long runs but I’m getting better. On the other hand, I highly enjoy intervals. This probably has to do with the fact that I’ve played soccer all my life so I’m not used to running long distances.\n\nMakes sense! The only intervals I (sometimes) enjoy are very short ones. It‘s easier for me to push myself when I know it will be over soon.\n\nFor me long runs at a slow pace are uncomfortable. Interesting how we are all different. Just gotta lean into the discomfort and build up a tolerance.\n\nIt‘s super interesting! Tbh I thought runs at a slow pace aren’t uncomfortable for anyone!\n\nIt’s mentally uncomfortable as I have to consciously slow myself down and deal with some boredom.\n\nI love my long run. And I’ll do hills all day, but speed work on flat terrain? Not my cup of tea🤣\n\nHills are my worst enemy. I only need to see a hill and my heart rate goes up like crazy. 😆\n\nIt’s the other way around for me lol. \nLong runs are slow and torturous and my calves feel like they’re dying. \nDuring tempo runs and intervals I feel like I’m flying through the air and I’m actually making progress to my health.\n\nIt‘s so funny how different we all are! I wished I felt like flying - I feel more like dying. 😆\n\nFor me it is other way around. Intervals? Great! Treshold? Even better! Strides? Yeah lets go! Zone 2? Feeling good? Zone1? Why life is so hard? Long run in zone 1? Miserable. At least I am doing a lot of strides, while running easy runs. This at least makes my life managable.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes, I'm dreading feeling bad and dreading the ongoing desire to just give up or not reach my goals due to mental rather than physical weakness. On a long slow run, you just keep going and at worst you get bored and a little sore. During a long speed workout you really have to push yourself and mentally I struggle with it. There's a massive gap between my PRs and my watch's \"predicted race times\" that I think comes down entirely to some kind of mental tenacity through suffering I haven't cracked yet. I just don't like being out of breath!\n\nThis is SO me!! 😆 I would love to be able to push myself more… I think that‘s the key for me to progress…\n\nI love the long runs. I think my issue with speed runs is that they don't give me the relief of a long run. Long runs help me so much with regulating emotions and just in general my body feels such a sense of satisfaction after it. With speed runs I feel super challenged and can even enjoy parts of it. Especially when I make progress. But it doesn't give me the same aftermath.\n\nI feel the same. I am proud when I nail a speed session but it‘s not as satisfying as a long run!\n\nSupersets keep me awake at night.\n\nOddly, speed workouts on track I revel in, but on road ones provoke butterflies\n\nI would love to run on a track sometimes because I envision it would help me to do my speed workouts but unfortunately have no tracks near me where I live in Japan.\n\nI'd do intervals and tempo every day if I could. But my body would break. \n\nI used to do two interval sessions each week but kept getting injured and I was constantly stiff and sore.\n\nAs a guy who has been really doing 80/20 easy runs (really easy), I live for the 20% days. ESPECIALLY once I found a track. Going a doing intervals on a track is way better than some random path or parking lot. It just doesn't feel as goofy, and running on a track is a lot softer on my feet (especially  with the fast pace).\n\nI'm the complete opposite, I look forward to the intervals/tempo runs but my next long run is 18 miles and it's going to be a slog\n\nCan we switch? You do my intervals and I do your long run? 😆🙌🏻\n\nlol literally did that today. Knew I had a speed workout and only did about half. The anxiety was real today, for non-running things.\n\nI bet you never feel bad about a hard interval session once it's done though?\n\nThat's how the group I run with psych ourselves up for a session, and each interval we congratulate each other for ticking it off.\n\nEven solo efforts I feel great afterwards for getting it done.\n\nI just finished my track session. You’re supposed to hate them. It’s the pain cave. It makes you better at suffering. Be thankful for that discomfort- it makes you better.\n\nSpeed workouts are timed and by definition measured. It’s like taking a test at school.\n\nAnd it feels exactly like this…\n\nI used to be part of a coached running group. Every 8 weeks we would run a timed 3k for best time. Then the next 7 week track workouts were calculated from that 3k time. Loved it. Took all of the guess work out of it and I always treated each time to hit as a do or die. I was never sure what formula he used to calculate those intervals but perhaps something you could find. It may take some of the stress away in determining how fast to go.\n\nI think this is entirely normal. It is because you are 'performing' for speed runs rather than just 'turning up' for easy runs. There is no fear of failing to 'perform' on an easy run because you are just getting the mileage done. For speed workouts, you definitely will be checking your splits and looking for signs of progress. That breeds anxiety (which is also good for performance, generally).\n\nLiterally every time\n\nYou are not alone. I DREAD speed workouts. I am not a fast runner, and I always have it in my mind as well that if I'm slower than last time, that means I'm failing. I'm getting better at learning that that is not true, and the guided runs on the Nike Run App help me tremendously with that. I'm my worst critic. This time last year, I could not run a mile without stopping. I just signed up for my first half marathon yesterday. I just want to finish. \nI know speed runs work bc I am progressively getting faster. The results are just slow to see, in my opinion.\n\nI envy people who were born as fast runners. Doesn‘t run in my family for sure. 😅\nI love the half marathon distance! I‘m sure you can do it! 🙌🏻\n\nYeah, the only time people have run in my family is from the law 🫠\nSo I'm excited to do something different. And thank you! I hope to finish. I don't care if it takes me 2-1/2 hours. I just wanna do it. And keep up with the speed runs! You got this!\n\nYup.\n\n  \nWhile they're tough at the time the real issue for me, the same with races, is in the head in the lead up.  I've been putting way to much pressure on individual sessions and \"if I can complete them\".\n\nMy coach has been great in helping my put the right context about this - #1 priority for a race is to enjoy it.  Sessions don't have to be perfect.\n\nI did not enjoy my first half marathon race. I was stressed out before, during and after the race. Couldn’t enjoy running afterwards for a long time. Signed up for another half but didn’t show up. \nI signed up for a full marathon next year and I tell myself every day I want to enjoy this race. I want to finish it feeling good (as good as you can feel after running a marathon).\n\nTaking that view is key - what's the point if you're not enjoying it!\n\nPhily Bowden has been working on this process and talks about it in a few of her recent videos on YT.\n\nYes. It’s good for you. Use the anxiety and adrenaline to run fast\n\nYes, because I have bad memories of balls-to-the-wall, ego-fueled, teenage-hormone-drenched speed workouts from high school. Even now my brain is like, “Oh, we’re at the track? PREPARE FOR PAIN.”\n\nI tell myself when I’m warming up, “Threshold is an effort, not a pace,” or “we’re here to get a VO2max stimulus, the exact pace doesn’t matter.”\n\nI also try to make sure I’m not running speed workouts too hard. I like to feel I could add one more rep at the end if I really had to. It helps calm me down knowing that I’m not completely going to the well in training.\n\nWeirdly it’s the other way for me, I find it incredibly boring and hard to stay slow and keep going on a long/slow run but a speed workout makes the distance and time go by faster\n\nYes.\n\nI get nervous before any run that is going to push me out of my comfort zone… which I’ve learned is kinda the point. I’ve spent the last 12 months consistently on some plan or another, training for various races (a 15k trail race, a half, a 14k road race, and now a 10k), and pushing my distance and pace. \n\nThe biggest challenge for me the whole way has been the mental side. However, I’ve learned that I’m capable of pushing myself harder than I think for much longer than I think, and pushing myself through discomfort and negative thoughts which can hijack my performance. \n\nI’m getting better at controlling the nerves and negative thoughts, and it’s doing me good before races when I used to be a nauseous mess (I’m not even that fast!). I’m still no Olympian (most of us aren’t!), but since I’ve started training like this I get so much fulfilment out of running, and I’m achieving so many small wins.\n\nI would love to get where you are! This is exactly the mindset change I‘m working on!\n\nKeep working at it, but also run your own race and chase your own goals- make it as fun as possible and celebrate your achievements! There will be sucky workouts (either because they’re just hard, or because you’re underfuelled/tired/tight/hormones/ dehydrated/the weathers too warm/the weathers too cold/mercury is in retrograde/ your pet rock died, and so on…), but keep coming back to it and you WILL see improvement. Enjoy your running!\n\nI get nervous before any run that is going to push me out of my comfort zone… which I’ve learned is kinda the point.

You’re welcome 🤗\n\nI use to but not I look forward to them so I can conquer something that I want to makes me feel better when I have to conquer something that I don’t want to\n\nThat‘s how it should be!\n\nI really enjoy speed workouts (I’m not naturally good at them).  There’s a good book that helps called “how bad do you want it” by Matt Fitzgerald\n\nDo you think you could do speed workouts on a treadmill as a way to transition and become more comfortable?  I recognize if you do road races and such or want to improve overall running performance outdoors, you may need to do some of the speed sessions on the track or road.  But, I wonder if some gradual work on a tread would be a good way to get more comfortable in a controlled environment.\n\nI love tread workouts so this may be a huge bias here but just a thought to consider :)\n\nI work and live in Japan currently, in a very rural area, no gym with a treadmill near me. Unfortunately. Especially when it‘s raining cats and dogs I would love to run indoors.\n\nFind a club or running group that does speed training as part of their schedule, as it is so much easier to do speedwork with others rather than on your own. My club does a speed session of some description every Tuesday, and it is the highest-attended thing we do, with literally all ages &amp; standards turning up.\n\nThink of the big picture. If you want to achieve your running goals and get somewhere near your potential, then you simply have to do some fast running, and that was always enough motivation for me. Churning out 6 x 1 mile reps solo on a dark cold wet winter night is never fun, but the big picture was that if I wanted to get anywhere near my marathon target, I knew I had to do it.\n\nTypically for speed stuff I go to the gym so I can set the treadmill, put on a long show, and pretend it's not happening. Haha it's always fine so idk why I worry about it. In some ways I look forward to it though because I'm done a lot quicker. Tomorrow is an easy run and at the pace im supposed to do it it's gonna take sooo long 😅\n\nHaha, that‘s true, it’s over much faster. But way more challenging! Have fun on your easy run tomorrow!! 🙌🏻\n\n[deleted]\n\nI get most nervous about my tempo and long runs. I don't get nervous for the speed/strength runs. \n\nI guess it's because those are broken up into repeats with an active rest in between to help catch my breath. Whereas the tempo and long runs are all one run not broken up.\n\nWell Jakob Ingebrigtsen mentioned the same, and said it was normal to be stressed or a little anxious before workouts. And he is the best at running workouts, probably, ever. So totally normal. I have it the same way. \n\nYes! I am so glad that I'm not the only one. And then I think to myself, \"why are you anxious?? This is practice!\"\n\nExactly! I don‘t understand why I feel this way…\n\nI started doing speed work in a nice park to make it seem less like work\n\nTotally - been there. Have you tried pulling back a TEENY bit on the intensity of your speed work? I used to get nervous before tough speed work, and I was definitely pushing a little too hard. When I started giving myself some grace I found the speed work to be much more enjoyable (aka still challenging without being brutal) and my long runs still improved. \n\nLive to fight another day. 💯\n\nEdit: punctuation\n\nI totally agree with you and it makes so much sense! But pulling back is so hard for me… I feel like I failed and it‘s super frustrating to me! I really need to work on my mindset here…\n\nI can totally empathize. I am a bit of a perfectionist, and I realized a while back how much FEAR was mixed in to my fitness lifestyle. Back when I was younger and using exercise to punish myself for eating (anorexia athletica) there was the fear of weight gain. Later, when I was pursuing super heavy lifts in the weight room, there was the fear of not ever squatting a high enough number. With running, I was afraid that if I wasn’t 100% on every run I would somehow forget how to be a runner or lose something vital. One of the best things that ever happened to me, oddly enough, was a big disc injury that brought everything to a complete halt. Everything came to a stop, and I had to work my way back up to any sort of exercise at all with a PT. And you know what? My fitness was right there waiting for me when I was back on my feet. I had lost nothing by slowing down and giving myself a break. If anything, my new commitment let joy instead of fear be my motivator has made me a better athlete. It takes time to unravel those old, grind-culture thought patterns though. Ask yourself what you have to lose by taking it down a notch on just ONE speed run and give it a try. I bet you’ll be sweaty, and you might even enjoy it! ❤️\n\nWhat an inspiring story! The progress you made is amazing! Thanks for sharing! ❤️\nGetting injured is actually one of my biggest fears. Running is what I’m doing first every day, prepares me for the day and gives me a routine I never really had in my life. And it teaches me so much about myself and life. That’s why I love it so much!\n\nI’m the other way around, I get anxious and stressed when I know It should be an easy day.\n\nIt took me a while to learn to run easy and I did struggle with it in the beginning. But it was more like „oh my gosh what will other people think of me when they see me running so slow“. 🙄\n\nmy plan gives me walking rest between reps. going fast for a short time AND i get to walk rest? sign me up. \n\ni try not to think about that it’s 12k of intervals. the number of reps kicks my butt, but my brain takes the walk bait.\n\nYup, speed days always freak me out because I know how hard it is to physically push yourself. And while I’m always gassed at the end of them, I always feel real accomplished running so fast.\n\nThey are super important! For the body and the mind!\n\nI often struggle with hard/speed workouts because what I want to do in my mind and what I \"feel\" like I can do don't match.  I had a great coach for a while - she told me: Your best is only good enough if it's always good enough.  Meaning, the hard workouts are meant to challenge you to do the best you can do on the day you do them - don't worry about meeting the target... show up with what you can do that day.  There will be times you do better, and times you do worse - the objective is to do the workout to the best of your ability.  Less about being fast, and more about being your best.  That phrase stuck with me and helps. :)\n\nOh what a brilliant coach! Love it!\nSome of my runs (always speed workouts) I finish thinking I could have done better. I actually don‘t know if that’s really the case but sometimes I feel like I‘m holding back and not pushing myself as much as I could. But I would like to…\n\n[deleted]\n\nA tempo run is a run at your threshold pace. It’s a bit slower than your race pace and should feel comfortably hard. You should be able to hold that pace for at least 20 minutes up to 1 hour! \nI actually prefer intervals because it‘s easier for me to push myself when I know it will be over soon and I will get a break…\n\n\"comfortably hard\" runs. Basically 20-30 minutes of running at a bit slower than 10k race pace. It's not hard enough to leave you gasping for air like a hard interval, and not long enough to completely wear you down like a long race would. Towards the end you should look forward to it being over but not feel like you're dying.\n\nIt's a good stimulus to improve the efficiency of your aerobic system.\n\nIt's running at a pace a little higher than your relaxed running pace. It's meant to get you comfortable with being at an uncomfortable pace over a longer period of time than short intervals, like a 5 - 6 out of 10 in terms of effort vs. 7 - 9 out of 10 for other shorter types of speedwork.  That's my experience, at least.\n\nThis summer has been exceptionally hot and humid where I live and without fail every time I have an interval session planned for my half marathon training the weather is not very good.  I have managed to knockout those sessions but it has been rough and taken a toll on my motivation.  My next session is tomorrow and it looks like I will finally have reasonable temperatures for it.  Hopefully this one feels better.\n\nI feel you. I failed all of my speed sessions because of heat and humidity and had to adjust my pace… which was super frustrating for me.\nFingers crossed for tomorrow!\n\nAs someone who is made of glass from playing different sports growing up, I am always afraid of picking up the pace considerably in case my hamstrings or calves fall off!\n\nI actually don’t care a lot about my body, my mindset is more the problem. 😅\n\nI'm trying to find the fun in it.  It makes me nervous at times too, like Crossfit used to, that apprehension because you know it's going to hurt. I'm using the Nike Run Club training plan and the speedwork is guided, which I'm finding helpful to keep me focused and positive.  The coaches really emphasize that running fast is FUN, and you want to run relaxed, strong and in control.  The pep talks seem to help me and I'm reframing my relationship to the speed work.  I actually got all pumped to run my last :45 mile pace today like I was some competitive athlete!\n\nThat’s awesome!! I tried the Nike Run App with the guided runs some time ago too and really liked it. I haven’t done any speedwork with the App though so I will look into that again, thank you!\nDeep inside I think we are all competitive athletes. 🙌🏻\n\nI also get nervous but the night before - that pressure to get to bed early and knowing how hard it is to get up to do speed work…… but the feeling after is so worth it.\n\nSame here! And I know I must do it otherwise I will not improve…\n\nI found that I started putting way less pressure on myself and enjoying speed workouts more when I switched to a plan where I'm told to go by effort level instead of pace, because then it doesn't feel *possible* to fail. If I'm told to do the intervals at specific pace that's hard for me, I'm worrying about the weather and the elevation along my planned route because if it's hot and humid and there are hills and I'm tired it'll be even harder (or impossible) to hit that goal pace. But if I'm told to do them at a hard effort level, I don't care about the other stuff because hard is hard. It also feels like better prep for the race- even if I signed up for a race hoping for a PR so I have a pace goal in mind, race day might come and have conditions that aren't suited for that. Unlike training, you get what you get, you can't reschedule for the next day or earlier/later.\n\nI actually thought about using RPE instead of a pace goal too. But I’m a bit afraid that I don‘t push myself hard enough or that I could do better. I might just try it on my next runs and see what my pace is.\n\nI have a road I only use for speedwork. It's straight, level and open, and very quiet. I only use it for speed and deliberately don't run easy there. I've run on track before, but there isn't one near me now.  I think it helps compartmentalise things a bit, having a set date and place I go\n\n\nPushing your top speed gets your body to adapt and your lower easy paces feel easier. Knowing why you're doing a workout helps too I think.\n\nI don’t have a track near me too. I really like the idea to have a road dedicated to speed work! Thanks for the tip!\n\nIDK if this will make a difference, but when i do my workouts, i have set up times (like 3 min hard, 1 min slow), and just keep the hard part to what is hard that day instead of specifically trying to hit a pace.  Ideally, i focus on going as hard as i can for that timebox, but hard enough that i can maintain the pace for the full duration. \n\nWhere I run, the weather can vary wildly, i try to not focus too much on paces at any given point.\n\nI thought about that too but I‘m a bit afraid that I won‘t push myself hard enough or could do better. I will give it a try though and look at paces afterwards and see if it matches! Thank you!\n\nFor intervals, there is no fail.\n\nYou go out and do the intervals until your performance decreases significantly and then you stop. If that's 2 out of a planned 8, fine. \n\nThe point of intervals is to work \\*really\\* hard because that is what is required to put appropriate training stress on your body, and that's what leads to improvement. If you reach a point where you can no longer work out really hard, you are done - continuing the workout just builds more fatigue.\n\nSimilarly, if you start an interval workout and you aren't feeling strong that day, abort the workout. It's all about quality efforts. Some days you have good legs, some days you don't. \n\nIf that happens regularly, you are likely under-recovered and you need to figure out why that is the case.\n\nI happen to like intervals and tempo but I think that's because I'm a cyclist who decided he wanted to be good at hills and I ride them all the time, and if you do them hard they are either tempo or interval (not that I do them hard all the time, just now and then).\n\nI also philosophically think that discomfort is good for the soul. I'm retired and I could literally sit on my computer 12 hours a day if I wanted to, and I need some adversity in my life.\n\nI totally agree with you! Some of my speed workouts I finish knowing I could have done better. I don‘t know if that’s really the case but I feel like I didn‘t give it all. It‘s like holding back to not get too uncomfortable. Although I actually want to get there.\n\nI always felt this way until I found the Nike Run Club guided speed runs. GAME CHANGER!! Now I find speed runs energizing and confidence boosting.\n\nI still get nervous that I physically can't do it, but I always can!\n\nI used the Nike Run Club guided runs some time ago and really liked them. I never did any speed workouts with them though so will give it a try! Thank you!\n\nI don’t know the reason, but yes I’ve always felt like this. When I was in college and much faster, I’d feel anxious. Now I’m a lot slower, and I feel the same anxiety. One thing that’s been different lately is all this mindfulness work I’ve been doing. This has altered the way that I respond to the anxiety. Rather than simply wanting to get it over with, I approach the feelings with curiosity. It’s a different experience, even though the initiating feeling is almost exactly the same.\n\nI think you are on a good way! I don‘t think I will get over those feelings by just keeping to do those workouts. I suppose my feelings are triggered by something else. Maybe this is not about running at all.\n\nWhen I first got into running I did 10km, half marathon, marathon, 50km, 80km and 100km within the space of a year. I wasn't training for a time, I just wanted to get round the courses.\n\nAfter doing that, I was so incredibly bored of long steady state. All of my training was zone 2 for set distances. The idea of a speed session made me bubble up with joy and that has lasted to this day. It really helps break up the monotony for me.\n\nI agree! Especially in my case as I run the same route almost every day (not much choices unfortunately).\n\nI had the same feeling. So I started doing end of easy pace run sprints in a drain what’s left of the energy mindset and it gives that last nice endorphin spike. I started at 100 yards and usually do that or up to 1/2 mile end of run. I extend the stride and just move faster. Dont do it to any speed where you feel unsteady. It has helped me naturally pick up my speed. Also pacing with music can be an art form for speed development without feeling like it. Im not trying to do 6 min miles just get a lil faster gradually. So far I’ve shaved a minute/mile off my 5k and 45 secs off my 10k without feeling the torture of speed work dread.\n\nThat’s a great progress! 🙌🏻 And easy to do! Thanks for the tip!\n\nMy anxiety fuels my speed workouts lmao\n\nPlus you know, if you dont do speed workouts hitting those continous PRs becomes way more difficult\n\nI know!! That‘s why I keep doing them. I know they are so important!\n\nI am the opposite. Running fast just feels fun and like a personal challenge. My threshold runs and my sprint runs just give me a rush I guess. Slow runs I do the most of but they feel a little boring.\n\nOh I wished I could say that!\n\n[deleted]\n\nI‘m not sure if that would work for me. I need to follow a plan and schedule those speed workouts otherwise I won‘t do it.\n\nYes! I did an interval run last week and my hands started getting prickly - anxiety in physical form - before doing the first set of the 400 m work.\n\nIt’s not just the thought that it’s hard work but for me because it’s hard I think what if I fail to complete a split as dictated to me\n\nI have torn or pulled my hamstrings over half a dozen times. Sprint workout in college twice, ultimate frisbee, rugby, 200 repeats, 400 repeats... \n\nI finally started stretching more, but then I tend to get lazy with it after a few weeks because \"it's fine\"\n\n*narrator voice* but it was not fine, as he would find out playing kickball after work.\n\nMe! 18 miles at easy ish pace - love it. 6 miles with intervals - I dread it 😂 \n\nWhen I had a running coach who set me hard intervals with certain paces to hit - I actually used to sleep rubbish the night before worrying about it. Pathetic 😂🤦‍♀️\n\nOh yes! I look at my training plan and check the paces multiple times on the day prior I have to do the workout as if I hoped they changed. 😅\n\nYes, physically exerting yourself is uncomfortable. \n\nThere are good and bad days. There is no failing unless you don’t attempt the workout. \n\nYou should be goal focused when approaching workouts. Lots of little goals and reward yourself for hitting milestones.\n\nI feel anxiety before cold plunges specifically. Main thing to overcome it is to just get in all the way and don't think about it. \n\nI also try to remind myself how good I'll feel when it's done.\n\nI get it and understand. Those 1/4 Mile intervals will pay off big time. Start with a few and your 1/4 jog in between. Make it easier and patience pays off. Increase speed as u go. Congrats on your efforts!\n\nI was experiencing this today! I have speedwork after work and I’m getting that anxious, excited feeling. It’s almost like pre race jitters, but it feels more like when I have a big lift programmed and I’m getting ready to get under the bar for a squat or prepping to pull a heavy deadlift.\n\nNow what do I do when I have the opposite issue lol😭\n\nOfcourse you don’t like the hard runs. They are hard. You actually have to push yourself, the incremental improvements are measured in seconds and it might take months to really see results. Easy running is easy and the incremental improvements are measured in miles that can be added week after week. So do you want to put in the hard work to get faster or do you just want to do slow easy running? That’s up to you.\n\nI definitely have a build of anxious adrenaline right before the first interval of a speedwork day. Whether it gets better depends a lot on how the first set goes - if it's manageable, then I find I'm able to settle in for the ride (even knowing later intervals are going to **suck**). If the first one goes badly, it's a one-way ticket to mental shambles.\n\nI don’t know if this helps, but I think part of threshold and interval is failing. To complete them you’ve often got to be perfectly rested, the conditions have to right, you can’t have woken up with tired legs. You’re going to cycle up and down on how you perform, and that’s natural.\n\nThank you so much for your comment! It is very true! ❤️\n\nNo need to feel anxious. Speed workouts suck,  but they are a great way to gauge your fitness. If you’re training for a marathon 80% of your runs are easy and the other 20% are speed runs. While I don’t look forward to doing 12x400 workouts I’m always amazed by what I’m able to do at the end of it.  In the long run (no pun intended) it will make you a better and stronger runner.  Embrace the discomfort and remember it will end eventually.\n\nI've had this sense of foreboding on both speed sessions and long runs. It's just nerves, trying to trick us into not trusting that we're ready, but training is supposed to push us to improve, if it was easy, it would be maintaining, not training.  Go forth and hit it. And even if you don't nail your splits, you still got a much better work out in than starting on the couch letting that doubt win. But you'll hit your splits, go do it.\n\nI sometimes feel anxious or nervous when I go to test out my max pull ups. Sometimes it's easy to psych myself out and worry if I'll even be able to meet my last max,let alone exceed it...\n\nAdvice I’ve taken from YouTubers: never do more than 90% of your max. \n\nNorwegian 4x4s have you do intervals at your 5k pace, not your max speed. Thats a very important distinction and has huge consequences for likelihood of injury.\n\nHell yes! I always get nervous before my speed work, but it’s because I set a standard in my head that if I don’t hit, I think it’ll be a let down.  Had intervals this morning and was having a tough time hitting all my desired paces, but it was like 95% humidity at 5:30AM, and 80 degrees so I just did what I could.  I always have a tough time sleeping before then though.\n\nI am always experiencing that whether it's a track workout or a race day, I am anxious that I will get side stitch during my runs, but I just go with the flow and eventually pushed myself to the limits and be thankful that I finished a hard workout\n\nI compare intervals to being Frodo when he puts on the ring\n\nThat‘s hilarious!! 😆\n\nBig time. Sometimes I dread it for even a day or two before. I know it is where I need to put in my hardest effort, and I think for some reason I’m afraid to find where my limit is? I guess because I’m afraid it won’t be good enough….. for…. Me? Wow, thanks doc for making me process this ;-)\n\nIm like this before almost every run, idk whats wrong with me 😂\nI always tell myself its perfect practice for race day jitters \n\nI could very easily go out and run 12+ miles every day and be perfectly happy for the rest of my life… well, my knees might not be happy, but my mind will be clear! I had been running long, slow runs for years but in the spring of ‘21 I decided to try and finally get “faster” so started adding a speed day at the track each week into my routine. At first I hated it - I felt slow and lumbering, I was anxious, I was worried about other runners, etc. but I just kept doing those track days. Fast forward a few years and I absolutely love the track days, have added a second one most weeks, and look forward to them each week!\n\nI'm not really doing speed so much, but I do faster steady/tempo runs. Even though I can't really miss the goal (just need to get HR up), it still sorta stresses me out. Maybe it's the amount of time I spend being a bit uncomfortable and not the level of discomfort. For these workouts, I remind myself that being willing to do the harder workouts makes you faster. I sometimes get everything together so that, once I get out the door, bailing seem like a waste of that prep. During the run, I focus on the mile I'm in. Just feel the discomfort and keep going, I guess. I think I might have some CNS fatigue - I hate doing strength as well.\n\nFor me the time I spend being uncomfortable is the key. I have no issues with short intervals, when I know it will be over soon and I can have a break. The longer the intervals are the more nervous I get. Tempo runs are the worst!\n\nAlways!\n\nI'm the opposite.  I love intervals at the track.  I love the suffering!\n\nI’m on a very similar training schedule for a marathon. I definitely feel a little anxious anticipation the night before my tempo and track workouts. I usually don’t sleep as well although it’s been getting better. I wake up early in the mornings to do these which adds to it. It’s my first time doing this type of speed training too so I think it’s partially my body adapting to stress and partially just anxious about the sucky idea of waking up early and doing something physically hard.\n\nConsider this: there is a part of you that believes this. Ask it what it feels, what it is afraid of you feeling and what will happen if you fail. \n\nConsider reminding that part that it’s ok to feel.\n\nTry incorporating some strides during your easy runs. For example, after 2 miles easy run about 100 meters fast then do a slow jog to recover of the same distance. Start by doing about 4-6 of these like once a week. This will get your mind and body more accustomed to going fast but not in a workout that will crush you, like intervals might. Not a replacement for intervals or tempo runs, just a way for you to be prepared for those. You might find them invigorating (after the first couple of them) and they’ll boost your confidence. \n\nAnd google what a stride is, too (fast, but not a full on arms pumping sprint).\n\nThanks for the advice! I heard about stride running but never really tried it! 🧐\n\nI get anxious doing my first run in a new shoe I haven't used before that I will get pains or blisters or whatever.\n\nI'm actually the opposite with long runs. One way to ease yourself into a speed workout is to allow the first couple of reps to be at a manageable pace. If you're trying to run 800s at 3:30 each, allow yourself to run the first one in anything below 4:00 and then the second one below 3:45. \n\nAnother idea is to start with shorter reps and build up. You might find it daunting to run a mile at 5k pace, but starting with a 200 or a 400 at 5k pace would take a lot of the stress out.\n\nSame here! I feel ya mate! I procrastinate and get anxious before every speed work out. I don't know what to do about it.\n\n I do feel good afterwards especially hitting all my paces. That is until the next morning when the soreness kicks in. 😅\n\nI know the feeling. \n\nTry not to think about the workouts, just do them (harder said then done). \n\nI suggest looking up Do Hard Things or digging in to a few Goggins quotes to psyche yourself up for a tough run. \n\nAlso try to change your thinking and focus on the outcome of a long run instead of the run itself. As much as I love a long easy run, I LOVE looking at my run stats after a workout.\n\nMe too! Love some good stats!\n\nI love my speed runs! It makes me feel so free and kid-like. I really enjoyed the guided runs from Nike Run Club. They focus on the perceived effort more than speed, make sure you’re having fun, and reinforce psychologically that you are fast while recognizing that it is hard to run hard.\n\nHmm I think your body and mind might naturally be stressing out because speed sessions might be more intense on your body. Maybe ease into your interval runs a bit more with your warmup and try to listen to your body. It sounds like your body is naturally getting stressed due to the intensity\n\nYes definitely! I love doing speed work, but started getting really intimidated by some of the longer workouts for my half marathon, like 4x a mile, 12 x 400m, hill intervals, 6km of progressive effort down to 5k pace after 10k of easy (especially gross as it was a hot day), 45 minute tempo…. especially after my first minor injury. Plus I got absolutely mentally stomped at my run club’s speed sessions, I’m one of the slowest there and I guess ego crept in! \n\nI’ve dialed it back to doing some Nike Run Club speed workouts (normally based on a period of time with a pace like 1 minute at mile effort), combined with adding strides and hill strides in after my easier runs, so that I can face them. It’s probably not optimal for my half, but I figure it’s better than skipping them or doing no speed at all. I’m still getting faster so it must be fine!\n\nMaybe it helps doing the speed stuff on hills? It’s less “speedy” and you have the excuse when the numbers don’t reach what you think you should. Meanwhile it’s even better for you then speefwork on the flats\n\nThanks for the tip! Yes, I want to add hills to my training plan! Tried to avoid them as much as possible so far 😅 but I think they could work for me!\n\nIt really hurts legs and lungs so it’s super fulfilling for me! Start on easier inclinations before the steeper ones\n\nI’m the opposite, I feel a sense of joy before a sprint session but I dread the feeling before going for a long run. It’s pretty normal either way, depending on why you are better at. My body breaks down pretty easily during long runs.\n\nI'm the opposite. I love the hard speed sessions. \n\nBut long runs, I get super anxious because they are so long and I'm scared I won't make it"

    "all_comment_text": "at the disney marathon there was a couple who had a sign \"Your almost there\" at like mile 2 and then another sign \"Ignore him, he's stupid\" and then at mile 25 or so he switched his sign to \"Good start!\" and she still had the \"Ignore him, he's stupid\" sign.\n\nI really needed a smile at that point in the race and it still makes me chuckle when I think about it now.\n\nHe IS stupid. He clearly doesn’t know the difference between your and you’re. ;) But maybe that’s the joke.\n\nyes, it was totally him and not me that made that error :D\n\nOh no! I knew the onus was on him, not you. :) Just bringing some light humor to it.\n\nAn American spectator at the Amsterdam marathon shouted  as I slowed to a walk at 23 miles...Number 4287 is waaaaalking! ...Annoying as it was I started running again and finished with a pb.\n\nMy first half marathon was an up and down trail race and my knee was in a world of pain in the last 500m. I had been neck and neck with a guy most of the race. As  I slowed to a walk through the last turn, I thought ahh this is it he's going to pass me any second.\n\nAnd then I heard from a short distance behind me \"Nope! You're not walking! Pick it up!\" And I laughed and got a second wind and finished strong. Still really appreciate that guy.\n\nI've only ever placed in one half, 3rd in Grand Ledge, MI.  At the end of the course I see the finish line and pick it up quite a bit.   This guy had been on the same pace as me for the whole race, so he picked it up too.  Then I gave it some more.  So did he.  In the last 50 yards I sprint.  I hear him start sprinting, then say \"aaah fuck you win.\"  I PRed that one thanks to his competition though.\n\nWas it a spectator or the guy you were neck and neck with who said that?\n\nOh good point, that's not clear. It was the guy I was racing against.\n\nThey weaponized being an annoying American, lol\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility.\n\n😀\n\nMine was more wholesome but it also checked me - late in my first marathon I looked up and saw a little kid about 20 yards ahead and as I was passing by I heard I'm guessing his dad say \"I guess he's just trying really hard\". \n\nWas in a lot of pain and really pushing my limit for the last hour or so but as soon as I heard that I laughed and remembered this was supposed to be fun. I probably looked like a raging psychopath when the kid saw me haha\n\nI just cackled imagining that!\nReminds me of one of my favorite signs at one of my favorite races:\n\nThroughout the technical course the Marines who were hosting the race had placed signs that said “Today, Barbie.” (TBF at the time I had no idea what that meant— wtf is a “today Barbie”?!? I had to have someone spell it out for me: as in, *today* Barbie.)\n\nI still don't get it 😅\n\nIt's a reference to how we are spoken to during recruit training.  As in, \"let's move it, Barbie.\" You might be Barbie, thing, recruit, you-hoo, freak show, etc.  Pretty much anything that is not your name.\n\nThe \"today\" is just the drill instructor's way of telling us to hurry up.  Typically pronounced with much emphasis on the \"day\" part as in To-DAY\n\nEdit:formatting on mobile while drinking is hard\n\nI did not expect to actually start laughing at a Reddit comment, yet here I am with some watery eyes\n\nNo shame in walking to bring your HR down\n\n2019 Chicago Marathon. I was in the midst of one of the worst stretches of my life. I wanted to end my life. I was CERTAIN the world would be better off without me. I was coming off a freak knee injury from May that same year when the ortho told me I would not be able to run Chicago and I should give up running altogether. The knee injury wasn't even from running! So in the midst of my internal turmoil, running, the thing keeping me sane, was stripped from me. I was in such a dark place. I made it to the start line that October morning with a decently healthy knee. But still struggling internally. Around mile 16 or so the crowds had died down and there was a few people scattered around. I see this woman standing alone, dressed in white, all alone, no one around, looking incredibly sad. She was holding a poster. As I got closer I saw it and it stopped me in my tracks, it took my breath away. It read \"the world is not better off without you\" hashtag suicide prevention. I had to gather myself to avoid getting choked up. I finished the race with a marathon PR at the time. While I still have periods of darkness I will never forget her and that moment.\n\nfuck (wo)man I'm a sobbing mess now!  And yes, that woman was right.  The world is NOT better off without you.  I'm always here to listen or for a hug if you ever find yourself in need of one when you go through another dark period.\n\nThis is beautiful. Thanks for sharing. The world is most certainly better with you in it!\n\nThat made me water up. 🥹 What a story. I'm so proud of you for finishing!\n\nShe was waiting for you\n\nI have goosebumps. Glad you are here!!! And proof that one person can have immeasurable impact!!\n\nThat is beautiful. We are so much better off *with* you.\n\nDuring my first marathon, about .2 from the finish this random man looked me in the eyes and so genuinely said \"youre almost there\". Wasnt a cheer or a shout, just a quiet push to the end. I dont know why but it instantly made me teary.\n\nThat just made ME teary! Lol\n\nOmg this!!!!! My first marathon, a random man at mile 24ish looked at me and borderline-whispered \"you've got this.\" I think about him all the time, even 10 years later 🥹\n\nThis is beautiful. :)\n\nAround the halfway point of our hometown marathon, a fellow runner turned to me incredulously and said, “How is it that so many spectators know you?”  It reminded me just how supportive our running club is of all its members.  (Our club organized the race.)\n\nOne of our members parked herself around mile 20 near a switchback, found runners she knew and ran with them for a few tenths of a mile, then circled back to find the next person to give some late-race encouragement to.  It was such a sweet gesture.\n\nHappened to me on my first marathon, too. Then I realized my name was on the front of my bib.\n\ni did the name on my shirt thing for Chicago last year and kept forgetting about it. i was like, dang how do you know my name??? oh yeah lol\n\nSame\n\nIn the moment it always catches me off guard when I hear my name shouted during a race. And then I'm like oh yea, BIB.\n\nIt STILL gets me after dozens of races.  I’ll be like, wait, I know you? 🤣\n\nThis is me in Philadelphia.  I run with one of the largest running clubs in the city and also know a lot of the staff for many of the big races. I ran for a PR to Philadelphia Marathon last yay and I probably saw someone yelling my name at least every other mile and throughout the home stretch.  It's an amazing feeling having that encouragement all along the way.\n\nMy running club always goes above and beyond with support. When I did my first 50k, one of the members kept popping up at various points on the course to give me encouragement - it meant so much to me. Our local marathon is in May and I'm looking forward to being part of the cheer squad :)\n\nI thought you were going to say ‘they hadn’t realised our bibs have our names on’ 😂\n\nLol this actually happened to me in the 2022 NYC Marathon. \n\n\nI was pacing with this guy for a while down 5th Ave and people kept cheering me on by name for about 6 blocks, finally he looked over and said \"wow a lot of people know you\" I laughed and pointed to my name painted on my shirt. 😆\n\nNot a spectator but another runner..During one marathon i tripped in a pothole and fell, took me a minute to catch my breath and start up again, i was bawling. This guy came up behind me asked if i was ok, offered me a gel, told me he was proud of me, and off he went. I felt the love and it kept me going.\n\nA friend of mine had a similar thing on her first marathon. At 20 miles she was done, called her husband and then her daughter crying hysterically and this 60 some year old man said \"hey come with me\" and got her going and talked her through the last 10k. They've stayed in touch on social media since\n\nI watched a woman wipe out in front of me in a 10k race, and I helped her back up, asked if she was okay, and kept going. \n\n\nI wish I had checked in on her more, but I also know falling can be embarrassing and I didn't want to intrude too much. \n\n\nI'm glad you were okay!\n\nThis is so wonderful.\n\nThis happened to me on my first marathon - I had just unravelled at mile 20 - hit the wall and was struggling to get my legs moving again. This 70ish year old man stopped and talked to me, and then we started gently running. He said the last bit is mind over matter and helped me get going again. I was so touched - also a real mess by that point- every good thing was tearing me up!\n\nOn particularly hot days, I've run past people standing outside with their hose spraying runners who indicated they wanted it. That was the best.\n\nI was at about mile 11 of a sunny half-marathon when I passed a guy watering his lawn. I shouted, \"Is that just water?\" (I couldn't see from the angle if he had fertilizer on it.) He nodded so I said, \"Hit me with it!\" He seemed incredulous but complied. It felt amazing. \n\nI did this one day.  The old lady was at the bottom of her driveway watering her flower bed around her mailpost.  I shouted, can you hit me with that?  She incredulously replied, \"are you sure?!\"  After I gleefully responded \"YES!\" she gave it to me.  It was glorious and I yelled thank you.  I never broke stride either!\n\nHaha, I've done a few races where people have their hoses propped up on ladders and spraying onto the road. They cheered and waved as we ran through. It was awesome.\n\nYes, this is awesome. At the Bird in Hand half in Lancaster County Pa the farmers will have sprinklers pointing into the road when it gets hot\n\nThose people are the real MVPs!\n\nHad this happen at a 4th of July race last year, can confirm it was the best.\n\nI ran Amsterdam in 2022 3.5 weeks after having Covid.  Not only did I miss a ton of runs, including a 20 mile run, I was still recovering from the effects (I have asthma and 1.5 lungs).  So I was draggggging that last 10 miles and walk/jogging at a 14 min/mile pace.  My name was on my bib, and whenever I slowed to a walk, the crowd would start chanting my name.  I’d break back into a jog and the crowd would wildly cheer and I’d wave my thanks and repeat the experience 400m later, over and over.  The crowd basically picked me up and carried me to the finish.  With about 2 miles to go, some man addressed me by name and said with conviction “You are going to finish A MARATHON!  A marathon!  You are amazing!”  I almost cried.  Amsterdam is an amazing place to run.\n\nYou made my eyes well up.\n\nI don't race, but I'm running every single street in my city. This takes me all over the place, from opulent areas to broken down slums. I was running through a neighborhood one morning when an older fella was out in front of his house doing the odd chores—moving trash cans and coiling garden hoses. I think I was struggling for whatever reason when just started walking towards me and yelled, \"YOU GOT THIS!\"\n\nThat pretty much boosted my running for the rest of the week.\n\nThere was a bicyclist who rode on our local path who would yell encouraging things to every runner he passed.  \"you got this\", \"doing great\" \"looking good\", etc.  He did this every time he rode (generally most Saturday mornings at least) and it was a busy path! It was honestly the highlight of my run a lot of days.\n\nI like to yell \"Lookin' strong, guys\" to fella runners I cross. For women, I just politely nod. Most women running by themselves would rather not be yelled at, I just assume.\n\nCityStrides?\n\nI hit 100% in citystrides on my 36th birthday.  It was a fucking moment.  I put so much work into that.  Good luck!\n\nThanks! I'm looking forward to it. \n\nI'm not an external validation guy.  I'm generally embarrassed by the attention, don't go for the high fives or pep talks. But every time someone cheers me on in a race it makes me smile.  It's so kind, so selfless, and I just love it so much, which really surprises me.\n\nSo a huge thank you to all of the partners, friends, spectators, and random onlookers who wave, cheer, ring bells, hold signs, and hand out goodies.\n\nI was a spectator/volunteer in Boston yesterday, and I made it a point to look fot every name I could see and give them a shout out. \n\nIf I didn't see a name, I shouted out whatever identifying marker on the runners outfit I could see. So many city/country/etc yells, lol.\n\nI got so much joy out of seeing people smile and wave at being cheered on.\n\nThank you!  We so rarely connect with and encourage our friends, let alone perfect strangers.  It's a very special part of the running community and one I didn't expect.\n\nSame here.  I'm not into crowds or signs. But...\n\nI ran Indianapolis last year and had a horrible time of it.  Somewhere about mile 16 was a dad band playing the Who's Teenage wasteland.  Got a high 5 from the lead.  Damn near broke into tears.  Honorable mention to the guys playing Nirvana in the park at max volume 2 miles later.\n\nI also ran Indy last year and thought the crowd support was great!! Did you see the guy dressed as Jason from Friday the 13th hiding behind the van?! It made my laugh out loud!! The lone guitarist in the small park around mile 17 with his little amplifier just playing his heart out all by himself. Priceless.\n\nOn my first ever trail race, I remember an XC dad at a three-person aid station (probably mile 35 of 50) helping me pull my water bottles out of my running vest and filling them while I munched on some snacks from the table. Even did 50/50 Gatorade/water like I asked and helped tuck them back in before sending me off again. I’d only ever done big city, 10,000+ participant races before so that kind of personal help from a total stranger really meant a lot on a very tough race day.\n\nTrail people are a special breed.\n\nYeah, I have gotten so much incredible  help from ultra marathon aid stations. Like literally someone offered to help me pop a blister once 😬\n\nMy first marathon was Chicago. My husband found me three different times on the course but the best was mile 18. There was this break in the crowd and I was so tired and thought, “I could just walk off the course and be done, it would be fine.” My husband popped into that empty spot and started cheering. My gut thought was, “dammit, now he’s a witness, I have to keep going”😂 but it helped push me to finish!\n\nI have a singlet that has the \"Average Joe's\" logo from Dodgeball. I wore it for my marathon in March and most spectators said stuff like \"you're not average\" which was nice and all but one guy ran up to me from the sidewalk and yelled \"if you can dodge a wrench you can run a marathon\" I was 18 or so miles and struggling and this made me laugh and kind of broke the spell the unexpected heat had in me\n\nNot a single spectator, but when I ran Berlin in 2019 I wore my University of Wisconsin singlet. That race dumped rain for a majority of the time so I was dead for the back half, but about a half dozen times I heard an 'On Wisconsin' yelled at me and every time it gave me just a little extra boost!\n\nWisco here too, good work!\n\nYes! I usually wear a club t-shirt in races and it has the name of my city on it. I love when people shout \"come on City\"!\n\nI will always go and hit those power up signs kids hold up and then dash off real fast for a few seconds. I’ll always high five any kids who are asking for one. It’s good to see kids out supporting us athletes and not robbing shops or bashing old people over the head\n\nWhen a kid offers you a high five, you better fucking give that kid a high five!\n\nSimilarly, I was running the Boston 5K the other day, which is pretty huge (10000 people). We were catching up on the para/adaptive runners and their partners who had started maybe 10 minutes before us. I came up to a guy, maybe a dad, pushing a younger guy in a running wheelchair with some severe disabilities. \n\n\nThis guy was ECSTATIC to be racing with everyone around him, cheering on everyone. I ran up and gave him a fist bump as I went past, his support person/dad cheered and the guy was so amped. I definitely felt a speed boost and some adrenaline after that. Great vibes.\n\nI ran the Paris Marathon a week+ ago and the kids among the route got the memo — I must’ve gotten a high five every kilometer from all those well wishing youngsters!\n\nIf the Mario mushroom signs I tagged worked I’d have been 50 feet tall by the end… but those kids sure made me feel that way regardless…\n\nThat is so cute\n\n&gt;I will always go and hit those power up signs kids hold up and then dash off real fast for a few seconds\n\nI DO THE SAME THING 😂😂😂\n\nI just ran my first full at the end of February. It was a point to point on a trail, with a road that ran next to it for a long time. There was a couple holding up a sign that said Let’s go Matt! After the fourth time seeing them in as many miles I jokingly said “I’m gonna change my name to Matt!” They asked me what my name was, and I told them. A few miles later I heard them yelling my name down to me from the cliff the road followed. Was awesome. Saw them at the finish line, and most importantly saw Matt too, and congratulated him and thanked him for having good family.  \n  \nAnother awesome moment was Beyoncé’s “Who run the world” playing as the girl that ended up finishing 6th ran through a cheer station in front of me.\n\nI was coming around the corner to the final 600m of a 10K race when I saw a friend who had finished already walking along the sidewalk. I gave him a wave and he screamed at me:   \n\n\n**EMPTY THE FUCKING TANK!!!**  \n\n\nThat echoes in my head every time I get to the final push before finishing a race.\n\nI was really struggling in my last 6 miles of Boston yesterday. Moving so slowly it seemed. I gave a random stranger a high 5 and she just started wildly cheering like I made HER day by giving her a sweaty high 5 and it made me smile. I wanted to quit so bad, but it was nice to have enthusiastic supporters even when I felt like I was having a pretty bad race. It reminded me I was doing something special.\n\nMy second 100 miler….\n\nSomeone who is never personally met but that I’d known from Instagram for a few years met me at one of the last aid stations. \n\nHe walked me out of the aid station and told me how proud he was to say he knew me, and that he knew I was going to crush the last portion of the race (I was really, really hurt at the time and just wanted to rest). \n\nAfter his words of encouragement I actually went on to win the race, my first and only win ever!! Could not have done it without his kind words in my darkest moment!\n\nThis is wonderful! Thanks for sharing.\n\nI was wearing a spurs shirt in the Valencia marathon and twice heard 'Come On You Spursss'...  it was magical and gave me such a lift both times.\n\nI'm not a spurs fan, far from it. But I gave a crossed arms sign to a runner in a west ham shirt I saw in a race. And I'm not a hammer either.\n\nIn a race it's the encouragement that counts, not the allegiance.\n\nThat's one reason why I love running - the supportive atmosphere from other runners and spectators is unlike any other sport.\n\nI'm a gooner but would still make a positive comment to you if I saw your shirt in a race.\n\nlovely stuff, yes perhaps we wouldn't mention the teams, but we'd support the persons absolutely heroic effort to complete the distance.\n\nI was on the final leg of my first triathlon (running portion), and I saw my best friend's husband on the other side of the flags about a quarter mile from the finish line. I thought I might be hallucinating, so I said, \"Gary, are you really right there?\"\n\n\"Yes I am right here with you!\"\n\n\"That's so nice!\" And I started to tear up a bit. \n\n\"I'm going to stay with you until you cross the finish line. I know you're tired right now, but you can do this, and I'm not leaving your side. I'm with you the rest of the way.\"\n\nAnd he ran the last quarter mile with me from just on the other side of the flags separating racers from spectators. \n\nHe and my dad also ran the last tenth of a mile (up a giant hill) with his wife and me during my first half marathon. Good Guy Gary for sure. His wife did the same triathlon four years later for her first tri, and I got to run next to her for the last quarter mile, and sort of pay it forward, while he waited at the proper finish line for her.\n\nThis is beautiful!\n\nThis made me teary. What a great guy.\n\nOh man this got me teary. I’m so glad Gary was there and that you were able to support his wife during her race.\n\nNot me, but my wife: running was her dad's thing, all her life.  She picked it up too, so it was kind of a shared activity between them. \n\nWe were running the Blue Ridge Half Marathon, and she got to the top of Peakwood. This is the last big climb of the half, and is a cul de sac at the top, so all the neighbors come out to make it awesome and super celebratory. \n\nShe was missing her dad a lot, so she found the most \"dad\" looking guy up there and asked for a hug. He said \"oh absolutely\" and gave her the biggest dad hug. It was the exact boost she needed.\n\nThat legit made me tear up just reading it. :)\n\nNot specifically, but the children with their families on the sidelines who warmly and enthusiastically cheer for hours, hoping for a smile or a high five every now and then absolutely make my day!\n\nIt's great isn't it. These kids are so excited when you acknowledge them or high five them. It's like they think you're a super star\n\nAround mile 23 at Berlin both calves began to cramp up. I slowed down drastically when another runner provided some encouraging words as he passed by. At mile 24 I pulled over and leaned against a railing with my head down while stretching my calves. A giant burly bystander locked eyes with me as I raised my head and yelled in German. I don’t speak German but it scared my cramps away so it worked and gave me that boost to haul as much ass as I could for the last two miles   At mile 25.5 I caught up to the runner from earlier who was now battling his own cramps and I returned the encouraging words and we finished together.\n\nI never used to have my name on my race number, like some others posting here I preferred to be concentrating on my own thing during races. However, at one race names were automatically printed on the number (or at least I had opted in to this)\n\nA funny thing happened - every time someone in the crowd gave me a shout using my name, I got an actual physical tingle across the back of my neck and shoulders. And a nice boost.\n\nBut then, I realised that if I responded with a ‘thanks’ or a ‘cheers’, I got a tingle over the total upper half of my body. An excellent feeling.\n\nI write my name on the number every race now, love it!\n\nI don’t run too many races each year, maybe 2-3, so maybe it wears off, but for the moment it’s gold.\n\nI've done this for every marathon, and it's still fun after 11 races.\n\nThank you for your post! It was so fun to read all of the comments. Renews my somewhat shaky faith in humanity. Well done!\n\nCheers! Amazing to see all of the runners here in Boston yesterday. Hands still stiff from all the clapping!\n\nA cliche for people who have been running since high school, probably, but I am a woman who started running in my forties after cancer treatment. During my first marathon, a man yelled the old  'Good job, runner! “ and I about burst into tears. Being acknowledged as a runner, an athlete, at my age, was a nice feeling.\n\nTears of joy for being seen. You are a runner. And a cancer survivor. May your steps be fast and your miles be healing. 🫂\n\nIf you’re running, you’re a runner! 🩷\n\nYes!  Mine is related to form moreso than encouragement.  \n\nHistorically, I have always looked incredibly tired in all of my finishing race photos.  It's been funny. I just figured I was working hard.\n\nLast week I was in the Newport Rhode Race half marathon in Newport RI.  While running, at about the 7 mile mark, a spectator was cheering everyone on.  She looked at me and said \"Chin down! Let's go!\".  So I pulled my chin down.  \n\nIt turns out the reason I always look tired is because when I get tired my chin floats up. This leads to my neck rolling around too much.  When she said that I tucked my chin, and it pulled my whole spine right into alignment.  It increased my power and endurance instantly. \n\nIt was pretty magical, I'm so grateful for that knolwedgable person although I can't thank them.\n\nNot a random stranger, but I happened to come upon a woman from my running group on the last mile of my marathon last year. I was a one-woman suffer-fest, a bag of wet cement, and she was a sight for sore eyes. She'd been volunteering and was on her way to the parking lot, but she handed her stuff to her son and ran with me for a couple minutes, telling me encouraging sweet nothings. She left me at the turn to the final stretch, and I managed to run it in. I probably would have been walking if not for her. \n\nA pair of young children, one with a kazoo, and one yelling “YOU WANT SOME SWEDISH FISH?!!!!!!”\n\nI was going to cause a collision if I swerved to get them, sadly.\n\nSome kid giving me a double high five about half a mile from the finish line had me smiling ear to ear.\n\nEdit: Oh also some people who lived in a house on the route set up a table they called the \"temptation station\" where they were giving out cups of beer, tequila shots, and donuts. Gotta say, aside from the burps, drinking about 8 ounces of ice cold beer with two miles to go hit the spot perfectly. The tequila shots did not sound appetizing at the time though.\n\nAbout the 6k mark of Philly (so like 7:20 in the morning in November) there’s a table manned by people giving out shots of Jamesons. Don’t know how many takers but I can’t imagine that feeling good.\n\nNot in a good way but during my first marathon at the weekend someone was holding up a sign at about mile 16 saying ‘4 miles to go’. I was already starting to struggle by this point, but in the moment my brain didn’t quite put 2+2 together so it gave me a massive boost thinking there was just over 5km left.\n\n…and then the grim reality came crashing down. Made me feel so much worse than I was already feeling lol.\n\nI'm sure this is very common, but a kid had a \"slap this sign for a power up\" about 3k from the end of a half. It definitely worked!\n\nNYC Marathon. It was only my second and I was so not prepared for the hills. I was struggling along central park and this guy just yelled \"I see you, you will finish\", with my name. There just something about him being so strong and calling me out specifically to finish. Loved that whole race but that moment really did help push me.\n\nDuring the Hartford marathon many years ago, I was running along an out-and-back in a residential neighborhood and there weren't any other runners super close by. Two women spectators were chatting about how diverse marathon runners were when one of them goes \"and then you have girls like this\", gesturing to me as I ran by, \"who looks like running is the most natural thing in the world.\" It was such an amazing compliment and a reminder of all the hard work I'd put in, it really kept me mentally focused. I yelled thanks over my shoulder and got my PR that day, and 3rd place in my age group.\n\nMy first marathon, getting near the end. I had been walking and crying for miles, in a lot of pain, and generally not into it anymore. I didn't know anyone around and felt really alone and sad. Then this lady shouted at me from her chair, \"Hey! It's only a 5k left!\" I turned to her and said incredulously, \"a 5k???? You know what? You're so right! It's only a 5k!\" She gave me the motivation to start running again and finish it.\n\nWonderful! Very glad that lady helped you find strength!\n\nNot a spectator, but on my first marathon I was about 300m from the finish line when my watch hit 42.2. Even though I obviously knew I wasn’t done yet, my brain broke for a second and I stopped to walk. This older man who looked like he was out for a Sunday jog came up behind me, slapped me on the back and said “come on, we’re going to run this in!”  \n\nI started shuffling while he bounced around, made circles with airplane arms, jogged backwards and talked me through it. I crossed just under 4:30 and he gave me a big hug after I crossed the finish line.  I was so out of it I just muttered thank you and didn’t get his name (I also got my medal from an Olympian and didn’t realize it until later that afternoon. I was a little marathon dumb).\n\nI was having a real shit race. Had juuuust gotten over the flu and my body was absolutely still trying to recover. Every part of the race hurt and it was entirely a slog. I was just shy of the halfway point (and water station) and I told myself: “just make it to the water station, *then* you can walk a little.” \n\nIt was ugly. It was bad. It took everything I had to claw my way to water. As I reach for the cup being held out to me, I realize, with my face full of snot, sweat and tears that the person handing me water is the manager for DC United. I froze in horror at the state of myself, and word vomited a heartfelt thanks for being there. Without missing a beat he stated he loved doing these.\n\n\nI’d love to tell you that gave me the kick in the teeth that I needed to keep running the rest of the race. \nBut it sure as heck gave me the adrenaline to jog another mile before taking a section to walk. \n\n\nI did finish. \nAnd in no small part because it really meant something to see that being there for runners was something people don’t just do, but look forward to, and take pride in. \nIt’s been years so I can’t remember if the race was the morning after an away match, or if they had a match that evening, but whatever it was, it would have been a really tight, and entirely purposeful turnaround to be able to make working that race. \n\n*that* energy, enthusiasm and dedication was contagious. And it really meant a lot to me then, and now. \n\nBen Olsen, you are a legend.\n\nNot really a spectator, but Bill Murray just randomly showed up at the Big 10 10k in Chicago and took over the starter duties. He was cracking jokes and got everyone in a super good mood right when we were at our most nervous. Probably my favorite race experience of all time.\n\nThat's a cool story. One for the memory banks.\n\nI saw a sign at my first marathon that said \"Your dog is proud of you\" that had me bawling. I had to push for my pups.\n\nPretty much every single person out yelling for you, especially if they call me out specifically, jacks me up. I love me some external motivation so just people clapping or reading my bib to see my name to yell really gets me going. Plus, the kids with power up/speed boost signs or high fives\n\nAbout 6 years ago when I was trying the c25k the first time, I had on a bright yellow Shell oil tshirt on the day I was running w5d3. I felt like I was going to die and probably looked like it as well. Some random girl around my age going the opposite way yelled, \"Go, Shell! You're doing great!\"  Instead of running 20 minutes stratight, I ran 21 and it felt amazing.\n\nThose first 20 minute runs in C25K are the worst. I've done it like three or four times now, and just completed it again a month or so ago.\n\nI did a 10k in Savannah where they announced your name as you were coming to the finish line. Really helped with the final kick. Got a new PR that day.\n\nAt mile 18 of a particularly tough marathon, a little girl of about 6 looked me in the eye, held out a leaf and said: “I picked this lucky leaf for you!” Best motivation ever. I kept the leaf with my medal and bib.\n\nNot a race but out for a run a few months back and ragging it up a hill, some young blokes drove by and the front passenger made a strong-first out the window and shouted \"You've got this!\". Gave me the boost I needed and I still dine out on that feeling sometimes.\n\nI inadvertently ended up along a trail race once on my usual Sunday morning trail run. So instead of being on my own as usual, I had people cheering me on as they hadn’t clocked I wasn’t part of the race. I remember feeling pretty chuffed and thanking everybody who cheered me on 😂\n\nI was passing people with bibs on left and right on a  run (I had assumed it was a local marathon) when I was in pretty good running shape years ago and had people cheering for me like crazy (I think I must have been getting pretty close to the frontrunners), and felt pretty good about myself. \n\nLater I realized the race was a 100 mile ultra. LOL\n\nHad that happen during an October long run, I ran through an entire Halloween 5k, the people were really nice about it though, lol, and my return through the course I was able to tell them how many were still on track at least, lol.\n\nI remember at about mile 16 of my first (and only) marathon somebody had a sign that said 'Don't be a little bitch!' that made me laugh and got me out of my head a bit. I still remember her smile.\n\nI was running my second marathon and absolutely blew up at mile 18. Went from possible 4 hour finish to barely able to walk with cramping calves.  My nutrition was off somewhere. Refusing to give up i walked most of the last 8 miles a lot of it alone (200 total finishers). Around mille 24 the race course came very close to a train track and crossing.  As i came close a train approached the crossing. The engineer waived at me (i think) and blew his horn.  Maybe they blew that whistle every time and maybe he was gesturing at someone else, but deep in my fatigue/ pain curve/disappointment, I took it as a whole train cheering me on.\n\nonce someone offered to throw away some trash for me. that was pretty nice! although, I was 10ft away from a trashcan at the time, but the gesture was still appreciated.\n\nI hit the infamous wall at a half marathon earlier this year and one of the spectators (and from my run crew tbh) came running to me, asked what I needed and ran with me for a bit. It was what I needed and I am beyond grateful to her.\n\nRunning the LA marathon (maybe 1989 or 1990) and I got SO many You Go Girl  type comments as there didn't seem to be that many females running compared to men. Or at least I was surrounded by men at my 7:30-8:00 pace so those cheers stood out. I was barely 20 years old and felt like I was repping. Now, that's not so special but I still think about how cool that was as a female athlete at the time.  Mind you, there was no internet to reference for training. I certainly didn't check out any books about marathoning and very few clubs existed in my world of running. Just a kid who thought marathoning sounded fun and jumped in. Appreciated the support. Over 25 marathons later and countless half marathons and more, and still going strong in my 50s. \n\nYou never know whom you affect while spectating. So thanks.\n\nAnyone who’s yelling “dig dig dig!” When you’re going for broke in the last 1/2 mile of a race gets a nod from me.\n\nLittle kid high fives\n\nAt mile 24 of Houston this last year in January, a man was simply holding a sign that said “This is where you find your why.”\n\nAs a 35 year old man, I can honestly say that this sign hit me like a ton of bricks on why I’m out there doing this. I’m setting an example for my 7 year old son. I’m telling him that you can do hard sh*t if you dedicate the time to work at it.\n\nHow neat that his holding up this sign—an act of love—reminded you of your own act of love.\n\nYou started a beautiful thread that has contained countless heart warming stories.\n\nI was 2 miles into a 100 mile race running south  , on a popular trail which is usually walked south to north, and hikers were congratulating me and telling me to keep it up. \nEven though it was completely unjustified praise being so early, I couldn't believe how much of a boost I got, and I vowed to be vociferous in my vocal support of folk doing cool shit.\n\nA lady was handing out warm chocolate chip cookies at mile 11 of a half marathon(my first) on a cold day. Can never forget her !!\n\nNothing a spectator said has ever made an impact. The cheering at Boston is nice (I ran it 14 times), but I don't really need it.\n\nBest I can think of:\n\n1. The 2016 Vermont City Marathon it was so hot that they shut the course down (https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/2016/05/29/heat-halts-vermont-city-marathon-first-time/85131462/) . I was far enough along the course that I was allowed to officially finish. People in neighborhoods ran sprinklers and hoses to cool us off. That was very helpful.\n\n2. Both the 2004 and 2012 Boston Marathons were similarly hot. A lot of spectators brought bags of ice. I'd grab some and put it into my hat when the last batch had melted.\n\n3. At the Nipmuck Trail Marathon one year  I was struggling as I approached the final turnaround (about 20 miles in). A spectator brought their Alpaca to the turnaround so runners could pet it. That was more helpful than you can possibly imagine.\n\nThe Nipmuck alpaca is legendary\n\nCramped heavily at Mile 14 of a marathon. Huge crowd of support outside a pub all started chanting my name.\n\nDidn’t really have a choice but to keep moving at that point\n\nI was on the ground with the worst cramp of my life and a young guy came by and said, “Hey Uncle. You good?”  I then had a superpower come over me that caused me to get up and finish the race. I’m not a damn uncle. I’m too young for that. I had to prove it to myself. lol. \n\nWhen I finally finished my wife reminded me that I was old.\n\nI’m not one who is usually motivated by spectators shouting encouragement to me. If I’m miserable, I’m just miserable and there’s nothing you can say to change that. That said, I was once at about mile 10 of a half marathon and the course had turned distinctly uphill, and it was hot. I looked up the road and saw an older guy wearing race gear from another race. \n\nHe obviously wasn’t running this half, but was a runner himself. As I approached, he shouted out “You look great!” I waved, but sort of groaned internally because I was miserable. Then he shouts “You feel like shit, but you look great!” I think I audibly laughed at this. Pretty sure this guy had run this race before and knew this particular part of the course was where he needed to be.\n\nI finished running the Dopey (my second) in Disney World in January this year. My marathon was awful - I was exhausted and not feeling great and just wanted to get through it. I was approaching the finish line and Jeff Galloway was standing off to the side. He put his hand out for a high five so I walk/jogged over to high five him, and he lightly grabbed my hand, looked me in the eye, and said “I am so proud of you.” I nearly cried haha.\n\nAfter a race… but I overall won a small 10K once, when the representative from the charity gave me the trophy she said, “I knew it was going to be you.” 10 years later I still break that memory out and enjoy it every now and then.\n\nI was on mile 23 at the Miami Marathon this past January. It was 90F with like 85% humidity. I'm pretty sure I had heat exhaustion+ also being at mile 23 of a marathon.... at that point, due to the heat, I was doing a run-walk-run thing and each time I was supposed to run it just kept getting harder and harder. A spectator started walking next to me, right as I said \"I can't run anymore\". She talked to me in the kindest voice I've ever heard. She said \"You've trained so hard for this. You've probably been training for months. I've seen how you keep trying and are not giving up, so I'm not going to let you give up either. Come on, run with me\" and she started trotting next to me and she held my hand and I somehow started running again. I started bawling. I was so hot and so tired. She told me her name, and then gave me a soft push, and I kept moving until the finish line. \nListen, that day I had my dad and my husband, helping me in ways that meant the world to me at different marks on the race, but this stranger found me at a moment where I legit thought I was going to collapse on the ground. I'll never forget how kind and encouraging she was. Even now, thinking about it, it makes me tear up.\n\nNo, but a spectator asked me during my first marathon if I'd seen his son during the race...  I didn't know how to answer lol\n\nFor me it’s just their presence! \n\nI’ve been participating in small (5k) races for years but last year was my first 1/2 marathon and the spectators were the most pleasant surprise. \n\nThe funny signs. The little kids just happy to be there. The high fives, smiles, and words of encouragement. I really love that part!\n\nI still think about the dog that’s owner was lifting his paw up for fists bumps in my last half marathon. Gus’s fist bump got me through that race, I’m not even being hyperbolic - it really helped! I’d been having kind of a shitty run and it was affecting my attitude and making me spiral. Fist bumping Gus just reminded me that it was supposed to be FUN and helped me get a smile on my face to keep pushing.\n\nLiterally every one. Just being there, not even for me, and knowing they will be terribly bored for potentially 16 hours for just a few seconds of seeing the individual the are supporting is amazing to me. Little kids, grandmas, people with their dogs and thise who took time to make signs and make a full day of it are simply the best people.\n\nNot a race, but in middle school basketball a lady kept yelling from the stands that her son was so much better than me he should just drive past me. \n\nI blocked 5 of his shots that game, 3 in a row to end the game. I made a real effort to make sure he wouldn’t score on me. It’s one thing to cheer someone on, it’s another to try to bring someone down to bring another up.\n\nNot during my race but immediately after crossing the finish line during my first-ever marathon. It was an uncontrollably hard year for me and I just broke down sobbing at that point – a volunteer just came up to me to see if I was OK, and I just said: \"It's just been a really bad year for me.\" And she just said \"Atta boy, you did really good,\" and gave me a nice long hug and gave me one of those silver blanket things. \n\nThat was a powerful moment for me. I still recall that experience regularly some 8 years later.\n\nAt Disney races I've seen \"you're running Disney better than Bob chapek!\" (Old CEO that most Disney fans hated lol)\n\n“GO GET YOUR FU#%!N PR!”\n\nSomeone handed me a beer at about mile 12 of the Boston marathon.  I was like 20 at the time so drank it right down, haha\n\nI ran what was inarguably my worst ever race performance at my first marathon in Philly in 2019. Everything went wrong for me that day and it was sleeting and windy, and I was very much in the back of the pack, time goal absolutely thrown out the window. Around mile 23/24 one of the volunteers at a water station saw me coming and that I had a handheld water bottle. He ran back to me and took it, said to keep going and he’d catch up to me after refilling it. He found me with my refilled water, told me I was almost there and I was doing great. Just keep moving forward. I wish I could tell him how much those few minutes he gave me meant. I was miserable and just trying to finish. The crowd support had dwindled by the time I made it to mile 20 because the weather was so bad. He gave me help and encouragement when I desperately needed it and I am so grateful.\n\nMy first half had 2 things. The first was a sign that said “smile if you’re not wearing any underwear.” This was around mile 8 or 9, I was really mentally sinking and it gave me a smile. In the last 400 m a lady that id evidently been going back and forth with looked back at me and said “let’s finish this together.” I was so stuck in my head that the more I ran, the finish still didn’t seem to be getting any closer. Her nudge got me out of my head to finish. I was able to find her on strava and now we’re mutuals across social media\n\nMy first race ever was a try-a-tri.  I can't remember the distances but it wasn't too much.  I entered it on a whim with no expectations.\n\nI used to be a swimmer and I was a competitive cyclist as well, so much to my surprise after the ride, I was in first place.  I got off the bike and started my transition, and this man ran up to me wide-eyed, extremely excited and shouted \"YOU CAN FUCKING WIN THIS WHOLE THING\".\n\nI don't know why but I got real hyped off that.  \n\nYes I ended up winning.\n\nI finished my first marathon extremely close to the time cutoff, and I was so grateful for everyone who was still there and cheered for me coming down the finish chute - I was bawling!!\n\nAnd on another note, I LOVE spectating races! One of my favorites is a local ultra that's run on a pretty short loop, and my best friend and I will post up in one spot with music and signs and cowbells. It's one of my favorite days of the year!\n\nNot a spectator, but a fellow racer. Was doing a half Ironman on a really tough bike course, with hot temps and nearly 100% humidity.  Got nauseous and started throwing up on the bike.  A fellow racer stopped, stayed with me, made sure I got enough water, and walked his bike with me to the top of the next hill.\n\nI was feeling pretty awful that day, and it meant so much to have someone stop and stay with me so I didn't have to go through that alone.\n\nI paid it forward on the run leg, by walking with a woman who was having a really rough time, and convincing her not to drop out of the race entirely.\n\nDefinitely my slowest half Ironman ever, but also one of the most rewarding.  That's why I race - to be inspired and to inspire others in our awesome community.\n\nNot something she said, but a slogan on a shirt she was wearing - “one day I won’t be able to do this, but today is not that day” \n\nFor context, I was running a 10k while sick. I came down with a cold a few days before, but it was a really unique race that I paid a lot for, so I was determined to run it. At about mile 5 I was beyond miserable and was throwing myself a mini pity party in my head. \n\nWhen I saw her shirt, it changed my perspective completely. Yes, I still felt gross from being sick, but that wasn’t stopping me from running and giving it my best despite the circumstances. It carried me through the rest of the race and I haven’t forgotten it yet!\n\nThe Paris half marathon several years ago (I'm American). I was exhausted, sad, freezing. So many people cheering in their elegant French \"Allez, Allez!\" I felt adiscouraged and alone when I saw a woman smling this massive smile and holding a sign that said \"MOVE YOUR ASS!\" It cracked me up and gave me the absolute boost to finish strong.\n\nThis is such a wholesome post. I just ran my first 10k race last week in Barcelona and honestly had no idea about this side of running, the community, the cheering, efforts that seem so small on the surface clearly make so much difference for runners. \n\nI was a bit worried about running alone and was part of the last group to finish but each and every volunteer I crossed clapped for me and said “almost there” which really made me feel like I wasn’t alone.\n\nCome on, your placed 11th right now and the next 2 dont Look good, you can Catch Them!\n\nOne 1/2 marathon, I was wearing a tank top that said “I am not fast, but I am strong” (a reference to Baymax from Big Hero 6).\nI had maybe a mile or two to go, and this woman practically jumped off the curb to get my attention, pointing at my shirt and yelled ‘YES! YOU! ARE!’\nTo this day I have no idea if she was agreeing that I was strong, or trying to argue that I am, in fact, fast. But she still pops into my head nearly every time I go for a run, and it gives me a little boost. 😊\n\n1. My 20 year old son was at mile 11 of my last half marathon. My heart swelled to twice the size\n\n2. My husband and my son spent the day going from aid station to aid station to see me on my one and only 50K. My son ran (using that term very loosely) the last 2 miles with me. Obviously there were tears \n\n3. I was running a full out of town and feeling like hot garbage at mile 22. We were on a part of the course that spectators really couldn’t get too. The people out there were people that lived on that part. Anyway I look and I see a guy I know from home. I was like what are you doing here ??? He said “oh I’m gonna run with you for a bit if that’s ok”. He ran like a mile with me…then said “that’s it now, only 5K…you got it” and went back to where he was. It picked me right up. I did spend those remaining miles wondering what the hell he was doing there. How did he even get there?   I found out later he ran with some other folks I knew too. He had just come up because he knew we were all running and he knew that was a tough spot.\n\nSomeone at a cycling aid station had chocolate covered bacon. I know I won't see it again, but I always hope.\n\nNot me and not a race.  My mom back in the 90s was trying to get in shape.  She was jogging/walking through the parkway when she noticed Hank Raymonds (former Marquette basketball coach) and his wife walking on the path toward her.  She said he stepped off the path, started clapping and kept saying “keep going! It’ll get easier! Just keep going! Don’t stop! You can do this! Work hard!” and gave her a high five as she went by.  She said just those words and the way he said them with no judgement and complete encouragement was so inspiring to her and she made it to her goal for that day without stopping again.  I’m sure most have had coaches like that- it’s amazing how they can do that.\n\nMy first half marathon. Mile 11 kicked my ass. Mile 12 was a struggle. As I'm about a half mile from Mile 13, I'm seriously considering quitting. It was *that bad*. An older man, in his 70s or older, was walking down the sidewalk, eating a banana. He'd just finished the full marathon.  He saw me, turned around, and ran beside me for about 50 feet. He told me not to quit, to push through because it was worth it. He told me I was *so close* and he knew I could do it. I swear, that little pep talk boosted me enough to finish strong! And I loved it! I think of him often and his words still go with me (although I can't run now and haven't done a race in a while).\n\nNeed to preface here that I am slow, a total back of the packer. \n\nAt my first marathon (Bayshore in Traverse City, MI), a woman who was obviously long finished (she was wearing a Boston jacket) stationed herself about a quarter mile from the finish line and told us how close we were. I was almost 6 hours at my first marathon so she must have stood there FOREVER to cheer us on. “It’s just around the corner. You’re like a quarter mile from the finish. Congratulations! You’re a marathoner!” to every single one of us gutting out that last .2. I will remember her forever.\n\nChicago Marathon 2014 and 2015, a guy in a Santa suit had a sign that said, \"Do you believe in me? I believe in you.\" In 2016, I think there was a sasquatch with the same sign. \n\nIn the 2017 Philadelphia Marathon, spectators in animal onsies running in slow motion to \"Chariots of Fire\". Later on, more onsies with beer 4 oz cups filled up. I was having a rough race, so I stopped spilled some, and they said, \"Party foul, drink another!\" I drank the extra beer, and it put me in a great mood for the rest of the race. \n\nOn the other side, NYC Marathon 2022, I caught a stomach bug and the spectators saying, \"Why are you walking?\" did not help me make it to a toilet faster. I stopped at every toilet in the last half; it was rough.\n\nNot a spectator, but another group of runners. I was cramping up at mile 19 during my first marathon, and wasn't sure I'd finish. I suddenly heard a voice behind me say, \"come on, buddy. You're not done. Let's finish strong. Here, drink this.\" I kid you not, this man pulled a bloody Mary in a water bottle out of his running belt and tossed it to me. 🤣\n\nHim and the couple of people running with him all paced me to the finish. We had so much fun laughing, talking, and yes.. doing a tiny bit of drinking, that I kind of forgot about my pain until I finished. Maybe it's illegal to drink on the course (ha, oops!), but the fact that they cared enough to stop and help me finish and try to forget about my pain was so meaningful to me. It's definitely a core memory and something I'll never forget! :)\n\nDuring a lonely stretch at the end of the Philadelphia marathon, around mile 23, a woman read my name on my bib and said: “I see you, [name]!” and it was awesome! Tearing up now remembering. \n\nNot during a race, but I was on holiday in New Orleans. I was still on UK time and woke early first morning, so I decided to go and run at dawn to try and beat the heat, as I'm not good in the heat at the best of times. Quickly discovered you don't beat the heat, or the humidity in New Orleans, and once the sun came above the horizon I was soon overheating like crazy. As I was running back to the hotel I passed another hotel that had a liveried concierge stood outside, and as went I past him he saluted me and said 'Good morning God'. As a slightly overwight middle aged man, red of face,  sweating like a pig and puffing like a steam train that made me laugh.\n\nLA Marathon - mile 22-23, a random dude steps out a bit to catch my attention. He locked eyes with me and told me to keep my head up and on the pacer flag. I don't know what it is, but I was definitely on the brink of backing off a bit (knee was feeling off). But in that moment it was what I needed, and I did stick with the pacers. Don't know how or why, but the dude seemed to be there just for me at that very moment.\n\nVancouver Sun Run 2023, 1km left, there was a turn to the left that was uphill, and this woman screams IT'S THE LAST HILL I PROMISE!!!\n\nAnd it made me chuckle.\n\nRunning through a residential area during a marathon, a middle-aged woman made eye contact, then yelled \"Look at her go! She's so strong! She's got it all!\" Makes me want to cry every time I remember it. I will remember that moment and that feeling forever.\n\nFavorite spectator sign: \"The pain is temporary, internet results are forever.\"\n\n17 marathons and these are a few of my favorites. \nRun faster or I’m going to miss the Bloody Mary brunch bar.  \n\nI know you trained hard but it’s supposed to rain. Hurry the F up.  \n\nDonald Trump skis in jeans.\n\nI live in a college town and once when I was on a long training run, a group of students who were out playing beer pong stopped what they were doing and gave me a slow clap. I burst out laughing and their energy kept me going.\n\nOn the flip side of this, I was at an Ironman in England a few years back and was making a damn fool of myself with my cowbell and clapper noisemaker thingies cheering for all those athletes doing an incredibly hard thing (this was in the running section). I would make eye contact with them and say something specific about their running. Things like you’ve got great turnover, or way to keep those knees moving. Later someone found me and told me that it was because of me that they finished. He said he was on the verge of quitting but the comment I made was on the thing he’d been working on (don’t remember what it was), and the fact that someone recognized it made me decide not to quit. Chuffed indeed!!!\n\nWhen I ran my first marathon, around mile 22 or 23 there were signs that were spread out for about a half mile telling the story of a young woman who was training for this race but was diagnosed with cancer and passed away before the race. \n\nThe last sign said “she may not have been able to finish this race, but YOU can finish for her”\n\nI’ll tell you I’ve never ran so hard in my life.\n\nI got one, from my very first marathon: I developed what I now know was IT band inflammation around mile 20 and was hurting, bad. Also nervous, because I thought I might be doing permanent damage to my knee. The last hour or so was pretty unpleasant, and also pretty sparse in terms of the crowd.\n\nThere were more people for the last two miles, and around mile 24 there was a sharp left turn. Tons of people with noisemakers, cowbells, and whistles cheering for anybody with the foresight to wear their name on their jersey: “You rock, Jessica!” “Go Rob!” “Almost there, Beth!”\n\nThen there’s me, with only my bib number and what must have been a pretty obvious grimace. No visible name, no personalized cheer—those are the rules. Then as I came out of the corner a thirtysomething woman in the crowd who looked like a very serious runner herself locked eyes and said very evenly _I see you, 1004._\n\nFor whatever reason that simple sentence put a little bit of gas in the otherwise empty tank, and I ran those last two miles feeling like a champ.\n\nIn my very first race, nerves had me questioning if my bib was on correctly. So, I approached  one of the volunteers and asked if my bib was ok. He smiled, said everything looked good, asked me for my name and wished me good luck. Half an hour later, as the race kicked off, a voice came over the speakers for annoucements. To my surprise, the person who I thought was the volunteer was actually the race emcee and he goes \"We've got a lot of first-timers today. Let's cheer them all on, including TurboTabouleh in corral E. She was really nervous but she'll do great!\" It was the sweetest thing ever and made my whole day, week, and month.\n\nYes. \"Allez, allez.\"\n\nKM 40 at Rome Marathon - a couple of American spectators gave me a huge \"LET'S GO, X\" and properly revved me up when I was finding it hard to start again after injury slowed me to a crawl. Will always remember them. \n\nAnd then there was the little girl just after them with the Mario \"Power Up\" sign which I tapped and never stopped running after it. Crowds are great, people are great.\n\nLast semi marathon I was crumbling in the last hill before the finish line and another runner slowed down next to me and said \"we're almost there , come on!\" And this meant a so much from a total stranger\n\nYes, but from another runner. I ran a half marathon barefoot. Lots of the comments from other runners, mostly expressions of anguish as they couldn’t imagine themselves doing that, running 13.1 miles was enough!\n\nBut the coolest one was passing a couple women running together, and one said to the other, “He runs through my neighborhood all the time.”\n\nIt was verification that I *was* disciplined training for something that was beyond challenging. Every morning run was filled with fear… am I gonna seriously injure my foot? What if I get so sore I can’t make it back? I almost died on my 10 mile run… can I make it 13.1? What if the course has terrain I can’t handle?\n\nSo it validated that I was pushing the limits and I did approach the barefoot run strategically and consistently. Anyone that knows me personally would never use the word “consistency” in describing my character.\n\n\"You're amazing, mama!\" at mile 5 of a 10k with my toddler in the stroller. I was really lagging and it gave me the strength to go up the hill.\n\nI sustained a hip flexor injury training for a 5k last year.  Decided to do the race and reinjured myself around the 2 mile point, absolutely could not run, walking was doable, but every step was agony from my inner quad up to my midsection.  I was heading to the finish, ready to abandon and take the DNF, and a few spectators were cheering me on, saying \"keep moving forward!\" \"you're almost there!\"  I finished.  Felt really good about finishing too.  Even tried running across the finish line but that didn't go very well.\n\n“Now’s not the time to quit running. The nearest sag road is further than the finish.”\n\nI was nearing the end of the Revolutionary Run in Washington’s Crossing, PA. It’s an annual July 4th 10K race along the Delaware River. As I was about a quarter mile from the finish line, I heard and saw a lady ringing a cowbell. It nearly brought tears to my eyes. You see, my grandmother used to bring a cowbell to all of our (my siblings and my cousins and my) sporting events so that we’d be sure to hear that she was there supporting us. She had passed four months prior. It was the universe’s way of letting me know that she was OK.\n\nUpon finishing, I went back to tell the lady/spectator how much it meant to me.\n\nAt a low crowd part of my recent half marathon (full marathon people also there) an adult man was by himself yelling about being so proud of us.  It was full 'proud Dad' vibes and really nice after like two miles of uphill.\n\nLike yeah, stranger, I *can* do this, lol.\n\nAlso saw a 'we've been trying to reach you about your cars extended warranty' sign, that was pretty funny.\n\nLast 1-2 miles during the indian wells 70.3, a dude in a jesus costume and an overhead sign walked toward us/parted me and the few runners around me yelling “THE END IS NEAR” in a foreboding tone. It was genuinely one of the funniest moments of my year. Had me laughing in hour 4.5 of pain\n\ni love it when random people on the sideline just read bib names and shout them out.\n\nI love this thread!! Was feeling down and reading stories about the kindness and support we see at races has given me a bit of life. 💜\n\n\nAnytime a little kid gives me a high five I burst with happiness. No sign or words of encouragement can beat that. \n\nOk that’s not true. I raced an Irish themed 5K on St Patrick’s Day and someone had little cups of beer.\n\nWhen I ran the Marine Corps Marathon, this guy had a life-size cardboard cutout of Rocky and was playing the song (This was in the rain too). It was like he was at a rock concert or something the way this guy was singing and having such a good time. It made me smile.\n\nPittsburgh Half Marathon last year, knees locked up at 12.6 miles and three kids who saw me stumble to the side yelled out \"go go go!\" it hurt like hell, but I crossed that damn line.\n\nThis might not fit, but I had driven to a local hotel to pick up my friend before the race. She was rushing around to get her breakfast before we left because we were running late. She had a bagel and was toasting it while realizing she had forgotten to buy peanut butter. It was so early that the breakfast bar wasn’t open yet, but a worker heard her and without any hesitation went to the back and brought her a shit ton of peanut butter. When we profusely thanked him, he just shrugged and said “I’m only half man, half amazing” and after chanting this to each other when we needed a pick me up during the race, we both got a PR."

    "all_comment_text": "I live near a college town.\nWe get xc kids and college students ripping it. \n\nI finished sub 23min and was 180th place 🥲\n\nFastest was a 15 year old with a 15:59.\n\nOurs is a 5-miler.\n\nI ran 7:30 pace for 170th place out of ~1800 runners at that distance.\n\n1st was a D1 athlete running 5:06 pace, he previously ran a 15:17 5k in high school.  24 people ran it under 6:00 pace.  Course isn't particularly fast and conditions weren't great (decent headwind coming uphill for the last mile).\n\nStill wouldn't have it any other way.  Full send boys!\n\nI know it was trouble when everyone was wearing super shoes lol \n\nBut yes, i prefer the competition. Keeps things interesting and fun.\n\nMine was also a 5 miler and I also ran about 7:30 pace, finished like 500th, winner finished at a 4:54 pace 😭\n\nAustin TX?\n\nColumbus OH\n\nI'm sure Austin is similar - two of the larger colleges in the US coupled with a couple million people.\n\nWould have guessed Columbus based on size of race, winner, and the fact my dad was a bit slower than you and finished 200 something. I actually knew the winner back in HS (I graduated in the same year, ran XC for the other high school in the same suburb). \n\nSeems like there are always a few very strong HS/ex college athletes in the top 5 or so, think this year was a little more competitive than previous years as well.\n\nSomeone mentioned it elsewhere, but I'm sad they got rid of the \"pumpkin pie for the first 1000 finishers\" deal.\n\nI don't think anyone got too bent out of shape over it, and it added some fun competition for the 9:00-10:00/mile crew.\n\nTop 46 at my 5-miler were under 6:00/mile paces. Top 200+ were under 7:00/mile. \n\nGranted there were over 5200 finishers.\n\nA couple years back a guy who is now a pro busted out a 4:41 pace for the local 5 miler (he's from a nearby town). The route has a lollipop too, so we all got a nice view of him absolutely hauling ass back the other way long before it seemed humanly possible.\n\nI read this comment and I was like oh wow this sounds like our turkey trot and wtf it was Columbus 😂 it would nice that the rain stopped\n\nOur 10k event is won by a sub 30 every year.   Cash prizes bring out some serious competition.\n\nOur winner was a 15:27, i was in 40th+ place around the 20 min mark. \n\nOh. And our winner, \"dont go all out, you are training right now.\" So he ran that time in a full body turkey suit. Us folks take our running serious, as do you I can see! \n\nCongratulations 👏\n\nI've won my age category and I'm... uh not fast.\n\nOther runs I get lapped.\n\nCongrats. My mom won her age group and left before the ceremony, so my brother picked it up and we gave it to her before dinner, lol\n\nWas it a full size pumpkin pie? That's what our age group winners get.\n\nIIRC it was a gift card for a local grocery store and a bag of chocolates.\n\nDude same with mine! Did my personal best which would normally be enough to place in the teens but nope haha\n\nI am in a beach town of retired people. 5k on the beach fastest time was 17:34.\n\nOurs had a 15:32.\n\nMy local 5k had a bacon station, jello shots and mimosas. #goingsohard\n\nI want to know where this one is…\n\nMight be Maine. I’ve run one there with a bacon station but I imagine it isn’t unique\n\nRound Lake NY :)\n\nWell if you like that you need to do the It’s A Wonderful Run in Seneca Falls, NY. It’s a 5k drink fest. Jello shots. Fireball. Shot skis. People were giving out chicken wings by the soccer field. It’s wild.\n\nThe Dallas trot has an 8 mile course and there’s a whiskey shot station around mile 6 that I look forward to every year.\n\nSo where is this lol\n\nNot very. We had 8 people finish sub 20. They also had the audacity to charge us $50.\n\nThat's insane man. I'm very much a cheap ass but c'mon, a 5k should not be 50 bucks, especially for a small local thing. At that point I'm just gonna go on a speed run lol\n\nI don't know why parkrun hasn't really taken off in the US the way it has in many other countries. A free timed 5k every Saturday. What's not to like ?\n\nIt's massive in the UK. Most weekends there are 800 events which together have about 180,000 participants. And it's all free\n\nI live in the Boston suburbs. We have one in Boston and one in Cambridge. On top of that, a lot of clubs in the area have been offering weekly no- or low- cost race series for many years. They all depend on volunteers. A place like Boston has a big running community, so it's not hard for us. Other places in the US, not so much\n\nAlso there's races that go both ways in MA. Super chill dumb turkey trots in one town then half of the BAA elite team shows up to another.\n\nBecause the logistics don't add up to 'free' here, in most places.\n\nParkruns need a Lot of voluntary Work and, more important, the City has to allow the Route.\nI live in a top ten City in Germany and we Just got Our parkrun month ago - Not in one of the Central Parks sadly. They tried Other, more scenic routes First but the city didnt allow Them\n\nIt’s crazy how expensive some of the smaller local races are getting. I did a 4th of July 10k that was local and it was like $60.\n\nIt’s a fundraiser, so you just donate money.\n\nIn San Francisco, we have a local race nonprofit that puts on races many weeks for the year. It's $100 for all 35-40 races in a year or a $20 membership plus $5 a race or $10 for non-members. The distances are always correct and it's a ton of fun. I raced a big turkey trot (which was a fundraiser for the food bank) it was $40. And a quarter mile short!\n\nYeah it’s our local running store too and everyone is sooo grateful 😒\n\nOurs was $70 this year. Not happening.\n\nOrganizers have gotten wise to the fact that they have very high demand even with outrageous pricing, I feel like 5ks are getting crazy expensive across the board.\n\nJust run a god damned 5k yourself along the neighborhood trail for free\n\nI signed my whole family up for a local kids 1 run and it was $25/person. We didn’t even make it today. My son got sick last night and threw up everywhere. I guess it’s a good donation to whatever charity.\n\nFifty bucks for a turkey trot?!?   Damn, I do not miss america.   My bib for the Athens marathon was 55€.\n\nAround 10 years ago the Columbus OH 5-mile turkey trot offered a free Whole Foods pie to the first 1000 finishers of each gender (about 7000 participants overall back then). I mathed it one year and figured out you would need 9:30ish miles to finish \"in the pie\" and I have perhaps never been so committed to a goal. (Yes I got the pie; no I did not need the pie, my mom had made pie already!)\n\nThat's a lot of Whole Foods pie. What was the entrance fee? (Also, congratulations on winning a pie. I don't think I'll ever win anything with my running. I did find a buck a quarter on the sidewalk one morning.)\n\n$38!\n\nI trust it was a good pie! That's fun.\n\nWell shoot, I’m driving to Columbus now. \n\nMy mother called me this morning to ask if I had “won a turkey” and I had to explain that there was no real prize on the line.\n\n&gt;finish “in the pie”\n\nPhrasing?!? Are we not doing phrasing anymore?\n\nOh Christ I used this phrase so many times that year without ever thinking about this! My husband even said \"lol at finish in the pie\" (thank you gchat for going back that far) and I'm pretty sure that comment whooshed over my head at the time 🤦‍♀️\n\nThe first time I ran the Delaware Ohio trot, every finisher got a full size pie from Meijer. One nice thing about that race is that 100% of the donations go to charity because all the prizes are donated from local companies. This year I did the New Albany trot and just got a mini pie. Age class winners got a full size pie!\n\n[deleted]\n\nLet me in. I reckon I have top 10 potential.\n\nCan I also join, but in a heckle-from-the-finish-line kind of way? I'll feverishly brag about how I could have done better, but never actually do so.\n\nHaha, someone organized one at the last minute in our neighborhood - I missed the post so didn’t attend. Saw at least 6 people trot by the house though. I hate I missed it.\n\nI ran in one (a 5k) this morning that had 1400 people. I ran 17:33 and finished 14th. Winner was 15:58. 54 people under 20 mins.\n\nIf I pay money and get chip timing, I’m gonna go all out! If I want a casual jog for fun, I’ll do that on my own or with a family member, not 1000 other people.\n\nHow old was winner? That was the exact same time as our winner and it was a freaking 16 year old\n\nWinner of our race was 34, beating out a 19 year old by a couple seconds\n\nThat must have felt amazing for the 34 year old, happy for him!\n\nOne of my students ran that speed at a XC race this year. He didn't even break the top 50 contestants. It's crazy how fast they are.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI grew up in a town nearby where this was my local race. Never got to run it because I didn’t get into running until I moved away in my 20s, but man I didn’t learn until recently that like… legit pros have run this race.\n\nWe had over 4000 people between the 2.5 and 4.4 mile runs. I did the 4.4 and got it done in just under 45 minutes the most people they've had since 2019!\n\nIt was an amazing time and amazing atmosphere\n\nIndianapolis? We had a banger today.\n\nRochester NY\n\nI guess we were closer to 5k people but have a similar long/short split\n\nHoly cow that's a lot\n\n‘They say’ it’s one of the largest drumstick dashes in the country and maybe a top 50 largest race nationally. \n\nLooked it up, 4894 finishers. I stood like 1/4 mile from the start and rang the cowbell for everyone. Took 48 minutes for the field to pass by me.\n\nWebster represent! Complete with a mudslide at the end!\n\nI was going to say, those distances sound very Webster-y.\n\nMy first time running Webster yesterday. Wow that hill was slippery. Super fun race.\n\nIt is a blast! Glad you made it out!\n\nI full sent it and about 1/2 down ended up head over ass and got all muddy there was barely any traction left xD\n\nMine seems fairly competitive. We had 1400 people in the 5K. Winner ran 15:07. 45 ran sub 20. \n\nI ran 19:30 and got 35th (4th in the M35-49 group)\n\nWell 14:30 would have put you at 6th this year so pretty hard for an 800 person race. Fun though!\n\nI wonder if we were at the same trot cuz, same.\n\nPretty hard as far as turkey trots go - it’s the oldest consecutively run footrace in the world. Capped at 14,000 runners. Lot of casual and serious runners\n\n[Buffalo Turkey Trot](https://www.ymcabn.org/ymca-turkey-trot)\n\nWe have about 12k-ish runners and actual true elites that compete (Sara Hall, Connor Manz, etc.). It’s an absolute madhouse.  Like running a race and being in a mosh pit at the same time.  Just shy of 5 miles and winners are generally ~ 20 min (give or take).  \n\nSo don’t come here (Manchester, CT) thinking you’re going to win.  Unless you’re a literal Olympian.  And even then you’ll have stiff competition.  \n\nSo I guess we go pretty hard here?\n\nHey connecticutian! I was going to say that my closest turkey trot is the Manchester road race, which is so hard core and famous that it’s not even fun.\n\nOh do not be afraid my fellow non-Olympian.  While the front of the field is pros and such, the rest is your average turkey trot-just 12k people.  Costumes galore, lots of people in various stages of inebriation, and more crowd support than I have seen at any race.  It is such a fun time.  It’s crazy crowded and a total madhouse, but it’s really fun.\n\nHey CT here as well! I kept getting ads for the Manchester roadrace that I thought it was a different Manchester based on the photos. Didn’t realize how major it was. I thought the goshen turkey trot was major. \n\n200 maybe, closest to 20 wins basically lol\n\nBased on the results screen we had 11,252 people this year doing out race, 2.6 or 4.3 miles. A lot of fun even with a windchill of 27 deg. Managed to get my PR for 5k timing and finishing the 4.3 at just over 45 min. Next year my FIL and youngest SIL want to join in the fun.\n\nShould probably note this is my \"local\" anymore, we moved to a new state but come back for Holidays.\n\nWe had a half marathon. The 5K I guess is a turkey trot alongside the kids dash and mile.\n\nIt's like $20, and about 200 runners. Top 10 are sub 20, and the winner sub 18.  All ages and abilities though.  \n\nWe had a literal Olympian at ours.\n\nSame here in Santa Rosa, CA. Kim Conley put up a 16:01 to win the women's overall. Rapid...\n\nWas it a runner?\n\nNah, archer. Everyone was running diagonals to stay safe so their times weren’t great.\n\nIt was Zeus.\n\nLOL yes.\n\nIf it’s New Orleans, it was Gabbi Jennings. Steeplechase. Think she finished top 5 or 6.\n\n22,000 . San Jose, CA\n\nMy wife and I were just talking about this. \nI’m from a town of less than 25k people. \n\nToday, the top three all went under 16 and it’s not a particular friendly course. \nI’ve gotten used to my 19:xx not even placing top 3 in a mid-range age group.\n\nMerely showing up in a Boston Finishers jacket doesn't mean  jack\n\nThis was my first 5k in almost 20 years as I just got back in shape and lost over 100 lbs the past couple of years. I finished a hair over 24 minutes. I was 161 out of over 1,600 and 4th for my age group(50M)\n\n1100 or so in my town's this year. Top 10-20 is almost all high school and college XCers. Winner was about 16 flat with 22 under 20 min. The course is hilly and runs long, so is not fast at all.\n\n\nTop 3 in each age group get a pie and I'm on a run of supplying the family with a really cheap pumpkin pie every year. Took first by one second in the 45-49 group this year.\n\n\nAfter the top 40-50 runners the time really stretches out a lot with an average finish around 39 min.\n\nAbout 12000 runners this year for the 5k, winner was 13:59. 13 14:XX, 16 15:XX, 32 16:XX. Sub 20 was 155th place, not too bad\n\nChicago grant park turkey trot - 5k winner out of 1100ish was 16:43, 10k winner out of 560ish was 33:20. \n\nLess people than I thought there would have been for a major city.\n\nThere were several turkey trots in Chicago, that could be why\n\nSmall town in eastern NC, we had 262 today for a 5K.   I ran it hard, agonizing the whole way, completely spent out at the finish line, and won my age group. The 10K I ran last week was 10X easier.  I might stick to 10K’s for now on.\n\nWe had about 3500 in the 5k. Winner went 14:3x, and over 100 people were sub-20. I don't think I'll do it again; it was very crowded with people who didn't really self-sort despite multiple attempts from the announcer to get slower people to move back. I would have been pretty annoyed, but I was jogging (and walking) with my tween daughter whose only goal was to finish, which she did. My older daughter managed to get ahead of the crowd and place in her age group, earning a pie, which was nice. \n\n&gt; it was very crowded with people who didn't really self-sort despite multiple attempts from the announcer to get slower people to move back\n\nThis is why I didn't run my local Turkey Trot this year. The first mile or so is downhill and you'll have groups of 4 or 5 people abreast, walking, near the front causing issues. I didn't want to risk getting hurt this year after I almost fell last year dodging a slow group.\n\nThis happened in my Turkey trot, too! Except the race organizers didn’t make any effort to sort runners vs walkers that I saw— I was SO frustrated the entire race and twisted my ankle trying to pass a group of walkers. There were 4500 in the 5K and 1500 in the 8K, so not a tiny event!!! \n\nWe have two 5Ks in different parts of town. The larger one is pretty chill with 1300 runners, and just 5% of men go sub 20. The smaller one is 330 runners and 15% of men go sub 20, and it’s known as the fastest open 5k in the state. I did the smaller one today, because it’s just around the corner from my house.\n\nFort Myers. I ran 16:59 and came in 12th out of 3727. We had 6 people sub 16... Course may have been like 0.02-0.05 short\n\nMy little hometown had apparently over 1,600 (the town has a population of 10k). We had two waves. Gold wave for runners expecting to finish 25’and below and then gold for runners expecting to be above that.\n\nLocal 8k a few towns over. Consistently the fastest local race I have run. First male finisher ran a 4:48 pace. First female finisher ran a 5:38 pace.\n\nWhen I was on line for the bathroom, an 80-year-old runner was talking to his friends about the “new guy” in their age group who outpaces them. Just checked the new guy’s pace: 8:19/mile! This runner is 35 years my senior, and he finished before me. Good for him. It’s a wild race.\n\nAbout a thousand people do the Run For The Diamonds, a 9-mile road race, winner gets a diamond. The top male usually comes through in 45:xx (5:00 mile) and female about low 50s. It goes out with a 600' climb from miles 2-4 but the next 3 miles are mostly downhill. Starts and finishes flat. \n\n5th oldest race in the United States!  Not an easy course, finished twice years ago...wanted to break an hour, but miles 2 &amp; 3 make it too hard.\n\n10000 people and the winner ran 14:30\n\nOurs is just a leisure 10k, no entry fee, no official start / finish line. Big group run, 50-100 people depending on how nice the weather is. Guaranteed a few will take wrong turns and end up with 5 miles or 7 miles.\n\nWe had a 3 miler that had 4,635 people. The top finisher ran in the low 14s...There's also a 6 miler that is less well-attended at 592 people, but the winner there ran a 29:58. Not sure I'll be competing for the top spots any time soon.\n\nSide note: the 3 mile race had 170 people run sub-20s. That's pretty solid in my book.\n\nI ran in one this morning that had about 6k people signed up, but it rain/snowed so less people showed up. The winner ran a 14:59 5k.\n\nThere are at least 3 organized turkey trots in Las Vegas. BTW, November is a great time to run here. No snow, no rain, in the 50s. \n\n[Jus Run Turkey Rock](https://vegasoutside.com/jus-run-turkey-rock-5k-2023/) is a 5k road run that starts and ends at a bar, and has a fair share of folks with dogs and strollers. I did this last year and it was ok. It was a little weird to me to pay for a race on a route that I regularly run, and that doesn't require any traffic management, as it's a dedicated multi-use trail. Maybe 200 folks total last year.\n\nBBSC does a trail Turkey Trot that includes 4 distances, from a half to a 1-mile fun run. If you want a race that goes hard, this is the one.\n\nAnd then there's one hosted by Lifetime Fitness, another 5k on paved roads.\n\nSounds like lots of areas could use more small organizers to step up for the slowpokes! :D\n\nI did the trail one a few years ago and it was a lot of fun!\n\nI gave my non-running partner the choice this year of doing the track club one that is fun but super competitive and 4 miles with a couple hills or the main one that is a 5k (actually 2.98 it turns out) that isn't even timed though you do get a bib for photo identification and draws hundreds of runners, joggers (yes, there is a corral labeled joggers), walkers, people pushing strollers, geriatric golden retrievers (who were all The Goodest Pups), people in PJs carrying mugs of coffee that you know were already laced with bourbon at 8am because this is our life now. It's $35 and all proceeds go to support a local homeless shelter.\n\nHe chose the latter and we had a great time. There were probably 5 actually fast runners.\n\nWe get a nice mix of elites for our trot.  Winning time is typically sub-16 and I try to finish around 20.  With a sinus infection the last three weeks, was okay with finishing sub 7/mile pace.  This is the 20th year for the event, so finisher medals are different.  Typically go after the photo booth with props, chicken corn soup from a local restaurant, and I grab a feather from a \"turkey\" during the event for a small prize.  With a long-sleeve shirt, not a bad deal for $28.\n\nOur local (5-miler) had an elite division and the overall winner finished in 23:01 (4:36/m). The freaking stroller division winner came in at 28:06 (5:37/m)… they take it very seriously here\n\nClocking in 28:06 with a stroller is impressive.\n\nOurs has been getting bigger, 1700 people this year i think, but we have several nearby and specifically go to the smaller neighbor city rather than the big city one, so it's a chiller vibe. \n\n\n\nWe took my 70s FIL this year, and he walked it.  Pre race he was clearly expecting to be last over the line and embarrassed etc, but still wanted to participate.  Post race he was so proud of himself, talking about next year and asking about other 5ks.  That's the kind of thanksgiving race I want.\n\nOurs is a 5 miler. It’s a big deal. 21,000 people participated today. And legit elite runners.\n\nAustin? I heard we had 21,000 total and I think we were just shy of 4,500 on the timed 5 mile. I thought hitting my personal goal for pace was great only to see if was very middle of the pack.\n\nYep, Austin. The winner ran 24:30 for the 5 miler.\n\nThere are several in my town but the one I usually enter is pretty casual. 416 entrants this year, 7 sub 20 (mostly high school kids) with a big drop off; a sub 25 got you in the top 30. \n\nThe 10k is a bit more competitive though. 160 entrants with 7 sub 40s (winner was 33:34) and 17 total sub 45 on a punchy course that has about 400 feet.\n\nPretty competitive overall. Over 100 of people were sub-20, which was around 10% of the racers. Winner ran a 5 min/mile pace. For the women, though, the fastest was around 24 minutes, so much less competitive. I’m surprised because we just had another 5K run last weekend\n\nI live in a hilly area but the Turkey trot I run yearly is flat as a pancake. There’s no hope for mere mortals.\n\n12k registered but cold rain tamped it down to 8k runners today. It’s kind of a big deal.\n\n5k, untimed. In the grass (???!!!!) of a park. It did not go hard, other than in unexpected obstacles (sprinklers, mud, roots)\n\nCan someone explain what a turkey trot is? \n\nIs it just a park run?\n\nIt's a race on Thanksgiving. Usually 5k but not always, some also have a kid's mile. Some (like listed here) are legit competitive races, others don't even have timing, it's suuuuper variable based on where you are. Sometimes people dress up-if you've ever wanted to lose a race to someone wearing an inflatable turkey costume, this is your chance.\n\nA Turkey trot is a race (typically a 5k or 5 miler) held on Thanksgiving day in the United States. \n\nThe name derives from the traditional Thanksgiving meal, turkey.\n\nBasically Americans get parkrun once a year.\n\nI didn’t sign up for one but got trapped in my local one by making the mistake of looping an island in my morning run where turkey trotters started flooding the one entrance/exit. Kinda shocked by the sheer number of people; my dog and I had to join them for a mile just to get off the island.\n\nOurs is a 5 miler. 23:01 took the W out of ~4300 runners. That's a blistering 4:36/mi pace. \n\nThis is in Alexandria, VA.\n\nRan in one yesterday (first turkey trot! And longest run I’ve ever participated in!) and it was 8K. First place ran it in 25:20. About 3,000 people registered but it rained so a number of people switched to a virtual run.\n\nThey gave out bagels at the end of the run but those ran out pretty quickly.\n\n1161 runners in a small town, winner was 16.08 on a wet and cold split road/trail 5k. 25 people ran sub-20.\n\nI ran just under 23 and was 62nd.\n\nI saw lots of xc kids warming up, so I imagine pretty hard.\n\nIn Dallas / Fort Worth we literally have 7-10 Turkey Trots. They are located in different cities. The Dallas Turkey Trot is the biggest. There is a 5k run and 8 mile run, probably with 20K runners. The last part of it there is a huge hill! So, depends on which one you run.\n\nOurs is massive.  4 miles.  11k people. Waves from 9am-12pm. Winner ran 4:55 pace.  Top 20 all ran under 6 min mile pace.  Kinda crazy!\n\nFastest at my small town (100,000) TT with approx 85 runners was 15:05. I ran 21:30 (55M) with a groin pull so not sub 20 but was satisfied.  I bet the range was 15:05-45+.  😆\n\nThe guy that won our 4 mile turkey trot won in 19:00. His brother got second with 19:49…\n\n11,000 runners. 4.735 miles. Winner ran 4:28 pace. Female winner was in the Olympics and ran 4:55 pace. Manchester Ct.\n\nOne year our suburban 5miler was insane. we had a local former d1 guy win at 2430. Some guy brought his D3 all American teammates who were too far from home back with him, between them, college athletes and other local runners I got 17th with a 26:40.\n\nI got my 4M PR at mine. It’s still my PR. There’s something about a late autumn short race that gets me going…\n\nOur hometown turkey trot is not timed and the organizers are unsure what the distance is. People run to the end of a street and back. Every other person gets a pie (as determined by race officials).\n\nI pr’d but I’m 90% sure our 5k course was only 3 miles not 3.1 miles 😅\n\nSo hard. Tons of college runners come out of my high school, so it’s fast. I paced myself with a group of high school boys that were using it as a tempo run.\n\nWe all go hard AF. Results may vary.\n\n5k Turkey Trot. 2000+, 200 of them in the “competitive” category. Winner and runner up were sub 15. About 75 or so went sub 18. Most of the others in competitive category below 20. First time doing it for me and will go again next year as the competition helped me get a Masters PR (not gonna touch my college times!)\n\nVisiting family for thanksgiving and an absolute mad lad ran our 5k in 14:31, second place was right behind him at 14:40ish\n\nMine was a half marathon. It’s pretty cool, it’s A good preview for my cities marathon. I ran a 1:45 and 50% in my age bracket, I placed 90th overall, there were a lot of college Xc kids on the circuit\n\nPittsburgh has both a 5 mile and then a 5km option (or a double gobble where you do both with a small break in between). I did 5km only this year and the results listed 3700 runners. The winner was around 15-16 minutes and they had pacers in the starting corrals going down to at least 7 minutes / mile, maybe lower.\n\nPretty stout. It’s a 5 miler and the women’s winner  ran 25:29. Men’s winner ran 23:01. About 4,300 runners total.\n\nThere are a lot of Thanksgiving day races near me. The last thing I need on Thanksgiving is extra stress, and I prefer a 5k  event close to my home with ~700 participants and easy parking. Yesterday I left my house at 7:20am, drove to the start, ran, chatted with some friends after the race, and was home at 9am. Winner finished in 16:25, 13 people under 20:00. I ran unimpeded at just under a 7:00 per mile pace.\n\nJust a couple of towns over was a race of about 1700 that had 16 people finish under 17:00, with a winning time of 15:30.  Still not huge, but instead of finishing in the top 40, I'd have finished around 150.\n\nThen a little further than that is a race that had 1300 in the 5 mile event (won at 25:05) and 3700 in the 5k (won in 16:33). I've run the 5 mile there, and it's well orgnaized, but it consumes much of the morning\n\nTake a look at the [Manchester Road Race](https://manchesterroadrace.com/)\n\nI used to do ours but it’s so political. All the local politicians have a one party lovefest. It’s even named after a local politician who looks like he didn’t run ever. I just want to run!\n\n22:22 at the Andover Turkey Trot (7k entrants) was good enough for 111th I think?\n\n\nWinner was just at 16:33. There is a bigger hill in mile 1 though.\n\nHad someone run it in 14 mins yesterday. Ran it with some friends who aren’t in shape and we did it in 30 mins\n\nOurs is 4.3 miles…I definitely wore super shoes and, while not embarrassed with my time, I’m nowhere near the top finishers.\n\nThe one I did has a 3 mile and 6 mile option. The top 13 finishers this year in the 3 mile were sub 16, with the first place finisher in 14:13. The top finisher in the 6 mile finished in 29:58. I was 196 with a time of 20:20 in the 3 mile. The top folks don’t come out to play.\n\nHad 4 people under 15 in bigger city in Michigan, fastest was 14:41. I ran my goal under 20 so I was pumped but not used to that cold of weather, also went out too fast.\n\nI didn't do it this year but winner was sub 15, looks like about 40 people went sub 20.\n\nI finished 41:25 in the 10k and I was 37th lol. We had some down under 37, so fairly competitive\n\nOurs is set up exactly like every other 5k. Fastest up front slowing back to the walkers.\n\nStrictly neighborhood folks and free so it depends on who is in town for the holiday and who shows up. 1 mile course for kids, 5k for adults. 25 total runners or so this year. I happened to win with a 22:44 but if the HS XC kids are in town or college kids come home, they'll crush me. It's all in good fun though, very little competitiveness.\n\n5600 participants, fastest time was 16:12.\n\nI ran with my wife who clocked in at 38:49, it was her first time running a 5K. She had done the couch to 5K program and the Turkey Trot was the first time she actually ran the whole 5K without having to slow down and walk at all.\n\n5 sub 15. near d1 colleges, also have 3 of the top 5 high schools for xc in my state in this regional. it’s fun\n\nWe had multiple runners in the 14’s this year with the winner running 14:09. Part of me thought I could get top 10, nope, got 71st at 18:18 lol.\n\nMinneapolis Turkey Day 5k had 7000 registered but only 5,600 ran.  First was a 16:12 in a 9F windchill\n\nThe one in my area is pretty big, we had over 6k+ people register and run. I ran a 16:25 and got 25th. The winning time was 14:34 😭\n\nFairly competitive due to a strong local XC program and lots of college kids. Top guys usually in the 15:20-15:50 range and top women in the 18:00s.\n\nWe have around 12,000 participants each year where I am at. There are those who compete, but really most of us are there to have fun, dress up and maybe get a lil tipsy.\n\nCompetitive but not stupidly so. Ran a 33:27 to win the 10k by about 45 seconds (sub 35 would easily get you in the top 3 most years and the winner usually runs in the 33s or 34s). 10k had about 300 people and was the more serious race. 5k had about 3000 people and seemed more casual (winner ran around 16:40). Had good weather (40F and cloudy) and the course was medium difficulty (250ft of elevation for the 10k with most of it being gradual).\n\nThere’s so many turkey trots in my area(like 5 within 30 minutes by car) that the elite runners are sort of spread out.  That said, our race was won with a 16:48 and 22 people out of 749 went sub 20. \n\nRegarding people wearing Boston jackets, I wouldn’t read too far into it. My Boston jacket is the only real running jacket I own, so I’be probably worn it to at least one turkey trot before, and I’m by no means elite.\n\nSan Antonio. First place was 14:03. Sub 17 got me at about 30th place\n\nI heard a guy say at the one I went to in my town that a small town in Massachusetts has one that is 20k people lol\n\ndamn you guys are fast!\n\nI was a course marshal for the Gobble Gobble Gobble in Somerville, MA, which is about 3,000 runners/walkers and the largest trot in Greater Boston. It's truly a mix. The first place finisher did the 4 miles in 20 minutes and 2 seconds. I went to the finish line, and there were plenty of folks crossing the finish line after the 1 hour mark as well. We had elite runners, social runners, families, elderly folks, and walkers.\n\nNot at all. Lots of walkers, even dog friendly\n\nOur fastest time this year was a 14:16. That should give you some context.\n\nJust finished the one near my place.  It was hard only because it was 10 degrees out.  Finished with 26min time. lol\n\nI didn’t run my running club’s Thanksgiving race this year, but I checked out the times.\nI was really surprised at the paces in the age groups — let alone the overalls.\nI hadn’t even heard of most of the runners, but they listed our hometown as their location, and I’ve been running and racing locally for over 20 years.\n\nA professional triathlete won the women’s 10k. \nThe fastest woman in the 5K went to Olympic trials for the marathon this year. \nA lot of current and former collegiate runners.\n\n10K folks. 4 miles. Top time was 28 yrs old in 19:35 so 4:55/mi. Top female was 33 yrs old in 22:33 so 5:40/mi.\n\nFor the women, the 1st HS age finisher was 20th. Colorado women runners go hard.\n\nThe 1st HS age male finisher was 18th and he finished behind Eric Stollar, who is 44. Stollar threw down a 21:43 for 4 miles.\n\nTry visiting Sacramento’s version of the turkey trot. 31k participants this year - there’s always lots of front yard parties for the 5k and this year CJ Albertson won first place at the 10k.\n\ni’m so regretting signing up this year! i’ll have to pay attention next time around\n\nDrumstick Dash had just over 15,000 registered between their different distances.\n\nA little over 5000 people at mine for the 5 miler in southern Ohio. \n\nTop finisher was at 24:30\n\nMy first ever 5K. I finished at 27:40, winner was 14:47, about 1000 participants. \n\nI had no idea what to expect or how I will do. I signed up a month ago with no prior running experience. Ran a 5k on the treadmill the day after signing up and haven’t ran since.\n\nOurs is an 8k with a $50 cash reward if you can bet the fastest time, which is like 26 minutes set by Olympic marathon runner Shalane flannagan.\n\nI go to family in NJ and they do a 5k, with about 280 feet of elevation, they had about 2000 registrations this year but only 1300 or so entries. The weather was horrible 40 degrees and stinging rain. The overall winner was 17:20. I did 19:50 and won my age group (50-54) out of 57 competitors this was a PR for me, the first race I’ve run in real race shoes Asics Sky Paris."

    "body": "I’m a fairly beginner runner. I’ve run off an on for years but never as consistently as this year. I did the Hal Higdon 10k plan in the spring and that was the first ever plan I’ve successfully completed but i didn’t run an actual race. I’ve actually never run in one. I’m now coming to the end of a half Marathon plan and am loving the process and my long runs but I am DREADING running the actual race that I signed up for. Signing up for the race has kept me mostly on track. I missed 3 weeks in the middle of the plan but honestly I don’t think it really set me back too bad. I know if I ran the race i could complete it but I just really don’t want to do it. I’ve thought of just running my own solo run that day to complete the distance.\n\nMy friends keep telling me to do it and I’ll that I’ll feel so proud but I think I’ll be proud of myself no matter where I run my half marathon distance. I can’t tell if I am just scared to run the actual race because I’ve never done it and making excuses or if it’s genuinely just not for me. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this feeling? Is it just nerves or are races just not for everyone? \n\nEdit: thank you all for your responses. They’ve really helped me with my anxiety about race day. It’s nice to know some of you have felt the same way and were able to pull through! I’ve decided to run the race I signed up for. Like some of you said, I won’t know until I try! Thanks again! ",

    "all_comment_text": "It helps not to think of it as a race against other people, but rather as a community of people all motivating each other to test themselves. It can be a lot of fun when you frame it that way. And the support and camaraderie along the the way can really be a positive experience\n\npeople cheering me on on the sidelines always give me an energy boost, no matter how tired I am. I love it\n\nLittle kids wanting high 5s.  They are my people, y'all.  Gives me a boost usually right when I need it.\n\nOne time, someone had a sign that said “hit here to power up” and that was the best power up of my life.\n\nAnd the music bands. You start to hear it from 1 km before and it just becomes louder and louder. And bang there are 10-20 people play music. Instant boost!\n\nAbsolutely, the fun of the race day is the feeling of community, people coming out to cheer and impromptu food/drink stations. Lots of positive vibes. The worst part is the long bathroom lines.\n\nYep. I’m running against me. Trying to find that motivation to move my feet after I stop for a water cup.\n\nBy the end of a race usually surrounded by the same people I’ve seen for the last half a race. Saying “great job” or a friendly nod as I stumble off to chug water or down a banana is a nice thing to do.\n\nMy favorite moment came at the end of a race last year when an older guy walked up to another older guy I’d been running nearish for the final miles and tried to strike up a conversation about being the second oldest runner in town and yadda yadda. Older guy was not having it, one word answers and just basically letting the guy know he wasn’t interested in chatting. (It was a small town race I’d driven to and I imagined them as probably being peripherally aware of one another up until this moment). \n\nAfter the old guy leaves, older guy comes up to me and says “You were paced really well out there. Very even, good job.” It was a nice and meaningful compliment that kinda meant more because it felt honest after hearing him not want to interact at all with the other dude.\n\nYou get to know your little running cohort during races, not necessarily to the point you have to ever talk or acknowledge each other, but man can it be uplifting.\n\nThis is where it’s at. I’m slow as Christmas but love the energy and positive vibes of an organized race.   I think you’ll be surprised how supportive the whole group is in cheering each other on.\n\nI signed up for Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta in 2010 because I thought the idea of walking when everyone else was running would be enough shame to keep me motivated in my training.\n\nThen I got to race day and realized the majority of people there are were just there for a good time. No one would have thought it weird if I had to walk. This is true for races of all sizes. There are only a few people with any chance of winning and most people are just there for the experience and maybe racing their previous times in their own heads.\n\nAnd that being said, there are lots of people that never do formal races and are 100% satisfied with their running experience. There are those who only rarely do races to judge their progress. There are those who would race three times a week if they could. \n\nAll of those are OK. If you want to race, race. If you don't, don't. There isn't any one right way.\n\nThanks for this. I’m like op never been in a race before and I’m also dreading it. Love how you framed it!\n\nAnd it’s a very accurate and honest way to frame it! \n\nWhether you’re struggling for a 2:20 marathon, or a 6:00 marathon, we’re all struggling out there! These events are a fun way to find community, dig deep, and really test our limits, no matter what they currently are\n\nIt's not a race against other people for the vast majority of runners in the race. Most people are placing in the hundreds or thousands.\n\nThis! I also like it as a goal to work towards and a way to beat myself! It’s a big celebration and not a race in the sense that you should need to feel pressure\n\nYou are absolutely right. Best part is that you always find a group of people with equal pace and motivating each other. This and the adrenaline kick at start I love most.\n\nHmm I used to think that way but not after I ran one. Yes there is a competitive aspect, but it’s mostly against myself. I want to finish at the very least. And each subsequent race beat my time from the prior one. It also helps me stay motivated to run - if I don’t, I’m going to struggle during the race!\n\nThe beauty of the challenge of relaxing during a race as you can only find it during a race and it’s an opportunity to grow.  specifically: count to your anxiety with gratitude and joy, and don’t forget to smile.\n\nExactly. I always think of it as a running event not a race, a celebration of all the preparation that we did.\n\nYa 100% this if you're not racing it the half marathon distance is just an experience in a shared challenge and strife...it's kinda pretty great, first one had my anxiety levels going crazy until I actually set off from the line.\n\nThis is it. I just did my first triathlon and got pulled along for the run by someone more experienced. It was the best experience. I think it has a lot to do with what you think about the race going in - I was focused on making it fun, screw the time…and I made a great time and had a blast! \n\nUnless you are an elite athlete, a race is a bit of a misnomer - for the vast majority of us they are just \"officially timed runs with like minded people\" and you are only really racing yourself.\n\nRace nerves affect some more than others, but the first one will probably be the worst.  Once the gun goes and you've run for a few minutes it'll be fine - in my experience it is more the fear of the logistics, where to go, what facilities, being on time etc. rather than the actual run itself.  I've only run to push myself and races do that a \\*lot\\* more than a solo time trial (unless you have an iron will) as you can find a group of similar runners to yourself and it is easy to ignore your brain that is saying \"stop, have a breather\" when the going gets tough.\n\nI've run loads of races from 5K to marathon and the occasional longer trail run over the years - yet I still get severe nerves before a local parkrun I've run many times before, let alone a league race for the running club - but every time I run one I enjoy it during and after, even the ones that go badly.\n\n&gt; Unless you are an elite athlete, a race is a bit of a misnomer - for the vast majority of us they are just \"officially timed runs with like minded people\" and you are only really racing yourself.\n\nThat's all well and good until you accidentally win your division... then it's on like Donkey Kong!\n\n100%! I finished 3rd in my division in my first ever 5k and it completely changed my attitude towards running. I have never placed as highly again at 5 or 10k (despite running faster times) but that single boost from my first race changed my perspective of myself so dramatically. I’m now training to run my first half at the end of October. \n\nIn my experience - the dread and nerves you are feeling are a result of you not having done it before. It fades with each run you do. I think for the most part it is the fear of the unknown, not knowing what to expect, how it will go, what the race setup is like, etc. You'll soon find that none of that really matters - you can get involved in as much or as little of the gumph surrounding the race as you want, all you really need to do is be at the start line at the right time, and then run as soon as they say 'go'.\n\nRun the race. Enjoy yourself.\n\nI’m always nervous before any race haha even a local 5K. Idk why…always feel like I gotta pee or poo even though I know I don’t really have to go haha. And then I have fun once the gun goes off. I even get nervous before big workouts…it’s funny cus my nerves don’t bother me in other aspects of life haha just exercise.\n\nI’ve been running for 6 years now. Ran a handful of marathons/halves and a bunch of 5Ks/10Ks. Always nervous\n\nI'm never able to eat much the morning of a marathon. I'm not nervous, but my stomach is. It's really annoying to not be able to eat before a 42km run... \n\nI just ran my first half and the friend I was doing it with was gagging and dry heaving in the bushes from nerves.\n\nYou're describing not the experience of racing but the experience of *imagining racing*. Afterwards you'll know what racing is like for you, but you don't yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's probably different for people near the front, but as a middle-of-the-pack runner I don't experience the least bit of pressure in a race.  There are going to be tens or hundreds of people finishing before me depending on the size of the event, and I'm not going to put any meaningful dent in that through anything I do or fail to do on race day.  I'm just out there to enjoy running on a closed course or a trail with a bunch of other people who also like to run.\n\nIf anything the race is more fun at the front.  It's more stressful too though.  I'd be surprised if I can run under 18 minutes for a 5k in a solo time trial, but in a race I'm trying to get under 17.  The competitive environment where people don't want to let you pass is incredibly exciting and helps to push past my limits.\n\nsolo or \"virtual\" races are a pale substitute indeed.\n\n&gt;as a middle-of-the-pack runner I don't experience the least bit of pressure in a race\n\nAs a back-of-the-pack racer I find it incredibly liberating. I don't compete for any podium places, I only run against myself. It takes a lot of pressure out of running in races.\n\nIn another comment I just told the story of my first 5K where I accidentally placed 4th OA. I actually hated being in the lead pack because I felt like an imposter and less fit than most of the people I had passed. I had thought I could just blend into the crowd and be mostly invisible. That's how I prefer races. \n\nYou are a beginner.  You are not going to win the race so it’s just a fun day running with a bunch of other people and seeing the sites.  \n\nIf I am honest I have e found races to be the most relaxing of any run because of the circus around races.  It’s entertaining.  Running a twenty mile training run alone somewhere is dreadful. \n\nAnd after your race you usually get a medal and swag and some lousy snacks.  And if you are lucky you get to power up during g your run using spectator’s magical signs.\n\nThis is a great point whether you are a beginner or an expert.\n\nYou will be hopelessly slower than those 140 lb 20 year olds who are going to run 5 min miles, while at the same time you will also be ridiculously faster than the people running 18 minute miles... Welcome to the middle 95%. \n\nJust run the race, and you'll settle into a pace with a group of people close to the same shape as you. Try to reel in a few of them who started off too fast and I promise you will feel great about yourself.\n\nAgree with this so hard! My first race was a half marathon and the lead up to it was so stressful because I put so much pressure on running my fastest and beating people and never stopping to walk and blah blah blah. I put so much pressure on myself that the burnout happened sooner and more often. Once I ran a few more races I realized that ✨no one is watching me and expecting me to run like an Olympian✨i recently got super into trail racing because trail runners embrace mediocrity in a way—it doesn’t matter how fast you go or how fancy your gear is. We’re all just there to eat candy, trudge up hills, admire some views, and eat burritos at the finish line\n\nI am comfortable with 10km distance but I only did one race (3km) which I hated. For me running is me-time to calm me down and do something good for me. So I do not need competition in this hobby.\n\n\nBut this is absolutely up to you and you should at least try it once.\n\nI find that I'm so far back in the field that they're is no pressure to do anything other than enjoy the route, meet people, take photos. I cared a little bit more a few decades ago (f58) but not much\n\nAnd it's quite hard to be last, there's usually a few people who get injured and hobble you the end. This is also an awesome way to meet people and get bigger cheers at the end.\n\nSome of the events I've done locally have a long-time participant, usually elderly, person who always, always comes in last and that's the official-unofficial last person.  They are supportive of everyone, usually have a crazy get-up going on, and get along at a steady shuffle.  I love them, I love that they are out there doing it, and it's inspiration and aspirational at the same time.\n\nHonestly I helped run our local running club for years and was involved in many races. To me the winners were always a bit boring, crossing the finish line like it was no big deal (and for people winning our races, it was no big deal for them--these are modest local races with no major competition). \n\nIt was always the people coming in at or near the end that tended to move me. These were people for whom frequently just finishing a 5k/10k/whatever was a big goal for them, and they were so happy just to finish, frequently crossing with friends/family running with them and cheering  them on, acting like they won the Olympics when done. \n\nWe're all racing against our own goals and demons, motivation is everywhere.\n\nI run to get away from people and myself. Organised racing is not for me.\n\nI've never ran an organized race, but I've ran the distance of a half marathon many times before.  I enjoy being able to step out and running many miles as I want, at my own pace, when I have the time.\n\nsame here, for me a substantial part of the pleasure of running that distance (anything over 10k really) is doing it at a chill pace because i feel like it.  the idea of a strict starting time, being under pressure the whole distance with other people all around is not appealing.  \n\nthat said, i would run a 5k race, it's brutal just pacing against the clock trying to get a PB, a bunch of people might provide a welcome distraction.\n\nSame. I run alone and enjoy having the no-thoughts head-empty time. I don’t want to run in a crowd. \n\nMaybe this will change later but for now 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nI felt this way in high school track meets. I would have a pit of dread in my stomach all day.\n\nRunning races for fun as an adult has a completely different vibe, it feels like a big positive party atmosphere that everyone is choosing to do together. I find it a really fun experience that I look forward to.\n\n(If you're being competitive or pushing for a specific time, it can feel a bit different and stressful).\n\nI’ve been running since 2019 and have never entered a race.  I think about it lots, but at the end of the day, it’s really not for me.  You don’t need to race!\n\nMy comment above is about everybody being different and doing what is right for them, so I'm 99% with you, but I'd still encourage you to try at least one race at some point just to see how it works for you. Sometimes things surprise us, and there isn't much lost if you don't like it.\n\nI had some pretty serious jitters before my first race. I have grown to love the race atmosphere though! It’s not as competitive as I think you’re thinking it might be. Everyone at these races is supportive, kind and will encourage you. Think of it as 100s of people with a common goal, completing it together!  If you have a PR you’re shooting for, a race will help you get there (the adrenaline will make you faster in my experience).  Try it once or twice before you make your mind up on it. Good luck!\n\n90% of my runs are solo so when I do a race it’s pretty much to enjoy the community, run a new route, and get a fun medal at the end. My first “race” was such a positive experience from the super supportive community that it has kept me going for two years now. I say try one or two and if it’s not for you that’s totally fine but give it a chance\n\nUnless you're one of the top runners, it isn't a race.  You're just running with fellow hobbyists.\n\nl've been running for almost 30 years and only paid to race twice. I do \"train\" for certain distances, but I want to be able to run them when I feel ready and willing, not because I've paid money and feel obligated or pressured to do it on a certain day, at a certain time, or in a certain place.\n\n\nMy first half distance was on a whim about two or three weeks ahead of my training schedule. It was absolutely exhilarating and felt good to know I could just go out and knock it out because I felt like it.\n\n\nWhatever works for you and keeps running fun is is just fine. Individual runs and times are just as valid as paying races. You know yourself best. Have fun!\n\nDon't see it as a race, see it as an experience and take in the scenery, you can drop out anytime you like.\n\nI'm the opposite, I find it extremely motivating. The fact that I'm doing what I like surrounded by like minded people does to for me\n\nI only di virtual run.. I don't like race where i have to be in location at specific time and date. Basically i wanna run for my own enjoyment and pace anytime i want. Running is great for my mental health. Being alone and disconnect from everyday grind..\n\nI see a lot of people giving advice and that's very nice. But to answer your question, YES. I've done a couple races a year for a few years now and always feel stressed about them. For me I still sign up here and there because it does help me stay motivated but it's ok to use races for that but to recognize that running on your own is what you like more. Do what works for you!\n\nI used to enjoy the thrill of raceday..nervousness coupled with the excitement…These days I’ve become more injury prone..muscle pulls etc, so I no longer run them…I do miss them a little esp the foreign races but these days I can just get up and run a 10k or HM and that suits me fine…I’ve kind of moved on from running actual official races.\n\nI've ran everything from 5k to half marathons on my own and have been running for years and have never once signed up for an official race. It just seems like an expensive and inconvenient run compared to my usual. I'm nowhere near elite as my splits for half marathon were alternating between 8 and 9 minute miles. Running is secondary to my main fitness goals so I don't feel the need to run any official races. I will say watching my friends or family in their official races is a blast. Id imagine the boost in performance from the additional motivation that comes from race day is cool and very fun to experience but it's kind of a to each his own thing\n\nIt took me a few years to realize it but you don’t have to PR every race. In my opinion it’s more fun if you run your race at your pace. You’ll enjoy the runs more if you’re not killing yourself everytime. I already know I’m not going to win so I just run my race.\n\nI do my best to not sign up for races. There are a lot of reasons. I don't want a set date, don't want a crowd, don't want to be pressured to go fast, having to wait to start, having to drive somewhere to run to name a few. Plus paying to run is weird, especially when they give like 2% to the charity. I just do the distance on my own. I've done 5ks, 10ks, a half, plus sprint and olympic triathlons. \n\nI am currently signed up for a beer fest 5k but that's more for beer and because my friend who doesn't run asked me.\n\nWhen I’m gearing up to go for a PR, yes absolutely. Going through it right now. It all melts away the second I cross the starting line.\n\nI personally think races are great to use as milestones in the journey! Unless you are going for a top spot or an age group, there really is no one else you need to feel like you are “racing” except for yourself/your own personal goals. The atmosphere is usually a ton of fun, and for me I use them as a celebration of all the work I’ve put in!\n\nEveryone's different of course, but races are my primary motivation for running. I love the feeling of everyone being out there together ~~suffering through~~ enjoying the same thing.\n\nThen again, I have a friend who has been running for a few years, but is not interested in ever running a race.\n\nWhat is it about the race that you're dreading?\n\nI've run Tough Mudders, Half Marathons, a full marathon and Spartan Races.\n\nI still get dread the days before 5k races. I have a 10k race this weekend that I'm already dreading, even though I comfortably ran a 10k race last weekend.\n\nSome level of anxiety will be there before a race, no matter what. Every race is a new experience, so you're never sure exactly what to expect. But the more you do it, the easier it becomes. And if worst comes to worst, you run/walk some of it. You're still a million miles ahead of people who never left their comfort zones and stand on the side-lines.\n\nDon't sweat it OP, you've got this 💪\n\nI have never once thought of running a race as running a \"race.\" It's just a run. With help along the way - water/electrolytes, people cheering, mile markers and a pre-mapped course. And fun stuff at the end - food, a medal, usually music, and more people cheering even louder, regardless of your time.\n\nI remember being mildly surprised when I suddenly realized one time that it is actually a race for some people and they're trying to win it. That's a very small minority of the total people running any decent sized race, though.\n\nWhat exactly makes you nervous about it? Do you just not want to deal with the logistics and other people? If so, then I guess races just aren't for you. But lots of people like the community and I've always found it worth it to deal with the sometimes annoying logistics of getting to the starting line and then getting home afterwards.\n\nI’ve placed last at races before and it actually feels great knowing I kept other folks from placing last who’d otherwjse care a great deal and be demoralized about being last. If I’m close to last I’ll ensure I’m dead last, but not slack off so late that it’s keeping the race staff too long.\n\nIt simply does not matter in the grand scheme of things. The only reason I run is the endorphin afterglow, and the glow doesn’t give a shit about your time.\n\nPlease just do it. Yes it’s nervy the first time, but once you’ve done it you won’t look back\n\nIt'd be a good idea for you to see if you can understand where that anxiety comes from, and then take it from there.\n\nIt could be simply because it's an unknown. Unknown course, unknown experience and worries about getting the logistics right - where to park, how early to get there, when to eat, etc. That's totally normal. I get kinda amped up when there's somewhere I'm going that's important for me to prepare for and make sure I'm on time and it's new. I'd recommend getting there extra early so you're not rushing, give yourself to get acclimated, do some warmup runs, light stretching etc.\n\nIt could be a feeling of \"what if I can't finish?\" or \"what if my time isn't as good as my training runs?\" If that's it, you will 100% finish. Even if you have to walk/run some of it, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. You'll see a lot of people doing that along the course. The goal of your first one, or few, is to just finish. If it's a performance question, I'd wager you'll do better than you think you do - there's a lot of energy at race that's contagious. Though I'd also recommend to be careful on your first mile and not go too fast (it happens) which can suck a lot out of you towards the end.\n\nIt could be that you're worried people will be judging you as a newbie, or what you wear, or don't wear. One thing I'll say is that every race I've run everyone is either completely zoned into themselves, or talking to friends or fellow runners they recognize or run with. And it's hard to find a runner that's a jerk...that could just be my perception, but I believe distance runners to be more even keeled.\n\nMaybe you don't like crowds? That's a valid reason. If you still want to do it, go to the end of all the runners when they line up to start. And take your first mile a little slower than you would. It'll start thinning out, and you'll be back with people who are very likely in the same boat you are. You'll be able to navigate through and past people pretty easy, and the field thins out fairly quickly (that is you're not running as a big blob).\n\nBring some ear buds. Even if they don't allow them on the course, you can listen to some of your favorite music up to the start of the race. \n\nHope these points help.\n\nAnd if you run this race and you're like \"no thank you\" there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nI’m socially anxious and the idea of a starting line and running with a bunch of people made me nervous. For so many years I built the narrative in my head that I didn’t need a medal or a swag bag, and that it was more pure to just run for myself…. well I planned to do a mountain trail race course a few days before the actual race. I attempted it by myself and took a wrong turn which resulted in an incomplete feeling after I was done that day, so I forced myself to sign up for the actual race a couple days later. I had the time of my life!!! It was such a different experience and has motivated me to always be signed up and training for a next race. It brought my training and love of running to the next level.\n\nEveryone else has good advice, but I would like to add: reframe that anxiety as excitement. You’re excited to run! How exciting this race is! I’m excited for it!\n\nBodes well for generalized anxiety in other parts of life, too\n\nI think it's normal to feel nervous/uncertain about racing if you've never done it b/c everything feels unknown.  However, my own experience is that performance during a race tends to be stronger than any performance during a training session--something about the adrenaline, sense of community, etc. that you can't get outside of a race. Running with other people in a race often allows people to give their best. \n\nIf you're anxious about racing, a few thoughts:\n\n1) If possible, connect with someone who has raced the race before (and ideally someone who will be racing the upcoming race) and ask them all the logistics details and/or to help get you to the race start.  I find that for a new race, it's not the race itself that's nerve-wracking (you've done all the training), it's all the logistical unknowns that can stress me out (how does bag drop work? what time do I really need to be there? what's the port-a-potty situation?).  \n\n2) Start with small races.  I know you're doing a half training block, but doing a small local 5K/Parkrun or something similar might help ease you into racing and increase your comfort. These are almost always very chill with lots of supportive people.  It's a little rarer, but you can find smaller half marathons as well which can feel less stressful/more manageable than larger city-wide marathon/half marathons.\n\nImo, the race atmosphere helps run the distance as best as possible.\n\nThe race day also gives structure to training. \"I am going to race on this day, so I'll schedule my training like so, and I'll taper leading up to the race to be fresh.\"\n\nObviously, you can just pick your own day and do it, but I enjoy the atmosphere. And it is a bit nerve-wracking, but I enjoy the mental aspect of the whole thing, and the rewarding sense of accomplishment.\n\nAlso, depending on where you live, an organized race might also be the only way to have a nice, continuous route, without time delays due to cars and traffic lights.\n\nI used to get really excited for races, but I don't do as many any these days now that I've slowed down a bit. I still do one marathon per year, but I try not to think of the race as a race, but as a finale to my training. I hate being worse at things than how I've performed in the past, but that just comes with the territory and I have to learn to accept it.\n\nIf you are okay with not worrying about your time, then you can go out there, enjoy the energy around you, and feel the accomplishment of crossing the finish line. Races can be fun with the right mindset\n\n&gt;I can’t tell if I am just scared to run the actual race because I’ve never done it and making excuses or if it’s genuinely just not for me.\n\nThere is exactly one way to find out which it is. \n\nLook, there's no downside to doing the race. Either you enjoy it, or you learn that you don't. Either way it's a good experience to have under your belt and it teaches you something about yourself.\n\nmy last race was 2007. i just enjoy running\n\nyeahhh i was training for a half marathon &amp; it made me hate running. i searched reddit to see if this was normal but read a lot of responses along the lines of “no because i *actually* love running” so i felt like a loser tbh\n\ni’ve since accepted that i love running but i don’t love training and that doesn’t make me any less of a runner.\n\nChill honeybunny, it ain't that deep.  Go run your race, drink the free beer, and enjoy yourself.  Raceday is the best part of a training block, don't cheat yourself out of it.\n\nOP, I just checked your history... you were working on your form back in 2017.  Let me assure you that whatever mental thing you've got going on, after 7+ years of running casually, you can absolutely let go of whatever this hang up is.  You may not be an elite athlete, but you're not a beginner.  Own it.\n\nRaces are not for everyone, that's true. But also most of us here on Earth are at least a little afraid of new things. I feel like that's normal. \n\nYou get used to it and then all that anxiety just becomes excitement.\n\nAs a slow but steady recreational runner, I’m with you OP. I’m not running to win anything or get faster. I do it because it’s exercise I enjoy and it quiets my anxious mind. \n\nI hate how if I’m signed up for a race there’s this pressure to run that particular distance on that particular day. What if the weathers unexpectedly hot/wet? What if I happen to have a cold? Get a particularly bad night’s sleep? Etc. etc. if it was my long run I’d just push it back a day, but you can’t if it’s THE race day. And then as a solo runner, I find it distractingly annoying that there’s always another running that is just a little ahead of me, and then I pass them, but then they pass me, over and over. \n\nThat said, I am glad I did one official half marathon. It’s a milestone and I get to say I did it for the rest of my life. But the only races I find fun are short and super local (like my neighborhood’s annual 5K or themed runs for holidays like a turkey trot). \n\nIf you don't want to run a race, then don't.\n\nI'm not driven enough to be fast so when I run an event (note the term, I am calling it an event, not a race), the only one I am competing with is myself. \n\nSigning up for events keeps me motivated and encourages me to train. I also find them fun and with lots of comradery, a very positive experience.\n\nYES! I started to train for a half marathon at the end of last year with no specific race in mind. Ran the distance just for myself and was happy. Then I signed up for a race and started a new training cycle. I really enjoyed my training. On race day I was stressed out. Before, during and after the run. I did not enjoy a single second on that day. It took me weeks until I found joy in running again. Then… I signed up for another half but didn‘t show up in the end. I signed up for a full marathon next year and keep telling myself that I want to enjoy this race and finish it feeling good. I don’t want to put any time pressure on myself. It would be nice to finish sub 4h but if not I still can say I ran a marathon!\n\nYou want to \"enjoy\" your first marathon and finish it \"feeling good\"?  That's a tall order.  It's still certainly worth doing but you're probably going to be pretty messed up at the end.  That's part of the fun too.\n\nI know a marathon is tough but yes, I do hope that I can enjoy at least parts of it. And feel some kind of happiness/pride/sense of achievement when I cross the finish line.\n\nI would strongly consider a run-walk strategy to increase enjoyment, especially of your first marathon.  I have done 20mins run - 1min walk for a marathon before and it was so much better than all run, all the time.  Even if I was a bit slower, I felt so much better and enjoyed the experience a lot more\n\nHope you're planning on winning a lot of money from this race. That's the only reason to be worried.\n\nYou're only nervous cause you're never run one. Races are a fun party and a celebration of your training\n\nI don't think about it as a race against another people. With 100 some others and being only a novice, there's no way I'll be competitive. I think of them as my \"official\" runs instead\n\nIt's not really a race if you know you ain't winning it, is it?\n\nSo, do not worry about other people, it's you vs you, it's a race against yourself.\n\nOf course the whole even makes you nervous , the people, the movement, the music, it's all very new and different.\n\nThe more you do it the more you get used to it and you'll start enjoying it, it's part of the process of knowing yourself.\n\nThink of it not as a race but a passing-out parade, a victory lap, the successful passing of a test.\n\nRunning, and especially racing, once you can comfortably cope with your goal distance is 75% mental 25% physical. We have to train our minds as we train our bodies.\n\nEnjoy, and if you can't, endure.\n\nNot even a little bit. I can think of few events with less pressure than an organized race. Of all the runners there, only a few are even \"competing\" and those that are tend to celebrate each other's wins. \n\nNo one is there to compete against you.\n\n running for 40+ years. Yes. Usually when trying to qualifying for a \"big\" race. I moved over to trails to relax and enjoy.  Sometimes,  the aid stations have pizza or bacon or beer.\n\nOne other things that the coach says that I really vibe with is that a race is a celebration of your training. It's not about whether you finish first or last, but that you're celebrating all the work that you've put in to get to this point.\n\nI hate running races. You don’t have to run a race to be a runner. Run how you want -\n\nExact opposite for me. It’s what keeps me running. I usually need a goal to strive for or I loose motivation\n\nIt's a fear of the unknown and maybe misplaced expectations. \n\nThese races for 90% of entrants are a \"try it and see\" type thing. The only expectation on any runner is that they give it a go and be proud of themselves for crossing the line.\n\nI've done a lot of races but done my first Half a few weeks back. I was one of the slower ones, started near the back and finished near the back. There was so many people across the whole route cheering and encouraging everyone on.\n\nUnless you are sub 1h 20 (male) or 1h 35 (female), then you are just there to have a good time and test your limits against yourself. Go enjoy it\n\nHave you done a race before? If not, you could find a dinky little 5k somewhere nearby and do it for fun, don't worry about PRs or anything, just treat it like your morning run or whatever. It could be that you'll enjoy it and be energized by the community and good vibes folks are describing, or it could be you just don't like races. Only one way to find out! (But again, I'd suggest doing it on a small race you don't care about at an easy distance.)\n\nWhy the anxiety?  It’s just an extra long run!  \n\nIn fact, it’s even more fun because you’ll have other runners all around you and water/fuel support.\n\nWhen is your half? Any chance there is a 5k prior to that you can sign up for? Maybe this will get some pre race jitters out of the way since you’ll know what to expect!\n\nDo the race.  If it turns out you don't like it, then don't register for another.  But I bet you do like it.  As people have mentioned, it's great hanging out with like motivated individuals.  I have most often done it solo and still loved it!\n\nNot at all. Go in to it with an open mind. It’s what you train for. Do your best and that’s all you can ask of yourself\n\nI second guess my life decisions that lead me to sign up for a race at the starting line most of the time. Then you run that race see the sites, crowds, positive vibes and finish feeling amazingly accomplished and proud along with all the finishers around you.\n\nDon’t think of it as a “race”, rather a large group of people all collectively doing something they love for the betterment of themselves :)\n\nOP In every race of course there will be a little group of people \"the professionals\" who really want to win the race and get the prizes, but those are the minority.\n\nAlmost all of those there just wants to face the challenge of doing it, just for their personal satisfaction or just to have a great time. \n\nSee the race as an opportunity to share the road with a lot of people who share your love for running, nobody will care about the position you will reach, just focus on enjoying the moment.\n\nA road race is just a supported, timed, group run\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE MEDAL! In all seriousness races are a blast and should always be treated as the reward for training, in my mind. You get to run a course no worries about dodging traffic, free drinks along the course. It’s really a lot of fun! Don’t overthink it.\n\nOne way that I've used to offset race anxiety (usually when I'm tackling a new distance) is to think of it as less of a race and more of a demonstration of the progress you've made through the weeks and months of your training. A victory lap if you will.  \n  \nIf you can adjust the focus away from the'race' verbiage and on the day just enjoy the community and atmosphere, talk with other runners, give supporters high fives and finish with no injuries and a smile, that might help.  \n  \nBest wishes for the day!\n\nOp, I think it’s worth sticking through it if it’s your first race.  I find the last few weeks of training are a hassle bc it just gets tedious and is a big time commitment.  But I find the race itself a lot of fun!  Yes, for your first race there’s a bit of nerves but bc everyone around you is also excited and motivated it feels like a Special morning and I find the race a lot easier than the last couple long runs bc I have adrenaline and borrowed excitement on my side.\n\nThe only thing I will say to anyone is that the only person you should be competing against is you! Don't try to compare what you do to what anyone else does! As long as you know in your heart of hearts that you did the best you could.\n\nIt's that fear of failure that is blocking you. Good news is if you dont complete the race you still are alive and well. Even better news is if you complete the race you're alive and well but have now completed a goal. Don't back down. Harness that energy run with the community and don't trip 😜\n\nA lot of people will tell you no in your life, you shouldn't be one of them.\n\nCompletely understandable.  I (56M) was very nervous on my first race 3 years ago.  As I look back, I was very nervous about being judged.  That other's would see how slow I was.  Turns out no one cares.  The running community is there to support other runners of all speeds and capabilities.  I now race 1x per month just to keep some excitement in my running.  It may not be for everyone, but it can be a very welcoming, non-judgemental environment to mix up your running experience.\n\nAlso, I still experience some level of nerves before races, esp ones that are new to me, like my first half marathon.  Nerves are a fear response designed to protect us from new/unknown experiences.  The adult me looks at nerves as a signal that there's something new for me to try/learn.\n\nI just truly started running this past July and did a quarter marathon at a Midnight on the Falls race in WV this past weekend. I was a little anxious as well and the late start time didn't help. The nerves started to subside closer to start time. I just decided to really lean into the experience and the atmosphere which helped. Everyone was super cool and you could tell that the more goal/pace oriented runners made their way to the front of the pack. It felt a lot like organized sports in that the work was already put in (practice) and now it's time to go out and have fun during the race (a game). \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and I plan on signing up for a half marathon in November. I'm sure you'll be hooked once you do it.\n\nYes! What I do is stick to my race plan. For example: first 2 miles @ xxx pace, then 10 miles @ xyz, last mile @ djjejs pace. I trust my training specially my long runs and this works perfectly for me.\n\nHalf marathon is a great race. Don't worry about competing against anyone or any time. It's just a fun race because you get to see sights, and you pass and get passed by the same people multiple times throughout. Just the whole experience is a great time. Don't stress too much, you'll get butterflies at the starting line but that goes away as soon as you take off and get running.\n\nAs someone who did their first half marathon a couple of years ago and felt similar to you, do whatever makes you happy. If you really think that running solo is what you want to do then by all means, but running in races is the most fun I ever have in all my runs. The atmosphere of a race is incredible, and if you're not an elite runner the only competition is with yourself, which turns a \"race\" into just a big community event with lots of cheering and good vibes. In my opinion you might regret not experiencing a race at least once!\n\nNot a bit. \n\nI do my best and feed off the energy and enthusiasm of the others and allow that the push me to do better.\n\nDealing with this right now actually.  I’m supposed to have a half marathon on October 5th but the last few weeks of training have been miserable. I’m tired of training for it and as somewhat of a loner to begin with the idea of being around a large crowd and event makes me annoyed.  \n\nIm sitting at about 23-24 miles a week right now and my latest long runs have been in the 11 mile range so I think I’m going to just do a HM by myself\nThis Saturday and call it a day.\n\nI don’t race frequently but I love the race experience. I almost always PR. It’s mostly because I always go out too fast and have to hold on at the end. Try to enjoy the experience and just run.\n\nMost of the races I've run have been easier than the practice runs preceding them.\n\n\nIt's usually a very positive atmosphere, and the adrenaline gets going a bit with the pressure of the live event\n\nAs others have said it’s not really a ‘race’ the only person you are actually racing against is yourself (and that’s only if you want to) and your previous ‘race’ times. It can be daunting going into your race but I love having races to aim for now it gives me motivation to train.\n\nI’m at little anxious before every race, questioning why I signed up! But once the fun goes off it’s pure adrenaline and I love it!! The fans along the way are awesome too.\n\nI was anxious before my first race but you soon realise that the only person you are racing against is yourself. You'll see fit looking people fall by the wayside and some looking like they could drop dead from clogged arteries at any second sail past you effortlessly.\n\nApart from a few elites at the front no one there is racing against you, there is no pressure. If anything the problem is trying not to get swept along by the atmosphere at the start, you'll soon find your self joking with those around you that you went off way too fast and they'll all be in the same boat.\n\nFinishing position is meaningless, only you're time in comparison to your goal time matters. Even then crowds, heat, or your legs just not feeling it that day can and will regularly scupper any PB times and every person there understands that. In those cases don't take it as a failure or negative, use it as a training run to relax and enjoy the atmosphere and comradery of the other runners and the spectators.\n\nsoft deer rich yoke one chief fine languid punch sink\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nJust for the first times. Then it goes away the more you train\n\nRemember that the real hard part of getting to race day was the weeks of work you put in before. The race day is really a celebration and victory to your determination and hard work. Treat it more as a party and a fun way to celebrate the hard work. I am positive that with a positive mindset and a fun race, you will be able to knock it out the park.\n\nYes absolutely, this happened to me. I got very into my head about it. But I recommend signing up for like a 5k or 10k ahead of your goal race. I started running in the summer of 2020 (covid) and almost exclusively ran by myself up until I was training for a marathon in 2021. I was just a month from my marathon when I realized that would be the FIRST race I actually ever attended. So I signed up a small 5k just to get the heeby jeebies out about being in an event. It was fun - being surrounded by people, some more serious runners, some less serious. Watching people make the mistake of going out too fast and then having to walk half way through. And following people ahead of you - is basically primordial from early humanhood. Since then I've done 4 half marathon events - one for a PR and three just for fun. The distance goes by SO fast when you're surrounded by people and supporters and having people ahead of you almost to chase (as long as you don't blow up your pacing strategy), and then letting it all out in the last .1 mile.\n\nIt sounds like you're making excuses to avoid being out of your comfort zone. It's understandable but I think you need to push past that. \n\nIf you hate the official  race experience you never have to do another one. You can do virtual but I think you need to try it at least once.\n\nI dread racing because I feel external pressure from others to place high or run a certain time. But I'm usually glad I showed up once I'm in it. There are zero expectations on you for this event. You've done the hard work of training. This is just the victory lap to get your finisher medal.\n\nI love race day. I like having something on the calendar to work towards.\n\nEveryone has to have a first race, and there’s only one way to do it: jump right in. And you won’t be the only one doing their first race, there are always a ton. \n\nI was super nervous, too, just not sure how I would do. But once you’re in the corral waiting to start it’s just exciting, you’re surrounded by people who are in there to run, but for lots of different reasons. Some will be chasing a PR, some will be in there for fun because their PR is a lifetime ago and they have no plans to challenge it. Some just like the crowds and the camaraderie. The one thing everyone understands is that they’re there to have fun and race their own race, nothing more.\n\nI find it the exact opposite. \n\nIt may just be nerves that are getting to you since it's the first one, but once you start there's absolutely nothing like a race. Flying down the streets of your city in a way you never get to do on foot alongside thousands of other people is so energizing. The crowds are all there rooting for you and the adrenaline and endorphins will just make you feel amazing.\n\nI put a lot of pressure on myself over races as being the “pass / fail test” of my training and dreaded them as well. I really had to work to reframe it as a fun event that might be my day and it might be a day I just jog the distance. It’s really fun to see people from all walks of life out there doing their best! Maybe just try a 5k to see how it feels?\n\nwhat part of the race are you dreading? i think it depends what's causing you stress. we have a local parkrun and that's done wonders for me, by going along to an organised run with a specific start time it's helped me work on raceday nerves\n\nrace definitely aren't for everyone, but also it might just be scary because it's new. the best way to find out is to try. you might love it! if not, you never have to do one again if you don't want to\n\ni don’t know… i love race day because the energy is so high and exciting. it’s not about winning it’s about doing. it’s like the reward after a hard training plan.\n\nI dread the races where the race announcer does a countdown. They say, \"30 seconds\" then it's, 10,9,8,7,6 lol. I put pressure on myself to run a certain time, which I hate. Sometimes, I run the first mile way too fast and struggle the rest of the way. The best experience came when I held back a little and was strong at the end.\n\nI'm someone who doesn't enjoy racing, especially if it's a race into which I've put a lot of effort to prepare.  I am always anxious that I'm going to let myself down.  I also am unfortunately not at the point where I can show up to a race and not give it my all, so it's just not an enjoyable experience for me.\n\nThat said, I do enjoy the camaraderie of other runners and the spectators that are cheering.  But that's not enough to make me actually enjoy racing.\n\nThere is NOTHING to be worried about.  It's in your head.  Races are shitloads of fun.\n\nOP thanks for posting this. I’m running my first race in 10 days and I’m insanely nervous. All I can think right now is I want to get this over with so I can go back to running like I used to. But these responses have been so comforting. Maybe we’ll actually enjoy the experience?!\n\nMixed bag for me. Having a race to train for helps me be disciplined and organized- esp longer distances. I sign up for races to get me motivated during the times of year I find training easy to slack on- heat of summer and dead of winter. 10k in august and 10 miler in Dec. but I also get race anxiety and if I’m really dreading it, I don’t go. However I found once the race starts I’m fine. It’s the getting there and waiting for the gun I hate.\n\nFear is a powerful motivator. Use it!\n\nI never participate in races to compete or to be fast. I enter them to challenge myself. If you remove the idea of running fast, it will be much less scary.\n\nI say just look at it as an event. Marathons/halves are basically big parties with people who enjoy running just like yourself. Everyone cheering each other on and music playing. I’ve dreaded some in the past but once I got to the convention, seeing everyone on race day, and coming across the finish line… it can be a lot of fun\n\nTreat it like a group training run. I did that with a 5k I ran a couple months ago. I knew I wasn’t going to be competitive but I did want to finish under a certain time (I did!) \n\nUnbeknownst to me until about halfway through the race, another runner was staying with me sorta like I was their pacer. They told me after the race that they had their best finish because they were running with me. So go to your race. You never know what you’ll learn until you try and you may positively affect someone else there.\n\nIve been running since April. Like properly running, 3 times a week. I did my first race, Solihull 10k. Completely fucked it. Took me one hour 40 minuted.  I walked a lot. I was trying to shoot out. First km was 7 minutes, 2nd km was 7 minutes. Then hit the hills...so yeah it was horrible. \n\nDid 10k on sunday. Just a run in one hour 26 minutes. And then finished 12k at the same time as my 10k at Solihull. \n\nMy nxt race is in november. I am able to practice the route so i know it now like the back of my hand. No surprises there. Also, i will run for myself. I wont race with anyone , i wont be in a racing mindset. It will be just a 10k run at a route i know.\n\nI don't think of the races I enter as \"races\", at least not as far as against other people.  I'm trying to put in MY best time, and I don't compare myself to what other people are doing (unless I am able to pass them, then there's a fleeting sense of \"aw yeah\").  \n\nYou don't HAVE to run a timed event after you finish training.  It's not a requirement.  Sure, it can be fun, and getting a medal and some free swag is cool, and if you're lucky there may be adult beverages (if you partake) at the finish.  But if it's not your scene, then it's not your scene.\n\nNah. Race day is about putting all my workouts to good use.\n\nTry the conqueror challenge stuff! Sometimes I prefer to pick a distance/medal and set a day I'd like to do it. No pressure.  If not that day then another!\n\nDon't think of everyone else on race day as competitors... they're your pacers :). A story from my recent 10K race: 1km left at the finish line (32C with humidity).. I was absolutely gassed. A guy slightly behind my pace catches up, taps me on the back and screams let's fucking gooooo. Gave me enough motivation to power thru for a PB.\n\nI feel this. I love training, following training plans, and all the race prep. I freaking hate race day. I hate races and dread the actual event. Like you, I'd rather go run the distance on my own. You are not alone!\n\nUnless you are hoping to win there really is no pressure. Enjoy the experience and run as hard or as easy as you want.\n\nYou’re bound to have some nerves, but don’t think too hard about it. Unless you’re elite level, you’re really only running against yourself and the clock. These races have all skill levels and most people are there to have fun and do their best. So do the same - do the best you can for you and enjoy the atmosphere. You’re not really “racing” anyone. You’re running together.\n\nIf you don’t enjoy it, don’t do it. Everyone has to figure out what they enjoy. For me, I enjoyed the atmosphere of the races and have done about 160 of them. You do you!\n\nI know some people prefer to sign up for races to motivate themselves to do the training, but I think I've avoided the feeling you're describing by doing the running with personally set goals and then signing up for races once I feel I'm more than capable of finishing them - almost like running a race as a sort of final \"test\" of my abilities. I had been running for a few months before I even thought to sign up for a half marathon... I didn't sign up for a half marathon in hopes that it would motivate me to run. I think this approach has also helped me save money lol\n\nAdditionally, I don't think of it as a \"race\" because that word in itself makes you feel like it's a competition. Whether it's a 5k, half marathon, or an ultra-marathon, most people are just running for themselves... as a personal challenge or sorts. Race day is such a fun, energizing, and beautiful experience. It should be something you look forward to.\n\nI have never felt this in the past, probably because all the races I've done have either been really big (things like Rock 'n' Roll half/full marathons, etc) or small community events that were super casual.\n\nBut, I just signed up for the Open race at the Footlocker Invitational Western Region XC Championship and am definitely feeling some early anxiety &amp; pressure already (race is beginning of December).  To be clear, this is an \"open\"/community race that includes everything from grandparents to little brothers &amp; sisters of the athletes competing in the real races, but it's on the same course just following the competitive high school events.  The top high schoolers are running 5-6min miles on a [REALLY hilly](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/recording/mt-sac-cross-country-course--3) (500' of climbing) 5k course ... and my likely outcome is to average 7:30-8:00 miles.  I've never done a race that was both so competitive and so exposed, and I already know I'll being feeling self-conscious.  Oh, and I should mention, too, that the Open race also attracts college &amp; graduate athletes and the top 20ish in the Open race are typically faster than the HS Championship race.  Frankly, it feels a bit like what it is: a casual dad who probably has 50lb on most of the high schoolers, running in one of the fastest &amp; hardest XC races in the country.\n\nGood times!\n\nI've gotten race anxiety every race since high school, even when I stopped running competitively and knew I was going to do much worse than my high school PRs. I even get race anxiety watching other people compete in distances that I've done in the past. \n\nThe thing is, the feeling goes away the second the gun goes off and I start running. I use this to remind myself that once it starts, there's nothing to be anxious about, I'm only going to perform as well as my training plan prepared me, and I can't expect anything more or less. \n\nIf you've never done it before, you should definitely give it a try. I know I race differently when there are other people on the course, or there are spectators at the finish line. I don't consider myself a half marathon runner yet, even though I have completed the distance on my own. To do it in an official race is part of the experience for some people.\n\nFor me, a race is part validation of my dedication to train, part fun time to be around like minded people, and a great running festival. If my training gets too focused on achieving a pace or time, and I start to lose the joy  of just going out for a run, I take a break from racing for a while until I recapture it.\n\nI sign up for races but don’t actually race them. I go and jog my normal pace and enjoy the environment. Maybe one day I’ll try to push myself more, but for now I’m happy with what I do, and I suggest you entertain that mindset a little bit. Race atmosphere is a fun thing to be around and run in!\n\nA lot of these comments are spot on. Unless you are one of the elites, you're not entering a race to win it. You're entering it to test yourself in an official timed environment. My biggest draw for races is the community. There is nothing like getting to the start line early and just being in the energy there. I love the half hour before a race starts. That's what I do all my training for: to be in that moment with all those other people who have the same goal in mind. Just finish. \n\nThe best thing I've read that describes the race is people who have ran Boston. The race itself is a celebration. You're there to celebrate all the work you've put into training. Picture your race as a victory lap. You earned it.\n\nI feel the dread and nerves of a race every time. And then I run it and feel amazing and proud of myself.\n\nRace day is so much fun. I view it as a celebration of all the hard work I’ve already done. Please go and enjoy every moment!\n\nMy slowest times are almost always races. I train like a beast, go for a PR in the final stages of training, then have a blast running comfortably, talking to others and goofing off during races. Been doing it that for 20 years now and I love it, but I get that approach certainly is not for everyone.\n\nThere’s racing where you are hoping for a podium finish and there’s running where you just do the event to the best of your ability or to just enjoy it either way no hope of podium place. I don’t have the ability to challenge for podium place so just go the have fun route or race against my own personal bests. No pressure\n\nNot really, the opposite. I actually hate running unless it’s competitive\n\nJust think of it as a big group fun run, with water stations and toilets.\n\nI think that until you run a race, it's hard to visualize doing a run that is a race against yourself and nothing to do with the rest of the people who are all also doing their own race. I get race nerves and I remind myself that the line between nervous and excited is a pretty blurry one. \n\nBut if the idea of doing a race fills you with dread, then don't do it. You don't have to race to be a runner.\n\nActually, like most aspects of running, it’s all mental.\n\nJust go out and do the race.  In my experience, the only pressure that you’re going to experience is from yourself. If you just run it, as you would any other run, you’ll probably enjoy it more.\n\nDon’t worry about getting passed, or passing people. Just run at your own pace and enjoy the experience.\n\nYeah, I want a personal best and I want to be faster than I was before not necessarily personal best but faster than yesterday. But quite frankly, I’ve looked at these 5K 10K‘s has an awesome workout. There’s no way my heart rates going to be in that zone for that long at Planet fitness or wherever the hotel gym. It’s a good OK let’s just round it up 29 minute workout 58 minute workout or whatever it is and I can only grab, the to do a 15 K it’s a cardiovascular session\n\nNo, I use the people I’m running with to spur me on. “Let’s catch this guy” “don’t let him go past you”.\n\nI don't race often and have only over the past couple of years started entering anything. My take is \"I was going to go for an (insert distance here) run anyway on Saturday morning, might as well do it with a bunch of other people.\" My main things are to push myself to do better than I thought I could/beat a certain pace, have fun, and get some exercise. I still get some nerves, but I think that's mostly the excitement of lining up at a starting line and the energy of the crowd. Also as someone mentioned the fear of the unknown, especially if you haven't run the route before. Tends to all go away after the start. Just have fun. It's just a run.\n\nMy pace is dictated by what song I’m listening to.   Im currently doing a Hal higdon Novice 1 full marathon training plan which is essentially a whole lot of easy slow paced miles.\n\nI never feel pressured. It’s a relief to finally get it done.\n\nAll my best times have been at races. That’s where I PR\n\nNo. That's why you train.\n\nSuggest you complete a warm up race such as a 10k or even a 5 k. Experience the fun nerves and the enjoyment of finishing. You will adjust but be careful with missing 3 weeks of training! Good luck\n\nI find running ruins my running experience 😂😂😂😃😢😭😭😭😭😭☠️\n\nRace is so fun! I’m not winning anything other than having hundreds of strangers cheer me on, free shirt, food &amp; bragging rights that I ran! Running with lots of people &amp; noise is different than running on your own. I love the solitude of training &amp; the togetherness of race day.\n\nThe hard part is the training, the race is the reward.  I've always found the atmosphere at races to add to the thrill of it.  If I didn't have races to look forward to, I wouldn't train nearly as much.\n\nMaybe you’d do better with virtual races. Less pressure and more flexibility. Personally, I just go into a race with the intent to finish. I my performance exceeds my personal best, and even better. I thrive off the crowd motivation and entertainment and the adrenaline from race day. I was actually pretty nervous about my first full marathon (I’ve still only fan 2 fulls). It was the LA marathon and it was an event I had to travel a couple of hours to, get a hotel and my family came. So if I didn’t finish I felt like I would be letting them down. It was such a hot day and I hit the wall at mile 20, but seeing an Elvis impersonator running and pushing his baby buggy that had a boom box playing old Elvis tunes really helped me. I finished at the same time as someone else, a total stranger that I hadn’t even seen along the course and she cheered for me and her and gave me a double high five. It was one of the most fun experiences I’ve ever had\n\nThat’s why I like trail races. It feels like a running hike with amicable strangers.\n\nAbsolutely.  Pressure makes it less meditative for me.   I ran a lot when I was in the army (obv) but it didn’t become a passion/hobby til after and I realized nobody cared about my pace but me.\n\nI think you may have social anxiety. The race is the best part tonnes of positivity and like minded people.\n\nI will stop short of saying that I feel \"pressure,\" but I do feel something.  A certain amount of butterflies in the belly, but it's probably closer to being described as excitement or anticipation rather than pressure.  There's a saying something along the lines of \"the game is won during practice.\"  I think that applies to running as well.  If you've done adequate training, before you even get to the starting line you'll confidently know you can cover the distance.  There's no pressure - you've already \"won\" the race through your prior preparation. \n\nFor me, I like to have races scheduled because it provides a reason for my training.  It keeps me motivated/interested.  I like that races provide support along the route and will block streets etc. so that I can run in places where I wouldn't normally be able to run.  Running right down the center of Main Street on a Saturday morning?  Yes!  Races also provide me with motivation: I need to catch up to that guy ahead of me or, I need to stay ahead of that guy I passed a few minutes ago I can't let him catch back up to me.\n\nI've never heard anybody else mention this but about a mile or so into the race at a spot where most people have settled in to their pace and I'm grouped with my similar paced fellow runners , I make a special effort to be \"in the moment\" and just listen to all of the shoes around me landing on the pavement.  There is a certain stimulation about being part of a herd like that.  Mob power.  I don't ever get that during training runs.\n\nI’m the opposite of you, I hate training to run. But I absolutely love running events. By the end of the year I will have run 3 half marathons, a 15 and a 5k. I know training is part of it, it’s just the part I hate😂 it’s so hard for me to be motivated to run on my own. But an event especially with some of the fees so worth it to me.\n\nI get that but you aren’t racing for anyone but yourself. Like there’s really no expectations other than the ones you place upon yourself. There’s really no consequences to getting out and just doing it, you just gotta get over it.\n\nNo not at all, since I’m slow anyway I just enjoy it, I don’t care what place I finish and just set a reasonable goal for myself.\n\nAbsolutely! Even if I Just think, about running not allone makes me feel stressed\n\nThere’s no rule that you have to run races. I ran 1100 miles last year will probably run more this year and not  one of those miles was in a race.\n\nI had such a good experience with my first race. I invited my parents and sister, it was awesome to see them along the course. That really motivated me.\n\nYou'll probably have so much adrenalin that you'll run faster than you thought you could. That's really fun to experience. And that's why I end up doing more and more races.... It's fun to see how well you can perform under a little pressure. \n\nCan you maybe try and run a 5k first and get something under your belt?\n\n100%. I ran my first half marathon privately @ 6am in the park. I’m good on the crowd and all the cheering. I use running as medicine 💊\n\nI lost some fitness during perimenopause so started doing more trail races instead of road. That way I can still compete and enjoy the community but not compare myself to my old race times. To my great surprise training for trail races actually tapped into a different kind of fitness- I PRed in the 50K by 40 minutes and ran my fastest 10-mile and half-marathon road times since 2019! I still do mostly trails while I work on hormone therapy and it’s great to challenge myself in new ways in beautiful places.\n\nNo. Maybe you should run a race before you decide how you feel about them.  \n\nThere’s no reason to get worked up about a race, you’ll just be one of thousands running against yourself, and you’ll be able to run the distance faster than you can in training.\n\nYeah for sure. I did a relay and was the strongest runner going in so I trained really hard to impress my friends but got hurt doing so and it ruined it.\n\nDon't race if it doesn't motivate or inspire you!  My mantra, from some running book I read long ago, was to only compare myself against the people behind me in the race and the version of myself who could still be home sitting on the coach.  I have never been a super fast runner, and I am definitely slower with age.  But I do still really feel inspired by a race!  Lately I have been into trail runs.  I think the energy of those races is much lower key than road races.  That said, I've been sticking to 10ks and halfs, but most of these trail runs highlight ultra distances.  Some folks run for time, so folks run/walk, some folks hike.  No judgements!  Beautiful locations and super inspiring."

I was big into cycling last summer but when temperatures got too cold, I switched to running. I had already been running 1-2 times per week but very short distances (3-5 mi) with no real plan. In the fall, I decided to run a marathon given I had 4-5 months to prepare. I got into the Boston Marathon by running for a charity. I had never run a race before. I get lots of running injuries anytime I try to increase volume so my biggest worry was staying injury-free. I dedicated lots of time to strengthening, stretching, mobility, and plyometrics to make sure my legs could handle training. \n\nI followed Hal Higdon's 3-day a week plan with some modifications -- most notably, cut from three 20 mile long runs to just one. Overall the Higdon plan is 5 workouts per week (3x running, 2x cross). I also kept my normal lifting schedule (bodybuilding-focused) of 4x/week so it was a lot of work on my body but I tried to make it work. About halfway into the plan I got shin splints. I saw a PT who helped me change my foot strike. It fixed my shin splints but ended up causing runner's knee. I was able to solve that with strength and plyometrics.\n\nRunning through the NYC winter sucked, especially since I run first thing in the morning when temps are coldest, but I didn't skip any workouts. Discipline &gt; motivation. \n\nMy easy pace is around 10:30-11min/mile so was shooting for a 4:30hr goal time. \n\n### Pre-race\nGot into Boston on Saturday -- an easy train ride up from NYC. Ate lots of carbs (Chicken Yaki Udon, Pad Thai, Spaghetti, Bagels). \n\nMorning of the race was my biggest concern. I usually run fasted without caffeine at 6am, but since the start time is 11:15am I knew I would have to have both food and caffeine to make it through the day. For breakfast, I had coffee with a bagel with peanut butter and banana with some electrolytes. I also ate a Clif Bar about an hour before the race. \n\nThe buses dropped me off in Athlete's Village at 10:25am. I thought I would have lots of time to warm up and get changed but they called my wave at 10:40am, just 15 mins later. All I had time to do was go to the bathroom and change my shoes and do some light active mobility. I felt rushed and wasn't mentally prepared. It was a 0.7 mile walk to the start line where I was really nervous as it was my first RACE not even just first marathon. I had no idea what to expect. My heart was racing while standing in the corall with 5 mins to go.\n\n\n### Race\nMy gameplan was to break up the race into three chunks. Miles 1-10: run easy and treat it as an extended warmup. Miles 11 - 21: use my fitness I developed in training to pick up the pace slightly and make it through Newton Hills. Miles 21+: give it all I have left with my heart.\n\nIn reality, this all went out the window.\n\nHere are the challenges I faced immediately out of the gate:\n\nThe first challenge was the heat. It was 70 degrees and sunny. I had done all my training under 40 degrees so I was not used to this at all. Out of the gate, I felt dizzy and was worried I would develop more serious heat exhaustion.\n\nThe second challenge was food. I was nauseous from the start since my stomach wasn’t used to all this food before running.\n\nThe third challenge was how crowded it was. I was in the last wave so lots of slower runners so the entire first 2-3 miles was just weaving around and through people and trying to find some open space to run in a straight line. I wasted so much energy.\n\nThe fourth challenge was water. I usually run with a running vest and sip pretty often, a few times every mile. I wasn’t used to only having a tiny cup of water once every mile. My mouth was dry and I was dying for more water.\n\n**By mile 5**, I was already gassed. I realized I had gone out way too fast and there was no way I could hold this pace for the race so I would need to slow down. I was planning on running 10 min/mile for the first 10 miles but I looked at my watch and my average pace was already like 9 min/mile. This is really fast to me and I was freaking out what to do. I knew I had to slow down.\n\n**Miles 5 - 10**: I felt less nauseous and better with the heat. I actually felt good but had trouble slowing down with all the energy from the crowds. There weren’t really any hills here and so I was cruising along at ~8:45min/mi pace. It was still hard but I was just trying to get to mile 10 where I had planned to put in my headphones and listen to music to give myself a boost.\n\n**Miles 10-13**: I put in headphones and turned on some music. I’m starting to struggle but told myself I just need to get to halfway. ~8:30min/mi pace. This is basically threshold for me. I usually do my interval runs at this pace. \n\n**Miles 13-16**: Just holding steady awaiting the Newton Hills. Somehow going even faster I don’t even know how. ~8:15min/mi pace.\n\n**Miles 16-21**: Dear lord what the fuck.. The hills are way bigger than I imagined. I’m do my training in Central Park in NYC so figured they would be similar to that but I was wrong, they seemed much longer. My legs start cramping. My inner thigh, quads, and calves are spasming. I knew that if I stop or walk, my race is going to be over. I don’t think I’d be able to get my legs working again so I just run through all the pain. I’m downing salt pills and taking an extra gel here to make sure I am getting enough fuel. I start taking Gatordade and Water at the aid stations. It feels like I’m going at 15 min/mi pace but somehow my watch is telling me ~9 min/mi. \n\n**Miles 21-25**: It somehow gets even worse. I only have ~5 miles left but I know there is no way my legs will hold on for another ~45 mins. It will only take 1 really bad cramp to just completely derail me and force me to walk. I’m downing gels and salt pills. I’m gritting my teeth. My legs feel detached from my body. Every time my foot slams the pavement I feel my muscles spasm. Everything is tight. I’m weaving through a sea of people walking and limping like I’m in a zombie movie. I wouldn’t wish this feeling on my worst enemy. I tell myself that this is what I asked for and these 5 miles are what the last 6 months have been about. Holding on for dear life at 9:30 min/mi.\n\n**Mile 26**: With only 1 mile to go, I felt much better. I knew it was only going to be ~10 mins more of pain and the crowds were getting so loud. Once I could see the finish line it was way easier. \n\nI look at my watch and somehow see my finish time starts with a “3”. I’m blown away. Every race predictor and calculator I used online told me to shoot for a 4:30. I even made a reddit post a few weeks ago asking my goal pace and was told a 4:20-4:30 is where I should be targeting. I smashed that by like 30 minutes. \n\n**This was the hardest thing I’ve done in my life. I gave it everything I had and couldn't have gone a second faster. I left it all out there and was ready to die on the course in that last 10k.**  This was a 4 hour battle of dehydration, nausea, cramping, heat, weaving through crowds, downhills, and uphills. \n\n### Post-race\nThe sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. I felt like crying honestly. I waddled through with the other finishers to get some water, pick up my medal, and find my gf. We grabbed some Shake Shack and hop on the Amtrak back to NYC.",

    "all_comment_text": "Congrats.  I ran my first on March 17th and it was so much harder than I'd expected.  Towards the end I was literally delirious.  Unlike you I was more than 4 hours, a guy in a giant duck costume beat me ^^.\n\nFirst one is always the hardest.  Simply finishing is an incredible achievement that 99% of the population wouldn't be able to do.  I always (jokingly) remind myself that the first guy to ever finish a marathon died.\n\nKeep at it and you'll see those times start dropping quickly.\n\nHe died, and the message he died to bring was “we won!”\n\nWent out in a blaze of glory!\n\nGood result.\n\n&gt; I just need to get to halfway. ~8:30min/mi pace. This is basically threshold for me. I usually do my interval runs at this pace.\n\n&gt; Somehow going even faster I don’t even know how. ~8:15min/mi pace.\n\nYou need to recalibrate your training and expectations. 8:30 is clearly not your threshold pace if you can actually hold it in a warm, hilly marathon. It's hard to argue with results surpassing expectations, but I would argue that your expectations are too low for your fitness level. Believe in yourself, and aim high!\n\nI'm wondering how much of this gain in fitness is due to the taper + taking a week off of lifting prior to marathon + carb loading during the weekend + caffeine boost during the marathon + fueling during the morning. I do all my training runs fasted without caffeine and in all my training runs, 8:30min pace felt noticeably harder. Is that possible?\n\nThere’s also potentially a “OMG I’M HERE IN A RACE” factor. The desire to catch up to that person in front of you and to stay ahead of that person behind you can help with speed and endurance.\n\nI definitely think so. I do about 50% of my running in the morning fasted, and the other 50% in the afternoon about an hour or two after I eat lunch. My afternoon runs always surpass my morning runs in speed.\n\nMight be time to start fueling before running harder training runs. It helps to train under similar conditions to how you race -- not every training run, but at least once in a while.\n\nDude you ran your first race EVER, it was a marathon and it was THE Boston Marathon! You really like a challenge. Congratulations! I grew up in Boston and marathon weekend in the city is honestly the best. Its such a fun atmosphere and I get choked up every year reading all the heartwarming marathon stories that come out in the news the day after. So many people run for so many different reasons and its so inspiring. Like I said I grew up in Boston and rhe marathon is what inspired me to start running in the first place a few years ago after I lost weight and I hope to run it one day myself. I doubt I'd ever make a qualifying time but most of the runners run for charities. \n\nI'm sorry you didn't know about Heartbreak Hill ahead of time though. The whole time I was reading your post I was like \"Oh god, they don't know, they DON'T KNOW\". Especially with how warm it was yesterday its such a huge feat to finish! Boston's course is so different from other marathon courses because most of the first 15ish miles is downhill and lots of runners find themselves going way too fast at the beginning because of it. Then by the time they hit Newton and the second half of the race, they're wiped out and heartbreak hill kills your legs if you're not prepared for it. Its a challenge for even the elite runners.\n\nI hope you're relaxing this week and basking in all the glory you deserve for finishing yesterday!! If you're interested you should take a read of this article that Wired did in the course in 2019. It explains some of the reasons Boston is so different from other Marathons. https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-boston-marathon-messes-with-runners-to-slow-them-down/\n\nlet that race euphoria carry you.\n\nCongrats! Most the people I know that ran were killed by the heat and missed their goals considerably, awesome you were able to smash yours!\n\nSick race! Congrats!\n\nAmazing work! Congrats!\n\nWell done, amazing that your first ever race was the Boston Marathon!!\n\nI'm doing my first ever marathon in a few weeks and I'm really worried it's going to be too hot. I've done all my training in the winter and I hate running in the heat...\n\nWhich one did you choose?\n\nEdinburgh (Scotland). I should be OK for heat, but there's an outside chance of an unexpectedly hot day\n\nSpeaking as someone from Edinburgh - I wouldn't worry about that! Where are you from, out of interest?\n\nNewcastle haha although I live southeast England now\n\nYou never forget your first but I dont think it gets better than the Boston Marathon. Holy shit lol. OP is going to be so disappointed anywhere else.\n\nJust curious. How did you qualify for Boston? Your time is a lot slower than the BQ. Or was it based on your age too?\n\nCharity/fundraising spot, I'm guessing\n\nYes, charity spot\n\nHow much were you on the hook for as far as fundraising targets were concerned?\n\nThe minimum you need to raise for the charity I ran for was $10k.\n\nHow did you manage to fundraise $10k? That is equally as impressive!\n\nNote how they're not saying how much they actually paid. Pretty sure OP just bought a spot.\n\nNo shame in that. $10k to charity is a good thing regardless of it comes from one person or many.\n\nI know that if I were rich, I wouldn’t hesitate to buy a spot through charitable donations. There are far worse ways to spend $10,000 dollars.\n\nYeah honestly that's pretty damn cool if people are willing/able to spend that much to run it. It goes to charity plus it's overall just a positive thing to spend your time doing. There's a lot worse things that rich people spend their money on.\n\nThis is probably an unpopular opinion but I could never bring myself to hound my friends and family to send me money so that I can run a race, even if it is going to charity. Despite the fact that most people can't afford it (including myself) I don't really think it's worse at all to come all from the runner, and it might even be better.\n\n“Dear lord wtf” was something I said to myself repeatedly during the race when the sun would not quit. Congrats!!\n\nI worked the medical tent - we had so many people coming in from heat. People were running about 15 minutes slower than average time. You did great\n\nYou ran a really good pace. It’s really cool you got to do Boston.\n\nGreat job. It was a warm one. Very impressed with your pacing especially as it was your first marathon and it was at Boston. Most people thrash themselves the first downhill miles and pay for it later. Sub 4 for a first marathon is pretty good, looks like you can easily get a BQ with some training!\n\nCongratulations! This is amazing! I ran a half marathon 2 weeks ago &amp; my legs cramped at mile 12 for the first time ever during a race. It was BAD.  I'm 62 F, and finished at 2:43:02. I'm sticking to 10k &amp; under 😂\n\nGreat write up! Love that feeling of trying something new and surpassing your own expectations for yourself. Congratulations :)\n\nAmazing effort! Please mail me some of your grit. Thank you.\n\nI am so happy for you and am so much motivated now. I am preparing for my first marathon in October this year and have a target of 4:30 finish. Kudos man!\n\neveryone on this sub: never do anything new on race day, always practice your food and water intake beforehand, it will end up disastrous\n\nmajority of Boston 2024 racers: worst race of my life, my predicted finishing time was 30 minutes faster than my actual\n\nthis guy: hold my beer\n\nGreat effort, what exercises helped your runners knee?\n\nI was already doing lots of squats and leg exercises before I started running. \n\nWhat helped was more active work like loaded jump squats, box jumps, sled pulls, etc.\n\nGreat stuff, thanks\n\nYour first time running in a crowd is a helluva drug. Congrats man.\n\nhahah fuck this really fired me up. good for you man. great run\n\nWay to go. This is awesome- congratulations!!\n\nCongrats! The question is... Where and when is the next race 😁\n\ncan you please DM me what you did to heal from runners knee\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1c6a3v1/race_report_first_marathon_boston_smashed/l011hn3/\n\n[removed]\n\nI'd rather see all the wealthy people in the world spend their money on charitable donations so that they can run marathons than whatever random bullshit the wealthy usually spend money on. I don't like rich people any more than anyone else, but maybe I'd like them a bit more if they were all spending their money on things like this.\n\nYour jealousy and negativity is not needed, or effective. Congrats on your progress, keep working on it, and if you have a problem with charity bibs, take it up with the race directors, not random redditors. \n\nOP, congrats to you as well on a good run. Seems like you've got a lot more in you with some additional training, hopefully this won't be your last marathon (or PR).\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat's why I'm going for a 2:50ish :)"

    "all_comment_text": "This happens in every sport and the only real option is to just roll with the changes.  That is, unless there is some truly remarkable cutover point where there was a dramatic rules or equipment change from one season to the next.  Bekele may be right, but it is what it is.\n\nLike swimming, where they intervened and banned suits.\n\nNot an interesting story, but I was a high school swimmer during this. I remember there were whispers of dudes buying those suits for Illinois conference meets, and then suddenly they were banned.\n\nThat was part of the reason they took action.   \n  \nSwimming has never been absolutely egalitarian (already surrounded by some barriers due to costs of pool access and coaching) but it was suddenly about whether the teenager's family could afford the $400 suit or not (can't remember exact price).\n\nWeren't they also only usable a few times too before they didn't repel the water or whatever anymore. \n\n\nSo $400 or whatever for a suit that can only be used a few times.\n\nSame with our modern super shoes.\n\nDon't forget those beanies with the little propeller on them.\n\nTrue. But I want to see it broken down on a cost per distance basis. Because I thought shoes like the Vaporfly or AlphaFly lasted like 100 miles\n\nProbably 200+ before they should be relegated to training duty only.  But more than $1/mile in most cases.\n\nVaporfly and Alphafly are old news.  The new super shoe the top Olympic marathoners are wearing (just finished first and third) is the Adidas Adios Pro evo 1.  It is $500 and rated for 1 time use (one marathon).  Obviously you can still run in them afterwards like you can still use Vapor/alphafly after the first 200 miles.  But the ‘performance peak’ for the adidas is just one marathon.\n\nI'm not up to date on the latest super shoes since I avoid them because I'm a cheap ass and also don't run marathons. But that's pretty wild about the evo 1 only being rated for one marathon. That's definitely the territory of only something a pro needs to use and not the 4 hour plus dentist. However, types like that are what keeps the sport going I guess\n\n$300 suits that can only be used a few times are still the norm at any competitive level of swimming.  My high school (~20ish people team) would buy 7-8 per year and give them to the people on our relays and anyone with a chance to qualify for state. The rest got old ones, which were still an improvement over normal suits. We would only wear them for the district and state meets.\n\nIt was party because of the water repellent, but also the fact that the suits are *tiny* and stretch like hell to fit the wearer. \n\nI never competed with or against anybody wearing the full suit, but I had a couple teammates get those [ankle-length swim pants](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/nEIAAOSwal5YH1t7/s-l400.jpg) and before putting them on, they were only about as long as hips to just below the knee, and only looked wide enough to fit their *arms* in, not their legs. At the end of the meet, they took them off and they only went about 50% of the way back to how small they were pre-wear. They got a few more ears, but never fit as snug as that first meet again.\n\nsounds about right, can't remember exactly\n\n[deleted]\n\nNot crazy more expensive than a regular good pair of shoes. Half the runners would be wearing a watch that cost twice that\n\nYeah but the watch should be good for like 5 years minimum. Those swimming suits were good for less than 10 wears iirc.\n\nyes\n\nLast fast parkrun I was at I counted about 10 pairs of vaporflys, 4 Saucony speed 3s, a couple of endorphins and a pair of bostons. No one at the front was wearing a “non-fast” pair of shoes.\n\nNitpick time: the only carbon-plated “super shoes” in that list are Vaporflys and Endorphin Pro. The others will last for many more miles.\n\nYeah Speed 3s are my default everyday shoe, I love them dearly but they’re definitely not my race days\n\nYeah, the \"tempo\" shoes with the plate last ages.\n\nAs for new runners being intimated, new runners or beginners don't even know what super shoes are.\n\nEven the Endorphin pros can last a while as trainers after you are done using them as racers. The shoes don't just crumple after 200km-300km and even if you only get that out of it it's only 1$ (CAD) per km. So a parkrun where you are doing a PB attempt is $5? Still cheaper than a race, send er.\n\nI’ve got friends that rave about the Endorphin pros. They have some structure to them, too - “they actually feel like a shoe” compared to the Nike carbon series.\n\nI have gone through 2 pairs of Endorphin Pro 2s, put over 400 miles on both before retiring, actually got the last pair to just shy of 500, but used it as a trainer, and by the end I could tell it was time to move on. Honestly though, don't notice much difference between the old pair and the fresh pair, other than I don't get as many aches running in the fresh pair.\n\nI wear Bostons, the training versions (if you buy last season’s) are the same price as Brooks GTS which I wore for years. They’re great, don’t get me wrong (the Continental rubber on the sole is incredible if you live somewhere wet and run on asphalt a lot), but I honestly don’t think they do anything for my times.\n\nQuick question. GTS are stability shoes so how do Bostons fair helping overpronators (writing as an overpronator)\n\nWhen I started running and got my form checked I was an overpronator so wore stability shoes for years. After a few years of consistent training I started dipping into non-stability for fast sessions and races and ended up racing in Brooks Hyperion for a few years (if you don’t remember them, they were super-light almost racing flats, as was the trend pre-plate). Then after having no issues I made a switch over to adidas Boston 8s for my long runs for their lightweight durability without ever considering my overpronation. I liked the fit so much that I stuck with the Boston’s even after the redesign into a bulky shoe. So I haven’t really worn a genuine stability shoe for 4 years or so. \n\nApologies you probably wanted a short answer, but ask a runner about their shoes… Anyway I don’t want to give a misleading take. Long story short, I’ve had no issues whatsoever transitioning away from stability shoes, but its been gradual as my body has adapted to running. And I find Bostons to be a very stable shoe, had the 10s currently on the 11s. They feel strong for a long and slow, and fast if you start picking up the pace.\n\nEdit: apologies, even my “long story short” bit ended up long-winded.\n\nI love the detail and thank you so much this makes a lot of sense. Also I have a pair of the GTS variants of the Hyperions so all this is good to read. Thank you\n\nI wear Bostons too (and I also got the 12s on sale). The grip and cushion is nice, and the nylon rods add just a bit of pop compared to other distance trainers I’ve tried. I wore Bostons for my last two half-marathons.\n\nI did a short distance triathlon a while back, specifically aimed at the broad public in a relaxed atmosphere. Many people had fancy bikes that closely resemble space ships. Compared to that, a 300$ shoe (and that's the only equipment in running that really makes a difference) almost seems cheap.\n\nThis is one if the main reasons my college-age kid burned out a bit on tris this year. He put in all the hard work and the advantage a top-end bike gave his competitors was a bit more than he wanted to deal with. He does wear super shoes for running, but they’re nowhere near the expense of a top-end bike.\n\nUnless he’s trying to win the races, there’s very little difference between a $2k bike and a $10k bike for the vast majority of riders. \n\nIn my first tri, I placed 4th in my age group and 30th overall out of 400 on an old aluminum bike I bought for $300. \n\nI would have been marginally faster on a nice bike but as a novice cyclist, I can make much better improvements by just training more\n\nYeah, but that top end bike should last you the rest of your life unless you do something terrible to it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAs a new runner yeah that must be intimidating. I think it’ll be worse at the parkruns where you have loops. This one I went to is one of the fastest (according to power of 10) and attracts people like that. It also puts fast and slow by each other as there are three laps of the course and one main bit where outbound and inbound traffic run side by side. At least at the physically bigger parkruns if someone wants to go all out they can do it far away from the others\n\nSounds like Letterkenny\n\nIt’s the legs that put the energy down, some shoes are better returning energy than others via pates, foams and/or aggressive rockers but you still need the legs/training to put you in front.\n\nI don’t really run parkruns anymore but do road races in ASICS metaspeeds (similar to vaporfly) . They to help but I’d say it’s about 15 seconds (max) in a 5k and I’m a sub 18 on a good day (no slouch but not an elite).\n\nAbsolutely you don't magically get to run a sub-20 minute because you paid cash for a super shoe. The prevalence of performance shoes is nearly at 100%. Hell I was in a pair of Hyperions GTS so I'm as guilty. They give me probably a similar boost over 5km (sub 21 so not as good as yourself) but in a pair of Endorphins I think it would be a huge improvement. I can always put it to the test tomorrow morning\n\nAbsolutely you don't magically get to run a sub-20 minute because you paid cash for a super shoe.

I’ll write up a report soon but tl;dr I did everything the same bar the Endorphins Pro 3s.\n\nGlory be the day when I can outperform my Boston 12s.\n\nAll the guys who run sub 16 at my local Parkrun are wearing Brooks Hyperions and Ghosts.  It’s only us slower middle-aged guys who are wearing super shoes.\n\nYeah you knows it!\n\nI wear non-plate regular road shoes and it's a fun game to see how many I beat.\n\nIt's a lot.\n\nWish I could be as fast as you then. I play similar games on hills. How many sprint past me on hilly parkruns when I overtake them on the climbs\n\nNot very familiar with the adyzeros... but when i look for them in google they appear at 70€ to 100€. This seems like a reasonable price, even if they don't last 600km.\n\n\n\nExample: [https://www.tradeinn.com/runnerinn/es/adidas-zapatillas-running-adizero-sl/140551874/p?utm\\_source=google\\_products&amp;utm\\_medium=merchant&amp;id\\_producte=142046389&amp;country=es&amp;gad\\_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw\\_Na1BhAlEiwAM-dm7BacAhBgMawW4GBZ-zSV8r-tR\\_0SQkbpUCx\\_bkL6VZ8ajdk-bpcZTBoCNDUQAvD\\_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds](https://www.tradeinn.com/runnerinn/es/adidas-zapatillas-running-adizero-sl/140551874/p?utm_source=google_products&amp;utm_medium=merchant&amp;id_producte=142046389&amp;country=es&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_Na1BhAlEiwAM-dm7BacAhBgMawW4GBZ-zSV8r-tR_0SQkbpUCx_bkL6VZ8ajdk-bpcZTBoCNDUQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\nAdizero is a running line from adidas that ranges from the SL(SL2 now) which is the basic trainer all the way up to what the Olympic marathoners are wearing Evo Pro 1 which is $500 USD.  Although the high end most non Olympic level runners buy is the Adios Pro 3 which is considered a ’super shoe’  and retails for $200-250 depending on discount.\n\nAh, thanks for clarifying! \n\nI was confused when I looked for them and found a bunch of relatively normal running shoes.\n\nThese shoes also get review bombed a lot because they “fall apart after using”\n\nNike caught a lot of flak for being worse than knock-offs for these supershoes lmao. Which is funny because the fakes are more durable for not using carbon plates\n\nOnly marginally relevant, but this puts a common position of mine into some relief.  I've generally considered *fencing* to be an egalatarian sport because while strength, speed, endurance, and the like are advantages, for most fencers they are pretty far from decisive.  So much so that one of the most common competitive formats is simply \"open\", meaning any age, any gender.\n\nAnd yet that sport is pretty radically far from egalatarian in terms of access.  It requires access to uncommon training facilities and coaching that frequently is well over a hundred bucks a month.  It requires equipment that, even when purchased according to the lax standards here in the US, runs a few hundred dollars.  Some of that equipment is essentially consumable such as the weapons themselves.  They break, and cheap ones more frequently, particularly when handled by people trying to figure out concepts such as distance.  Other parts such as the uniform and mask are made of sterner stuff, but these are close fitting things that kids are quick to grow out of.  It can easily cost *thousands* of dollars a year for a kid to fence - well out of reach of *much* of the world.\n\nSo thanks for making me rethink that notion that it is egalitarian.  I mean, I'd always recognized the economic reality, particularly when I was starting out and struggled to pay all of that myself, but I'd not fully translated that into a bigger picture thing.\n\nIf the IOC actually cared about egalitarian principles. Nearly all winter sports would be banned.\n\nSee my comment further below, but $400 suits are still required for swimming at the club or high school level.\n\nFor what it's worth, World Athletics has responded and limited stack heights on spikes to 20 mm, so all of the road running super shoes are banned on the track. The full regulation doesn't take effect until November 1 of this year, though. That said, the newer spikes are definitely better, but the super spikes are not as revolutionary as the super shoes for road running.\n\n\nOn the road, the stack height limit is 40 mm (conveniently the stack height of Nike's shoes. Surely just a coincidence there). They definitely are making a massive difference.\n\n\nUnlike the swimsuits, though, World Athletics drew the line in the sand where the tech currently sat rather than rolling it back. They also haven't significantly limited carbon plates in shoes to my knowledge, but to be honest, any attempt at doing that would probably be subverted pretty quickly.\n\n&gt; (conveniently the stack height of Nike's shoes. Surely just a coincidence there).\n\nIt would be a massive headache to disallow the vaporflys after a bunch of records were broken with them. Either you retroactively cancel those records - that were fully legit at their time - or the \"newer gen\" has to make do with inferior shoes, and we'd see very few new records the coming years\n\nI somewhat agree with the logistics and also personally think super shoes are no worse than the improvements to the track surface, but do find it funny that they drew the line exactly where the Vaporflys were. It was close enough that Nike actually had trouble where some Vaporflys were measured at 40.5 mm pre race, probably due to manufacturing tolerances or poor measurement precision at the events.\n\n\nThe ruling was made in January 2020, though, and at that point only a couple new world records had been set. Ironically, on the men's side, I checked the 10k (track), half marathon and marathon on the men's side, and the only new record I found between 2017 and the end of 2019 was Bekele's marathon record. They definitely could've put the genie back in the bottle if they wanted to.\n\nInterestingly - it's not just the about the shoes at this point. The Paris Olympic track was built [to \"provide a trampoline effect\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/01/paris-olympics-purple-track/) - so even the track surfaces are being modified to help with speed.\n\nThat's been going on since forever. I remember discussing different school's track surfaces and how they affected times when I was in high school in the 00's. We had one invitational meet and the state meet at Hayward Field, which always produced really fast times because the track surface was always new and cutting edge. There was a rich school nearby at altitude that had a really, really nice surface for a high school, so every dual meet athletes would put up monster times there, especially in the sprints. There was also a local high school that didn't get very much funding at all and was in a region that couldn't collect as much property taxes that had a way undermaintained track, and I didn't even bother wearing spikes at that meet because the surface was so bad it basically neutralized them (I also was a distance runner, so didn't rely on explosive starts).\n\nPeople just never really looked into the innovations of track surfaces until the media hype around the super shoes.\n\n&gt;Fueling typically meant a shot of whiskey, brandy, or other alcohol. Spyridon Louis, winner of the marathon at the 1896 Olympics, sipped cognac with fewer than six miles remaining.\n\nFrom a quick google on marathon fueling.\n\nEverything has improved monumentally. Training, diet, surfaces, shoes, fueling, etc.\n\nAbsolutely true.\n\nMy point of highlighting track changes was more that for Lagat, his fueling and training were likely pretty similar to today - he wasn't fueling with cognac and probably had mostly modern training techniques.  But shoes and track surface are external components that simply money/location can add speed to immediately, which to me is a different class of advantage more than diet. \n\nUSATF &amp; similar can't put limits on diet and training (other than PEDs) but when it comes to external things that can add speed just by existing, I'm not against adding reasonable limitations if it's egregiously effective.  If someone invented slippier water, I expect a regulation to appear in swimming as well (closest analogy there might be depth of the pool isn't regulated and I guess that had effects on swimming this year).\n\nOr javelin where they banned serrated tails and retroactively erased some records set with it.\n\nEven for that it was more about keeping thing fair amongst current athletes, not preserving the record books.\n\nThe governing bodies always favor setting records because it generates more interest in the sport.\n\nI think it was the 2008 Olympics where they were allowed, and I remember that basically every race a world record was broken.\n\nOf note, only 1 (maybe 2) of those world records remain since that 2009 ban.\n\nAnd then a bunch of those records were broken anyways ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ \n\nWell the US suits had a huge writeup in Popular Mechanics on dead trees, and they were worth six figures. They were hydrophobic in one direction only and filled with little riblets.  If you could stay afloat you'd move in the water before you even started swimming.\n\nAnd baseball where you can’t use anything other than a wood bat.\n\nCricket banned aluminium bats 40 years ago then allowed these monster fat wooden beasts that make a mockery of historical comparisons\n\nAren't cricket records still dominated by Don Bradman who was active in the 1930s?\n\nOk, fair enough . I may have been exaggerating. Don Bradman still well out there on batting average. But strike rate (speed of scoring) is out the window\n\nFuck it, go back to doing they Olympics barefoot and naked\n\nI’d be down to watch a barefoot 100m and 3200m events added to the Olympics\n\nOlympic mountain bikes now have AI deciding how stiff the suspension should be in real time. Is it making a difference? Probably not a significant one. But if it does, it fits the same pattern\n\nThat’s wild. When you need to incorporate AI into your equipment you might’ve gone too far, IMO\n\nSeriously. Even Formula 1 banned active suspension in the 90s, even though it was a breakthrough engineers in the sport created which entered the consumer market.\n\nI thought Formula 1 is more about the cars than the drivers. It actually makes sense there, unlike in mountain biking. \n\nThat Williams was insane. I’ve never seen a more dominant car. If they had not banned it the cars would probably be driving without brakes by now.\n\nI was too young for that era of racing to be cognizant of it. But what a time. When you can have a small independent team come up with a groundbreaking technology that impacted both motor sport and road vehicles and lead to pure dominance. They’ve fallen far behind with the difference in budgets but hopefully James can make them competitive again.\n\nWilliams was not a small independent team by then. Even before the active suspension they were pretty good.\n\nThey had many championships back then, but they were still a small team nevertheless compared to the competition.\n\nSo machine learning shouldn’t be used to optimize running shoes? At this point we’re putting the line in a gray area.\n\nIn design and manufacturing sure. But there shouldn't be electronics and a software in shoes. Seems like a practical line not to cross to me.\n\nIt shouldn't, but more because it would be pretty minimally beneficial for the weight cost. Especially for anything on the road or track.\n\nIf person A can only beat person B in the instance where they have hyper optimized running shoes and person B doesn't have them, that's not a victory when person A wins the race. Might say so on the tape, but the racing deities will know, and the person who won in their heart of hearts will know that it wasn't a deserved win, it was a purchased win.\n\nThat’s objectively a different use case but is fair play if you’re trying to race at an elite level or have money to blow. Again, IMO\n\nyou mean it locks out depending on power output? is that AI? last i saw (like nino schurter setup) it was power based, not generated algorithm based on/off etc.\n\nWhat I heard the announcers say was adjusting stiffness, not locking out. But I’ve not experienced it myself\n\noh it looks like they are using the word AI to describe their algorithm/method.  so you are right and I stand corrected! https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rockshox-cross-country-flight-attendant\n\nTbh every \"if/else\"-condition is labelled as AI nowadays, because that sells\n\nyea reading about it i’m not so sure it isn’t a bad marketing misnomer. but it’s def more involved than i thought. and also way above my pay grade rofl\n\nI just skimmed the article, but I'd guess the difficult part are the electronics. The algorithm is probably not simple, but also nothing ground-breaking. But hard to say without an in-depth description\n\nFrom that article, I am also skeptical of really calling it AI. But it’s not clear enough what the algorithm is to know for sure from just that article. For the point at hand, this doesn’t feel like cheating in any way to me personally. It’s essentially letting the practice runs on the course tell the bike how to adjust based on the power output, potentially in a slightly smarter way\n\nRock Shox Flight Attendant. It adjusts the lockout from fully open to fully closed and a few variables in between.\n\ni’ve seen a bit about it. I’m just curious if it really uses “AI”, or if it’s a misnomer because it’s a catchy SEO term these days. marketing folks aren’t always known for knowing what they are talking about 😁😁\n\nit does look super cool though in functionality. wish i needed something that awesome!\n\nI don’t mountain bike, and most certainly not at an Olympic level…but I would think that an outside factor arbitrarily changing suspension compression would negatively effect that level of rider, no? That’s crazy. \n\n“Oh, you think you are a good mountain biker?? What if we randomly take off your front wheel?? Good luck!!” Lol.\n\nI’m sure at the very least it is something they have to train for specifically to get used to. I agree that in general, I’m not sure I’d like the added unknown variable\n\nDifferent suspension settings work best for certain terrain.  The riders know this, but it's either not possible, or too difficult to change all the settings mid-lap quickly enough.  This is basically turning the knobs for you.\n\nIn running terms, it's like if your shoes magically changed from your daily trainers to your tempo shoes after your warm up and before your speed work starts, and then on the way home they magically changed to your trail shoes when you had to cut through on a gravel road for a couple miles.\n\nThat’s what I mean…that someone else is arbitrarily changing those settings. It’s all well and good if I’m cruising along with my comfy long run shoes, but if someone didn’t tell me and slapped on a pair of the most unstable plated race shoes…I can’t imagine it would go well.\n\nIt's not like Nino Schurter showed up at a World Cup race one day and his mechanic swapped his suspension and just told Nino \"good luck\".  You practice and train with new equipment, and then use it on race day after you get it dialed and know it's better than what you were using before.\n\nSo going off the comment I replied to…there’s AI that adjusts suspension settings as the race goes on, right? So can you tell if the AI will decide on the same changes at the same point in the race? And that assumes they are able to ride on the same track prior to the actual race, I don’t know if that’s a thing or not.\n\nWhat happens (and I’m using hugely generic terms as again, I’m not at all knowledgeable in all things mountain bikes) if at turn 3, he is expecting the compression or rebound to be at x, but AI decides it should be set to y?\n\nIt’s entirely possible those sorts of changes wouldn’t make any noticeable difference. I figured if we are talking Olympic level riders, those changes would absolute make a difference. I cannot imagine I would notice, but that’s why I’m not in the Olympics. Or even own a mtnbike lol\n\nPart of your confusion may just be that the system is *way* more simple than the comments here have made it out to be.\n\nThe suspension in question has modes for best downhill performance, best climbing performance, and an in-between pedaling mode.  In the past you'd have a button on your handlebars, or a knob on the suspension itself, and you'd just turn that before big climbs or descents.  Some bikes had little mechanical features that would block oil flow in the shocks if they were titled at various angles, basically detecting climbs with mechanical means, and changing your settings that way.\n\nAll this thing is doing is changing for you, based on the angle of your bike, how your suspension is moving, and how hard you're pedaling.  It can also go in between those settings for like half climb/half pedal, which wasn't possible in their old system.  It's a better version of what's existed in mountain biking for a very long time.\n\nBut it's marketing, and it's bike racing, and it's 2024, so it's AI powered race wining technology to make you 2% faster.\n\nLol. That’s fair. That makes far more sense than what I had going on in my head. \n\nIf we are being honest…mine was closer to like a control room, with several very angry midgets…a panel full of buttons and switches…\n\n“And turn it to rigid suspension….NOW!” \n\nAlso worth noting is that I’m extremely bored at work, this is likely the result. Lol.\n\n&gt;Also worth noting is that I’m extremely bored at work, this is likely the result. Lol.\n\nAren't we all? This is what keeps reddit working.\n\nRock Shox Flight Attendant shocks and forks. 1.8% speed improvement has been claimed. You can buy them, not a ton more, but not worth 1.8%\n\nI've never met this Bekele bloke, but why are his records any better than those set 10 years before him, when shoes were surely worse? Humans are always iterating and improving. If you want a true objective measure of physical dominance (and evolution), competition ought to be naked.\n\nYou should  lobby the IOC about this. Go to every meeting with a NAKED SPORTS NOW sign.\n\nThey should race on cinder tracks like Roger Bannister.\n\nEven the pools in swimming are faster now than they were a few decades ago. I'd assume the same would be true for tracks. And that's disregarding all the stuff behind the scenes, like sports science, superior performance tracking, better medicine.\n\nThat's not saying I'm against naked sports btw. On second thought, my main sport (BJJ/submission grappling) would be very uncomfortable without clothing\n\nHe ran barefoot. 🙂\n\nI mean their training and nutrition are also better\n\nSome sports have the opposite issue. There are records in baseball that will never be broken because of how the game is played today and how the players (assets) are treated so the investments the owners have made in them don't get derailed because of injuries.\n\nZatopek is widely considered one of the greatest runners of all time.  His former Olympic records wouldn't even be an OTQ today.  This is just how it is.\n\nExcept the difference is, that this is rapid.  Not to discredit your point.  I believe it’s important to recognize that just because you have the WR, it doesn’t make you the best ever. Bekele’s a significantly better runner than Cheptegei (who’s really fucking good).\n\nWith that logic, his (and many others previous records) would then be subject to the same criticism. Technology is constantly improving and his technology was far better than that which came before him. It’s a continuous cycle.\n\nExactly. He had the benefit of running on a track that wasn’t just cinders. He absolutely benefited from technological advancements. Come on, what a silly thing to argue.\n\nFunny you should say that, just reading this week that Herb Elliott (Australian middle distrance runner) won the 1500m Gold in 1960 in the a time that would have made the 2024 final. 1960 was apparently a track made of crushed scoria and he was wearing long spikes.\n\nEdit: my source was incorrect (thanks u/throwawaymac83), Herb's Gold medal winning time would have only beaten two of the semi finalists at Paris 2024 and would not have qualified him for the final. The underlying point is still relevant even though the example isn't as cool as I thought it was.\n\nYou mean wouldn’t have made the final? Wasn’t his WR a 3:35? I believe it took sub 3:33 to make this years final. Nonetheless, it feels like we can say that about most races and events these days. The standard is constantly being pushed further and further.\n\nI stand corrected. Good pick up.\n\nI trusted the source (Australian public broadcaster) and accurately communicated what it said: [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-07/film-celebrates-running-legend-herb-elliott-and-percy-cerutty/104191896](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-07/film-celebrates-running-legend-herb-elliott-and-percy-cerutty/104191896)\n\n&gt;Elliott ran a time of 3:35.60 in 1960 at Rome. Incredibly, his effort on a track made of crushed red scoria (volcanic rock), and achieved while wearing running shoes with 2.5-centimetre spikes, would still have been enough for him to qualify for the final at the Paris Olympics.\n\nBut, I didn't check my facts and the source was wrong. \n\nSlowest qualifier for the 2024 final was 3:33.03: [https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/results/athletics/men-s-1500m/sfnl--------](https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/results/athletics/men-s-1500m/sfnl--------)\n\nThe article also said:\n\n&gt;Elliott won gold in 1960 in a time that would still have secured Olympic qualification six decades later\n\nAnd that's not right either because the Olympic qualifier is 3:33.50: [https://assets.aws.worldathletics.org/document/64b027b60f3d42ed998901b5.pdf](https://assets.aws.worldathletics.org/document/64b027b60f3d42ed998901b5.pdf)\n\nThey could have said: \"wouldn't have been last in the slower of the two semi-finals\" but that doesn't have quite the same ring to it.\n\nAppreciate the correction! I’m more fascinated by how the article got so many things wrong than anything else lol\n\nIt's a bit of a worry. They used to be a highly trusted source of journalism. They still do good work but the quality is definitely off, even just the level of typos is disturbing. Funding cuts and time pressure probably.\n\nwoah\n\nY’all see the 100m? You needed at least 9.93 to make the final. The so called 10 second barrier means nothing now. Defending gold medalist Lamont Jacobs ran 9.85 and got 5th place.\n\nI mean the only thing that makes sense are those pacing lights, the shoes, other gear, fueling before race/during training cycles/during race (for longer races) has constantly been evolving and changing and as you said he had far better gear than people 20 years before him... \n\nBut yeah those pacing lights do make life easier because you don't have to watch your watch constantly to keep the pace, and everything can be easier. Then again, you also have the pacers in races since I remember watching athletics so I don't know if that's just a better pacing technique... It's tough to draw the line for sure\n\nThis. When do we start taking score of equipment? I love Bekele, but he’s tilting at windmills here.\n\nThe true world champ is from the footprints of the ancient hominid guy who was determined to be running at around 23 mph barefoot\n\nUnless there's more than the odd set he probably just did the 60 yard dash.\n\nAn athlete of any sport can only be judged against his contemporaries.  \"Who was the greatest of all time\" is a game for fools.  As for track, of course they have technological advances.  As long as everyone in this day and age has access to them, and those who are charged with protecting the integrity of the game do just that, there is no unfair advantage.\n\nThe \"greatest of all time\" argument in sports is literally just a fun thought exercise/debate for me. Same with what if so and so didn't get injured or had the diet and training of 2024 instead of cigarettes and diet Pepsi (talking hockey here now lol) of the 80's. \n\nBut I'm able to not get super invested. I've noticed that's harder for some. 😅\n\nExcept, 80s hockey..., Gretzky was the greatest!\n\nI'm a Pittsburgh fan, so I get to be all BUT WHAT IF LEMIEUX DIDN'T HAVE A BAD BACK AND GET CANCER. \n\nSee, it's fun. \n\nBut hockey really is the sport where there is a consensus #1.\n\nNo one ever will wear 99, all the way through to the youngest league\n\nAlso probably Brady, he won more Super Bowls than any franchise in the league so far. He was also in the top 5 for playoff wins among NFL franchises when he retired.\n\nBut he benefited from an era of NFL that had rules super beneficial to offenses, particularly QBs. Defenses in the 2000s-2020s could *not* get away with the shit that Elway, Montana, Marino, etc had to deal with.\n\nHe won more championships than anybody else in the league, than any other team, but he did so in a different environment than GOAT claimants from past decades. Brady doesn't have any stat like Gretzky's \"If he scored zero goals his entire career, he would still have more points than the second-highest scorer in NHL history\".\n\n(For the record: Gretzky also played in an era that was overwhelmingly favorable for offenses as well. He would've been dominant in any era but his points record is the result of his talent crossed with being born in the right year)\n\nIf you take away all his goals, Gretzky still has the most points in NHL history. Maybe the most dominant athlete in any sport ever.\n\nNot hockey per se, but basketball. Years back, Larry Bird was on a podcast where he said, heavily paraphrased, \"In my day, obviously we took our practices seriously. But outside of practice, our 'diet and exercise regimen' consisted of 'jogging to McDonald's'.\"\n\nExactly.  Gymnastics is far more technical and powerful now than in the 1970s, where grace and form were important.  The advancement in equipment is notable.\n\nWatching clips from yesteryear, it's not comparable.\n\n&gt; “Who was the greatest of all time” is a game for fools\n\n\nNah bro Bekele built different, you don’t rack up that many golds and that set of PRs by accident\n\n\nTime Machine scenario he beats everyone \n\nLike I said...\n\nI’m incredibly skeptical that any old athlete could beat the modern ones, even if they had all the advantages the modern athletes have. There are more people in the world and FAR more people who compete in these sports worldwide than ever before. Just by sheer numbers you can safely assume that the best right now are better than the best in the old days.\n\nBreaking: Athlete past their prime thinks it was better back in their day\n\nCan we forward this thought to about every retired NBA player in the 80's/90's please?\n\nYeah I’m very skeptical that Jordan is actually better than current players. That’s pretty much not how any sport works\n\nI actually agree with you, but be prepared to be down voted into oblivion. The Jordan/James debate makes people INSANE.\n\nBekele had better, faster shoes than those that preceded him, and more advanced training and recovery science. It’s all part of any sport.\n\nIt's not just technology, it's all the science that goes into training an elite athlete too. Should old world records be considered superior because they didn't have the same dietary supplements we have now? Or as the article points out, high mileage training?\n\nYeah, every minor body movement is studied in detail to get the absolute maximum efficiency. The training resources today are much better for all sports. It makes it hard to compare athletes across eras, it’s not all equal.\n\nYes, the \"supplements\"\n\n\"Supplements\" aside, even just modern nutrition science puts training on a different level than in the past. How would the greats of the past have changed if they were eating the diets of a modern athlete during their formative training years?\n\nThis keeps coming up.\n\nBy his own logic, Bekele's records are unfair. He had spikes and a rubberized track.\n\nDo it barefoot on a cinder track or it doesn't count.\n\nSo everyone should be in heavy leather shoes, 1/2” spikes and running on cinders so that we line up with roger bannisters time frame?   Kenny was tough as nails and would have slaughtered cheptegei et al. Head to head.  But time didn’t work out that way.   \n\nSo happy I got to see Kenny dominate and change the sports (track and xc) the way he did.\n\nIMO we will see a sub 1:59 marathon in a decade. We are still in super shoe infancy.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah Kiptum was amazing I can’t believe he passed away so young\n\nOnly 35 seconds away, super shoe or no, someone could push that.\n\nSub 2 probably in a couple years, I could see it as low as 1:58 by 2040. \n\nmarathon used to be the retirement home for the diamond league. now you got these teenagers targeting going pro early in the marathon. Its the glamour distance sport now.\n\nWell Bekele's records were set before a test existed for synthetic EPO, so I'd say that roughly cancels out the shoes.\n\nI thought his records are from 2004 and tests were available before that?\n\nHmm just looked it up, you're right! Not sure where I had heard that it didn't exist. I'm not sure when it was reliably used though\n\nYou should check out this TED talk by David Epstein (Sports Illustrated, author of *The Sports Gene*): [Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8COaMKbNrX0&amp;t)\n\nIt's not all about technology. Nutrition has changed. Training has changed. Culture has changed. But yeah, tech has changed too.\n\nAre the records set in the 80s unfair?\n\nYes. Anyone really thinks Marita Koch is such an outlier talent? For me, greatness is seen in domination against contemporary competition, which changes over time and it‘s still impossible but so much fun to discuss who’s the best all time.\n\nIf it was only a matter of new technology etc., there wouldn't still be running records (at least national ones) several decades old.\n\nAnd if those technologies are here to stay then things are fair to everyone currently involved and that's all I care about.\n\nSomeone setting a new record doesn't diminish Bekele's records at all.\n\nFine.  Then Paavo Nurmi was also superior.\n\nI think the best point made in this article is tech could be deemed unfair when most or all competitors don’t have access to it. In Kipchoge’s 2016 Olympic marathon win he was one of the only competitors wearing super shoes.\n\nSuper shoes nowadays are fair game tbh, it's having two dozen pacers etc, or elite biomechanical analysis etc that is unfair.\n\nHe is correct that new technology makes things easier. But that also applies to his records, compared to those set before him.\n\nHe's already a legend, hopefully he doesn't ruin his legacy with this\n\nThis is literally the purpose behind the Olympics. Pushing the boundaries of human possibilities through competition. Technology is a big part of that.\n\nYour personal effort isn't the point nor is your superior genetics.\n\nShort answer: No.\n\nLong answer: If this is the case, you should lock the records to what they were a hundred years ago because of all the progress made since then. \n\nIdiotic take.\n\nWell, the flip side of this is that nobody has beat FloJo's 100m time yet. Probably the majority of athletes from the 80s were on now banned \"supplements,\" and apparently wind measurements are suspicious. Either way, we haven't reset that record yet, so it's so far been impossible (despite better shoes and tracks) to beat that time.\n\nI compete in Olympic weightlifting and I really like the way they've done it. They tweak the weight classes and the old record is just set in stone. That athlete has a permanent, unbeatable record. There are no more competitors in that weight class because it doesn't exist anymore, and new athletes set new records. Consequently, they've reset the records several times over.\n\nNot sure how that might apply to running, but I feel like we should somehow define maybe 10-20 year blocks of time where everything resets. Maybe the 5k becomes 5001m :)\n\nIt's also really nice to see how times decrease over the years too, though, with changes to exercise science, technology, and so on.\n\nInteresting. I was thinking the other day how different the men’s 100m sprint results would have been if they’d decided 90m was the best distance to race over!\n\nReally interesting article.  I like that author (have read his book Endure, it got me into marathons).\n\nThat said I agree with Bekele and having re-calibrated Robert De Castella’s 1987 marathon world record in alphaflys he is the first to break 2 hours and is the current holder of the WR.  Go Australia! Let’s go Deek!!\n\nI see the point. It would be interesting to have some standard performance standards for comparison. With super shoes, and super tracks, super human efforts become more human than before.\n\nThey definitely help, but it's only half the difference. Modern athletes have better training, nutrition, and recovery after decades of research have gone into identifying the most effective ways to improve.\n\nIt’s going to be interesting to see this in the long run. I.e. next 100 years. While technology gets better our environment and genes get worse. Who knows if microplastics, geneticly modified food and more sedentary lifestyle might lead to slower top athletes. Alan Turing an amateur ran a 2:46 marathon on leather shoes and rough roads in 1948. What do we think he could do today?\n\nPeer-reviewed citation for \"our genes get worse\" please.\n\nIdk man.\n\nLook at the world records from the first Olympics and look at the same disciplines records now.\n\nI bet Pheidippides could run sub 2:00 in vaporflys\n\nYo think of how much further Leonidas would have kicked that messenger if he was wearing a vaporfly\n\nI know you’re just joshing but I want to see a Mythbusters-style breakdown of which shoes are best for kicking messengers now\n\nThis is literally every sport. That guy gotta humble himself\n\nThis one made me laugh. Yeah. Professional sport doesn’t exist today without gear. And yeah. People today know better what and how use the gear. And yeah. Today’s gear is better and purer than the gear used 20 or 30 years ago. \n\nAnd nothing I wrote was about shoes, shorts, shirts or socks. \n\nProfessional athletes rely on peds. And this makes the biggest difference. Shoes A or shoes B - that is marginal.\n\nThe pacing lights seem excessive to me because they're not available to most runners in most venues. They're also substantially similar to a pacer in a major marathon- you can't get someone with fresh legs to come in at mile 20 (this is one of the reasons why Kipchoges sub 2 hour is not official). \n\nThe shoes now have regulations on stack height and number of plates, plus they're available to even amateur runners. These seem similar to the shift from cinder to rubber tracks, which made a huge difference several decades ago.\n\nThis is the beauty of the Olympics, every four years we get to see how much the sport has advanced whether through equipment,\nTechnology or science/sports medicine\n\nThat's why sports should be played naked as in ancient Greece\n\nWould certainly make parkrun more interesting…\n\nAnd the shoes Bekele ran in were far superior to those from 20 years before. Synthetic tracks are better than cinder tracks. Technological improvements are just part of the sport\n\nAt this point it feels like all running records should actually be credited to Nike for their shoe technology.\n\nI mean sport evolves we can't compare the last results to current gen. It is what it is.\n\nYet a distance runner from the same era, El Guerrouj, has records that still stand. Maybe Bekele isn’t as superior or as much of a legend as he thinks he is.\n\nHeard a speaker talking about how the Olympics track was somehow of a faster type to help records. And we had plenty.\n\nIf everybody has the same access to upgrades, it’s equal playing field\n\n[deleted]\n\nHey now, that settings..."

    "all_comment_text": "Bins after the water / feeding stations. It amazes me how often these are not provided.\nA follow-up email after the event with a link to the results. Again, might be normal in some places.\nBest of luck with your new role!\n\nAlso, bins on both sides of the road! If you want to throw some gel packaging out or whatever but don't want to grab water, this makes it so you don't have to swerve to the side of the road where the station volunteers are. Just keep your lane and free space for those who do want to grab water.\n\nYes!  It’s taking your (or someone else’s) life in your hands to cross the flow of runners.\n\nAlso if they are they are often too close to the water station. I can’t drink that fast! And then people just throw them on the ground instead making a bigger mess. One race last year had them spread out farther from the station and it was glorious.\n\nYES! And BIG/wide bins or a drop area (like a tarp). It’s hard to aim a flimsy paper cup into a tiny bin while running!\n\nYes, they need to be positioned in places where they'll be of practical use to runners\n\nBins with like a massive target, basketball hoop or funnel to make it easier and more fun to throw your bottle/cup in.\n\nI've done some that have a QR on the bib that takes you directly to your results.\n\nMake sure you keep the finish line set up at least until the race cut off time.\n\nI remember I did a race once. I was well within the time limit, but by the time I got to the finish since I was on the slower side (still inside the time limit) , but they started deflating the finish line arch they had! \n\nIt was not a good feeling.\n\nThanks for this! That is unacceptable, everyone deserves to cross the finish line especially when within the time limit.\n\nOne time my buddy finished last (later learned he had a broken bone in his foot) the whole event cheered him on to finish.\n\nMy favorite race company gives you a cookie ice cream sandwich when you finish. Probably expensive, but I think they started as a local run club and that must have been their post-race tradition.\n\nAs a back-of-the-pack runner, my heart hurt reading this.\n\nTHIS.\nI have finished SEVERAL races, from 5ks to a full marathon, within the time limit, where the entire finish line setup was packed up except for the timing mat. Photographers are often long gone too, so even though I’ve paid in advance for photos, I often get none or only at the start line.\nPlease please please support your back of the pack racers!!\n\nETA: Please have multiple porta potties available throughout half marathons\n\nYeah I’ve come way back of the pack plenty of times lol, but this one was probably the worst one because I saw the arch, and as I got closer it kept getting smaller and more deflated and I figured out what was happening lol. It was worst because I felt I had JUST missed crossing under it by probably less than a minute.\n\nOh yea - we won't tear anything down until the last runner crosses. That's a big deal! I can't believe that happened to you.\n\nYeah my husband and I joke about it to this day. It’s our hometown race so we do it every year. That year I did the 10k, the following year I did the 5k and I said “because I want to make sure I make it inside the arch!”. During the 10k I was averaging maybe 12:20/mile? So I knew I wasn’t absolutely the last one but it was a little disheartening to be detoured around the arch because they were actively taking it down already🥲\n\nThat would be so disheartening, sorry you experienced that. \n\n Race organisers should remember that everyone is at different points and have different things going on, just because they are behind the pack doesn’t mean reaching the finish line isn’t a massive achievement for them in that moment and that deserves to be celebrated.  E.g. I just did my slowest race ever a couple of weeks ago but it’s one of the races I’m most proud of because I’m still in recovery from having flu (proper sick for 10 days flu) less than two months before.  The majority of runners aren’t racing against the other runners, they’re racing against themselves and trying to do the best they are capable of in that moment. \n\nOnce in high school, I got put in the 2 mile with really fast girls and got lapped 😭 and they set up all the hurdles while I was still on my last lap lol \n\n\nFML it was*so embarrassing* for high school me, I wanted to die\n\nOne thing that I love is if there are free photos available from on the course. You can have higher quality available for purchase, but the free photos being there is fantastic!\n\nThis is a BIG one. Over the last few years I've noticed more and more races using photo services that charge an outrageous amount for photos, like $40-100. This really stinks. Photos are much better than a bag of random calendars/sunglasses/microfiber sheets/other knickknacks.\n\nYeah it's a shame they're like $40 for the full set of photos but at least if you only like one really good photo then you only have to shell out.. Oh, just one photo is $35. Nice, thanks \n\nI'm really sad enmotive is shutting down because I really like how they do photos. I ran Detroit last week and you get free photos, medium resolution with the race banner at the bottom, but at least no watermarks over your face. Or you can pay like $10 for high res without the banner.\n\nWait they are shutting down?!???! I need to get my Detroit photos too!\n\nYeah they stopped taking new events and will completely shut down at the end of 2024. So you still have time to download past event photos.\n\nhttps://www.racedirectorshq.com/news/enmotive-announces-ceasing-of-operations-in-surprise-announcement-916/\n\nPhotos are my favorite swag\n\nSeconding this. Did my first marathon (a trail marathon through mountains) and only found out afterwards that there were no photographers. Why do you think I did it if not for the sweet ass pics?\n\nEnough portapotties at the start - like double what is currently at most races\n\nI ran the detroit marathon once and they had the best portapotty setup at the start and end of race course/corrals. The entire street was just lined with portapotties, probably 1500-2000 porta potties or so. Didn't take longer than 5 minutes at most from getting in line to getting into one. \n\nHowever, I felt like there was a lack of porta potties on the actual course.\n\nThat was one of the things I hated most about the Berlin marathon. So few portapotties. I saw the queue and the speed at which it was moving and literally headed for the bushes. I am not proud of it, but circumstances forced my hand, err, bladder.\n\nAnd this is why I carry some wipes with me on long runs.\n\nAlso toilet paper in the portapotties. I’m lucky that I didn’t have to poop but two stalls I went in had no paper. \n\nThe best organized potty situation I've encountered had potties IN the corrals, not just in the pre-corral start area!\n\nWell, initially, it might seem attractive but it feels like a severe crowd control issue depending on the size of the corrals. Most of ours are on city streets where there's not much space curb to curb and put a potty lines would take up the entire corral.\n\nJust show up late and you won’t have an issue. I have been late to my past 3 marathons and there’s been rows of empty porta potties available 😄\n\nI showed up late-ish to my last 10k — start-time 7:30, I got to the line at 7:18 — and I finished washing my hands three minutes before the gun went off. Stressful, but it worked out.\n\nI just did the Marine Corps Marathon in DC, and the walk from the Pentagon metro station to the runners village had maybe 15 portapotties? I’ve never seen so many people peeing in the bushes. Mostly men, obviously, but also women. I saw a dude taking a dump in the bushes. The line for the portapotties was like 500 people deep. \n\nSo I cannot upvote this one enough. \n\nFlipside to that is they could very well have had signs informing folks that there were 50-60 portapotties in the runners village. That could have staved off some of the anxiety everyone felt.\n\nAnd urinals for the guys. The number of times I've had to go find a bush because I didn't want to wait in the long line.\n\nThe actual date and start time as the first thing you see on the web page!\n\nIt is so incredibly annoying when you go to the website and it says \"Running Festival Weekend!\" and gives a range that somehow spans two Wednesdays but you have to dig through six levels of links to discover the half marathon is on Saturday at 8am.\n\nAnd the location! I've seen quite a few where there's no location directly listed, or I have to google the venue name to find out where it is.\n\nAvailability of a course map ahead of time.\n\nThis!! Or even better a gpx\n\nThat’s all I need. A gpx i can load into my watch.\n\nWt heck’s a gpx?\n\nIt's a file with all of the actual GPS data, so people can upload it to their watch or other software instead of just looking at a PDF of the map.\n\nThis is fantastic, thank you! I know we always have the map available plenty of time in advance but I'm not sure we have this so I will need to double check and if not get it implemented. 😁\n\nI'm sure lots of your runner colleagues will know how to make the file themselves :) Loads of people will appreciate access to it!\n\nIncredible. Thank you.\n\nIt also gives you elevation data which is nice, or you can use it to go practice on the actual race course\n\nI don't think I've ever participated in a race that DIDN'T have the course available ahead of time. That's crazy talk\n\nI don’t live in a big city and many of our races are run by small clubs or charity organizations.\n\nI would love a sign somewhere near packet pickup that breaks down the aid stations and what they have.\n\nIf the race is half or longer please make sure there are still snacks left for slower runners! I have friends that got to later stations as slower runners and the pickings were slim\n\nThis also applies if you're setting multiple races off at the same time. \n\nI ran a half where the half and the full marathon runners were set off together. By the time my husband finished his marathon at 4:14, the post-race chute was skeletal. He got half a banana and a beer. When I finished at 5:28 (my race went sideways), there was nothing left but foil blankets and one little box of prepackaged brownie bites. I didn't even get the finishers shirt size I registered for, which was a bummer.\n\nThe half-marathon runners had absolutely decimated the finishers chute, and the race planners clearly didn't think about getting enough snacks/swag for the marathon finishers. It was sad, because we had walked around the finishers chute the day before, after everything had been set up, and there were tons of massive crates of different snacks and drinks, even a refrigerated truck set up with little ice cream cups, and we got...none of that. Extremely frustrating and disappointing after paying $175 for a race registration and traveling in from out of state for a big first marathon experience.\n\nYes! As a slower runner who finishes within the posted time cut offs its so frustrating to get to the finish line of a marathon and be met with little or no post race amenities. I've encountered aid stations running out of water later in the race far too often as well. Sometimes it's just empty tables turned over and no volunteers in sight.\n\nAnd you paid the same amount so are entitled to the same benefits.\n\nAnd toilet paper. My first half Ironman, they ran out of TP by the time I got to the run, and I wasn't even particularly slow - this was 4.5 ish hours into the race.\n\nlol this is tragic\n\nDitto the location of portapotties. I just ran a half/marathon course where the packet said that restrooms would be available “at reasonable locations.” It turns out that the RD and me had awfully different notions of what was “reasonable.”\n\nDid a race this year, I remember these little carts near the portaloos that were just drawers full of gels, cheap painkillers, vaseline with lollipop sticks to avoid grubby fingers, and sun cream - basically just those random little bits you might need, all just freely available for runners, didn't even need to ask anyone. I think it might be the single best idea I've seen for a race start. Most have this stuff available, but having it just *there* right by a place pretty much every runner is going to pass, in one place, was so damn handy.\n\nIn terms of more feelies, I'd love for it to be easier for anyone supporting to quickly/easily get to wherever the runners get spat out. I feel like there's always a degree of logistical nightmare trying to figure out the difference between where the finish is, and where the bag drop/collection is, and where the runners actually come out into the \"real world\".\n\nIf the race website says there will be pacers for certain time goals, there damn well better be pacers for those times. I've now been to two large and otherwise well-organized races where there either weren't pacers for the time I wanted (2:10 and 2:20 for HM but not 2:15 even though the website said there would be) or were no pacers at all. \n\nDon't put aid stations in stupid locations, like the narrowest point of the course just after a sharp turn.\n\nI’ve volunteered at lots of races and it’s usually the pacer just flaked out and didn’t show last minute. Pacers aren’t paid and stuff happens.\n\n\"Stuff happens\" is a pretty key statement there IMO. Sometimes one of the pacers is sick or injured or has a family emergency, and can't make it. The other pacers may shuffle around to try to accommodate people if it was a major goal time (like, two hours on the half marathon, or twenty-five minutes on the 5k), but depending on the difficulty of the time (not all pacers can achieve all paces) and the perceived importance/popularity of the time some times will get dropped.\n\nPacers that run at the pace and don’t go out too fast and then do the second half slowly to make up for it.\n\nMore Saturday races. I know it's not feasible, but I enjoy doing a race (with travel) knowing I don't have to do anything important the next day\n\nAn in-race time trial segment.  Like a 1 miler within the race that also kicks out a result.  Could be a downhill or a killer climb.  Give something to the top 50 in each gender as a bonus.\n\nLike flying pig final mile of the marathon\n\nOur Oktoberfest run in New Orleans includes a time trial segment around the horse track and the top performers each get a new pair of shoes. It's a slog getting through that dirt no matter how well packed it is, but it's a fun wrinkle from a regular 5k.\n\nThey do this in cycling gran fondos, usually on the biggest climb, and I think it's great!\n\nProvide basic instructions on race etiquette for the inexperienced runners. So many people don’t know how to behave in a race and it impacts them as well as others. It’s annoying being held up by runners who started far too close to the front &amp; then decided to walk, or running into the back of someone who stops on course with no warning.  It’s no fun for the person being run into either though, &amp; who doesn’t understand why the event feels confrontational.\n\nWalkers, strollers, groups that want to run 5 people side by side should get later start time.\n\nI like when the 5k run and 5k walk are different events. Both are valid events and the people participating deserve to have fun and meet their goals, and if time permits, separating them out facilitates that.\n\nAn easy way to help with this is by putting small signs along the start corral(s) with paces, and informing runners to line up according to their expected race pace.\n\nThis will only work if participants choose to comply; unfortunately, most do not.\n\nDifferent colored cups for water and electrolytes at aid stations\n\nDefinitely this (I poured electrolytes over my head at the MCM on Sunday instead of water then could hardly see out of my glasses!)\n\nYour comment made my day. Filed under: crazy stuff that happens on race day.\n\nThe option to opt out of the race t-shirt and/or medal for a lower sign-up cost\n\nThat is standard in all the races I run in Ontario/QC. Usually filed as Green Bib\n\nThis is a great idea. I would also take the option to skip the shirt and medal and have a little bit more of my registration fee donated to charity.\n\nI recently did a charity 10k that did almost this. You could opt out of the shirt and the cost went to the charity being supported. Cost of registration was the same either way. Two thumbs up from me!  \n\nCouldn’t opt out of the medal though.\n\nAlso if you have a shirt, please tell me the type/brand of possible! That will influence whether I order a women’s or men’s and also the size!\n\nTree or Tee option! \nPlant a tree instead\n\nThis might be the reverse. \n\nI don’t think the shirt and medals cost much at all and thus don’t save you much money. The point of them is to make you feel better and have something tangible to remember dropping $50-$150 on a race. \n\nIf you don’t get a medal I imagine they lose the psychological benefit of the race being meaningful and less people pay. It becomes a park run\n\nTLDR: I’m guessing shirt and medals are &lt;15% of the cost, but having them results in &gt;15% more sign ups, so it simply makes sense.\n\nIn the UK we normally have an optional shirt add on, and it’s normally £10. Our races are between £12 and £75ish with most being around £20-£30.\n\nEven if the fee remained the same, it’d still be nice to skip either or if you aren’t into collecting race mementos like that.\n\nI mean you don’t HAVE to take them. \n\nAnd because they are likely bulk ordered from china months in advance, for all but the biggest races that sellout it’s easier to just order to capacity.\n\nI would like this option even if it wasn't cheaper. Cuts down on waste.\n\nAlternatively, something useful (running socks, Goodr/Tifosi sunglasses) instead of plaques for age group awards, or even instead of finisher medals. I'm sure the cost would be higher, but I'd be willing to pay a higher entry fee. \n\nSocks would be cool every now and then\n\nDefinitely this.  If it’s a good event the experience is enough.  I don’t need more clutter.  I can kind of get it if you’re a bucket lister, but I’ve done dozens of races over 25 years.  I really don’t need another shirt.\n\nI’m doing a running series at the moment where I automatically received a tee shirt, cap and bag, plus there are 4 separate medals for the separate events.  I have a small head so the hat looks ridiculous and I didn’t need it anyway.  The bag is also not something I will use.  I wish I had the option of choosing what free bonuses I received even if it didn’t change the price. \n\nWhat I didn’t receive but would have appreciated is safety pins.  \n\nOr the option of a t-shirt or shorts. I have far more shirts than shorts. A bit earlier to put sponsors on shirts so I get why they do it.\n\nTotally agree. Sack off the goody bad and reduce entry fee accordingly. I haven’t bothered to collect a finishers t-shirt for a good few years and even if a medal turns up in the goody bag it’s in the bin as soon as I get home.\n\nThe option of a tank top instead of a shirt\n\nI would much rather have a cool sticker or mug than a medal or shirt, personally. Also don’t have packet pickup super far from the actual race when there’s no day of pick up option. I would also spend a pretty penny to get my packet mailed to me!\n\nTHIS. MAIL IT TO ME!\n\nI'd pay for this.\n\nAgreed on the packet pickup stuff. I come from out of town/state for 99% of races and with flights and delays and traffic it's not always possible to make the 5-6pm cut off time for pickup. I wish more races offered race day pickup or mailing. There are several times I've not signed up for a race out of state because they were strict about pickup and I knew I couldn't make that time work.\n\nDitto on a mug (or something else) alternative to shirts. I have enough shirts and half the time the sizing is so weird I can’t wear it. I still want the medal though!\n\nDetailed parking information, including the times of road closures.\n\nAdding to this around race-day logistics: detailed specifics around exactly where the starting line is, especially if the start line isn’t on an actual road, and detailed information on where gear check is located. On race day itself having tons of signage to help folks find the right corral, find the spot for gear check, find the nearest restroom. Bonus if race day volunteers are also equipped with all of this info to help navigate early morning confusion\n\n5k and 10k splits included in half results\n\nSupport for slower runners. I'm usually among the last finishers (my HM PB is 2:46 😅) and so often they've already started packing up by the time I get there, even though it isn't set to close until 3:00 or 3:30 generally.\n\nNothing worse than coming into an aid station and they are packing up already.\n\nOr gone \n\n100% agree. I know a few people who stopped attending events because they experienced this and felt discouraged. One of my favourite trends in the last few years has been races celebrating their last finishers, especially if the volunteers have a big party when accompanying them towards the finish line.\n\nA race I went to earlier this year had a space with yoga mats for people to do some stretching after the race. I thought it was absolutely glorious. Bonus points if you bring a couple of foam rollers too!\n\nPost race beers\n\nAm I too late to chime in? When I raced more in the 90s, the commemorative T-shirts  were cotton, and some were quite nice. You could wear them to hack around the house with a pair of jeans or throw one on after a run. I'd love to revisit that way of doing things, but only if the T-shirts are decent. I know that adds to cost, but it's better than giving away a cheap polyester T-shirt than nobody wants or will wear.\n\nI said this on another comment, but two of my favorite t's are cotton race shirts from the Redwoods marathons in northern California. The key is low-key colors, neutral color but interesting graphic, and limited sponsorships\n\nYeps. I’d love a t shirt to wear with jeans as opposed the running shirt ones.\n\nI would love this- if they also had women shaped ones, or tank tops, even better! The few races I've done with cotton tees have only been \"unisex\"= men's shirts. They just don't fit right on so many of us.\n\nNot late at all, Thanks for the comment. :) Can't go wrong with cotton. 😁\n\nAgreed! Those soft canva brand t shirts so we can wear them with jeans would be awesome. Throw in a vintage race logo and people would love it!\n\nWhat electrolytes will be available on course and ensuring they are mixed correctly. I’ve had so many instances of either too strong or watered down Gatorade.\n\nRace website: \n\nTHIS IS THE DATE OF THE RACE \nTHIS IS THE LENGTH OF THE RACE \nTHIS IS THE START TIME OF THE RACE \n\nplease.\n\nRecently did Amsterdam Marathon and it's the only event I've been to that give out wet sponges at aid stations. I was sceptical at first but they were glorious.\n\nHad a summer evening race here in Texas that had small hand towels sitting in ice buckets.  It was so refreshing for a super hot race, and I still use (and see other people using) those little branded towels when I run in parks.\n\nStop kettling runners into bottlenecks where we lose cadence as a result.\n\nFree photos. We pay so much in registration, and some races charge for photos.\n\nEven better, HQ video.\n\nI’ve seen a few events recently with a low-angle video camera set up and live screen \n\nAfter the race, The whole video is posted on the site. You find yourself and then go frame by frame to find your best shot\n\nPeriod products in the porta potties or at the medical tent.\n\nI’ve been racing for 40+ years. Here are my preferences:\n- age group medals. I’ll never win a race, but I love competing within my age group. I don’t care about finishers’ medals; \n- get the results done and get the awards out quickly. Some of us will be cold/wet/tired/busy, and don’t want to or can’t wait around; \n- the shirt should be optional (I don’t need more, and I rarely wear them after the race);\n- no miscellaneous “swag” that just adds to plastic waste;\n- and please make sure the course is properly marked and measured! I have run many inaccurate courses, as well as gone off course on occasion. It’s not fun. The whole point of a race is to get an accurate distance and time (and hopefully an age group medal! 😊).\n\nA cheap entry that doesn’t include clothing\n\nEspecially if it's being run in hot weather, more mist stations along the route than are currently there\n\n&gt; …more mi**lk** stations…\n\nchocolate milk stations would be amazing\n\nNeither I nor the runners potentially unfortunate enough to be near me on the course need me to knock back chocolate milk at the business end of a 10k or Half.\n\nOne I've seen for particularly hot races (summer evening in Texas) is a sports-type small towel as race swag.  Like microfiber or something, and they had most of them sitting in big ice buckets so they were cold and wet. \n\nSuper helpful for cooling down after running on baking pavement in hot temps.  Very refreshing.\n\nYes! Also provide ice if possible. The marathon I just did was pretty warm and very sunny with little to no shade in the last 10k. There were no misters or ice provided on course; they would have been so helpful for that last hot hour!\n\nPortable “pissoirs” (open urinals) for men: basically 3-4 outdoor urinals connected in a circle. Men relieve themselves quickly, facing inward, with their backs to the crowds. There are side protectors so no one sees anything unless they really want to look, but there are no full walls or doors. They can be the traditional plastic or more sustainable wood and sawdust. \n\nMuch much faster than traditional portable toilets with doors. 3-4 men can use one that takes up the same space as a single portable toilet. They only directly help men (or women with a moon cup), but this also of course shortens lines for women at unisex portable toilets. I see them a lot in Europe but rarely in North America. Is it a little gross to piss out in the open? I don’t think anyone cares 10 minutes before the race start.\n\ni saw this for the first time last weekend. it was great! no like for us, and the portapotty lines were shorter as a result\n\nThey make portable walls for things just like this; a lot of the portable toilet companies also provide a privacy wall for rent at the same time.  So even if an event was concerned with it being too open, they could still have them.\n\nIf it’s an end-to-end course, shuttles between the start and finish. Some races offer this but many do not and it makes life so much easier.\n\nAs someone who went from road races to trail running I'm going to say oreos and shots of bourbon at the aid stations (to be consumed at the same time, of course).\n\nIf the race does not have assigned starting corrals, at the very least have people line up by their expected pace. For a small, casual race, this could be as simple as a competitive runner start, a start for other runners, and a start for walkers. There’s nothing wrong with walking a 5k, but it is dangerous to allow the person who wants to walk with their toddler to start alongside the runners.\n\nThe person in the floppy hat, capri pants and slip-on Vans who is super excited and oblivious and lining up around a bunch of greyhound people in tiny shorts wearing vaporfly shoes… seen it so many times\n\nI ran into a small child once at a poorly organized 5k. The parent was letting him wander across the road and in between runners, and he darted in front of me too abruptly for me to stop or avoid him. Kid was okay, but I felt bad.\n\nMy last 10k I ran past a guy after 300 meters that I guess would finish in at least 60 minutes, if not  more. This was a race with probably 10 000 entrants and I started around 10-15 meters from the front (just ahead of the 40 min pacers.\n\nThere's nothing wrong in any pace, but God damn that was dangerous.\n\nI LOVE live music along with way! Team no headphones and feeling the vibes\n\n‘PHOTO COMING UP IN 100M’ \n\nmight sell more photos that way too.\n\nGreat idea! We could call it the smile mile 🤣\n\nI'd like race-shirt optional to become normalized. Let me save $15-20 by opting out of the race shirt. Races are often pricey and I'm cheap.\n\nNot taking down the finish line signage, food, etc until everyone has crossed. It feels so disrespectful. That person who took 6 hours did the same amount of work as I did, and it bothers me to see things taken down. I say this as a volunteer who knows how much work it is. \n\n(If there is a cutoff, that’s different. But everything should stay up until the cutoff).\n\nAbsolutely 💯! They do this now and we will as long as I'm part of the organization. ❤\n\nKudos for volunteering!\nI'd like to see a gentle reminder that slower runners should try and stay on the right. Especially for the 5k. And especially when 5k routes and 10k routes overlap.\n\nWe all run our own races, at different paces . But too many times have I started a 10k, only to run into a wall of 5k walkers partway through the race.\n\nThanks for the reply, noted. Looks like I'll be making some more signage :)\n\nGet the remaining distance signs right! So often they are well out of sync. One time I saw a 4km to go sign about 200m from the 5k to go sign.\n\nA post race beer.\n\nAnything over a certain number of runners should have tiered/wave starts, preferably with faster anticipated paces going out first. Ran a 10k recently with 5,000 people and you’re either stuck waiting in the pen for half an hour before the race if you want to get up front, or you waste a ton of early energy weaving through crowds (obviously it helps to have a lot of extra room for runners to congregate at the starting line). Probably easier said than done, but it’s such a difference maker when done right!\n\nLove the suggestion of misters mentioned by someone else… always gives me a huge boost.\n\nI’m probably alone here, and I’m sure there’s many factors to why races start so early, but I’d love for races to start later in the day. An 11am race, or afternoon race would be cool.\n\nI think a lot of this is just the disruption of shutting down roads being more tolerable in the morning.  Plus… cold is fast.\n\nYou’re definitely not alone! If I have a choice between two races that both fit my criteria for distance, etc., I will pick the one with the later start time.\n\nShirt optional, for a lower entry fee.\n\nResults ASAP and awards immediately after enough results are available. I did a 5k recently where it was cold out, but everybody went inside and had pizza and it took forEVER to mosey over to where awards were being held. Give the awards out in the cold first please! I want to go home! I'll take a slice for the road!\n\nCourse map and previous years' results on the website\n\nFor races held annually, please give the date of the next race as soon as you have it! Marathons are ofc good about this but sometimes I have a favorite 5K and would like to plan vacations/etc ahead of time to be sure I can make it!\n\nMake the bananas at the end YELLOW bananas not green ones. The worst!\n\nSystem where you are Able to transfer or sell bibs, if it’s a race that sells out. Plans change . Some races like Flying Pig allow this .\n\nI feel like this would lead to perverse incentives and scalping/gouging for popular races.\n\nBut this can easily be avoided if you're only allowed to resell on the organizers platform for the same price you bought it or even with a small withdrawal fee attached\n\nAlmost certainly\n\nOnly if there’s some way to make sure people can’t profit off of transfers otherwise bots will appear, races will sell out even faster and you’ll have price gouging.\n\nStaggered starts. Half 8:00,10k 9:00,5k.9:30\n\nEvery race that has a half or higher should have an app for friends and family to track your progress. I’m not looking forward to having to teach my mom how to use Adidas app to watch my live run for my upcoming marathon!\n\n(if anyone has suggestions for an easier way, please let me know! It’s not enough just sharing my location on find my friends. I want her to be able to tell when I start, which mile I’m on &amp; when I’m done. She’s not in the same city)\n\nIf you’re going to do t-shirts have male/female sizes, as a smallish female I have so many that are useless, male size small is still ginormous on me.\n\nIf we speak of swag. Can we please get rid of string bags. I don’t want or need one. I have one million string bags. A reusable grocery bag costs about the same and I can actually use that\n\nSpot prizes so not just the fast guys and girls get something special. \n\nE.g on a 10k a prize given out on the line for the first person to hit 45 minutes, 60 minutes etc. Or the 250th finisher. Or just for the best smile. Etc etc. Be creative!\n\nI really like this idea, I will need to think on how to make it happen. I was thinking best race helper, best costume, best pace setter, or something like that. 😁\n\nYou could do it like in some fishing derbys where there is a \"secret time\" that the closest to gets a prize (60:05 for a 10k would be fun, to share the fun with someone who maybe missed their 1hr goal).\n\nI have a cycling jersey that says \"World's Okayest Cyclist\" and I always thought it'd be fun to give out a prize to the median runner(s) for being exactly middle of the road.\n\nBest hi fiver! I often see kids putting their hands out for a hi five and always try to give them one. It seems to make their day\n\nChocolate Milk!\n\n- Refreshment stations with actual food, at least the final one at the end of the race.\n- Course map available beforehand (most but not everyone does it already).\n- Toilet supply proportional to expected demand lmao, better if at least semi clean.\n- In case the course includes significant dirt roads (and the race isn't a trail running event), I'd like the organizers to at least make sure just before the race starts the whole course is in decent conditions e.g. no trenches filled with water/mud inches deep.\n- I'd be willing to pay more for an event with less space taken by commercial stuff &amp; people hawking supplements and shoes but with more actually useful services for the runners.\n\nlot of participants are there just to walk. I have been in runs where charity supporting walkers held their hands together, made a chain and covered the whole road. Its a like protest where runners cant go past them.\n\nAll the walkers in the running events should start last. There should be a pacer just for walkers.\n\nLess waste (one use bottles, random swag no one wants) and more children-friendly acitivies like short distance kid's races.\n\nFor early morning races:  coffee at the finish!  There's a Jingle bell run in my town that does this and it's glorious!\n\nPeriodic trash cans along the route, particularly for longer races. I can never finish my water cup fast enough at aid stations and always end up carrying it until the next one. Also useful for gels.\n\nThank you all so much! I'm still combing through all of your comments but this information will 100% make our races better. ❤🙏🏃‍♂️\n\nEdible medals like cookies, pretzels, etc.! 🥇🥈🥉\n\nRace photos of ALL the participants. Not sure what it's like at your event, but I've attended several events now where the photographer took photos of the first 20-40 participants and then moved to a different spot, so all the photos were of the same people and the average to slower runners were never shown.\n\nEnough gel stations, one gel per half marathon isn't enough for slower runners. Also pacers for slower than 2h people. And trash cans please.\n\nThere's some great stuff happening from https://www.sheraces.com that's focusing on encouraging more women into races, including eg more visible representation in promo, more generous cut offs, deferral policies, changing and period products at loos or aid stops.\n\nAs a back of the packer. Making sure the aide stations are still opened and stocked for us slower folks. I carry my own water on top of using the aide stations because I can’t rely on aide stations being available the whole race.\n\nThe option to opt out of a shirt and or medal. Would LOVE to pay a reduced fee for a race only package. If you HAVE to give a shirt, I would always choose cotton. The tech shirts suck, never fit well, and are just more plastic waste in the end\n\nNon-alcoholic beers.  I am a sober runner and get a bit sad when beers are given out and no NA beer.  There are some great NA beers these days...NA Sam Adam's, Athletic, Wellbeing, and so many more.\n\nHonestly, better post-race experiences. My favorite races that I go back to every year hand out free vietnamese iced coffee in the summer, hot chocolate in the winter, and overall make a celebration of the ending. I appreciate the typically banana and granola bars, but usually prioritize the races that are more of a party at the end!\n\nChoccy milk!!!!\n\nBe organized and start on time. Communicate needed information well in advance. Also awards for the top runners. It doesn’t have to be anything huge or expensive but unless it’s a 50 person race some acknowledgment of those podium 3 should be granted. Sometimes races will do overall 1 only or not give anything, even token. I never repeat those races.\n\nGetting people walking the 5k to not take up the entire running area, this is for routes that loop.\n\n1. Separate corrals \n2. Limit u turns and narrow bottlenecks on course\n3. Use bigger cups at water stations \n4. Have medals that doesn’t just have mostly the sponsor’s name but has items relevant to the site\n5. Medics on bikes (that’s standard in every Asian marathon with a half I’ve been to)\n\nYour event might already be well established, and maybe this is not relevant, but I’ve been to several races where traffic flow is a problem. I was at one last year where they had a narrow lane returning to the finish line and all of the half marathon and 10 K participants were returning in the same lane. I ran a 1:54 and was trying to get around the 10k participants who walked a 1:54 10k… it was an obstacle course, and it was really frustrating. I’ve seen that in several different races. \n\n\nAnother time there was only one exit from the finish line up a narrow set of stairs, and traffic was really congested with so many finishers, and I ended up standing in line, hungry and exhausted and unable to leave or stretch for over 10 minutes. \n\n\nSomething positive that I enjoy is when local active clubs/ groups come out and cheer and support. I’m thinking of one race where a spin class club shows up and runs a class on the sides of the race and cheers everyone on as they go by\n\nGood quality 100% cotton T-shirts! So frequently I love the shirt design but don't like the material.\n\nNo more event shirts\n\nSee if you can partner with a hotel near the start/ finish for a racer's discount, then include the Hotel as a \"partner\".\n\nPortapotties on the actual course.  There were like 2 at the start/finish, one maybe 1.5 miles in, then I guess you were just supposed to leave the course to go to the gas station or parking lot restrooms it went past?  Next set was up near the halfway point (this is a half-marathon where you run to a turnaround point and back btw).\n\nDon't make me buy a t-shirt or goodie bag with race registration. Simply a bib and nothing else. Maybe give a medal to the top 3 but that's it. I would race way more often if the price could come down by not including these unnecessary items.\n\nProper km markings. I've been to too many races where the km markings have been off which is very confusing. If you're able to have a verified course length you should be able to get distance markers exact as well.\n\nThe option to opt out of a shirt. Maybe add more merch options? Shorts, Sox, a singlet, hat?\n\nOr allow the merch cost built into the entry fee to be diverted to the main event charity? So if a shirt costs £10 to the organizer they divert that to the charity.\n\nIf the start and finish aren't in the same exact place and you're going to check ID at the beer garden and/or sell other things, make sure the gear dropoff bags are closer to the finish line.\n\nWater near the start line!! I have frequently found myself freaking out in the \\~20 minutes pre-race when I realize there's no water and nerves are making me parched—have had to rely on kind strangers who have allowed me to drink from their own supply because races never seem to think about the time leading up to the race. 5k water stops throughout the route aren't remotely helpful if you're racing for a time, but pre and post race is crucial. Also, well stocked bathrooms. Have been to too many races where there's no TP early into the event."

    "title": "After ~36 years of running, I did my first marathon (Berlin)",
    "body": "# Race Information\n\n* **Name:** Berlin Marathon\n* **Date:** Sept. 29, 2024\n* **Distance:** 26.2 miles\n* **Location:** Berlin, Germany\n* **Time:** 4:27:40\n\n# Goals\n\n|Goal|Description|Completed?|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|A|Finish|*Yes*|\n|B|Under 4:40|*Yes*|\n|C|Under 4:30 (post-covid goal)|*Yes*|\n|D|Under 4:15 (pre-covid goal)|*No*|\n\n# Splits\n\n|Distance|Time|\n|:-|:-|\n|5k|32:02|\n|10k|32:17|\n|15k|31:44|\n|20k|31:45|\n|25k|31:57|\n|30k|31:54|\n|35k|31:18|\n|40k|31:26|\n|42.2k|13:24|\n\n# Training\n\nI started running as a kid (my dad was an avid runner). I've never been fast and always said that I didn't want to do a full marathon because the running culture I grew up with emphasized improving at your choice of distance (not increasing distance) and I was convinced that I'd injure myself trying. But then, like a lot of folks, I got bored during the pandemic and after beating almost all my pre-2020 PRs, I started to think that I should give the marathon a go before I get any older. I also love Germany and hate hills, so why not Berlin?\n\nI signed up for a pricey marathon tour because the lottery didn't work out. Then I managed to re-injure my bum foot in a spring half-marathon. I found a great coach/physical therapist who had me doing a lot of strength exercises to prevent the gait thing that caused the injury. The plan was for me to get serious about the marathon training after my June vacation but instead I came home with covid--my first time, and a nasty case. I cared more about my overall, long-term health than any one race, no matter how exciting or expensive, so I took off one week of zero activity, then a couple weeks of walking and walk-running. In my first actual run, 21 days after testing positive, I wondered whether it was possible to have a heart attack at 13 min/mile. At this point, it was a very hot and humid mid-July and I really wasn't sure I could do the marathon at all.\n\nBut I just stuck with the PT's training plan for all the weeks after that--a foreshortened version of a classic beginner training plan. My covid recovery felt non-linear (gradual and then fast), and I had lost my sense of pacing both in the sense of having lost speed and lost my intuitive sense of how fast I was going. (I had to recalibrate my watch from scratch; that wasn't helping.) I focused on distance rather than time and by late August, was doing those 18 and 20-mile training runs. I switched my watch to km and started to think about distances and paces that way.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI got to Germany a week early and spent some days doing tourist stuff, getting in a few easy training runs in different cities. I arrived in Berlin on Thursday and tried to take it easy. I met some folks from the marathon tour going to the Expo, which was incredibly crowded and where I did the only thing (quite minor) that I regret in all of this: I decided not to buy the very nice jacket because it was expensive and I still wasn't sure I would be able to finish! (Also I'd heard that you could get stuff online later, which was sadly not the case with the 50th anniversary.)\n\nSome of the marathon tour group had a nice pasta dinner together the night before and I slept fine, nervous as I was. Got up pretty early and had oatmeal (brought from home), toast with jam, one egg, tea, and OJ for breakfast. Much more than I usually eat, due to the late start. Took the U-bahn to the start with a small group, dropped off my gear bag, and commenced the search for bathrooms. Here my language skills came in handy: I asked one of the info people in German \"Is there someplace with a larger number of toilets\" and he pointed us in the direction of the K corrals (?I think) where there were rows of portapotties with a short wait (5 minutes when we first arrived, about 10 when we revisited right before joining the J corral). Ate a few American graham crackers that I brought with me while waiting and one Maurten gel as I was doffing my disposable layers before starting.\n\n# Race\n\nA week later, I'm still kind of stunned at how smoothly it went. I've done multiple half marathons just under 2 hours, so my pre-covid goal was 4:15 (A) or 4:30 (B) but after covid, I revised that to 4:30/4:40. I wrote the min/km paces for 4:25, 4:30 and 4:40 on my hand (the 4:25 was to hit 4:30 allowing for extra distance, water, bathroom stops). I was at the fastest of those paces right near the start and felt fine so I just... kept going.\n\nThe only problems I had were that a selfish and clueless runner veered RIGHT in front of me about mile 4 when he saw someone he knew on the other side of the course and almost tripped me badly. How my HS coach would have reamed that guy out. Also, I noticed lots of people at the start were carrying water bottles--even though I own both a handheld bottle and a hydration vest, I'd brought neither and so held onto my stupid disposable plastic bottle from the start for about 30km. It was useful to be able to skip some water stations but I think having something in my hand tensed up my shoulders and became uncomfortable, which is why I ditched it when I knew I was near the end. I took some Salt Stick tablets and 5 more Maurten gels along the way (I wrote when to have them on my hand). Drank water, but not that much--because it was about 25 degrees cooler and infinitely less humid than how I'd been training.\n\nAt around 20 miles, now doing my all-time longest run in 36 years of running, I realized that I'd avoided bathroom and fueling perils and was likely to beat 4:30... so I sped up. The crowds were great. Since I did the 5k as a warmup the day before (signed up for it as a backup plan when I had covid), I knew the last chunk of the course and when I'd see the Brandenburg Gate. The song that was playing as I finished was \"Despacito,\" which I found quite funny. Having not stopped the whole way, coming to a halt felt weird, like unexpectedly hitting the end of a moving walkway.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI was suddenly thirsty and it took a little while to get my hands on a water bottle. I wasn't very hungry, and instantly stiff and sore. It was a pretty pathetic scene as I tugged my warm-up clothes on, basically flailing on the ground. I sort of wanted to buy merchandise at this point but felt too disoriented and tired to look for it. Took the U-Bahn back to the hotel, had a very long shower, then pulled on some compression leggings. By this point, the tour group was convening in the hotel restaurant and I just hung out there for a few hours, enjoying the company, and some of the food and booze I'd been denying myself. Went to bed early and slept badly until it occurred to me that I was allowed to take some Advil. I had an early flight back to the US the next day and quite a lot of the passengers were marathon runners. The flight wasn't as uncomfortable as I feared, and the fatigue and soreness didn't last as long as I had expected after the race. I felt almost normal by Tuesday/Wednesday. Maybe I could have done the whole thing faster?!\n\n# What I learned\n\nI am glad that I got this out of my system! Would I do a marathon again? I'm not sure I could top this one! I guess I shouldn't be surprised that something I carefully planned and focused on for months went well. My goal here isn't to review the tour, but I wasn't that impressed; I felt like I was going to pay a gatekeeper to get into the race, and that's about what I got.\n\nA lot of the people in the tour group were trying to do all the majors, but at my age/speed/work schedule that doesn't seem like a reasonable goal. I probably underestimated how much of a hassle doing an official \"major\" would be, and I think I'd probably enjoy doing the travel aspect again but to non-major races in interesting cities, like the Gothenburg Half Marathon perhaps. Also, knowing how fast I recovered, maybe I'd do the tourism stuff after rather than before.\n\nOne of my aims was to change my relationship to the half-marathon distance--that will always feel easier now. During training, I had to learn cross-training and fueling in a way that I'd gotten away with not doing right at shorter distances. I know this will help with other distances.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

    "all_comment_text": "Really enjoyable read and delighted for you getting it done fair play to ya! ❤️ I’ve always said I’ll never do a marathon myself but stories like this make me think maybe, just maybe one day…\n\nThat was always me! And now \"one day\" is \"last week.\" It still feels a little surreal, except to my knees, for which it is very real.\n\nWhat a fun read — thank you for sharing your experience. \n\nBerlin was always on my list, but reading all the race reports this year is pushing it up to the top. \n\nNetjes! Ben op het moment in Berlijn, had graag de Marathon willen zien...\n\nBedankt! Misschien volgend jaar...?\n\nBen nu voor een paar dagen in Berlijn. Dan maar de marathon in Rotterdam!\n\nCongratulations!!\n\nThank you! :)\n\nNice work! I’m training for my first. Biggest difference is I refuse to set a goal time. Just seems like a way for me to get disappointed if I’m not going fast enough. First marathon should be about the experience of finishing, not adding stress to finish in a specific time.\n\nI totally get that. I did set goals but I changed them cheerfully and multiple times, so I don't think that put too much pressure on me. Turning it into an expensive international trip *did* put pressure on me in a way that I wouldn't necessarily recommend. I could have afforded to bail on the whole thing, and try to collect on travel insurance, but it turns out that [loss aversion](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/loss-aversion) is very real. It was while I was actively sick with covid that they added the 5k race to the weekend, and having that as a backup plan cheered me up.\n\nGood luck with your race! I wish I could bottle the feeling of crossing the finish line...\n\nThanks. Many people set goal times I just want my goal to be finishing. Whatever my time ends up being I’ll be happy about. Now…if I run a second….then it’s time to crush some goals lol.\n\nCongratulations on your race and insightful takeaways!\n\nThank you! I gleaned some helpful details about the race from this sub so am trying to contribute in kind. (Especially on the crucial topic of portapotty location!) I'm happy to try to answer questions on the event or my later-in-life increase in distance if people have any.\n\nCongratulations! I’m running my first this Sunday and reading your experience actually made me excited instead of anxious haha.\n\nDo you mind sharing when you took your gels/fuel? I’m still unsure about what to do on Sunday and i’m super curious what worked for you. Did you go based on distance or time for example?\n\nGood, it definitely IS exciting! I was not planning to carry that stupid water bottle so I'd planned when to take the gels based on where the water stations would be. I also got better at swallowing the rather gross texture of the Maurtens so in the end, I was able to take them without water, anytime.\n\nAnyway, what I'd written on my hand was that I'd take them at the water stations at 9, 17.5, 25, 32.5, and 38km. (Plus the one I had at the start.) The stations were spaced not entirely equidistantly and if you do the arithmetic, you can see that I also aimed to take them slightly more frequently towards the end.\n\nSo in effect, I was sort of planning on both time and distance because I could guesstimate how long it would take me to reach the stations. In the end, 9km was a bit too far to go without fuel even at the start (but 5km would probably have been too early). I took the last one \"early\" around 36km IIRC because I knew I could use the fuel and I was quite belatedly thinking through the fact that it probably takes 20 minutes to hit and I'd be pretty much done by then if I took it at 38km. Surprised my brain was still working at that point but that probably proves that the fuel was working. ;) Hope this helps.\n\nThank you so for taking the time to respond! I’m going with Maurtens as well, good to know that you took 6 gels in total as I was told yesterday at the running store that I wouldnt have to take anything until 30k and I was like, that can’t possibly be right lol. Also, just noticed your username. Dutch by any chance? Is so, i’d like to shout out a “lekker bezig!”\n\n[deleted]\n\nGood question. Before I left for Germany, I'd read a post (maybe on this sub) from someone talking about using a hydration pack during the Berlin Marathon specifically to avoid delays and crowding at the water stations. He said that he did it partly because he knew he was on the slower side and was more worried about hydration than the weight of the pack. I considered doing that but decided not to because I was looking forward to losing the weight of the pack and having someone else supply the refreshment! Where I live (Philly), the summers are very hot and humid--during my training period, it was often 80 F in the 6am hour, and my weekend long runs extended into even hotter temps than that. So I'd been running with a 1.5 liter bladder at minimum on every &gt;5 mile run. BTW, that was also why I kind of expected that bathroom visits could be a problem for me time-wise--all my training involved drinking tons of water and then needing to pee.\n\nAnyway, based on that, I arrived at the race with no water bottle or pack, then noticed that most of the more experienced runners in my tour group had either a handheld or belt bottle with them. And I realized that if I left my disposable bottle at the start as I'd planned, I couldn't get it back--but if I brought it with me, I could chuck it whenever I wanted. \n\nI kept it for most of the race because the stations *were* quite crowded and there are a lot of them, so it was nice to bear left and just run past sometimes. I bet I skipped at least half of them (there are a lot on the course). The ones with fruit, tea, and other stuff were more chaotic than the ones with just water so I skipped more of those. Given the extremely improved weather conditions vs. my training, I also liked being able to take one swig at a time as needed, versus my usual thirst-guzzle-pee routine. \n\nI think it was a half-liter size bottle. I drank a bit at the start with my inhaler and gel, some along the way, definitely spilled some, refilled it partially at one station that had pitchers, and it was not empty when I chucked it. So I'd estimate that I maybe drank about .75 liter, half the capacity I would have carried if I had brought the pack.\n\nIf I did this again, I'd probably look for a waist pack like this: [https://www.nathansports.com/collections/hydration-belts/products/peak-hydration-waist-pack](https://www.nathansports.com/collections/hydration-belts/products/peak-hydration-waist-pack)"

Here’s what worked for me:\n\n* Cadence**:** Increasing my cadence to around 180 steps per minute helped me land more softly and avoid overstriding.\n* Posture**:** Keeping my body upright and leaning slightly forward from the ankles allowed me to run more efficiently.\n* Footstrike**:** Transitioning to a midfoot strike reduced the impact on my knees and improved my overall comfort during long runs.\n\nWhat changes have you made to your form that have helped? I’m curious if there are other tips out there that I haven’t tried!",

    "all_comment_text": "Add in flexibility and strength training. Your core needs to be strong enough to keep you upright. Your hip flexors need to be able to lift your legs in a hinge. Your back chain needs to be strong enough to propel you, but also your butt and hamstrings need to be flexible enough not to transfer force to your joints and back. \n\n[deleted]\n\nLearning to activate glutes helped me with this issue. Instead of pulling with hip flexor muscle groups, pushing with your glutes.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI find it helps to go \"boingy boingy\" in my head to remind me to focus on rebounding off my ground contact, treating my legs to treat them as if they were springs, rather than to land on my feet and focus on using my quad muscle strength to \"squat press\" my way into my next step.\n\nboingy boingy is the best thing I’ve heard all day\n\nGlutes activation means imagining you're holding a credit card with your butt cheeks for me.\n\nThat’s actually a great tip, I’ll have to find my girlfriends credit card and try.\n\nThis, and the suggestions from the OP, had a huge impact for me.\n\nTai chi opened up my hips a lot but my PT disagrees. My homework this week included more quad flexibility to get my heels to stay on the ground a little longer. I murder the hell out of the forefoot on my shoes. Always have.\n\nCurious as to why heels on the ground longer is good?\n\nI’m a PT and I don’t understand what your goal is exactly?\n\nOh, sure. The bulk of the contact time of my foot ends up being on the ball. Bit of heel and arch at the beginning, then straight to the ball.  \n\nIt’s always been hell on my shoes, now it seems it’s not so great for my knees either.\n\nIf that's not being good for your knees, it probably means you're overstriding.  If you're landing on the ball of your foot, but with your foot under your center of mass, your ground contact time is going to be short and your stride is going to end up probably being pretty efficient (and safe).\n\nYa, my flexors and knees are the two to get sore for me. Makes me think about hitting the leg raises more consistently next time I train for a marathon.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWas recently in physiotherapy for sore shins after some hill workouts in a 1/2M run clinic I'm in. Basically my shins were overworked lifting my toes up to not trip going uphills. One of the treatments was leg raises against a resistance band. Just a couple of weeks made a difference!\n\nI do the couch pose just for the hip flexors. I do asian squats throughout the day.\n\nMy right hip flexor used to be extremely sore after runs and I would need 3-4 days of rest before going again. I changed my routine a bit and don't feel any pain anymore.\n\nPrerun and postrun:\n- Hip flexor stretches (3 different variations, 45 seconds)\n\nCore strength:\n- Mostly focus on glutes and abductor exercises\n\nForm:\n- Less heel striking and more mid to front landing. This took a while to adjust and my pace took a dive. But I believe (just my assumption) that the impact from heel striking, especially on concrete sidewalks, may have caused a lot of irritation in the hip socket. Leaning forward more, focusing on raising heels, and landing on middle and ball of foot seemed to help.\n\nBut I don't know if any of this helped or if it was one specific thing, but just sharing my personal experience as I know how difficult it can be to work through this type of injury.\n\nBut I run because I don't enjoy strength training. Running is one of the few types of excersize I do enjoy\n\nMe too. But doing 1 or 2 strength sessions for each 5 runs is the price I have to pay for running. I can run further, faster, and more frequently when I do it.\n\nI was looking into swimming. I also do some bouldering but that's more upper body.\n\nYou don't have to go crazy with it. You can do plenty at home with no equipment. Body squats, situps, and hip bridges and you're basically there.\n\n2 30 minute full body strength training sessions per week will make you a better runner (as well as a better anything physical) and have enormous heath benefits long term.\n\nResistance training strengthens your muscles, bones, and connective tissues, and as long as you don't try to go too hard too fast (as with any physical activity) it both has a very low risk of injury, and can protect against injury in other activities and in everyday life.\n\nYou can run more without injury if you’re strong. Think of it as maintenance to keep you on the road.\n\nYou should be trying to meet the physical activity guidelines for health which includes strength training: https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/where-should-my-priorities-be-to-improve-my-health/\n\nPart of being a responsible adult is doing things because you have to even if they aren't currently something you find fun.\n\nThank you for this comment, I’m actually in PT for my Achilles and was prescribed exercises to increase strength in all these areas but he didn’t really explain why.\n\nGot a strength training video you’ve found useful?\n\nYeah I do 20 min Peloton core workouts every other day as part of my normal routine as a hybrid runner and lifter.\n\nAfter starting running, I’m so sore in weird places in my core and hips (and shins, naturally). \n\nWhat’s odd is that I’ve been strength training for 15 years with loads of different plans, and I’m in pretty good shape, and just now started getting into running. \n\nI’m pretty convinced that strength training and running create an amazing synergy together\n\nFor my goal, which is just general health and ability to do what I want for fun, I totally agree.\n\nI went to a PT who specializes in runners and she did a gait analysis and some other stuff.\n\nShe had me start running my easy runs with a metronome to keep my cadence up because I over-stride. After about 4 weeks of this I didn't need the metronome anymore, and my cadence naturally increased for even my fast runs and long runs. \n\nI also tended to run with my hips, where they would swing back and forth and up and down. Like a lumbering ox or something. She said to pretend I'm running with a tray of glasses of water attached to my hip, trying not to spill any, especially on uphills and downhills. This had a pretty immediate effect - my glutes were sore the next day after I tried this. Apparently I just wasn't using them much, I was lifting my legs by swinging my hip up if that makes any sense. \n\nShe also gave me a few strength/mobility exercises to do a couple of times a week, like side steps with an elastic band, a \"ninja step\" thing where I hold a heavy kettleball and bounce from foot to foot, box step ups with weight, reverse lunges with weight, goblet squats, romanian split squats, and doing bridges with my feet on a yoga ball.\n\nIt only took a couple of weeks before I started feeling major differences in my running. I feel lighter and faster, my running seems smooth at any pace. Slower runs feel more effortless instead of like I'm a lumbering ox. I feel a lot more confident on trails, even after running for 4+ hours.\n\nAnyway, if there's a service in your area like this I highly recommend it. Although the one thing she said that heel-striking itself isn't a problem and isn't worth trying to correct on its own. I was heel-striking because I was also over-striding, and increasing my cadence helped a lot. But otherwise, if you're a heel-striker and not over-striding, you should \"fix\" it with shoes with more heel padding instead of trying to change your stride.\n\nThanks for taking the time to type this out.\n\nEdit to ask, when you started with the metronome where did you start? Did you work your way up or did you just go straight away to 180?\n\nI'm not sure if anyone else does this, but I reproduce this effect by having a 180bpm playlist, I do like my EDM though!\n\nI want to know about the metronome, too. :)\n\nI wouldn’t recommend 180 straight away, or possibly never at all.  The 180 spm by itself isn’t the goal, it’s improving your stride.  It’s just that it’s easier to use an external cue such as a metronome to do so.  Find your current cadence and increase by a small percentage.  I took a running PT course years ago but I no longer specialize in orthopedics or sports.\n\nAlso keen to know!\n\nWow, that's awesome progress! It’s impressive how quickly you saw results. The hip tray tip and those strength exercises sound super effective. Thanks for sharing your experience and advice on heel-striking!\n\nThank you for providing useful information! My gait is all screwed up 😂\n\nI tried the \"running with a tray of glasses attached to the hip\" strategy today, and I'm glad to say I'm pain-free after a few days of hip pain after running. I managed to do my longest run ever, and I feel ok! Thanks for the tip.\n\nJust started trying the metronome thing over the last couple of days. It’s not very fun but you can go on Spotify and find playlists that are at whatever bpm you’re aiming for.\n\nI tried 170 today. What’s interesting to me is that I ran 8:15 miles which is slow for me, but I spent a lot of time in zone 3. Thanks for the tips and I’m hoping this helps with form, shortening my stride, and knee pain in the end.\n\nLast year my cadence was around 160 even if I was running sub 20 5ks. This spring I focused every run on cadence and now I'm easily sitting between 175 and 185 depending on my speed. If I drop down to 160 I feel like I'm running on the moon. I usually get shin splints and have avoided them this year, in part, I think, because of this change.\n\nSo you’re just taking smaller strides to increase your stride?\n\nYes exactly. It felt very weird at the beginning and felt like I was doing butt kicks, so I had to figure out how to run comfortably again, but my form feels great now.\n\n[removed]\n\nThat's an amazing tip. I didn't think about that when I was working on it, but now thar I run that way I can see that being exactly it.\n\nBest video to explain cadence imo. It changed the way I run.\n\n  \n[Link](https://youtu.be/Lhrae87EpWM?si=iAQL67WyC0u_5li0)\n\nThanks!\n\nWow so good\n\nThanks! I tried doing this on my run today and my run felt a lot smoother.\n\nRest days!\n\nHow about “rest day”?\n\nInjury is a much bigger risk than taking a second rest day when you need it\n\nWhen I come back from a double rest day I feel like I’m floating down the road it’s great.  The more run down I get, the clunkier my legs feel.\n\nYou're really selling rest days. It has been weeks since my last double rest day but now I kinda wanna take them.\n\nI highly recommend. Hemingway meant it in terms of writing, but it’s true for running also: “leave something in the tank for the next day”\n\nIn fact the more often you run the better your body adapts to running. It must be progressive of course. The chances of being injured are less if you run 50 miles in 7 days than 50 miles in 1 to 5 days.\n\nLots of guys walking around with injuries from overdoing it, many of whom I ran with\n\nYes, too many stresses lead to injuries: [Here’s a video that explains it well.](https://youtu.be/BUJpvs0Rkwc?si=-nImRqYAcX0rR0Rm)\n\n[Meta analysis on training load and risks of injuries](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26822969/)\n\nAbstract:  \n*Sports science and medicine professionals working with athletes should monitor this load and avoid acute spikes in loads*.\n\nThe hard session you do after 2-3 rest days is part of that spikes in loads mentioned in the study. Of course that is for the anatomical system, not physiological.\n\nAll the latest stuff I’m seeing is that we should all ignore foot strike and focus instead on overstriding. Overstriding is what makes heel strike dangerous.\n\nYup, it’s not aiming for hitting a certain cadence, bud rather correcting overstriding and where your center of gravity falls. Cadence will naturally increase as a result of correcting overstriding, since speed can be calculated as = stride length x stride rate.\n\nOk, I have a question about cadence.\n\nI hear a lot about the importance of 180 cadence. But how do I achieve 180 cadence without speeding up my run?\n\nI like to run around a 9-10 minute mile. My natural cadence is 160. When I increase this to 180, invariably I'm running a 7-8 minute mile, which is just way too fast for me. I've tried significantly shortening my stride, but unless I'm taking comically short strides and looking ridiculous, 180 cadence just makes me run too fast.\n\nAny tips? How have people integrated faster cadence but kept the same pace?\n\nSpeed is about stride rate X stride length. \n\nIf you hold your stride rate constant, you can still vary your speed by varying your stride length. \n\nIt sounds like you can do it just fine though. You just feel a little ridiculous.\n\n180 is a broad refernece, not a real target. There is no need to aim for it \"no matter what\". \nWhy on earth would everyone need to run at the same cadence, if everyone is different? This 180 cadence thing has been thourougly dismantled.\n\ni don't think 180 is a magic number it's just a target.  i run similar paces and only hit 180 doing 1km intervals (just over 4min/km).  for slower paces on long runs i'm trying to keep it above 160 but more focussing on the 'light on the feet' feeling and other gait cues like hips and posture than a particular cadence. it does feel a bit goofy but there's a sweet spot with practice and getting used to it.  \n\nin contrast though when you see someone really slamming their feet into the ground with a slow cadence you notice it.\n\nA lot of the same changes you’ve listed. Thankfully, I researched my form and worked with a good coach early on, and never had to go through a difficult transition from years of bad habits. One I would throw in was learning not to have my arms cross over side to side, which I did to some degree when I started. Now it feels natural to keep them moving in the direction of my body/momentum. But that simple thing really added a lot to my efficiency and likely prevented a lot of wear/injury over the long term\n\nGood for you for nailing your form from the beginning! Keeping your arms in line with your momentum sounds like a small change, but I bet it makes a big difference. It’s great that you avoided any tough transitions and bad habits!\n\nMaybe not nailed it, but definitely got off on the right foot (pun fully intended). I still pay a lot of attention to it and have made additional tweaks to improve over time. But at least I was aware of some of the things to be conscious of\n\nWhat I did to improve running form was almost exclusivley: run more.\n\nOn finer details, trying to keep a good tall posture was something that I did chased deliberately. I am a bit of a Quasimodo so this is somthing with which I strugle even outside the running scene. \n\nThings like cadence and footstrike IMO are highly over hyped. If you investigate a little deeper than surface, the meta 180 cadence and front/midle footstrike kind of fall apart. Not saying it doesn't matterjust saying the meta does not apply to a lot of people. \n\nOn my particular case, My cadence varies from ~160 on a slow run to near 200 on a sprint. And there is nothing wrong with it.\nI am also a back strike kind of runner and that is also ok. My foot is landing undetneath me with slightly bent knee and I'm not stressing the knees or the ankle.\n\nthis is pretty much me. Running more is probably going to be the most effective way for 90% of runners to improve their form (as long as you don't increase mileage and level of effort too rapidly and continue to listen to your body). Strength training is the other generically easy way to improve overall running \"performance\", but even then I'd urge people not to overdo it, and do a couple of targeted exercises 3-4 times a week but not overdo it either (I say that as someone who overdid it to the point of injury, and has since then stayed away from strength training and been practically injury free since dropping the strength stuff)\n\nThe 180 cadence thing is such a generalist approach - I couldn’t hit 180 cadence on slower, easy runs if I tried and I’m a very normal height at 5’10”. Im pretty sure Pfitz got it from averaging stride rate from an Olympic 10k back in the day. People with different heights and leg length and foot strikes will naturally have different cadence.\n\nI have long legs and forefoot/midfoot strike. My cadence is like 160s to 170ish at slower paces. As soon as I pick up paces or begin sprinting though. My cadence hits 180 or higher easily. Not to say that people shouldn’t try to improve form or mechanics but I see the “aim for 180 cadence” parroted here mindlessly.\n\nHow did you increase your cadence? I haven't been running super consistently but this has been something I am trying to work on and I cannot for the life of me figure it out. My main problem is, I can increase my cadence but not without lowering my pace. My easy runs I cannot get my cadence down. I am currently around 160 steps per minute, I can get it to about 170 but not without going faster.\n\nI can't either. Even with a metronome my legs just do their regular thing. I have to go sub 7 minute mile pace to get over 170 steps per minute. I have a long stride, but I don't actually overstride. I've never gotten to the bottom of whether the cadence thing would actually help me.\n\nWatch the link I posted on this thread. It will be much clearer after. The transition will feel kinda weird at first (but it’s easy) and, after a few weeks, it will feel very natural.\n\nI watched that video. Thanks for that, I will have to give it a try.\n\nRemember that every changes must be gradual. Happy running!\n\nMaybe try it on a treadmill?\n\nNot OP, but I increased mine 10-15% just by lifting my heels. Less angular momentum to pull the leg forward. \n\nBut that also came after working on my overstriding, so my steps are a little shorter. I probably added an inch behind for every two I took off the front. I wasn’t really tracking my cadence before that.\n\nAhh I see that makes sense. It will be hard to correct with 15 years of running haha\n\nThere’s a pace where I can think about life or tomorrow or my favorite book and keep an eye on my form at the same time. \n\nAs I get near my max speed, I have to really buckle down to keep up with just my body.  If you can work on things when you’re at an easy pace it might go better.\n\nI haven't quite figured out what the issue is, but my right ankle cracks/loud clicks a lot and that same ankle has poor lateral flexion.\n\n\nThe weird part is that I develop pain in my Achilles/low calf if I ever STOP running for a period of more than a few days.  If I rest it for a week, the pain returns and physio doesn't help, but as long as I keep running daily, it feels great.\n\n\nPlease help!\n\nHow do you measure your cadence?  There a wearable for that I’m guessing\n\nMost Garmin watches track this. Not sure about Apple watches.\n\nApple Watch Ultra does, can’t spear for any other models\n\nThey do! I’ve owned multiple AW, currently series 9. They all track it. Measured it against a metronome and it’s fairly accurate.\n\nThe 9 does. Theres something missing from the 8 and I don’t recall if it’s this or something else.\n\nThe SE has it so the 8 should. SE even has vertical oscillation too.\n\nEvery Apple Watch running watchOS 5 or higher can track cadence (even my series 3 had this), but some running metrics like vertical oscillation, stride length, and ground contact time need series 6 or later (with watchOS 9)\n\nIf you run with your phone, Nike Run Club app will measure your cadence.\n\nI have the Runkeeper app on my phone and it measures it.\n\nI did it the old school way. Count your steps for a minute of running. Once you're at your normal pace, either set a timer for a minute and see where you end up at.\n\nAfter I adjusted to 180, for most of my half-marathon \"career\" spanning a decade I was able to keep track of time by counting every 3 steps as a second and would be accurate until around 10 minutes.\n\nSo it would be:\n\nL R L - 1\nR L R - 2\nL R L - 3\n\nand so on, so that each \"count\" of three steps was a second, and I could count to 1800, look at my watch and it would be between 9 minutes and 50 seconds and 10:05.\n\nIt worked great for track workouts and tempo runs when I could time the interval pace without looking at my watch. Long runs I would get bored counting that high.\n\ni use music with known BPM.  nike run club app also keeps track of it.\n\nI just got the Coros Pod and got some helpful data from today's run. I'm not as imbalanced as I thought but the main things I need to work on are stride length and ground time. I think focusing on leaning forward more from the ankles will help me improve both of those but I'll find out on Saturday!\n\nCadence, form and footstrike like yourself. Regular strength training, consistent yoga, and some physio (specifically in my case gluteus medius was super weak) to make the knee pain a thing of the past.  \n\n I also replaced my shoes for the knee issue I was having. Was using Novablast 3s for a while and really suffering even though I’d barely done a few hundred miles. From day one it felt like someone else had worn them into a weird shape. I tried them on a run since and I always hurt after. No problem with the newer model though. \n\nI've really been struggling to increase my cadence. I started the summer at something ridiculously low like 135 and have got it up to 150ish using a 160bpm metronome on my watch. But getting any higher feels impossible. Any advice?\n\nKeep in mind that the 180 cadence has mostly been debunked. It was a based on a group of elite Olympic runners and does not necessarily translate to regular runners.\n\nWhat is the range for muggles?\n\nAnything above 160 should be alright if you don't have any problems. In the end, cadence isn't the problem but it can be a sign that something in your running form is maybe wrong (especially overstriding).\n\nWhen I bumped my cadence I had to shorten my stride, but I got about a 1% boost in speed for every 2% increase in steps so it worked out.\n\nhigher cadence is still link to better running economy and less physical stress impact. [video](https://youtu.be/WtYK7puN5OM?si=lBj1gO7Aeiy7U5Pc)\n\nshorter steps and lifting your feet higher. higher feet = shorter pendulum = fasters turn-over.\n\nOne drill you can use is to try and consciously have your heel 'look to the sky' after your stride. This will queue you flexing your knee a little more and lifting your foot higher. No so much that your kicking your backside but enough to raise your feet more than you are now\n\nOne of the things I did was go through my song library and pull in songs just a little faster than what I’ve been using for my workouts, and culling a few of the slower tempo songs from my workout playlist. \n\nI may have actually gone too far because I landed in PT for knee pain. Oops.\n\n180 is the \"ideal\" target/\"rule of thumb\", which is like saying \"running 1 mile burns 100 calories\"\n\nWhen you add every possible factor, it'll be different for all of us. \n\nEssentially the 180 is for a relatively short male (5'4\" to 5'8\") with medium length legs going 6-9 minute miles on smooth flat ground; and a fitness level where the 6-9 minute miles is moderate to easy effort.\n\nIf you're significantly taller, the turnover required is simply impractical, as well as if you happen to have extra long legs and short torso. If you're pushing for pace it'll change, if you're dead sprinting you're likely overstriding as well which will also affect it. If you're a \"weekend warrior\" and 9 minutes is your race pace, then pushing for that cadence will likely feel like sprinting.\n\nHave you tried a zerodrop running shoe? \n\nI usually run in minimalist shoes. I also think you can get most of the benefits of them *without* the minimalist shoes. I think that you get extra benefits in wearing them but you also will generally sacrifice some speed when compared to wearing a more traditional running shoe. \n\nBut the only time I've hurt myself is going too hard too fast with too much volume running trails and adding in too much other stuff on top. \n\nBut if I just focus on running I did it for 2 years almost solid (dialing it back in the winter months because I live in the exhurbs and on a dirt road) and the only injury I got was stepping on a nut once and bruising the bottom of my foot.\n\nI see that you listed what you did but how did you do it? \n\n\nI've got no idea how to change cadence just smaller steps? Doesn't that feel awkward?\n\n\nWhat about hills? In cross country we were always told to stride out going down hills?\n\n\nI'm suffering from consistent soleus muscle strains. Thought it was my distance so I shortened that. Seemed to work then I wanted to do a 6 min mile after averaging 6:30.. I did it but strained both soleus muscles... Starting to wonder if an 8mm toe drop shoe is causing it...\n\nStrain is from weakness. It can’t deal with the volume from running. You need to do soleus strengthening exercises - bent-leg calf raises :)\n\nThank you! \n\n\nThe rest of my body seems down with 5 miles or  6 min miles but the stupid soleus is crapping out on me.. \n\n\nOnce they heal I'll stary working on them and keep my pace down for awhile...\n\nSee a physiotherapist specialized in running.\n\n1) Got a coach\n2) Yoga and weight lifting\n\nNo more injuries and got faster even though I now run less.\n\nIt's crazy that OP used ChatGPT to write this entire post and replies just to boost his foot fetish onlyfans and no one even seemed to notice.\n\nNice catch. That is not a brand of foot fetish I would have anticipated. There’s truly someone for everyone.\n\nI paid my PT a visit and she watched me run and did some tests and found a number of issues.\n\nyep same.  also calf raises (which she recommended) straight up fixed my achilles tendinopathy.  i was under the erroneous assumption that running was enough 'strength' training for running, but doing separate lifting has made a big difference.\n\nHow do I go about fixing my posture when running? Are there videos to watch?\n\nIs cadence a factor of pace? Or can you summarise increase your cadence even if you run slowly?\n\nWatch this [video](https://youtu.be/Lhrae87EpWM?si=iAQL67WyC0u_5li0it), it explains it very well.\n\nCommenting to read the comments for future. I had to go to a physio to really get my forward lean happening. Mine was slack. And I was getting some hip issues.\n\nYeah, not sure how much exactly it helps or if I could do things more efficiently, but I try not to overstride and keep light on my feet/decent cadence, do a 10 minute runner's yoga thing on the Nike Training Club app to work out stiffness/tightness after every run, do a 30 minute light bodyweight exercise on days I don't run, and have tried to incorporate some more protein into my diet so my body has enough building blocks to do repair work. I do seem to be far less injury prone than before I implemented these, though.\n\nIs it 2010 again!? brb, have to get this new fad called \"bit coin\", it'll be a big thing!\n\nNow, less joking: yeah, this is what POSE, Chi, Evolution Running (and I'm sure there were others) did after being inspired/brought to light by Born to Run and the barefoot running \"fad\".\n\nTo actually answer your question: Dynamic stretching. All through highschool and college everything was \"jog for 3-5 minutes, then static stretch, now go race/run\". Even now, I already do what you've mentioned, when I get occasional aches I realize I haven't stretched in my last week or two of running.\n\nI went to a lab and had my form fixed. \n\nI know good running form is natural for some of you, but for me it really isn't. My form was terrible.\n\nHow did you increase your cadence? My average is at 155. I attempted increasing it a couple of times, but it felt unnatural.\n\nHow did you make these changes ?\n\nWell done, can't go faster than 160... \nI try so many times, I think mt size 46 feet does not allow to increase the cadence except if I run faster\n\nDeadlifts are a runner's friend in the weight room. This miracle exercise targets the legs, buttocks and lower back.  A developed lower back strengthens the upright posture you referred to.\n\nWeights and core training. If you're not doing that, then you are setting yourself up for potential injury.\n\nMy biggest problem was my arms. Throughout school i always had a stupid arm circular swinging motion that i couldnt get out no matter what i did. I didnt even know it was happening but when id see videos of me running my arms would just move in circles for no reason.\n\nI fixed that by simply turning my wrists so that my palms would face more up. Its almost like im in position to flex my arms while im running. Fixed up my form tremendously\n\nBack extension workout! I always experience lower back pain after running long distance. It disappeared after I regularly do back extension workout in the gym. It doesnt even have to be weighted, i just do bodyweight 3 × 10 reps and never had lower back pain since then!\n\nMidfoot strike is definitely my go to too. When I first started running, a lot of people were saying forefoot strikes were optimal. I tried it and I got really bad shin splints. Maybe it worked for some people but definitely not for me.\n\nDoing strength training (calves, hips, core, and believe it or not, arms and back) really helped too!\n\nDid you have a coach or PT or just use the old YouTube?\n\nQuestion: I have a bit of a neuro issue (oscillopsia and vestibular migraine) that makes focusing on the distance while running pretty hard so I end up looking at the ground about 5-10 feet in front of me. How might I compensate for this because I feel like it's throwing off everything else. Wondering if anyone else has this experience?\n\nI don’t look up as much as I should. As my pace goes up my sightseeing has gone down and I haven’t really “looked at” that much yet. \n\nHow about looking at other things nearby? Cars and trees you are passing instead of the horizon?\n\nAre you able to see a neuro PT? They would be able to help you best with a solution for that I would think.\n\nYea I go weekly! But the neuro stuff is slow to improve so posture is still weird.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo such thing as a panacea. Something can help most people with most problems and still not address all of your own problems.\n\nHey thanks ChatGPT\n\nRun barefoot and you will naturally adopt these efficiencies. r/barefootrunning"

    "all_comment_text": "You run the entire race with lake superior on your left. It's at a slight downhill grade the entire way. Canal Park is a massive, shoulder to shoulder party well into the night. I live in Duluth, and it's not just a marathon, it's an entire weekend event with activities and shows all over the city. If you're really only interested in running the race and going home I wouldn't recommend it. If you're interested in a mini vacation trip that happens to have a marathon in it, it's an amazing experience. \n\nDon’t read this and then be surprised when you actually can’t see the lake for the first 10 miles. I love Grandmas marathon but you’re really running on a tree lined road for that first stretch.\n\nAnd it's also rolling hills for a significant portion of it, with a net downhill. First 10k are almost completely downhill, though.\n\nThat's fair.  The first bit out of Two Harbors is still a nice run, but you can't see the lake.\n\nAgreed!\n\n[removed]\n\nI think that’s the year I ran it too.  Such great conditions for going fast.\n\n&gt;  If you're really only interested in running the race and going home I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nThe only disagreement I have with this is if you're fast, it attracts extremely fast people, so you have a lot of competition to help PR.  Outside of CIM, Grandma's produces the most Olympic Trials Qualifiers - so if you're on that threshold, you'll have a cohort of runners to pace with.  I'm male but I ran with a bunch of women going for the 2:45 qualifier a few years ago, it was awesome to have a large pack of runners at that pace.\n\nMy husband ran this race when we were first dating. My mom is from Duluth and I've spent many many summers there and I asked him what he thought of the Irvin and he was like, the what? It's a huge ship in the harbor, you ran right past it.... I don't remember a ship? And we later figured out he only noticed a huge red wall at the end haha\n\nI took him to visit it when he came up to visit my family :)\n\nI'm running it next year and I'm planning a whole north shore trip, similar to how I did Anchorage then went up to Talkeetna then Denali. I just booked whitewater rafting on the St Louis River Sunday, then I'm going to drive up and camp at a few sites along the way, hopefully golf Superior National maybe the Tuesday or Wednesday after, get the ferry to Isle Royale Thursday and spend a night, and drive home Fri/Sat\n\nSuperior National is so gorgeous!\n\n&gt; mini vacation trip that happens to have a marathon in it \n\n💀\n\nI’ve done it twice and while it is a party, this year the weather was a bit of a party pooper\n\nAlso, I ran 26.2 miles in the morning, I’m not capable of walking around much after and am very tired. Going back to the hotel and napping helps though. It also helps when it’s a beautiful day and not 50° and raining and dreary like this year lol\n\nI’m hoping next year the weather is better and I’m not as exhausted, but also it was basically impossible to find food in Canal Park for dinner lol\n\n[removed]\n\nAs stated, a fast point-to-point course is the main draw. The proximity of the course to Lake Superior is probably second. Running alongside a lake so large it has ocean like expansive views is fairly unique for much of the country. \n\nIf you look at the largest marathons, most are in large cities. Combined, the Grandmas races have about 20,000 runners in a metropolitan statical area of 325,000. Thus, the impact of the race on the community is huge. Everyone in town knows a runner, crowd support is impressive, and it is a major event for the area. It’s like being in a city hosting the Final Four, only on a smaller scale. \n\nMost fast BQ friendly courses are downhill runs in fairly isolated areas.  Grandma’s has the feel of a large race, but more scenery and speed.\n\nPlus it is organized! Like they have that thing moving like a well oiled machine. I've done races with chaos throughout and this generally has minimal chaos.\n\nMy god the Vegas Rock and Roll half is fucking chaos.\n\nIt’s a great course and very well organized.   I ran Boston after qualifying at my first Grandmas. It is a net downhill but rolling so be sure to train hills.  Compared to Boston the hills are easier and they are done earlier in the race but don’t make the mistake of thinking it’s all flat or downhill.\n\nLemon Drop hill can go straight to hell, IMO.\n\nThe first time I ran Grandma's I remember thinking that Lemon Drop wasn't nearly as bad as people said and that I didn't see what the big deal was. So when I was preparing to run it for the second time I didn't give much thought to Lemon Drop during training or when thinking through my race plan. Then on race day I bonked hard on that stupid little hill. The worst I've bonked in any race I've done. Threw up and ended up walking for a little while. I'm planning to run Grandma's again in 2025 and I will be including some short, punchy hills at the end of my long runs and race pace workouts. Lemon Drop may not be objectively that bad, but it's placement at mile 22 can ruin your race if you're not prepared.\n\nExact same experience. I blame Lemon Drop, but a blowup was inevitable for me. If it didn't happen on that hill, it would have happened just a bit later.\n\nStill love that race.\n\nYep bonked on lemondrop my first marathon. Should have known since I use to live on the dam thing..\n\nYa know the funny thing is, it's not even that bad of a hill to run up. It's just so happens to be at a point in the race where people hit a mental/physical wall, and they've been running relatively downhill for much of the race, that Lemon Drop Hill feels worse than it is. Also, from a distance, it looks worse than it is. But it's a pretty quick climb. I lived in Duluth and was so used to training on it, that I passed so many runners from out of town going up it.\n\nyeah, Lemon Drop is far more psychologically brutal than an actually bad hill (like say Shadow Falls in TCM). you just stare at this hill rising up at you for like a mile and a half and you’ve already hit the wall, it’s really easy to see why it’s so notorious even though every person running Grandma’s has run up a worse hill during their training\n\nFor sure. It's a nothing of a hill. But I distinctly remember running past those fancy houses leading up to it thinking \"I'm in big trouble here.\"\n\nIs this a 0.2mile hill or a 0.5mile hill? What’s the elevation gain - 30ft? 100ft?\n\nIt looks and feels like a highway overpass. Maybe 50 feet of elevation? If it wasn’t famous for breaking so many marathoners, it definitely wouldn’t have a name.\n\nI can't remember, it's been years since I ran it or lived there but it's small, yeah. Maybe someone else with a better memory can tell ya\n\nI don’t think it was all that terrible, but as others have said it’s just at the point where people hit the wall. I thought the Twin Cities hill after crossing the Mississippi was worse. \n\nFelt like I was going up Summit Ave for the entirety of miles 21-25 lol. It wasn’t as steep, but I’d rather have a quick steep hill than a long less-steep hill\n\nI always throw out a \"was that Lemon Drop Hill?\" at like mile 9 and get a good laugh from people around me lol\n\nLOL. I think around mile 8 I announced something like “Look at that! We’re practically done!”\n\nWhat they don't tell you is it's very hard to get affordable housing race weekend. Small town, lots of runners and family/friends, limited housing...\n\nThis! Loved the route, temps, scenery. Getting a place to stay was stressful. I ended up calling hotels to get a room when cancellations happened.\n\nI would up camping for the first time, ran to one of the bus pickups in the morning and ran back from the bus pickup after the race. It was actually super fun, and I want to do more camping marathons soon.\n\nWhat kind of insane person runs *anywhere* after a marathon?\n\nI camped my first time as well! Camping for 2025 too :P – most affordable\n\nI love it! I plan on camping in my car as well! It will be my first marathon too! (Well second if I include a 27 miler I didn't finish in Duluth in October)\n\nThis is the biggest downside to grandma's. For a few years it was the determining factor on whether or not id register. When I did it last year I ended up staying at the college of st. Scholastica dorms. It was...an option, but being 16 years removed from college, I forgot how terrible dorm beds are. \n\nI called around to downtown hotels before registration open and the only place with availability was the worst rated downtown hotel and still wanted $500 a night. I ended up finding a place about 12 miles away but that in past years has offered a hotel shuttle to the race shuttle\n\nIf you can get in, I did KOA in Cloquet two years ago and it was fine. Booked a cabin with them and it was like $110 a night?\n\nI managed to find a Comfort Inn last year for relatively cheap, I must have gotten to them early because I spent like $140 a night. I tried them this year and they were sold out, so I’m staying at some IHG hotel by the mall for like $250 a night.\n\nThe thing a lot of people recommend is using the dorms, but that’s never appealed to me lol\n\nPrice gouging by the hotels is what I would call it. Ridiculously high priced rooms is why I will not go back. It was a great temperature this year for a June race, and it was well organized.  But not worth the overpriced hotels to return.\n\nIt’s a point to point so new scenery throughout the entirety of the race. It is well organized, the local community embraces it well. Everyone starts at the same time, so you are going off with the pros too, not like you can get to the front, but it’s cool nonetheless. It is a great destination race! Highly recommend.\n\nIt’s a pretty spot and it is mostly downhill.\n\nIt's a beautiful race course and the second half is a party for almost the entire route. The entire city commits to the atmosphere and there are people cheering all the way to the finish line. \n\nCollege kids handing out shots and beer bongs.\n\nKids with sprinklers and hoses spraying down hot runners. \n\nFood, water, beer, snacks all over the place.\n\nRandom people playing live music on the course. \n\nThe last few turns around big freighter ships then finishing in canal park.\n\nIt's a blast and well worth the trip.\n\nFor anyone running Grandma's, I'd highly recommend nabbing a dorm at the College of St. Scholastic. I got a 4 person suite with some friends that came out to less than $100 per person per night. Free parking and an easy shuttle to get to the one of the other shuttle points.\n\nI always stayed in the UMD dorms and they were pretty affordable too. And they ran busses directly from them to the starting line, too!\n\nTraveled from Nebraska to run this race and made it into a long weekend. The race is beautiful along Lake Superior and through downtown Duluth. The crowd energy is great. The city itself offers up some delicious food along the river and there are plenty of cabins and small lunch and dinner nooks in the woods if you drive north. This is absolutely a bucket-list race and an amazing vacation for couples. We plan to do it again once we cross a few others off our list.  You have to register once it opens on October 1 each year, otherwise you'll get shutout since it is so popular. Set a calendar reminder now and thank me later!\n\nWeather, if you live in a weather climate.  A marathon in June with a starting temp of 42f is what I got when I ran it.  Perfect!  In the SE US you'd be +30 degrees warmer easily, and humidity. 🥵  Bonus for being a mostly straight course too.\n\nI recommend booking your hotel stay before registering!\n\nIn 2020 Grandma's Marathon was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was very much ok with me.\n\nThey didn't offer refunds which sucked, but was understandable to me.\n\nThey also didn't offer deferments, which also sucked, felt a little bit like theft, and was not easy to understand, to me.\n\nCan't speak to the course (even though I'd like to be able to!) Sadly, not a Grandma's Marathon guy.\n\nThanks for mentioning this. Did they use the excuse \"the race is still happening, its just virtual\". We had a couple races do this to us during covid and we made a point to never sign up for them again.\n\nBoston did that to me in 2020 after raising $13,000. Made me sick to my stomache.\n\nThey said the had prepaid all their vendors\n\nFelt like theft ? Sounds like theft, it is theft imo\n\nI’m like 90% sure I ran their virtual race and got a deferment\n\nNvm I looked up the email and I registered in 2021 with a 40% discount code\n\nIt was MCM that let me run virtually and let me defer twice\n\nThis needs to be said.\n\nTalking bad about an amazing race event because of a global pandemic and the second and third order effects it caused on local communities and organizations seems petty, to me. \n\nThe race is in late spring, and covid shut everything down in spring of that year. It's one of the largest events the city puts on and they plan everything well in advance. The money they collect from race entries was spent to make race day memorable (which is a standard practice for ALL races). How do you expect them to refund or defer tens of thousands of dollars they don't have? Remember it's mostly volunteer run too. Not some large corporation with deep wallets.\n\nI'm sorry you lost a few bucks but everybody lost something because of covid.\n\nGrandma's is one of THE BEST destination races. You're missing out!\n\nI’m surprised they didn’t allow a deferment.  I had 3 marathons lined up in 2020 and all of them gave a deferral or money back. Note: The only good that came out of COVID was I didn’t have to do 2 back to back in the spring.\n\nI think that, logistically, this is not a race that can accommodate rolling people over to the next year like that. There’s already a massive bed shortage in town for that weekend as is, the buses are crammed, the roads are full of spectator cars, it’s essentially a minor port town built into a hillside. They can’t handle a ~5,000 runner increase.\n\nSpoken truly like someone who has never volunteered, helped, directed, or put on a race before. Think of all the money that has to be put down for things like permits, reserving (deposits) for porta pottys, police, EMS, those things. Out of all the races you've ever done, how many have been cancelled? It takes a HUGE effort and a ton of people to put on a race, any race, yet alone one this large. You also agree to not getting money back if a race is cancelled in just about all the races I've done. You just read right over the fine print and sign on the dotted line. Take some time and help out at a local race and find out what kind of effort is put on from the race committee and then come back and complain some more.\n\nYou can say this about almost any outdoor event that would still refund you in a cancellation. Music festivals come to mind. The Fyre festival was so bad it got a documentary made about it and it wasn’t even cancelled. No refunds for a cancelled race is theft I’m sorry.\n\nI ran it in 2017. I also lived in Duluth, MN awhile. Duluth is just an awesome lake town/city. The race goes along Lake Superior and large sections of it are quiet and scenic. Once you get closer to town, spectators pick up a lot. The elevation is low and the course is relatively flat so it makes for an easier race. The year I ran was unseasonably warm on race day. By the end it was like 80 and sunny. Traditionally it's a much cooler race temp-wise.\n\nUnpopular opinion here, but I am not a fan of that race.  I disliked it the first time I ran it.  I gave it a second chance because \"damn it I'm a Minnesotan, I'm supposed to love this race.\"  I disliked it the second time also and haven't tried again.  There are very few spectators the first tenish miles of the course just because there isn't really access to that road.  The scenery is supposedly amazing, but once you actually can see the lake, the view doesn't really change and gets quite boring.  You can see the lift bridge that is at the finish line when you are about 17 miles out, and it just never seems to get closer!  The trek around the DECC at the very end is brutal because you know that you're basically done, but keep going around corners and the finish line keeps not being there.  Weather is a crapshoot. The first time I ran it, it was mid 30s and raining.  The second time it was high 70s, with 95% humidity.  Both times I ran it, I ran 10 minutes slower than what I was consistently running in other races, so for me the \"fast course\" wasn't even a silver lining.  So while I acknowledge most people love this race, it just isn't for me.\n\nRunning it for the first time next year. I waited 2 hours to register for the Half. For those who have run it, how windy can the course get? Any tips?\n\nPack gear for every kind of weather - Duluth is pretty unpredictable! Grandma’s has both been the hottest and the coldest marathon I’ve ran. Wind isn’t usually my main concern, rain has been for a couple years.\n\nThanks!\n\nWind isn't usually a problem. Like many races weather can vary a lot. It can be warm, but being right by the lake tends to keep temps down some. Make hotel arrangements early if you haven't already. It's not a big city so hotels will be full and they increase the rates and require 2 night stays.\n\nThanks!\n\nGrandma's is the only marathon I've run. I thought it was interesting that you can basically see the finish line for most of the last half of the route.\n\nThe finish line is in the Canal Park neighborhood. There's a distinctive-looking lift bridge that connects Canal Park to Park Point. It's easy to spot while running the route, so you're more or less looking at the finish line for most of the last half. I found it encouraging since the end was literally in sight.\n\nIt is beautiful, up along the shore of Lake Superior. The whole town comes out to party and cheer you on the last ten miles or so. And it’s slightly downhill for the majority of the course.\n\nI always liked that. The first half of the race is cool because it's along the lake and through the woods and really scenic, and the last half is cool for all the spectators and fans ( and the scenery of Duluth itself). And shoutout to the frats thst set up beer stations (for those crazy enough to chug a beer 20+ miles into a marathon...)!\n\nI am going next summer and it will be my first! Can’t wait\n\nGood luck!\n\nIt’s flat, consistently well organized, and has a chance of cool weather in June. There aren’t many races that check all those boxes.\n\nI love Grandmas. It’s a beautiful, straight forward course with enough spectators and a massive after party that is open to the whole city. All of Duluth is happy to welcome runners, vs other midwestern races where I feel like being there is a burden or the community doesn’t even know a big race is happening. It’s very well organized, they don’t skimp on the expo, or the supplies at water stops, and there are multiple aid stations along the way. The race itself can’t really grow anymore because the city cannot accommodate any more runners - the biggest con is how outrageous hotels are and how difficult it is to get one. I’ve slept in my car in past years, but we keep coming back!\n\nI managed to get a dorm room at U of M and it was pretty great. Not too expensive, comfortable enough, and great bus transportation. I was jealous of friends who got a house along the beach, but there's no way I could have afforded that.\n\nOne thing not mentioned yet is the timing. It’s a big, fast race early in the racing season with typically good weather for running (comparable to Chicago historically).\n\nIt can be pretty nice to put together a good block in late winter and through spring, land a good marathon, and then not have to train through the dog days of summer.\n\nA lot of points already made.\n\nIt happens when not a lot of other races are happening. Especially ones that will have a lot of people spread out on the course. The Twin Cities running community shows up for the race, so no matter your pace you'll have a good chance of having runners with you.\n\nThe course is very nice, though support is quiet. Weather can vary but typically seems pretty good.\n\nIt's on a Saturday so you can use that Sunday to recover from the post race events. Duluth is great. Lots of breweries, decent restaurants, use it as a chance to head up the North Shore some.\n\nIt was a beautiful race and fun town to visit. However hotel accommodations are very challenging to find!! AirBnB we finally found was outrageously priced!! If you go, make sure you get hotel and restaurant reservations way in advance! I’m glad I did it but I won’t do it again.\n\nIt's a great race, one of my favorite courses! The lake views and community support is unmatched. Also gives me a good reason to explore MN's beautiful north shore.\n\n  \nI would caution that it's a pain in the neck logistically since it's a relatively small place for such a large race. You can find relatively cheap lodging if you're on top of getting a place at a local college, but if you're bringing a crowd to cheer you on, it will cost you.\n\nFor those who need lodging options that aren’t crazy prices, the local Universities typically open up their dorms for the weekend. \n\nhttps://housing.d.umn.edu/summer-housing/grandmas-marathon For UMD, this opens on Feb 4 and goes quickly, highly recommend signing up at 10am when they open \n\nOther dorm options are St Scolastica and UW Superior.\n\nYou take a train from downtown to start, race is point to point, which is a plus.  Well organized and great crowds in town for finish.  2 for 2 qualifying for Boston for me as well.\n\nHot and humid conditions in 2006 🥵 My first, and finished just under the 6-hour cutoff. 💜 Memory of wading into Lake Superior to cool off 🌊 🙂  Always will have a soft spot in my heart for it.\n\nMiles 1-9= woods\nMiles- 9-19= lake\nMiles- 20-26= mixed bag of lake and city streets\n\nGood shots of fans at miles 3,5, 9, 13. Otherwise, if you enjoying the sounds of the lake, the spots between those cheer zones will be great for you. \n\nThe release areas to find the food are not clearly marked. Gotta hang a hard left after you get your medal/shirt and you will be ok. \n\nBag claim was really congested (3:45 race time). In the rain, waiting 20 minutes was far from ideal. Hopefully that will get fixed. \n\nI won’t speak to the rest of the logistics since I grew up 4 miles from the starting line, love the area and have accessible lodging every year. \n\nNice place for a BQ!\n\nFast, point to point, slight downhill course with fairly consistent good weather.\n\nIt is generally considered a \"runner's race\".  It has always had a fairly high quality top of the field - Bjorkland, Hovland, Beardsley, Spanglar, et al.  It also was an early adapter to getting high quality international elites, especially Africans.  This top end speed drew a lot of good runners there to try to hang on and get dragged to fast times.  The race organizers generally made it easy for fast people to come and run fast.\n\nIMO, it has slightly gone away from that over the past 10 years and started to court the mid-pack crowd a bit.  But it is still one of the higher quality non-major races in the US.  Very similar vibe to CIM - chances are if you are showing up you want to PR.\n\nHigh quality commentary!  Thanks!\n\nThanks! Nice feedback!\n\nDuluth is awesome, that's part of it\n\nDuluth is beautiful but I didn't love the course. While it is of course net downhill, it feels like you are on a rolling back road straight away most of the way. But people run fast there year after year!\n\nHave run 15 Grandma's. A fun run, weather can be hot, cold or wet....have witnessed them all.  72 now, so I changed to Gary Bjorklund 1/2 earlier in the day.\n\nCurrently have a bib for Grandmas, but also an option to go to Sweden instead... but I'm having a hard time deciding. Does that help?\n\nI've done 9 marathons including some majors like Chicago, Boston, and New York. I've also done some smaller ones like the Illinois marathon in Champaign. Grandma's marathon is easily my favorite that I have done. The scenery can't be beat. It is right on Lake Superior almost the entire point to point course with beautiful forest and streams/rivers along the way. Once you are in town the crowd in Duluth REALLY gets into it and once you are finished there is a giant party that lasts all day and is actually fun. The only downside is finding a place to stay is HARD.  I signed up for the 2023 race as soon as regisitration opened and literally nothing in town was available (that I could find). I ended up staying at a hotel 50 minutes out of town, waking up at like 3am and driving to one of the bus pickup points. Not ideal but it was worth it.\n\nAs a Minnesotan, I have no idea why Grandma’s is often listed as the best marathon in MN. Twin Cities Marathon in early October is much more worth doing as a destination race in MN. \n\nTwin Cities Marathon gives you a tour of the best of the Twin Cities: Downtown Minneapolis, our chain of lakes, the Mississippi River, Summit Ave, the Basilica, St Paul Cathedral, and Capitol, all with fantastic crowd support. The scenery is always changing which can’t be said for Grandma’s which is majority the tree line old HWY 61, with limited Lake Superior views for the first 13 miles. The first 13 miles also has limited spectators. \n\nGrandma’s does however have a fantastic start with a fighter jet flyover and also a train along side the course. \n\nGrandma’s is also an easier course than TCM. \n\nI have done both marathon’s multiple times and both are well organized races. I truly enjoy both. However, TCM is the better experience in my opinion.\n\nI ran grandmas last year, and compared to other local races I have ran (I’m in the Dallas, Tx area), I felt like it had very little crowd support until the last few miles. I also was shocked that when I finished, there was no food or refreshments of any kind. Even local cheap 5ks give you an orange, a taco, chocolate milk, or something. So I had to walk a mile cramping in rain back to the hotel before getting a snack and some water. I think I was expecting so much more for this race based on my experiences locally and seeing how well this one is advertised, it was a big expensive let down. The bright side was the weather was absolutely amazing!\n\nWall Street Journal Article in yesterday’s paper “Marathon Running Sets Milestones” calls out Grandma’s Marathon in the article.  Check it out!\n\nIf anyone has a full bib they're wanting to transfer via the portal, please let me know!\n\nWhat is BQ? \n\nBoston qualifying\n\nBoston Qualifier\n\nThere are many Boston Qualifier races but some races are known for their high % rate of Boston Qualification due to the course profile, time of year and temps.\n\nThank you!!!! \n\nAlso the name is awesome that has to count for something\n\nDon’t do it. I ran it. It’s not worth it. It was my first BQ attempt and I also fell into listening to all of these raving reviews when selecting the race. \n\nWhile it might used to be a nice course with cool / good weather historically, look at the weather on race days in recent years - climate change has made this race really warm and humid and not ideal racing conditions. \n\nDuluth is a small town that can’t handle the influx of folks so be prepared to pay $300+/night for a shitty holiday inn (if you can nab one), or do a shared dorm and roll the dice with a stranger. The costs alone do not justify the race. \n\nThey bus you out 26 miles and you run back on this closed road.  While there are not really any turns, there’s also pretty scant crowd support (trees mostly, and it gets pretty boring). \n\nFurthermore they bungled the start line logistics this year and people are pretty upset. \n\nWhile it’s net down, it’s not smooth and more of a bunch of rollers the whole way, with an overpass crossing at mile 20.\n\nBecause Kofozi ran it and said it was good! 😅\n\nI was supposed to run it in 2020 but I was so upset with how they handled it I haven’t signed up again."

    "body": "Been a lot of discussion about Matt Choi and NYC marathon I don’t think it needs to be spoken about anymore but curious to hear people’s opinion on the whole Runna situation within it. \nSpecifically Runna was one of his key sponsors and the CEO ran with him through the race. \n\nI know Runna have since dropped him and have come out saying they had no idea he would do it etc. but truthfully that just sounds like non sense to me. Anyone who has ever come across Matt Choi knows he used bikes and there has been so much discussion about it there no chance Runna didn’t know. \n\nI think the whole situation with show if truthfully any press is good press. This is not a hate on Matt or Runna just curious how people are reacting to it. \n\nPersonally has shown me how these large companies are handled and have stopped my Runna plan to go back to a local coach (probably should have done it a lot sooner but got caught in the hype).

    "all_comment_text": "If you are the CEO running with somebody who is doing something you don't like, you threaten to pull your sponsorship right then and you certainly don't run the whole race with them.\n\nWhether or not we can believe the CEO, the claim is he thought that because they had hi-vis vests on, they had permission to be there and had proper clearance. None of us here know whether or not that is the truth of course.\n\nNgl you can get away with a lot of shit if you’re wearing high vis and you look like you know what you’re doing\n\nMy mom used to half heartedly joke, \"just walk fast and carry a clipboard.\" \n\nEspecially when you consider that such a high percentage of staff at races are volunteers.\n\nI've heard this claim a few times both with respect to the CEO and to Matt Choi himself, and it just sounds so implausible to me.\n\nDoes any major marathon EVER allow something like this? I can't imagine a large event permitting ebikes in the middle of the pack. It's not all that safe, and the race would be taking on a huge liability if one of those bikes crashed and took out another runner. It's one thing to have motorized vehicles up by the leaders where there are relatively few runners, but not along side people at 3/hr pace. Thats' way more crowded. \n\nAm I off base here? Is this something that other races allow?\n\nYour question is exactly what I was thinking. I have never seen such bikes at a major event like this. The CEO should have taken a step back and realize this\n\nThe only bikes I've seen are for the leaders.\n\nAgree, it is totally implausible that he would not guess. Or at least say “Hey Matt, how did you get this okayed with NYRR?”\n\nYes, all the time. For the leaders, Chase packs and race favorites. They get cars, motorcycles and bikes. \n\nRight, I said that. But they don't do it for guys who are 45 minutes behind the leaders, which is what this situation was. This guy was literally miles behind the leaders.\n\nI commented on a previous thread about how Runna clearly didn't vet Choi seeing as how him banditting the Houston Marathon so someone else could BQ was a big topic of discussion in the running world. Someone from Runna responded claiming that they thought they did their due diligence and didn't know about Choi's other incidents including Houston.\n\nTo believe that story, you have to believe that Matt and Ben ran across the Verrazano Bridge together, with no bikes, and then at some point in Brooklyn two bikes popped out of the crowd, likely ducking under tape, and Ben in that moment thought “I know this guy has a shady history, but I’m sure this is legit so I’m not gonna ask”.\n\nMaybe. But smells like complete BS to me.\n\nYou really think he was going to stop during the race to investigate the pacers—or even more absurdly threaten to pull sponsorship? He was racing. Like, for time. The idea that he was going to stop to launch an investigation is nonsense. Once I start, I’m not stopping, and I wouldn’t expect anyone else to either. You have no idea what it was like at the start line or what had been revealed in advance. Let the person actually responsible take responsibility rather than declaring someone guilty until proven innocent.\n\n\"Dude, I don't know what all this is but I'm not running with you any more\" would be sufficient.\n\nI think their claim to not have known about how he film his content is BS, especially considering they saw it first hand. I'll leave it at that.\n\nTour de France motorcycle following us, totally normal and allowed!\n\nFor me it’s the NYC Citi bikes. If they were using their own bikes, I can see how you could believe that they were allowed there with the vests and everything (No shade on the citi bikes, I’ve used them and they’re great to move around NYC but I think if they were to allow any bikes it would be something less bulky? I don’t know…)\n\nI think it’s totally plausible that they didn’t know beforehand given the bikes would’ve had to join them at least two miles after the start because of how NYC is set up and honestly tons of influencers run this race and have no trouble capturing content within the rules.\n\nBut I also don’t really think it matters, they knew his past and they chose to work him anyway. You can’t then play innocent when he does something selfish that puts him before everyone else on the course because he’s done it plenty of times before.\n\nYeah I just don't but that they didn't know he'd done this before - look at how many of their coaches and employees are very \"online\" themselves, and skirting into influencer territory too. I'm a UK based runner who goes on Reddit and watches a few UK based YouTubers and I know he's done it before...\n\nTo see it and not do anything suggests that you were happy for them to be cycling there, being able to see the problems they were causing. Then putting out an initial statement that boiled down to being disappointed it happened but you didn't know about it; followed up by a second announcement to drop him hours later claiming it was done as soon as you found out. Again - not sure I see how it can have been done immediately if it wasn't done either roadside, or by the time the first statement comes out.\n\nI thought their claim was that they thought he had permission to film with bikes or am I misunderstanding?\n\nThe question isn't whether they had permission, the question is whether you want to be closely linked to somebody who is doing something that is unfair and perhaps hazardous to all the other participants in the race. \n\nIf I was running with a friend and they all the sudden picked up bike escorts, I would nope my way out of that situation immediately.\n\n&gt; I think their claim to not have known about how he film his content is BS\n\nWhere did he say this? The claim from the CEO was that because they had hi-vis vests on they thought he had gone through the proper channels to get them on the course.\n\nTbf I think if you read between the lines of the \"we didn't know he had previous for using bikes to record at marathons\" that's ultimately the claim being made.\n\nIt's even less about this particular race but the fact he's done this kind of thing regularly. Second nyrr he's had illegal bike pacers the Houston bib fiasco, other have said he's had bikes on other courses as well. 2 seconds of googling X and controversy would have picked these up. So sure this one just breached the public threshold enough that they got enough bad press to cancel the contract even though this isn't close to the first times it's occurred.\n\nI said it before, I'll say it again. Ben Parker (the guy running with the bikes and Matt) should be banned as well. He was going to benefit from everything just the same at Matt was, and was part of running with that crew the whole time.\n\nTHIS!!\n\nI don't get the fascination with people like him. There are so many inspiring runners out there. People who overcome odds just to get out there, people who give back to running, people who have achieved big thimgs. Dude has almost half a million followers, and I don't see anything but a running bro.\n\nPeople don't only want to follow exceptional athletes. They want to follow people who seem relatable, people who seem like themselves but better.\n\nPhily Bowden is a damn good follow for this exact reason. Elite but still relatable.\n\nBen Parkes is my one of my favorite non elite runners on youtube\n\nYeah. You need to have personality and the ability to connect and establish a relationship with your fans. No one wants to follow a boring person. They want\n\nThis is true. Influencers do have the audience since it attracts mid and beginners like me - like \"oh wow, maybe I can do it also\". A low barrier entry to any hobby. A cheap inspiration/motivation, as I call it.  \n  \nBut yes, you're right, a few months or years of experience into the running, that's when people start questioning things and end up looking up actual athletes.\n\nWatch one of his YouTube videos one about a race or running thru Korea or the Leadville one and you’ll see his very likeable and is able to take you on a journey as if you’re there. Meeting him in person is even better Matt has the unique quality of making people feel like the most interesting person in the room. He’s a rare he’s good and genuine. So what he skirts the boundaries to get a good shot if he paid attention to all the haters before it wouldn’t be productive. Now he has to listen bc he lost everything but as scandals go this isn’t bad he isn’t some criminal. I wanna see him bounce back and keep showing us the joy in his life and in running.\n\nRunning bros want to follow running bro content creators. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nI think Runna targets the kind of person that follows influencers so it's not surprising that this came to fruition. That kind of person is not me so its aggravating to see something like this and puts me off the app even further.\n\nLiterally Runna is for new runners no one that’s been a runner for a while would pay for an app like that bc we all know how to train either join a run club and get a plan or hire a legit coach. If you want online community you don’t have to buy then go on Strava 🙄\n\nwhat does that even mean? I got into runna because i got it for free as part of a charity\n\nRunna is uses a lot of the big buzzwords (AI generated, personalized, etc.), flashy UI, lots of social presence, the things that people getting into running gravitate towards. A large subsection of those people are new to running and making a training plan is tough. \n\nIf you're drawn to a service that costs $129 or something a month/annually, there's a good chance it's because an influencer promoted it to you. And for influencers, controversy is clicks and all press is good press. If you're getting it free, you likely don't fall into the demographic they're hunting by sponsoring runners like Matt Choi.\n\nI've been running for a while and I now use Runna because I'm lazy and like to be told what I'm doing next session based on my goal pace / race etc. Admittedly, I am bouncing back from illness, so I'm not running 100 km weeks just yet.\n\nRunna is an automated programme that uses influencers to market their product. They are huge in TikTok and other social media platforms. Their target market are those to follow their ambassadors (aka influencers).\n\n[deleted]\n\nI think assuming that new runners have a “lack of discipline” is quite rude, and attitudes like that create a false exclusivity around running in general.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Reddit posts wondering why they bonked in races based on very little training and fueling disagree with you.\n\nI think most would call that inexperience and not lack of discipline.\n\nYou can’t know how you’re going to react to something you’ve never done before.\n\nRunning at a competitive level, like pretty much everything else in life, has a learning curve\n\nMost would be wrong then, as the definition of discipline includes experience. You can't be disciplined if you are unprepared for the task.\n\nno offense intended but isn’t a new runner by definition one lacking in discipline, or in other words, the experience? It wouldn’t feel judgmental unless you find a lack of discipline, on its face, as worthy of poor judgment.\n\nExperience and discipline are not even remotely close to the same thing.\n\nWhat about when the bikes got in the way of aid stations, did he still think they were legit then? Or at least tell Matt, \"hey, i know you said they had permission, but this is unsafe and making my brand look bad, can you ask them to stop?\"\n\nWhat did Ben think when the first runner got clipped by one of them?  Did he still think it was ok? What about when people told off the ebikers and they responded, not with \"sorry, but we're permitted\", but with \"get out of our way we are shooting content\"? Did he still think it was ok?\n\n(Also, ive seen reports that the riders were asked to leave the course by marshalls, they left the course but then simply entered the course again later.  What did Ben think when that happened? Did he think the marshall was wrong to ask them to leave? When the riders turned up again did he confront Matt about it?)\n\nBen could've prevented the situation and chose not to.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RunNYC/s/2PVLVNcrQ6\n\nSo runna is a uk based app however as someone who was occasionally looking for a job I noticed they are posted a lot of jobs now in the US. I think they are making a big push to get a large US consumer base and that includes using influencers as does a lot of their marketing.\n\nI believe them when they say they had no idea however I also believe they didn’t do their due diligence when it came to who they are offering sponsorship to. It is a rookie mistake but I doubt any bad intent on their part, this is a big lesson to learn when it comes to who you select to represent your brand. \n\nThey most likely were fully aware that he didn't have permission to use the E-Bike and just threw him under the bus to save their brand. They probably got a lot of publicity from having Matt as a sponsor and were willing to just let his antics slide. Now that Matt's antics are publicly spotlighted, they dropped his ass Immediately and are acting like his actions were detrimental to everyone, even though they green lighted it lol.\n\nThis they also wanted the bike footage\n\nI think company ambassadors are generally a silly thing, but probably makes sense from a business perspective to get introduced to large followings. I’m sure Runna would still work with him if there wasn’t such public outrage right now, and this is the sort of risk you get attaching your name to random influencers. I actually enjoy Matt’s videos too but he brought the risk of losing partnerships on himself.\n\nI think the CEO of Runna is also guilty since he was running with Matt Choi and knew what was doing (as an Influencer of the company that he runs).  Due to this, I have cancelled my Runna subscription.\n\nI doubt that Runna would have dropped him without the sanction from NYRR. They know what they are getting from influencers. \n \nThis is my experience only but I had never heard of Runna until my wife showed me some of her influencer follows using it to train for marathons and halfs. The fact that they use influencers to promote themselves make me not take them very seriously.\n\nSpeaking of runna, does anyone have any recommendations for any similar type of program? I was already annoyed with runnas paces they were programming me for just a maintenance plan (my easy pace was faster than my recent marathon pace??). I would love to splurge on a local coach but everything I’ve seen is so expensive\n\nIn Runna I switched it to RPE instead of pace and had a much better experience.\n\nOh I didn’t know you could do this! That seems like it would solve most of my issues with the app lol\n\nAs someone that has look at all kinds of plans for all kinds of distances I genuinely don't think you need to be paying a monthly subscription for an app to tell you how and when to run. If you've got a reasonably new Garmin I found their daily suggested workouts pretty good if set to heart rate. You can add races to the calendar and it will work you towards them with peak and taper phases etc.\n\nIf you want a more solid plan I've found Ben Parkes to have some really good plans that only cost £7 each and you can choose one based on your goal race and time.\n\nRun with Gina RWG\n\nCoopah? I found it less intense.\n\nIsn’t Runna partnered with NYRR?\n\nYeah I believe they are the “official training partner” or something to that effect.\n\nI’ve been using Runna for my marathon coming up in a couple weeks. Overall I’ve liked it and was planning on cancelling after the race anyway. This situation does feel weird. I do think they have a good/interesting product from my experience. But I don’t get how you pace him and not point out the issues during the race even if you didn’t know beforehand. So in the long run I’m going to cancel regardless, but I have to also assume him running with e bikes is part of the reason he’s an ambassador. I mean that is his content after all.\n\nYou really think he was going to stop during the race to inquire about the pacers or check with NYRR? He was racing. Like, for time. The idea that he was going to stop to launch an investigation is nonsense.\n\nI see Runna ads everywhere. One more reason to avoid them anyways. They're just so \"in your face\" spammy, it's disgusting. I'd rather use a ChatGPT training plan, lol.\n\nI mean it’s less about the fact he did it in the past and more the fact he got caught and punished by new York runners. Him getting that ban and Runna doing nothing is a bad look, and that was likely the main motivation for dropping him.\n\n\"Personally has shown me how these large companies are handled and have stopped my Runna plan to go back to a local coach (probably should have done it a lot sooner but got caught in the hype).\" THIS! I started using a local coach again for training and I'm so glad I did.\n\nYou own the people you sponsor. If someone had the potential to harm your brand, you should do your diligence in advance. While the response seems implausible, it doesn't matter because it was your responsibility to know.\n\nNBGAF. Why are we still talking about those influencers?\n\n “We have since found out that he has done this before”\n\nYeah sure.\n\nI’m just glad that Runna responded to our grievances. Not doing the right thing from the start is one thing. Not doing the right thing even after being called out is another. My line is at the later.\n\nIt’s probably bullshit, but I don’t know who Runna is - I never even heard the name until this story broke - so I find it hard to care. A dickhead acted like a dickhead and lost his major sponsor. I’m satisfied.\n\nRan NYC, and if you roll an e-bike (x2) onto the course, I won’t miss you\n\nBen Parker is a man child with power going to his head since Runna evolving. Saw an opportunity to scale Runna through Choy, chose to ignore his behaviour. It’s as clear as this. Financial gain over ethics/morals. Hey ho. Ignorance is bliss. Good luck to them\n\nIt's all show and not genuine. It's always been and will be.\n\nRunna was caught off guard and could have handled things more smoothly. They brought in Matt Choi because he’s currently all over social media, hoping to leverage his visibility. I find it hard to believe they weren't aware of his controversies— even I know about the bib fiasco and other issues, and I barely follow the guy.\n\nTheir co-founder ran with Matt in NYC, he saw the e-bikes the whole time. They too, are only back peddling bc the outrage\n\nDon’t know what runna is and not looking it up.  F both of them.\n\nGiven that Runna are seemingly fine with their own employees breaking race rules (bib swapping) I’m suspicious, too.  https://www.instagram.com/p/C_YBg-lIOGl/?igsh=MW03eHIyamszbDk1Mw==\n\nIt makes sense it's not allowed, but I had no idea you couldn't do this. Guess I should read the T&amp;Cs at my next marathon..\n\nThey dropped him. I'm happy they dropped him. End of story for me. Don't care anymore.\n\nRunna you knew about the bikes and were part of the team I know for a fact you stand to benifit from the footage and are only throwing Matt under the bus for your benifit. You all were hoping the bikes would come in at a less crowded spot and would whether the annoyance from the other runners like you had in the past. Bc at the EOD this scandal and the previous ones aren’t bad. They’re only erupting at scale bc of the losers on here jealous of Matt and wanna ruin his life and you’re all saving face by dropping him. I don’t like liars tho. And you’re liars for saying you didn’t know about the past scandal or that e-bikes would follow. You’re not the only brand that had videographers on the course following runners. Equinox and ifit did too you’re just the only brand ppl got mad at bc runners here hate Matt bc they’re jealous.\n\nSo many people on here really think he was going to stop during the race to inquire about the pacers ? He was racing. Like, for time. If I had already started I wouldn’t have stopped either. Who would I talk to? What would I ask them while running at a sub-7/mi pace? The idea that he was going to stop to launch an investigation is nonsense. Enforcing the rules should be NYRR’s job, and they failed.\n\nHow can he be an ambassador of a training app, living like a full-time athlete and be so mediocre?\n\nIs the app not working?\n\nThis is not a dig at anyone or humble brag but you'd expect someone of his age, living his lifestyle and the general intensity with which he approaches his training to be performing at a much higher level.\n\nIs sub 3hr marathon considered mediocre? I understand it’s not elite by any means and get what you’re saying about the type of athlete they’d sponsor. But I feel like sub 3 isn’t necessarily mediocre. \n\n*I’m training for and attempting a sub 3 in March 🥲*\n\nI guess people are saying it's mediocre because his full-time job and entire life revolves around running and creating running content for social media.\n\nFor average people who have jobs and other responsibilities, sub-3 would be an amazing achievement but for someone who lives and breathes running 24/7 365, barely cracking 3:00 can be seen as underwhelming.\n\nAre we referring to Ben Parker (the Runna CEO) or Matt Choi here?\n\nBen Parker's PB is 2.34 - he was pacing Matt to a 3 hour marathon. And Ben is more of a triathlete, having competed at IronMan world championships.\n\nMatt has never run a sub 3 I believe. He tried once but got disqualified. ;-)\n\nReferring to Choi\n\nThere are very successful influencers who run 4-5 hour marathons. Speed is really not all that important - you just need to be entertaining.\n\nYup, as a slower runner (5-5.5 marathon) I’ve been following a few “slow” running influencers that routinely run about that quickly in marathons. It’s just a number\n\nBP’s marathon PB isn’t 2:34. He claims that but it’s 2:54 from a race. The 2:34 was done virtually on a 600 metre loop 😂😂😂\n\nWhy can’t he call it a pb? If he ran the distance surely it’s a pb?\n\nTell me you don’t know how GPS works…Run to 26.2 miles on your gps watch on a 600m metre loop and set yourself a new PB, you’d be lucky to complete 23 miles in actual distance\n\nYou keep referring to a 600m loop, you don’t need gps to calculate how many laps would be required to run a marathon just a calculator…tell me you know how one of those work! If you are saying he ran the “marathon” distance tracked via gps, and subsequently established it was a roughly 600m loop then your point is slightly more valid\n\nThe latter, come and sit this side of the fence now and see the bs for what it really is.\n\nHe was also a 1AA wide receiver in college, playing until 2016. So he has an athletic base and raw speed to begin with\n\nIt's definitely not mediocre for most people, it's actually a really good time,  but in this context, for this guy, with this platform, with this level of \"look at me\", I think it is.\n\nTo be fair having an ambassador that isn’t an elite runner is appealing to me. I can’t relate to much that the pros go through. Choi also focuses on bulking up rather than hitting fastest race times.\n\nI’m willing to give Choi a lot of crap, but hasn’t he run something like 10 marathons this year? Sub 3 with that much racing is not shabby at all. \n\nI would be interested to know what he could run if he focused on one race with a more conventional build, taper and recovery program. I suspect a lot faster than high 2:50s. But it’s obvious why he does not do that—he wants to be seen as some type of celebrity at every race.\n\nHonestly i don't think its \"look at me.\"  Doing what he was doing is what got him to 400k+ subs which isn't small for a \"run-fluencer\" which we know is a small world of IG and other platforms.  I think hes just enjoying his running and happen to have a big following for it.  And sub 3 is nothing to sneeze at.  There's other run-fluencers who are big and can't do that or are on par.  I might get down voted for this, but was he wrong? yes, did he deserve to lose sponsers over this? i don't think so.  Especially when said sponsors was running with him and saw it happening real time.  I think if this guy had a smaller following, there wouldn't be this much outrage.\n\nI wouldn’t say it’s mediocre - sub 3 is someone who takes running seriously OR someone who’s extremely gifted and has done other endurance sports in the past to build the required aerobic capacities, I know some can just about get by and sneak a sub 3 with little running but they're the guys that if they did run more and do proper sessions they'd get the sub 2h30s etc...sub 3 is a sign of someone who's a good runner imo\n\nSub 3 is a very good time for most people, but when I heard we was going for a 2:57 or whatever at the NYC marathon I kinda thought to myself \"I have only been running for 2 years while working full time and am targeting a sub 3 next year, wouldn't someone who is doing this for a full time job be alot faster?\". Side note: this also particularly pissed me off because if I was running that race there is a very good chance his antics would have directly impacted me as that would have been right around the time I was running for.\n\nYeah I get that. I’ve also been running for about two years and am attempting sub 3 so I see where you’re coming from haha.\n\nSponsors don’t care about running ability, experience, etc all they care about is engagement on platforms.\nThere is a “running influencer” in my area with more followers and sponsors than Choi. He barely runs. Makes videos about being over trained, etc but runs avg maybe 15 mpw…and also none of the local community even knows him. Doesn’t show up for big local races or workouts or anything….it’s all a show for engagement and that’s all sponsors really care about\n\nWhat a depressing situation. I hope that runfluencer also gets their dues.\n\nI always come back to this, once the running boom is over all of these people will vacate the space and leave nothing of value behind. No benefit to their communities or followers - they'll be selling the next next thing to their audiences with a similar level of vacuousness.\n\nGetting good at running is a long-term commitment, influencing can be done in a click.\n\ninfluencing is just modern day marketing. the old days used to be movie stars. everyone recognises movie star. movie star runs. movie star uses app. OK guys lets try this app.\n\nnow its just influencer A does stuff to gain followers and attention via social media. everyone that follows influencer A will have eyes on what A does. A runs, A uses app. OK guys lets try this app. \n\nmoney goes where the attention goes.\n\nIf I were Runna I'd be looking for athletes that showed much better progression as ambassadors and users of the app as a demonstrable reason to sign-up/purchase.\n\nIs it not simply because he is (by his own admission, from what I've read about him) a content creator first and a runner second? Sub-3hr marathon is pretty decent to me but I get your point. If you reframe it as the running is secondary then maybe it starts to make sense. Runna could have chosen from any number of runners who are quicker but they went for him based on the overall package - follower count (present and expected future growth), marketability, demographic appeal etc etc.\n\nI mean to be fair he doesn’t appear to be training to PB. He runs a marathon a month which you’ll all agree isn’t typical for someone trying to PB. \n\nHe’s probably a 2:45 runner if he wants to be but that’s clearly not his priority.\n\nThis has been a very interesting few days. Up until this incident I had no idea who this guy was, nor what Runna is. \n\nBased on what I've read it seems like everything that has happened to him as a result of this is reasonable.\n\nI couldn’t care in the slightest. I had no idea who he was until I read it here. He has a lifetime ban that’s enough for me. \n\nIncidents like these are a true testament to one's character and leadership. I've been around long enough to know that all companies make mistakes. And Runna seems to have fallen into this controversy due to subpar process controls. I believe the CEO when he says that they vet their candidates. I also semi-believe him when he says he wasn't fully aware of the controversy surrounding one of (reportedly) 300+ athletes they sponsor, nor the full extent of the rules governing participants on course.\n\nWhere I'm having an issue is the fact that Runna has not explicitly outlined how they plan to prevent this from happening in the future. A call for \"improved processes\" does little to alleviate public concerns. If it's true that they have only five program managers to handle 300 sponsorships, I'm not sure how they could reasonably mitigate further controversy with the headcount they have allocated.\n\nMy 2 cents...\n\nSucks because I discovered Runna through Matt's posts - got me through my first 2 marathons this year.\n\nHow has Choi not been beat up on camera?\n\nWhy is this still at discussion, you can’t change what happened? Who cares Matt messed up royally, endangering other runners and he got dealt a consequence both by the marathon authority as well as his sponsor. What else is there to talk about? Can’t change the past\n\nI have no clue who Runna is, so maybe they should spend less marketing dollars on \"iNfLuEnCeRs\" since it's not working all that well 😂\n\nReddit needs to calm down about this guy. I’ve seen some wild comments over the past few days talking about him like he’s some sort of war criminal or terrorist. \n\nAs far as I’m aware, he got some people to ride e-bikes alongside him to get some footage, and he entered a race using someone else’s name? Is that really worth the angry mob? Get a grip.\n\nYou should try running with random ebikes blocking you from getting water at hydration stations. Also this is a running sub, of course we're angry here.\n\nWe are angry because it completely mocks the spirit of sportsmanship. And having bikes in a running race can be actually dangerous for other runners, none of which consented to be a part of this self-aggrandizing dick waving. If I were running a race, and some fool knocked me over with his ebike, I would sue his balls off.\n\nThis community sounds a lot like country club golfers.  It’s silly as hell.  He seems like a decent guy who made a bad decision he’ll suffer consequences for but the mobs only happy if they get blood.  This dude has only been a positive guy who encourages others.  To call him a piece of shit and worse is just insecure children wanting to feel superior. Gross!\n\nWell this isn't the first, or second, or well even third time hes done this kind of shit so its not a oh wow i really didn't know i couldn't do that situation. He basically blatantly broke rules until it finally kicked up enough public backlash he felt some consequences. So its not A bad decision its multiple even after being warned.\n\nYup lots of bloodlust here and people taking our their grievances against all influencers on one guy\n\nIt’s disgusting. Everyone has made their points but can’t move on. Go run"

    "all_comment_text": "Unexpected appearance(s) along the route\n\nAlternatively: pre planned restock along the way at the location he chooses with the items he wants\n\nIf you can secretly get a bunch of his friends together with you, that would be really awesome. Few runners would ever have the self-importance to ask their friends to give up a Sunday to do that, but good friends would absolutely love to do that.\n\nEspecially somewhere after mile 13 and if  you can meet him at the finish line\n\nYea, I would even say after mile 20 is best.  20-23 is probably ideal.\n\nIf it's Sydney Marathon, which fits the timing, you could manage 3 spots by watching from George St, Mrs Macquarie Chair, and then the finish line.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat’s wild!  I’ve never been that impaired mentally, although have definitely experienced some emotionally dark places a few miles from the end…in fact, that’s kind of why I’d prefer seeing people so close to the end.  \n\nFor a few years, my parents lived on the route of the local marathon I’d run.   Around mile 16 they and my immediate family would hang out there and give me some hugs and high fives…it was great, but of course the last 10 miles of a marathon feels like 2/3 of the race, so it felt a little premature to see them then and not again until the finish.\n\nThis is the answer.   \nOnly the runner really knows what he needs for the race, so all that is left is the unexpected. Cheering at spots with some inside jokes on signs would make his day.\n\nDude, I wish you were a good friend of mine...\n\nMy wife randomly met me with a giant pretzel at like mile 20, and it was legit like nectar from the gods that fueled me to the finish.\n\nReally?!! Like a big soft pretzel?!\n\nYou'd be surprised. Ran the Honolulu Marathon last year and people were handing out all sorts of stuff that you'd think a runner would normally scoff at from cans of cold beer to king-size candies. \n\nBut damn if that stuff doesn't just mean the world to you when you're 20 miles deep and running on fumes. Some dude handed me a bratwurst on a stick, like, maybe a minute off the grill judging by how warm it was. Just standing in his driveway coming out to the road to hand them out to anyone who will take one. Easily by far my favorite experience with this, and really showcases the good in humanity.\n\nAt my last marathon I bonked so fucking hard at 20, was barely running by 22. Just when I thought I might have to break my “no walking” promise, some beautiful stranger gave me a shot of tequila. \n\nThat shot got me to the end\n\nI'm picturing the scene from Wolf of Wall Street where Jordan thinks he drove to the club just fine but then we see him crashing the ever loving shit out of his car lol.\n\nAn ice-cold beer with less than 10km to go would be heaven to be fair.\n\nas a Wisconsinite, the bratwurst sounds amazing\n\nCome to a trail race 😊 aid stations are full of chips, candies, coke/gingerale, pb&amp;j, cheese quesadillas and mash potatoes for longer distances and over nights. And you’ll always find a group with fireball\n\nThat would be so sweet! I’ve completed 6 Marathons and ran them alone. No one has ever shown up for me along a route, I even feel like a burden asking them to pick me up. One time my whole family forgot that I ran and no one answered the phone or picked me up. I started walking home, a few miles later I remembered a friend lived nearby and she luckily answered and picked me up. She was so sad for me lol.\n\nI’m sorry for you just reading this. Hugs\n\nMake some funny signs if you can.\n\nMy then-GF held up a “Go Rocket Man” sign for me. That was 19 years ago. Still remember (now wife).\n\nOP should note that technically, if boyfriend is running for a goal (like a BQ), giving them anything along the course is grounds for a DQ.\n\nWill it happen unless you're winning? Almost assuredly not, but thems the rules.\n\nAn expected appearance with a clean shirt (that he’s approved) would be great, I bet. My fiance loved that.\n\nMight be great, but beware where his BIB will be placed. If it'll be pinned to the shirt, then don't do it. He will not appreciate the fumbling required to place his BIB on a new shirt.\n\nOoh good point. I think we got around that by him putting the bib on his shorts so that wasn’t a concern. But yeah, coordinate with the runner first if they would want this and how to do it.\n\nI second this! Get to know the course map, and show up with fuel/electrolytes!\n\nThe rule for marathon race day is don't try anything new. So any new snacks, clothes, etc. might make the difference of a good race or a bad race. \n\nCan you offer to drive him to the race and drop him off? I was so stressed thinking about parking so having a ride was a huge help. My partner supported me on the route, and then got pastries from my favorite bakery close by for the drive home.\n\nBingo. Streamlining race day logistics would go a long way for keeping him focused and reduce anxiety/jitters.\n\nThis is such a good idea. When I started running long distance races, I lived near my parents, and my mom would get up and drive me on race morning. It was one less thing to worry about, and it made me feel very supported. Now that I live in a different state, I think about that a lot as I drive to races alone.\n\nAsk him?\n\n\nSurprises, especially nutrition-wise will not be welcome on race day.  \n\n\n\nIf you simply want to show support, popping up along his route a few times with a sign and a smile will go along way in showing you care.\n\nChili dogs at mile 2 should do the trick\n\nw/ extra cheese\n\nNothing makes for a better race than drawers full of shit on mile 5.\n\nWe call that “motivation”\n\nAnd a nice cold bottle of lemon lime magnesium citrate\n\nA flight of beer too\n\nWash it down with a couple IPAs and he’ll be good to go\n\nGotta go fast\n\nUncooked\n\n&gt;surprises, especially nutrition wise will not be welcome on race day. \n\nHe should already have the clothes, smart watch, nutrition picked out for race day. If he's on a budget and might not have, you can ask him what he wants and give it to him Asap so he can get a few good runs in them. \n\nAs a runner, showing up on race day and cheering would mean the world. Supporting him during training will mean a million times more than a physical gift.\n\nA lot of runners are very regimented and particular so it would be best to ask him directly. \n\nIf you do want to “surprise” him with something maybe get him a massage the day after.\n\nMaybe like 3 days after.  A massage the day after a marathon sounds like an excruciatingly painful experience.\n\nThat's the best advice in case OP really wants to gift something which can be bought unless she is planning to give him the massage herself,  which will be the awesome thing !\n\nPost marathon massage. He should have his race week and race day plan ready to go by now. So anything you want to help with should be post race.\n\nThis is the best suggestion I've seent so far.\n\nYes, I was gonna comment a post-race care package of some sort. Massage would be amazing. Some of those cushy oofos slides. Maybe if the race is a big one some piece of nice swag, like a hoodie etc.\n\nNipple tape.\n\nBody Glide\n\nAstroglide\n\nYeah. But do make sure he's got a strategy for this. Some people might be okay with nothing, others get away with just bodyglide, but I think band-aids are the way to go. For a marathon I'd get the tough ones and cross them over.\n\nMy husband actually uses kt tape\n\nCan confirm, ran a very hot half mara yesterday. Got some sore nips today\n\nAnything farther than a 5k needs bandaids pre race\n\n[deleted]\n\n1. Since he's tapering, remind him he's not losing fitness, and find some activities to do together to keep his mind from going bonkers. \n2. A huge hug at the finish line.\n3. Post-race: his favorite cheat meal.\n4. Plan a destination race (if he gets the bug).\n\n&gt; Post-race: his favorite cheat meal.\n\nPost-race, like 2 days after. Right after the race the best meals are simple carbs, fruits, bread, pasta, honey, etc.\n\nThe digestive system won't like complex meals for a while, and the body needs to rebuild the glycogen stores.\n\nCheat meal? He’s been training for a marathon, there is literally nothing that qualifies as a cheat meal right now. Eat all the food!\n\nWhat bug??\n\nThe marathon bug...a few days post race, you either can't wait to do your next one, or you've decided one is enough.\n\nOh, haha I was thinking something else! 😂\n\nLet him choose your shared meals for a few days before and after. (Be prepared to eat a lot of bland carbs without complaint.) After he's finished the race and showered, offer him a back rub or head massage and let him stare into the abyss or take a nap. Don't laugh at him the next day when he's struggling on the stairs.\n\nPost race he needs you to listen intently to his analysis of how it went.\n\nPizza at the finish line.\n\nBrahhh I’d lose my shit\n\nMy partner got me a set of BibBoards, which are little clips that replace safety pins to hold your bib in place, with a picture of my cat on them and it was the PERFECT gift. So much easier than safety pins and brought me a lot of joy on race day! \n\nIf he is planning to run more races and doesn’t already have one, a medal display is also a nice post-race gift for a runner.\n\nOoh! I’ve seen the ads for BibBoards and wondered if they were worth the hype. Glad to know you like them!\n\nI’m a big fan of my BibBoards.\n\n&gt;PERFECT gift.\n\n*Purrfect\n\nYou mean PURRFECT\n\nI would suggest asking him as he may know what could help him. With that said, here are some things I can think that would have helped me during my first marathon.\n\nPre Race: Help him remember everything he might need to pack (before you leave the house then the same from the hotel). This could include race outfit, vest/belt, gels/nutrition, sun glasses, hat, race shoes, SUNSCREEN, etc.\n\nDuring the race offer to hold and give him some gels/fuel/water mid-race so he doesn't need to carry it all from the start but be sure he knows where you expect to be so he can plan accordingly. Most importantly be supportive as he runs.\n\nAfter the race: Fresh, dry clothes. If it is a chilly day, even if mildly chilly, bring a heavy jacket. I get so cold after races on cool mornings. Anything else would be preference such as recovery foods/drinks. Be ready to drive or guide him through transportation.\n\nGood luck to you (and him obviously). Thanks for being supportive!\n\nCareful with this. Taking supplies from anywhere other than on course provided is a good way to get a DQ\n\nIf you are hoping to win. But it's unlikely any casual runner would be DQ'd\n\nNot necessarily. Just a word of caution is all. Anyone can be DQd, you don’t need to be at the front of the pack.  Not to mention there’s an ethical part of lining up to a race that should be adhered to by every participant.\n\ni mean first marathon, i feel like most people don't read the rules, just register, show up, and run, with little thought that small things like that could make any difference, much kess not be allowed\n\nFair enough. I would expect the boyfriend would be familiar with the rules (hopefully) to know if this is a possibility.\n\nHonestly if I were him I might be most thankful if you made early dinner reservations to a really good pizza place, Italian restaurant, steakhouse, or the like.\n\nAfter my first marathon, I was in no shape to have dinner out. I took a shower, had a quick meal, then took a “nap” that lasted until the next morning. \n\nNYC pizza in the hotel room after an ice bath is a memory I will never forget.\n\nOh god, SAME. \n\nI went to dinner and finished my soup before the waiter was back with my drinks.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMy husband always makes a nice sign and finds spots to meet me along the course. That’s always appreciated!\n\nI agree that gear and nutrition preferences will be different for everyone. I usually ask for Amazon or running store gift cards so I can ultimately pick out the color/flavor/fit that I want. \n\nOr offer to take him grocery shopping for all the carbs he’ll need to load up on in the days leading up to the race! I’m a pretty small lady and was shocked by the amount of food that even I had to eat for a proper carb load. The price adds up quickly!\n\nBe on the sidelines with ice and water. It’s hot. Have a sign, be loud and cheer. But also, ice. I would have done a lot better in mine mentally if I’d had ice.\n\nAnything for before and during - ask. It might be nice to surprise him on the course to cheer...but don't be surprised if he doesn't see you lol.\n\nAfter I really appreciated having a hotel (if it's not local). If it is then you picking him up and driving. We went out for an early dinner but it was nice to have someone handle all that - reservations, picking up the food, etc. Basically being pampered the entire rest of the day was exactly what I wanted.\n\nBefore and during the race is all about encouragement! He probably has a very set routine for eating and drinking so don't mess with it. \n\nAfter the race give him a hug and take some pictures of him with his medal! The post race area generally has some food and chocolate milk.\n\nI dont have any suggestions to add to what's already been said by others but I wanted to highlight how nice and thoughtful you are as a partner to come ask us about this. My wife supports my running and just knowing that she cares and understands how important running is to me makes a huge difference. Cheers!\n\nBetter underwear and socks; ask me how I know... chaffing isn't for the weak. Save him!\n\nAsk him. He shouldn’t be introducing anything new on race day. \n\nOtherwise find the course map and try to map out how you can see him as much as possible with a smile and a different funny sign at each pass by!\n\nDo not try any nutritional aides etc for the first time on race day. It’s a good way to wind up in the bushes shitting yourself.\n\nNew toenails for after the race.\n\nMake a big ass sign saying stop trying to run from me &lt;insert name&gt;\n\nsome socks?\n\nI always found the worst part of traveling for a race was what to do the day before, since you want to stay off your feet. Plan activities for that\n\nMaybe have a cooler ready in your car after the race with ice and a variety of cold drinks. One thing I always really appreciate after a race is shower wipes.\n\nA cold beverage after he's done\n\nYour presence! Either partway along the course or at the finish line!\n\nBuy him a finisher shirt and have it ready for him at the end.\n\nAn ice cold coke at the finish line goes a LONG way!  I learned in London that they call it the \"red ambulance,\" and I can think of no better description.  If he doesn't already have logistics planned, greet him at the end with a bag including a change of clothes (underwear and socks included), some baby wipes, whatever snacks he enjoys especially salty and sweet ones like chips, skittles, etc. and do as much as possible to make his life easier for the next few days.  Everyone recovers at different rates -- after my first marathon I was basically good to go within 24 hours, but I was 100% useless during that time.  Some people take much longer.  He will be physically drained, but mentally as well.  Movies are great.  Takeout or delivery is perfect.  Making decisions other than \"what temperature should the shower be?\" is not.  \n  \nAlso, aquaphor.  He will chafe somewhere unexpected.  Just trust me.  He's gonna need it.\n\nJust want to say it's wonderful to see you asking this and being thoughtful for him, kudos ❤️\n\nHe doesn’t want new clothes, surprise toys/gadgets or different food.  He is already wearing his running outfit and has already tested and decided on his gels / food. \nWhat he really needs is you to just support him on the day.\nWhere does he want his ‘go to be person’ to be standing and with what gels, liquid or food along the route.\nI hope you both enjoy the day. 🤜🤛\n\nAny logistics you can take care of just so he can focus on running the event is a game changer. So figure out dropping him off in the morning, meeting up after the race and leaving the course, post race meal, etc. Also, finding multiple spots along the route to cheer him on. That moral support will carry him through to the finish line.\n\nnothing new for race day. Everything he uses, down to his socks and water intake should be preplanned ahead of time already tested out.   \nThere is nothing worse than something new on race day which throws off all the months of hard work.\n\nThe last race I ever ran in, my dad kept commenting on my pre race routine and trying to get me to change it. By the time the race started I didn’t even want to be there anymore and my time reflected it. I was done. Switched to cycling. \n\nThat was more than half a lifetime ago and I still think about it.\n\nA lot of the race happens in your head. As a support person, you are there to do exactly what the racer asks you to do, down to the last dotted I and the last crossed T. If they ask for a bowl of green m&amp;ms you better start separating. If they want cherry flavored sports drink, you go to a second store if they’re out. You do not bring them strawberry even if you “know” strawberry is their favorite flavor. \n\nA lot of people are talking about after-care because after is easier. A lot - but not all - of the rules end at the finish line. They may have opinions about their cooldown, and cooldown food (is Team Chocolate Milk here today?)\n\nTry giving him a bottle of water with some meth inside during the race. \nIt'd be a nice race report on Reddit afterward.\n\nI would ask also, think of it like you’re the lead of his pit-stop crew and you were in NASCAR. He’s got a few secs to stop, check in &amp; then go off on the route again so having things he may need or want will be timely \n\nFor general - something like water, electrolytes, banana may be fine, but I do agree that runners can be particular about this stuff. \n\nDoes he have a running vest? Maybe you can give that to him at a certain mile and then meet up with him later to take it off of him so he can do an interval locked in with whatever he needs\n\nMeet him along the route with signs! That will be cute. One year my partner ran a marathon and I just tried to follow him the best I could with our dog and we had a blast. He was so happy to see us!\n\nMeet him at the finish with Gatorade and salty snacks he likes. \n\nAlso I would just be prepared with recovery stuff at home. Like food, maybe epsom salt baths if that’s his thing, foam rollers, and comfy spots on the couch :)\n\nNipple protecting items and random spots for cheering. I always like seeing my wife along the route\n\nMy list of stuff:\n- Body Glide\n- Nipple Protection (Nipeaze)\n- Singlet\n- Half Tights (New Tracksmith Allston Half Tights)\n- Gu\n- Nuun\n- Honey Stingers\n- Carbon Fiber Race shoes (if racing the distance)\n- Book a massage for after\n- Shockz headphones (nice for training)\n- Calf Compression sleeves\n\nJust some ideas based on my experience\n\nMagnesium salt for the post run soak in the bath.\n\nLollies and a massive sign on the run.\n\nTell him not to run directly behind someone as they cross the finish line for a better finish line photo in order to better capture their bib number; I’ve run 26 marathons and no finish line photo for my very first marathon.\n\nSome good socks\n\nAmazon Danish endurance socks.  Need to know size.\n\nSome run gear,  but need to know size and he needs to be able to train in it to use it on race day.\n\nGlide stick lube for anti chafe\n\nA white hat for sun,  adjustable strap but not plastic clip like a trucker hat.\n\nFind out what gels and electrolyte drink he likes and trains with, and buy exactly what he uses.\n\nThere's enough time if you get something now, he can try using it in training.\n\nFor my first marathon my wife made a little care package of things that included new socks, a headband, and some snacks that I knew I liked already. Key as others mentioned is not to try anything new per se. The socks were just a new pair of running socks I’d already had. The headbands were new patterns of a brand I’d already used. That and the pop ins around the route with a sign kept me going. Oh, and a dope playlist with random inside jokes sprinkled in for good measure to keep my spirits up\n\nCheer him . Give him mental support. And running gadgets he already have\n\ndon't let him run in a cotton shirt. his nipples will thank you later.\n\nA pair of crocs for the finish line. A battery pack to charge phones. A poster or flag so he can see you. Some sugary, fatty, and salty snacks for the finish line. A clean shirt.\n\nNice sentiment, solid posting\n\nSupporting along the route with signs + cheering. For the finish, anti nausea medication and Gatorade/juice lol it’s also good to bring an extra hoodie or blanket so he doesn’t get chilled on the ride home.\n\nHe already knows what he needs.  You need a sign.\n\nAsk him if he wants you to wait at a certain distance to restock gels or maybe even get fresh socks.  Leave it open ended and just do whatever he asks.  And nothing is still a decision.\n\nYou should ask him what he’s been eating on his long runs, and after. At this point in the training, he should have his fuel strategy figured out. You don’t want to introduce anything that will cause GI issues. \n\nI wish him success in running his first marathon.\n\nHaving a clean pair of clothes and shoes post race is the most amazing gift anyone could ever give after a marathon. It’s so nice to have someone there ready with a post race bag 😌\n\nHaving a clean pair of unders really improves the vibe while wobbling around post 26.2 miles!\n\nIf he’s not an experienced runner, tell him to get to 30km more comfortably than he thinks he should because the really hard part of the race will start beyond that.\n\nHe might be more exhausted than you’ve ever seen him so a big hug, some “I love you” and “I’m proud of you” in addition to just helping him rest and recover is perfect.\n\nMy wife got me the Martutan 320 drink mix before my half marathon and I had it the morning of and it was super helpful. I had never tried it before but had tried basically every type of gel, chew, bar during training and never had any digestion issues. The other commenters just want you to be cautious since different peoples stomachs react different to nutrition.\n\nYou tried something new the morning of your race? That’s brave! Glad it worked out for you. \n\nIf he's anything like me maybe a leg and back massage every so often is godsend.\n\n- Make a sign and show up at random points on the route to cheer him on. \n\n- be at the finish line. \n\n- expect he might be exhausted / non-responsive \n\n- make his favourite food for supper - a lot of it\n\n- if you must buy something, recovery boots (Reathlete) \n-\n\nMaybe not something for the race itself, because nothing new on race day, but being on the sidelines with a sign to cheer him on and then taking care of him after will be huge. \n\nAfterwards, you can meet him as close to the end as possible with lots of electrolytes (they never give enough fluids at the finish line). Make a brunch reservation if he thinks he'll be up for it or just help him back to the hotel and go get pizza for the room. You can see if he wants an ice bath and go get some ice and then just chill with him in the room. \n\nBeforehand, the sweetest thing my wife did was to have all my friends and family send short videos of encouragement that she put together and sent me the link to on the bus. It was such amazing encouragement. She also started a Whatsapp group for everyone and they tracked me through the race and I got to read through all the messages afterwards.\n\nA massage voucher.\n\nBefore needs be to specific to his training. But during and after you can do a lot. During: support. Show up with a funny sign, his face on a board, etc. it’s just nice having people cheer for you. After: Nice dinner, massage, electrolyte drink, cheat food stuff. He won’t want to do much, so ordering in works too.\n\nDude wipes or similar for the portapotty pre (or mid) race\n\n[Before](https://www.featherstonenutrition.com/carb-loading/)\n\n[During](https://www.featherstonenutrition.com/race-fuel/)\n\n[After](https://www.featherstonenutrition.com/recovery/)\n\nFocus on post marathon: slippers, towel, favorite foods, change of clothes, ointments, first aid... anything that will help him feel comfortable and recover.  He'll likely be obsessing over the pre- and intra- stuff.\n\nFind out his brand of shorts and model buy the exact same, and give them to him the night before can’t beat fresh shorts.\n\nThree weeks out he should have tríales and figured out exactly what he needs. I’d be there for support with back up nutrition, Vaseline and sunscreen. He may not be hungry for a while afterwards and then will be starving with little ability to think or deal with it, so preparing for that would be sweet. Maybe a massage gift certificate too\n\nMeet him at the finish line! Have a fresh shirt and socks because those get pretty gross along the way\n\nIf you’re thinking of a gift some nice running socks are always appreciated! You could scope out which ones he already has and get a pair of those. Otherwise, if he has a brand of electrolyte packets or gels or protein bars or something similar that he likes I’m sure he’d appreciate some more of those! Otherwise just showing up at different spots along the route would probably already mean a lot to him. \n\nMy partner often a brings me a frozen wet towel after a race (on hotter days) and it’s the greatest thing ever, highly recommend.\n\nnothing\n\nBe the hype woman. Course support was the best my husband could do for me. If he uses smart watch, text him something encouraging while he’s running. My husband texted me during my race and it was so heartwarming and motivating.\n\nMy husband ran his first marathon last fall and I reached out to a bunch of friends and family, and snagged a couple of Cameos, and got a bunch of good luck video messages together for him. I collected all of them and sent them to him a day or two before his race so he had time to watch them all and absorb all the positive vibes. Then I also got him a couple of sessions at a recovery spa that had massages, cryo, recovery boots, things like that.\n\nMake a coupon book for after. Like “whatever you want from in n out on me” “one day of me fetching you whatever you need” “full control of the tv”, “pint of favorite ice cream and a movie your choice”\n\nThat kinda thing! I’m a mom and have only run while having children but anytime my husband lets me not have to do anything after a race is truly incredible.\n\n\nI also second all of the suggestions about cheers and signs along the way!\n\nSomething to keep his nipples from chafing and falling off\n\nBody glide for before, salt sachets for after\n\nI would have loved a scooter or bike to get home/back to the car if its going to be a walk..\n\nSanta Cruz paleo electrolytes\n\nBluetooth speaker blasting cheesy motivational music at as many turns as possible. Think training montage from every movie ever.\n\nTake care of him post run by giving him good food, making sure he gets good rest, and maybe a massage as well.\n\nIf he doesn’t already have it, he probably doesn’t need it. But the best thing in my first was seeing my wife and kids around mile 18. If you can pick a spot at about 20-22 even better. The juice from your support will get him through those toughest miles (or they were for me; by 22-23 I figured I could suffer through anything to finish). Then, when he signs up for his second marathon a week after (right?), he will know what he needs/wants for the future.\n\n\n\nYou are so sweet! I'm sure whatever you do will make the day all-the-more special for him!\n\nMaybe make or take him out for some pasta the days leading up and just be there cheering at the finish line\n\nAlso after the race, a clean outfit to change into!\n\nTake him to a big carby dinner after. If he’s running in 3 weeks he has his nutrition on lock (he should). But when he gets done his body is going to be an incinerator, get that boy to grub. Maybe some swag from the marathon too. Good luck boy friend and good luck to you.\n\nRunning socks - merino wool. Do not wear cotton socks or RIP feet.\n\nAsk him\n\nBest to ask him because the rule of thumb is nothing new on race day in case his stomach disagrees. \n\nLike what others have mentioned, but popping up at certain parts of the race would help, especially in the later parts.\n\nA safe option would be water and ask him what kind of electrolyte mix and gels does her prefer.\n\nJust keep telling him he's going to kill it.\n\nTylenol, tums, electrolyte capsules, more energy gel/nutrition!\n\nIn terms of gifts for the marathon: Nothing new before or at the marathon! Please do not give him a new pair of socks or shorts or a new flavor gel or anything that he has not already field tested on long runs during training. While very considerate of you, any of these things could have unexpected results which might negatively impact their marathon.\n\nAfter the marathon: passes for ice baths, massages, compression sessions, etc are very nice. Maybe a mug with one of those marathon finish line pictures. Also any compassion during the first three or four days after the marathon when his legs might be less than comfortable.\n\nDuring the marathon: Unexpected sightings are ALWAYS appreciated. Especially in the miles when the wall might be likely, say miles 18-22. And any offers of reassurance that his training will get him to the finish line. If you are not at mile 25, please do not offer the very wrong \"You are almost there\"; those last miles feel much much longer than any mile before mile 18. Most marathoners I have spoken with get a bit cranky at the people at mile 22 saying they are almost there. \n\nAt the marathon finish line: Yes, please, would love to see you at the finish line. However, a lot of marathons have the finish area closed to all but runners. If this happens, make all efforts to be at the first collection point or corral exit so he sees your face ASAP. Loving support at the end of a marathon means a lot.  Would be really great if you could bring some cold chocolate milk, and possibly a light jacket or something to keep the sun off if it is too hot.\n\nSocks and comfy shoes or sandals for after the race.\n\nCouple Massage or cryo therapy day after the run\n\nI’m going to have the unpopular opinion here and say meet him at the finish line.  Running for me is like being in a bubble and when I have to leave the bubble to acknowledge friends and family it hurts a lot more until I’m back in it.  This is not to say I don’t appreciate their effort, it’s very nice and well meaning.\n\nSurprise him with your presence on one of his longest training runs. You can do this with a bike if you already have one, if not borrow one. My fiancé done this and it really helped me get through my longest of 32km. She carried all my gels and liquids and chatted to me the whole time to keep my mind busy , it was great :) \n\nGift voucher for a sports massage/sauna etc for day after\n\nNice massage cream/oil for the night after when the poor blokes legs are hanging by a thread.  My wife gave me a really needed massage post marathon whilst I scoffed on sugary snacks and whimpered pathetically...ahh good times!\n\nPop up at several spots later on. I always like to see people when I get to mile 16, 20 etc. He ready to help after the race. I never know what I’ll want afterwards and to have someone think for me is useful. Selection of sweet and savoury snacks. Change of shoes and socks, some wipes and deodorant..\n\nAsk him people know what they need and want. Don’t get him a bunch of shit other people recommend. Just ask him.\n\nNipple protection. Im not joking, look it up.\nHe needs nipple straps, as constant friction of the nipples against fabric can cause his nipples to be rubbed off, and cause them to bleed.\n\nApart from that, easy energy sources like energy liquids, isotonic water, etc.\n\nIf his feet and legs might hurt after the marathon, lay him down on his back and raise his feet up against a wall.\n\nAlso, buy some powder for his feet (Depending on how long the marathon will take place).\nGood socks that get rid of moisture fast are a must, and good running shoes (Dont want to get trenchfoot!) For longer marathons, hiking books are recommended.\n\nEssentials:\nBody glide\nFuel belt\nMaurten gels\nNo blister socks\nGarmin watch 265 (if he doesn’t have a gps already)\n\nDuring? Just show up with a sign and cheer. And maybe a ride home. Unless it is pouring rain... If pouring rain a change of shoes mid run can be a god send.\n\nSome Imodium for after the race, just in case.\n\nBehen you be there for him, rest be assured if he is going to run a marathon he must be having all required must haves !\n\nNipple tape, vaseline\n\nNothing new, look at the race route and tell him you will be at various points so he can look out for you, if you can be at multiple different points through the race amazing the morale support alone will give him an energy boost.\n\nBe his pack mule, carry a rucksack with post race joggers, towel, new socks, tshirt, hoodie etc book a place close-ish by the end to go eat and have a drink if thats your thing as a couple but nothing fancy (think burgers,chips, pizza, beer he will want carbs).\n\nPost race, if hes feeling good have some drinks or if heading home run him a bath, likely he will be exhausted so the less he has to do post race the better.\n\nHave a post-race lunch/dinner plan figured out.\n\nI was sooo foggy after my first marathon and didn’t know what I wanted to eat. My fiancé (now husband) was driving me nuts because he kept saying “You earned it, I’ll take you to go eat wherever you want!” I knew I needed to eat… I just didn’t want to think about it because I was exhausted! He had such great intentions and he was so proud of me, but I told him later that it would’ve been really helpful if he had mapped out a few places and just picked something or made a reservation.\n\nHe runs marathons now, too, and we both try to scope out a plan for post-race food (assuming the finish line doesn’t have a picnic or something). \n\nAnd that goes for dinner plans, too. Figure something out. Make reservations if the race is in a big city. Figure out how you’ll get there… your own car, Uber, subway, etc. The last marathon I ran was in a very small town and they did a spaghetti dinner fundraiser, and that hit the spot AND took the guesswork out of dinner. \n\nOh! One more thing… figure out a sleep plan. This sounds silly, but I know I never sleep great in hotels vs. home, especially the night before a race. Get him figuring out what works for him… melatonin, sleep mask, earplugs, tart cherry juice… start trying things like that out now so he can get the best sleep possible for his race!\n\nWhen I do half marathons I like the Gatorade things and the waffles for runners. I usually need more about 2/3 of the way. Id secretly hide there and bring reinforcement of whatever carb fuel he is using.\n\nHe needs really good signs. If it is raining, you can offer to carry a dry pair of shoes and socks.\n\nGuards for his chest. Seriously. Chafing is brutal.\n\nI think surprise appearances with funny signs along the way would be cool, as long as you don’t expect anything but a wave and a nod. I’ve seen people seem disappointed they didn’t get hugs along the route. If you’re into it you can check the course map and then make a bike route to get to multiple locations. \n\nHelp them with packet pickup, attend the expo with them if they want, hold their gear (especially if it’s a climate where you need warmups before the start) or help cook them dinner the night before. \n\nMeet them at the finish with their recovery of choice (water, Gatorade, chocolate milk, beer, whatever) but again keep expectations low. I have loved to have a partner’s support at the finish line, but hate to have to “entertain” them, or derail my recovery routine for them. He may just want to keep moving, he may want to lie on the sidewalk, who knows—ideally you discuss that ahead of time. A midrace surprise can be fun but a postrace surprise can be stressful.\n\nPre race: A bose with hype track for getting dressed/ready\nPost race: A massage gun, leg roller, and maybe a pain reliever \n\nLeave all clothing and nutrition stuff up to him though, he should know what works for him. You could also always ask.. my wife always has a cold beer ready for me near the finish line.\n\nTake him out for the biggest, fattest, greasiest pizza you can in the afternoon after the race.\n\nThis is something specific to me, but chocolate donut holes around mile 20-22. If you plan on seeing him around then.\n\nYou don’t really want anything new during a race. I’d just find out what he plans on eating and have a bunch of those things.\n\nI know people don’t like advice and I have no clue how experienced he is, but a lot of first timers don’t take in enough calories and water early on in the marathon. You dig a hole you can’t get out of.\n\nHydration gel\n\nSee if there are any specials for massages in your area! I got a groupon deal for $40.\n\nNot sure whether rules of your marathon are strict or not, recently someone was disqualified\n\n[Marathon winner disqualified after taking, drinking water from dad during race](https://mynbc15.com/news/nation-world/orange-county-marathon-winner-disqualified-after-taking-drinking-water-from-dad-during-race-received-hydration-cincinnati-fairness-integrity-competition-competitors-racing-regulation-director-gary-kutscher-track-field-rules-broken-violation-unauthorized)\n\nBefore:  Chapstick, body glide, a ride to the starting line\n\nDuring:  popping up along the route, a result of items of his choosing at the mile of his choosing\n\nAfter: a shoulder rub, beer, and pizza\n\nRunners almost always know what they need for essentials. The training weeks allow us that trial and error to figure it out. The best thing someone can get me is showing up at the race to cheer me on, ESPECIALLY in the later miles.\n\nGet him some Kane recovery shoes! I have a pair and absolutely love them after my long runs!\n\nA super comfortable pair of shoes at the end. Maybe a soft cotton top too. Perhaps just a complete set of soft clothes would be appreciated to change into.\n\nI run in runderwear and their (under)pants and socks are excellent although he’s probably good there if he’s this close to the day.\n\nAs others have said, it may be just worth asking him. I didn’t think about the comfortable shoes after my first race but the next one I didn’t forget and it was lovely. \n\nGood luck to you and even more to him.\n\nCryotherapy chamber session after marathon!\n\nNipple Tassles... I mean tape.\n\nMeet him randomly through the course a few times and cheer for him/hand him snacks. My husband dropped a banana off for me and it made such a difference—all they had at the aid stations was GU (which give me GI issues lol) \n\n\nEdit to clarify, he called me and asked me what I wanted\n\nA gift card to running warehouse is always something that makes me happy as a runner!\n\nHe’s going to need plenty of magnesium in his water so make sure you put 2 packets in each bottle!! He will wonder how you know about magnesium while running. You can get packets at Walmart. Thank me later 🙌🏼🙌🏼\n\nFor after the marathon: a donut."

    "all_comment_text": "I got a very nice running hat from a trail race. Trail races in general have better stuff than road races.\n\nJust want to shout out 5 peak racing series consistently great finisher gear!\n\nmy favorite running hat was swag from a trail race too.\n\nI got a 1L, vacuum insulated thermos from a trail race. They even filled it with beer!\n\nSame. I have a few hats from races and I use them more than any other swag ice gotten.\n\nA medal that is a bottle opener\n\nAny medal is a bottle opener with the right attitude 😉\n\nAnything is a bottle opener in Germany\n\nFound the German.\n\nThere's an Irish themed series north of Boston that does those. Not sure if it's doing much for the stereotype, but still a nice medal.\n\nPhiladelphia Broad Street Run did this! \n\nChicago triathlon sometime around a decade ago did this\n\nI have one of those and it is hands down at the bottom of the list for me. Blah!\n\nI have one of these and it doesn't actually work very well\n\nI got some pretty nice socks for a race once.\n\nI did too but it was kinda weird that they were dress socks…\n\nThat's genuinely hilarious. At least mine were running socks.\n\nThey were themed too and a light purple pink that would have looked cool as running socks but didn’t work so nicely as dress socks.\n\nSame, it was how I discovered feetures. I wore those socks until they got holes and now I exclusively wear them.\n\nYou threw out all your other socks because a pair got holes?\n\n🤣🤣 I did word that weirdly. I should say I exclusively wear that brand now. I went and bought a bunch of them and that's been my sock of choice.\n\nSame here. I got a pair of padded socks that run, like, $25 retail and I'm still running with them 3 years later.\n\nThat's awesome. Very jealous.\n\nI did too. They're also very colorful, so bonus.\n\nI got triathlon socks too... but I think one of my favorites was a quick dry towel. I never get tired of race shirts if they fit nice. Lately I find they're too short!\n\nThe abuse we put up with, to he grateful for socks. Once, I had to dig my own medal out of a box. (It was like a 50 person 5k)\n\nI was originally a little bummed there was no medal but after I wore the socks, I realized a useful prize is better than any participation medal.\n\nSame!   Gradnafarther race in Boone NC gave out awesome socks!\n\nI came to say socks. My favorite pair of tech socks\n\nA really nice sweatshirt\n\nOthers\n\nSocks\n\nWinter Hats\n\nA backpack\n\nFrozen apple pies to bake at home\n\n...frozen apple pie...\n....at a road race...\n...to bake at home\n\nDid they hand it to you at the finish line with your medal?\nWas there a freezer involved?\nDid you have your backpack &amp; sweatshirt with you to MacGyver up a makeshift cooler for your new pie? \n\nSo many questions.\n\nWe do a Turkey trot in our trot rotation that gives out a regular sized pumpkin pie to every finisher. If you don’t want it, there is a food bank on site and you can donate it and they will use it at their free thanksgiving meal in the community that day. ☺️\n\nI find this hilarious because you want the pie but feel guilty for taking it.\n\nYeah I'd feel like an asshole taking the damn pie lol.\n\nI'm absolutely intrigued about the frozen apple pie. I'd be delighted.\n\nThere used to be a race in the north of France (may still exist, just haven't been in 20 years) that gave Maroilles pies before the race. Maroilles is a fairly smelly cheese, and the race was in summer. You can imagine the smell of the car after the race! No regrets though, they were delicious.\n\nDid the 3M half in Austin earlier this year and the bags came with scissors and post-it notes. Really good quality scissors.\n\nRunning and scissors. The perfect combination\n\nMy parents told me never to run with scissors, my lesbian friend told me never to scissor with the runs\n\nAs family of a 3M employee, I am not surprised by this.  I haven’t bought a post it in 15 years, and we have gotten free scissors at least twice.  We just get buckets of freebies.\n\nLol we assumed it was like leftovers that they just pulled together. Worked out great for us; we’re always losing scissors.\n\nI’m really tired right now and I thought you ran a 3 meter half. I was like what the hell kind of race is that?\n\nMy kind of race 😔\n\nRan a race in Huntington Beach. They gave a picture by a local photographer, of a bird in the surf at Huntington Beach. 35 years later I still have it\n\nCan confirm, I am the bird.\n\nCan confirm, I am the photographer\n\nA half marathon I did as a teenager (26.2 with Donna, to finish breast cancer) gave us medals that were stained glass one year—it was so beautiful!\n\nCorning NY wine glass series the medals are blown glass - they’re so beautiful \n\nOh my gosh, just looked those up and they’re stunning.\n\nFabulous! The Baltimore 10 Miler does this too, it's a lion face because you begin at the zoo.\n\nSunglasses. They were a nice item in themselves but even now many months after the race people in the Facebook group for the event regularly post photos of where in the world they've been with the glasses\n\nMy favorites are fleece hat, gloves, spike bag, super nice pottery mug, insulated lunch cooler, and a bottle opener.\n\na hydration belt!\n\nA beach towel \nA transition towel \nWinter hat\n\nAlso got a beach towel and it has been my go to gym towel for years\n\nI got a lunch box for running a half marathon like 6 years ago and use it almost every day.\n\nThe Portland Marathon gave out some decent arm sleeves that I really liked the look of last year, and I use them all the time. They were especially nice for a marathon because I could start with them on to stay warm, then just shove them in a pocket during the race.\n\nIn 2019, I ran a race in Switzerland and they gave out engraved wooden-handled fondu forks, a cup of fondu cheese (sealed like a Mac n’cheese cup), a full banana and the largest can of beer I’ve ever seen.\n\ni got a pine tree seed starter kit. it’s pretty cool and i’m trying hard not to kill the tree!\n\nOne race gave away bushes.  I have 3 of them now around my house\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat’s an awesome idea if the kids are up to it. My mom is involved with organizing a charity 5k for a children’s hospital here- I’m gonna pass that one on.\n\na glow in the dark wood medal made by a local artist. it’s so freaking cool!!!\n\nA race in San Diego county.  Award was a bird carved from local hardwood tree, by a local Native American artist.  Still have it.\n\nOn 13 July 1991 I ran the Knysna marathon in South Africa and was the last official finisher (ran with ITB and finished four marathons and ultra marathons after the cut-off (04:30) that year). When I crossed the finish line I was told to stick around for prize-giving. Much to my surprise and delight, there was a tradition which I didn't know about before: the last runner home was presented with a walking stick. I thus became the proud owner of a yellowwood and stinkwood walking stick, presented by one of my running heroes, Comrades Marathon legend Wally Hayward. It is my most prized running-related possession.\n\nArm sleeves and a day pass to the Addidas employee store.\n\nNYC marathon gives out a fleece lined hooded cape that's pretty great.\n\nA towel. Perfect for the gym.\nI use them constantly.\n\nDoes food count as swag? After I crossed the 10k finish line at the Saint Paul Turkey Trot when it was like -20° F / -29° C they handed me a warm turkey sandwich and a cup of hot coffee. The most magical moment of bliss in my entire life.\n\nI got a nice hydration system from a half marathon called the Iron Girl (running only...weird name).   I also got a really cool buff for the Phunt 50K.\n\nMy first half marathon gave out beautiful posters. I framed it and put it on my office wall.\n\nI also ran a 5k that gave out huge cupcakes. What can I say, I run for chocolate.\n\nA backpack and running belt.\n\nA bottle of Dr. Bronners. 😆\n\nI respect it. I’d appreciate it, too. Unless it was a distance to provoke chafing and they gave out the peppermint kind…\n\nTowel cover for my car seat! Great for the summer on my faux leather seats- and for soaking up sweat after a run\n\nA local triathlon is run by a family who owns a bakery. Every participant gets a loaf of cinnamon bread.\n\nOooh, that reminds me, we have a race in Florida called \"Spud Run\" where everyone gets a head of cabbage and a handful of potatoes. All of the produce is grown along the race route, and had been harvested the day before.\n\nI got this little ceramic medallion with a feather imprinted on it.\n\nOne of my local races always has a local clay artisan (a different artist each year) make the medals. They are beautiful and make good coasters (I put felt on the back so they don't scratch my table)\n\nI'm running the SF Marathon next month for a beach towel and tote bag.\n\nI got some great socks from a local 20 mile run once. I still wear them now. Really comfy. \n\nThat said…\nMan I want more T-shirts. \n\nAll my local events will charge £10-20 extra if I want a shirt and the bloody events are crazy expensive already.\n\nOnce after a 5K my name got pulled out of a hat for a raffle prize. The prize was a $20 gift certificate to a cigar shop. I found it absolutely hilarious.\n\nMaybe it doesn’t count, but one of my local races does a loyalty thing and every year you get a better piece of swag. 5th year I think, I got this lightweight jacket that is absolutely perfect and I wear it so much.\n\nI hope all the race directors are reading this thread and taking notes.\n\nHammock from a trail race\n\nA summer sausage, a block of cheese, and a a  jar of mustard.\n\nA chia pet\n\nBottle of wine\n\nA few running hats and a trucker hat (less useful). \n\nSome beanies. \n\nSun glassses, quality ones not shit cheap ones. \n\nA back pack. \n\nA few duffle backs, including a waterproof one. \n\nRunning socks. \n\nHoodies.\n\nA decanter (race award)\n\nSome coasters. \n\n\nTrail races are always better than road races for these sort of things.  Wine themed races tend to have some more unique, but wine related, giveaways.\n\nThe Tokyo Marathon poncho cape thing is so nice. Baltimore Marathon's \\[metal?\\] crab medal is cool too.\n\nThe Flying Pig usually does a duffel bag or backpack of some kind. I’ve always found them pretty useful.\n\nI once ran an ice cream 10k and we got a huge spoon as our medal/to use to eat the ice cream after the race! \n\nI still use it from time to time!\n\nReally nice new gym bag this year…and another nice mesh bag from a race a couple of years ago that I use for scuba equipment.\n\nA 10k gave me a fanny pack and I still carry my phone in it on runs\n\nCoaster. Socks. Beer glass.\n\nA buff that works great as a sweatband\n\n\nSoftbottle\n\nI got socks once!! Love them. And I’ve gotten hats, from trucker style to a toque!\n\nI feel so much relief when races don't incur extra expenses to give me stuff I could buy on my own if I wanted. I have too much stuff 😕\n\nLove the option of “no shirt - donate to charity.” When that’s not an option and I show up to get my bib and say no shirt, I get looked at like I have two heads. 🤣\n\nFinish line tape! They have everyone one during the pandemic years. I love that I have a whole finish line hanging off my medal collection\n\nRan the Bologna marathon this past March. Lots of local food samples, including really yummy Parmesan cheese, balsamic, etc. then they also included a bunch of race recovery stuff - including arnica gel. Awesome to have on hand since I was traveling. They also had a cooling neck gaiter that I’ve been using constantly now. Lastly was some coupons for local shops, including the pharmacy (steps from the end of the race). It was seriously awesome and way more than anything I got in the states\n\nI got a pizza cutter from a half marathon once. Life is about balance, you know?\n\nI received a gym bag that has a compartment for shoes. Not the roomiest but it keeps my clothes and all separate.\n\nA key chain\n\nI got a key chain from the Edinburgh marathon and I know I’ll have it forever\n\nThere's a snowshoe race near me that people can walk or run (I'm not shelling out the money for speed snowshoes so I power hike it) but they have the best swag. Last year was a boco fanny pack and the year before was a boco hat and they threw in soccer scarves that they had leftover from the year before. \n\nInsulated cooler bag\n\nI ran a ladies mermaid themed run and they gave us a cute little necklace with a mermaid tail charm at the finish line. 🧜‍♀️\n\n- Gloves with fold-over mitts\n\n- Goodr sunglasses\n\n- Lacrosse ball\n\nA Paddington Bear!\n\nI wish we didn’t get “swag” and paid $25 less.\n\nA back pack!.....luv it since have a closet worth of shirts from races\n\nA sapling. For an Earth day themed 5k.\n\nI finished third in a mountain race and won a very nice ceramic coffee mug. It is absolutely beautiful! The winner got a big ceramic plate with the same design and the second place runner got a big salad bowl also with the same design!\n\nIt’s not swag but I got a granite plaque from a marathon I placed second in.\n\nI got a jar of Biscoff cookie spread once.\n\nThe slice of Lou Malnati's pizza I got after a Chicago half marathon - my introduction to the best deep dish in Chicago and a gift that keeps on giving with every take-out order\n\nWe received Goodr sunglasses. I was quite happy with that!\n\nMy local trail marathons give out hand made pottery mugs with the race name on them, my favourite brew mugs!\n\nTwo bottles of wine!! 🍷\n\nBeach towel! It was such a good thing to get.\n\nRunning gloves\n\nI still use my drawstring backpack from the Austin half in 2020, unfortunately that was their last good swag year\n\nGot a finisher medal that doubles as a bottle opener\n\nI’ve gotten a few buffs, a pair of fleece gloves and a fleece hat.\n\nCompression socks with the race logo. I wear them all the time.\n\nMy other favorite is admittedly a drink vessel. I got an age group prize at the turkey trot and they gave out Yeti-style travel mugs. Fantastic.\n\nThe Bird in Hand half marathon in Amish country gives you a horseshoe for a medal. If you do that race and Garden Spot in the same year, you get the road apple award, which is some petrified horse poop on a plaque. I'm very proud to have it.\n\nThere’s a half I do every year that gives out a tote bag full of snacks and drinks when you finish. It’s always a bomb selection of snacks and I use the tote bags every time I grocery shop.\n\nDrop the races for the great merch!\n\nI did the Dramathon in Scotland in 2019 and the \"medal\" was an old piece of a whisky barrel. It smells so good! They also gave out small bottles of all the distilleries we ran by as well as some short bread.\n\nA decent pen with the name of the race on it.\n\nAh! I get so much joy from nice pens.\n\nI got a really nice jacket from a half, also a blanket from a 10 mile\n\nPride flag blanket from a pride race is one of my favorite blankets.\n\nWait I just remembered I ran a race once 20 years ago and received a VHS of a backstreet boys fan behind the scenes. Also dope\n\nBackpack (a nice one with 3 zipper pouches, which I use for my race day gear)\n\nSkin care samples.\n\nMini rechargable fan.\n\nNew Balance bucket hat is a good one, and a pair of NB shorts that have been in the rotation for years now. Trucker hat too that I wore out over many miles, RIP. I do also have a lot of bad shirts I've never worn though....\n\nSeawheeze used to have lulu shorts with the entry and then a hat at the end as well as saje goodies. That was such a good race!\n\nI got a medal that is a bottle opener. Milwaukee based AF.\n\nThere's also a running series in Milwaukee over the winter. Six races, and if you run all six, your medals magnetically connect to form a giant snowflake. I always thought that was cool, too.\n\n**Edit** I ran a 10Km in the Texas Hill Country once and the swag was a wine glass. That I then got to use as part of a free wine tasting event related to the race. Hell yeah.\n\nHuge custom made large coffee mug/soup mug with running quote.\n\nSoft-sided cooler.\n\nHand made pottery mug with tree to plant at an earth day marathon (instead of shirt or medal).\n\nGloves (add them to my stash of throw-aways and always keep extras in the car).\n\nDry wicking running hats.\n\nBuffs. (Can never have enough.)\n\nClip on flashing running light.\n\nSocks.\n\nA nice hoodie sweatshirt. \n\nWinter fleece headband with ponytail hole. \n\nBeanies.\n\nWeirdest: in 2022 a well known large marathon gave out Dude brand butt wipes with packet pickup…sadly I saw many wrappers on the course 😫.\n\nGot a mini softshell cooler for the Flying Pig in Cincinnati in 2019. I still use it.\n\nHands down - pics of finishing with friends or family members. These bring the memories that beat all else.\n\nI ran a 5k for a brewery once. I\nTurned out it wasn’t for charity, like I had been led to believe. \n\nI was promised a beer glass with the swag. I didn’t like the one they gave me so I stole a better one (full of beer) as well as the one they “gave” me. Awkward bike home. \n\nTo this day it’s a favorite bit of swag. Cardio + Drunken shenanigans = win\n\nA zip-up running jacket! I do love the pints/mugs though — it’s way more satisfying than a shirt to me.\n\nA piece of the mountain I ran up (Mt. Evans Ascent time goal = a chunk of granite)\n\nA hand-made clock\n\nA race near me passes by 3 breweries. Their medal is also a bottle opener and you get a pack of 6 different beers brewed by the breweries you just ran through. Bottle opener isn't great but the beers are.\n\nAt my first ever trail race I got a buff which I still use frequently.\n\n2 small relatively waterproof backpacks I use for going kayaking. 1 before with the running merch khaki fruits and a bunch of lotions for runners, vaseline and a refreshing spray. The second one after finishing with some snacks, AA drink and again filled to the brim with khaki fruits.\n\nThe València area is known for khaki fruits apparently. It was great.\n\nI organize a 10 mile race in the middle of winter in Maine, and it goal is to always have some sort of useful award rather than a medal or something else that'll get thrown out (and which coincidentally works well for marketing or race in the local community.) They are often themed and seasonally appropriate for it race.\n\nSome of the awards we've given out off of the top of my head include: \n\n* Backpack\n* Coffee tumbler\n* Face mask (the kind you run in to keep yourself warm) \n* Headlamp\n* Reflective safety vest\n* Winter running hat \n* Ski cap\n* Running socks\n* Scarf \n* Neck buff \n\nWe always get good feedback and are always on the lookout for our next award option.\n\n#1 Nike Women's Series: a Tiffany's silver necklace.  \n#2 Portland Marathon/Half-Marathon: a nice metal race pendant/badge/charm-thing that could be added to a charm braclet, necklace or used as a general adornment.  \n#3 Really nice hat: great art on the front (race mascot) and the bill had topographic lines in the design (it was a trail event)\n\nA buff or a snood as it’s called in the UK\n\nThis ribbon with adhesive at each end to use as a way to hold my phone. No idea what it’s called. I’ve never seen them in stores. \n\nGot a really nice throw blanket running the Great Turtle Half on Mackinac Island a few years ago.\n\nI have a great running hat (trail race) and a great beanie (road race).\n\nI just got a fancy looking Salomon duffel bag that I haven’t had a chance to use. \n\nI also got a full zip technical long sleeve shirt/sweater kind of thing. I’ve worn it and it’s nice but the race logo on the front may start to bother me cause it’s scratchy on the inside\n\nI got a great running belt from a 5k for a local park names Caumsett\n\nI ran a 5k in Minneapolis on a cold March day like 15 years ago and earned a running headband/earmuffs that I still wear all the time.\n\nOak barrel half Lynchburg TN.  Nice running socks.\n\nRan a 50k where the swag was an outdoor blanket that ties up into a roll. It’s the handiest swag I’ve gotten, it lives in my car and has come in handy many times.\n\nMittens! Have been using them for 15 years.\n\nA medal hanger for the wall\n\nOne of my medals has a bottle opener on the back, so that one is cool. It gets to live in the kitchen.\n\nGloves, from a winter race.\n\nSweat towel, from a summer race.\n\nOne is a stadium blanket for picnics and another was a cooler backpack.\n\nHeadsweats visor and some lightweight quarter zips.\n\nArm warmers, Savageman triathlon\n\nWater bottle, bar-sized towel, art made by an animal at the sanctuary the run supported, bottle opener.\n\nBeach towel\n\nI ran a half marathon with the words \"road warrior\" in the name, they gave us plastic Viking helmets with horns.\n\nSome good quality slide sandals, a gift card that could be used at a bunch of business in the local area, and little travel tool kit.\n\ntowel from tokyo marathon\n\nNot me but my ex got a big belt buckle. I always thought it was cool!\n\nMuffler - very useful in winter!\n\nI got a beach blanket for a races 20th anniversary. This blanket will see lots of beach days this summer.\n\nGloves!\n\nThe Falmouth road race coffee mugs are so awesome, but idk if that counts as a cup to you haha\n\nTimely, since it just concluded last weekend but Broken Arrow Triple Crown has the best swag in the business. This year the headliners were a Salomon tech fleece, a nomadic full size towel, and a Salomon long sleeve. You also usually get flasks (this year we got Salomon 250, handheld, and XA filter along with hydrapak speed cup) and a whole host of other goodies. \nIn the past we have gotten full size Salomon duffels (I think the iron face challenge people got these this year), Salomon backpacks (2 for the triple crown!!! A small one and a large one), and drop bags. \n\nYou basically make money when you consider value of swag and race registration fee.  Can't speak more highly of it.\n\nI got some nice mittens from a race a while back!\n\nI got two pairs of compression socks at St. Jude - one from my employer as part of our team swag and another pair for being a hero. My favorite is the shirt that I got to screen print in Memphis. Picking your color tee and design and screen printing it was pretty cool.\n\nPackable blanket. Great for camping!! Also has buckles to wear it as a cape.\n\nNice warm beenie, think Carhart but softer and just as warm, with the race logo of course.\n\nI’ve received some cool trucker hats at races.\n\nBandana with an ice pocket\n\nI got a dandelion yellow hat from a chilly 10 mile race, from race day packet pickup, which came in clutch since I forgot one. I love it.\n\nIt’s not close. Got a headband from the “Race to Wrigley” in which you actually ran on the Cubs’ stadium. Orange with a little Cub on it and the name of the race on the front. \n\nI wear the headband every time I run. Held up well and great memorabilia.\n\nGloves\n\nI have a nice backpack from Western States that I still use 9 years later. Yes, a backpack was a part of swag among many other items.\n\nFinishing medal that doubles as a bottle opener.\n\nShorts!\n\nA mug from the Kingston 10-miler. Towel from NZIM x2.\n\nFull size towels, a cutting board, sweatpants, pottery mug, hoodies, socks, shoe gaiters\n\nI got a surfboard finisher medal for the surf city half marathon and loved it\n\nMy wife once did a race where the swag bag included two bottles of sex lube. Bizarre but useful!\n\nSocks and wildflower packets.\n\nA pair of arm warmers.  15 years down the line, I am still using them.  Thank you 113 events.\n\nI got a towel that has a hood on top that goes over the headrest of my car. It permanently stays on my carseat. Genius\n\nI pinched one of the event signs from a Marathon so I’ve got a giant “caution! Runners!” sign hanging on my wall\n\nTrail Racing Over Texas at least once gave Rarámuri style baskets. Very useful for holding small items, looks good, and was a nice touch that reflects the area where the runs were held.\n\nA running hat provided at the 2013 Knoxville Marathon is still collecting miles all these years later. Good design, quality construction, and just plain work well. It was part of every marathoner's package. \n\nFree warm up sprays, body/skin glide, and nutrition at runs in Korea were always appreciated, even if only for their uniqueness (example: bitter ginseng drinks). Most items at runs elsewhere (U.S., Germany, Poland) were forgettable, have tacky designs/printing, or were only available for extra cost."

    "all_comment_text": "Trail running helps me. If I stop paying attention then I hit the dirt.\n\ntrue for me too! love trail running. i can identify plants, bird songs, rocks, AND run while trying to avoid obstacles. all at the same time. its so busy, it allows me to finally relax. during my first (and only 50k) the one big spill i took was because i saw a patch of cool mushrooms (i suck at mushroom ID tho) and turned around to the person behind me to say, \"look at those cool mushrooms!\". BAM. barrel roll.\n\nFalling over because you got distracted by some cool looking mushrooms is the most relatable thing I think I have ever read on the internet.\n\nSincerely, another runner with ADHD\n\nThis is absolutely true. My friend and I have discussed trail vs. road running, and why I like road running more, and why she likes trail running more.\n\nMe: \"I don't like trail running because I have to focus on where I'm putting my feet all the time, and I burn out.\"\n\nHer: \"Agreed, trail running gives me something to focus on. On the road, my mind is free to wander and won't go quiet. The focus of trail quiets my mind.\"\n\nMe: \"Agreed, road running allows me to zone out and run on autopilot, which quiets my mind.\"\n\nSo we each prefer the one over the other for the exact same reasons 😄\n\nSame, also Climbing, Kickboxing. BJJ, Weightlifting, etc Stuff that gives instant feedback if ypu don't pay attention :p\n\n....mountain biking.\n\nRunner with ADHD here. I definitely feel like my running helps manage ADD and it definitely makes a dramatic difference for my depression. I don't struggle too much with boredom while running - I turn on some tunes and just let my mind wander wherever it wants. I feel like it centers me. Regarding your question about distance goals - I am super obsessive about my mileage targets and I obsess about running in general. I always have distance goals in mind and will damn near kill myself to hit them (not saying that's always a good thing lol). I tend to be pretty scattered and directionless, and I feel like running gives me a focus and a purpose which really helps me counter those tendencies a bit.\n\nI also feel that running is one of the only things that gives me a sense of accomplishment and pride at like, setting a goal and achieving it, versus the most simple of life maintenance tasks that somehow feel insurmountable to me. Like.. schedule doctor appointments? Impossible! Train for and run a half marathon? Yes please. \n\nOne of my hypotheses is that the threat of injury if I don't train correctly provides my brain with just enough urgency to keep it interesting and top of mind.. but I don't know. It may just be more that the nice chemicals I get from running are a super boost to my brain and it (luckily) keeps on working. \n\nI will say sometimes when my body is not on board (feeling sluggish, what have you) I can get into a good rhythm by tapping my fingertips together as a means of keeping a certain cadence, or I just try to sing along to my music, and it gives my brain so many things to do that I am able to just bop along without thinking about how many miles are left, etc.\n\nStaying hydrated and properly fueling throughout the week can be tough, but I use apps and reminders and alarms galore!\n\nI also find that setting running goals are way easier to accomplish than “simple” life stuff. I’m currently training for my first half. I am obsessed every day about where I am in my training and making sure I train in a way to avoid injury. But have I folded and put away my laundry? Absolutely not. Tomorrow is a rest day on my plan and I absolutely hate it. I *need* the feeling of running Monday through Saturday. But I know I have to take the rest to avoid injury.\n\nOh god this is me to a T - and I was never diagnosed with ADHD, although I've suspected it for reasons very much like what you describe. I HATE off days. That, and I've had a horrible week where everything just went off the rails because I had to take the whole week off due to overdoing it the last couple of days. I know rationally that it'll make next week better and that it's a lesson I need to learn (in running and in life) but similarly, when something like this happens, it's not just the running that goes off the rails, everything does. Gawd.\n\nI think it is easier to run than to do life stuff because it does not require concentration. In addition, it gives dopamine.\n\nIt's miraculous and I hope my body can keep doing it for many years!\n\nrunning from life\n\nTHIS EXACTLY i will say though sometimes i'll use running as an excuse to procrastinate 😭\n\nYES!  Running is the best form of procrastination there is.  Not only are you not responsible for doing anything but run, no one expects you to do anything but run!\n\nMan I'm so glad I joined this subreddit and found others with the same thoughts I have. This was a great comment to make me feel better about myself. Thank you.\n\nThis!! I struggle with ADHD and running helps me focus afterwards as long as I don't tire myself too much. I have found that having a rotation of shoes that I like keeps me motivated. I like having a variety of feelings under foot.\n\nOh man, don't even get me started on the shoe rotation! I put a disproportionate amount of thought into running shoes and my poor bf patiently listens to me drone on about which kind of shoes I like wear for which runs and on and on and on...It's a thing!\n\nIt's def a thing. I do the exact thing with my partner!\n\nThis is me all over\n\nI’m an ultra runner with crippling (at times) ADHD. \n\nRunning definitely helps with symptoms unless I end up very fatigued. Workouts can be hard to navigate during the week. My house is an absolute disaster during big training blocks. \n\nI’m generally pretty type B with broad training goals (e.g, peak over 70MPW, get in a 30 mile run 4-6 weeks out from A race). I usually reach these but have tailored my goals to my way of reaching them. That is, they are broad goals that  can be reached in a lot of different ways.\n\n\nFor longer distances ADHD is my super power. I can zone out for hours during a long run and just let my legs do the work. I’m rarely, rarely bored. Honestly, recovery runs can be the hard ones as I have trouble until I can get in the zone. \n\n\nI usually listen to music for workouts and podcasts/nothing for long stuff.\n\nSame here. My ADD is the I kind, not the H kind, but running helps me burn off some mental energy and allows me to focus a little better in other areas of my life. I listen to music but it’s just whatever I’m in the mood for - sometimes it’s slow and sad, sometimes it’s pop, sometimes rock. I have asthma and I’ll never be fast so I don’t worry about my pace, but I usually have a distance goal in mind. I like to keep a race on the calendar which keeps me motivated. And having that goal helps me with focused training, otherwise I feel a bit aimless and lost.\n\nThis is me, too. \n\nI think it's easy to treat everyone with some form of ADD/ADHD the same, but I'm a space cadet. Running helps me be my best.\n\nTo OP, goals end the second you achieve them, or failing can ruin what is otherwise something you enjoy. \n\nIf you make running part of your identity and think of it as a way you find joy and personal fulfillment, the rest will fall into place. There's no such thing as a failed run, so give yourself some grace.\n\nAlso... PODCASTS!! History of Rome, Strong Songs, Revolutions, Hardcore History, Gastropod, 99% Invisible.\n\nI set some aggress goals for running and achieved all of them. Afterwards I was depressed. I've started therapy and take meds for both the depression and ADD, but it's also been a process of learning to run as a form of play, rather than feeling guilty for not doing the \"run I was supposed to.\"\n\nIt's like playing an instrument or videogames. There's no right or wrong way to run, but feeling bad defeats the purpose. Let it be a way to express yourself, without judgement.\n\nHeck, Michael Phelps struggled after retiring. Not implying he has ADHD, but I adds fuel to the argument that setting performance goals does lead to happiness.\n\nAFAIK Phelps was diagnosed with ADHD in 6th grade\n\nthere are lots of different flavors of ADHD, but studies have shown that [ADHD folk are underrepresented in the competitive athletes population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8151350/#:~:text=Interestingly%2C%20it%20has%20been%20suggested,in%20young%20athletes%20%5B39%5D). if running seems harder for you because of your symptoms, you probably just have a different, incompatible flavor. \n\nfor me, i will often have like many strains of thought plus a song running in my inner monologue, but after a half mile or so of running, those voices focus to a single train of thought. (is this what normal is like?) i can turn on a podcast and actually listen to it and focus on what they are saying. i can zone out and just think about one small thing and stay thinking about it. its very relaxing, and i love doing it mid day to clear out all the accumulated work bullshit going on in my head.\n\nSame for me, after 45-60 minutes my brain quiets down to just … calm. \n\nTrail running is my favorite because I can go explore trails and mountains and the weather is always different and I can obsess over training and data of I want - or not. If life is to overwhelm I can just throw on my shoes and go out the door\n\nRunning is a major helper in beating the guilt of \"I haven't done anything all day\" because having done a run guarantees that I *have* done something today to make myself better. It helps me a lot to play music for runs to break up monotony and keep myself grounded during intense workouts.\n\nI feel this! The day doesn’t feel complete without some sort of distance workout now. \n\nTrail running. Cant turn your brain off HAVE to pay attention or you’re gonna bust your ass.\n\nI can't do audiobooks while running. I always end up losing focus and missing something. Sometimes podcasts work but mostly it's music for me. I almost never feel bored while running though. If I stop before I'm fatigued it's more likely because I  need to get home and shower because mismanaged my time and started running 30 minutes later than I meant to.\n\nRunning definitely helps with my focus  and energy afterwards though.\n\nThe time mismanagement is so real for me. I have been known to be fully dressed and just sit on my bed zoning out for an hour then am annoyed I can't fit my run in.\n\nI always mismanage my time when it comes to running and often have to cut it shorter than I originally planned. I even leave the house on time most of the time but then I get to the trail and scroll my phone for half an hour. It’s so frustrating\n\nI know this all to well. I'll spend 20 minutes sorting things for my run when I should be out the door. Or get lost on amazon looking for some new god dawn laces that I don't really need.....but just incase.\n\nRunning absolutely helps, its always been a way to burn off some extra energy all the way back when I was a kid. Its very meditative. The only thing is, I *have* to have music otherwise I cant zone out and enjoy the run. And also since Im timeblind, I have no sense of pace.\n\nI time long runs with my adderall dosages. Once its kicked in I can run what needs to be run without noise or anything. \n\n  \nShort runs - grin and bear it.\n\nyes. working out has been a literal lifesaver. I'm hiking or in the gym all the time. i cannot explain how much it has helped but i can tell you there were days a few months ago i wanted to end my life. the transformation has been incredible ♥️💪\n\nThis! This right here is everything. I’m so proud of you!! \n\nI am an ultra runner and it definitely saved my life too because I was at a really bad point in my life and was having death ideation. Having a goal to run a 100 miler was at one time the only thing in life I felt that I had to motivate me. Plus the mental and physical benefits of all the exercise were good! I have difficulty regulating emotions and it’s worse when I don’t get massive amounts of exercise.\n\nI found out a few months ago that I’m autistic! So that explained a lot about the difficult period in my life and motivates me extra to keep running because it supports my metal health so much. I’ve been working with a life coach for ultra running who helps me with not just running but also she’s kind of like the support person I need as an autistic person! The skills she’s helping me with have been really helpful in navigating life and developing mental strength and emotional awareness. \n\nSolidarity with all you fellow neorodivergent runners, we’re all amazing!\n\nthis comment is something i really needed. i identify with this more than i would like. autism... maybe. \n\nmost people think i am difficult or needy or arrogant. most people don't take the time to get to know me. most people fucking leave when i tell them about myself, only making my trust issues worse. there is not a harder working(when i feel supported which is fucking never) or more loyal person. i base my actions off of yours. period. most people today see me as a project that's not worth the time. most people put their faith in fucking idiots. \n\nif it wasn't for the woods and the gym, i would probably be in an institution or fucking dead. i am sorry about the negative response but every single person i know literally only cares about themselves. they will abandon you, label it \"keeping their peace\" or some other bullshit, and pretend you don't exist. i am talking about everyone. not a woman. \n\nthis had nothing to do with your reply but it's a difficult morning and i actually have real feelings. i express them. i care about myself and others, so that makes me a freak in 2024.\n\nIt’s ok! 🤗 You are expressing yourself, and how you feel now can and will change. I can really relate, I am an oversharer by nature and that definitely can make people distance themselves. However, those are not your people. Your people will love you for you and you will be able to be yourself around them. Also, maybe consider running an ultra - in my experience that is a safe space where people can overshare and nobody judges, in fact it’s sort of normal 😊\n\nOne of the beautiful things for me about the autism diagnosis was that it was finally an invitation and permission to accept myself. And that has started the unmasking process for me. Strangely, since I embraced my autism and started telling my friends about it (along with a “this is why I overshare, and I’m constantly worried that you’ll stop being my friend but I’ll miss the cues and be blindsided by rejection so please give me feedback about how I can be a better friend”) and my friendships actually started flourishing!! \n\nThe other thing that happened was that a week before I learned it’s actually autism, my therapist thought I had BPD. Which was devastating news and I thought I’d never have good relationships and was willing to embrace being solo for life. So autism was a relief, I can finally be kind to myself and I can learn the skills! I also started Dialectal Behavior Therapy during this time and that has really helped too! \n\nI also run my 100 mile races without pacers or crew because the added stress of trying to maintain friendships/relationships is a lot on top of being that tired! I’m learning the skills and learning to rely on myself in life and that’s been very empowering.\n\nI hope this inspires you to know that you are not alone and that things can and will get better for you. I have several ADHD friends and I love them, ADHD personalities are soooo fun!!! \n\nTake care of yourself and I’m rooting for you!! You got this!!\n\nI like podcasts and YouTube videos. And just doing out and backs are my personal favorite, distance is something I put a general goal out for but if I’m feeling good I’ll go a little further. Running helps me get through my thoughts tho\n\n Can I bandwagon on this and ask if people run on or off their meds? Just starting vyvanse and I don’t want to mess my body up but I’m wondering how others do it! :)\n\nI’m in a similar situation hoping for answers.\n\nI run in the mornings before taking the meds and the day after I’ve taken Vyvanse (22 hours post-dose), my HR is higher and my endurance is worse. I’m trying to decide whether to run 0:30/mile slower or 5bpm higher.\n\nSame same. I need my meds to stay focused and not quit, but they wear off after like 90mins\n\nI take Adderall IR as needed. I don't like the side effects and how they make me feel overall, so I only take them occasionally. I've run on and off meds. I prefer running off the meds but I find a run during comedown helps me feel a lot better. My HR is a bit higher on the meds (I've just come to accept this) but never dangerous. I also want to go faster but it's harder to run as long. Talk to your doctor to make sure it's ok and keep an eye on your HR.\n\nThis is good thank you!\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was taking strattera and my HR was killing my running. I was a bit out of shape already and trying to get back into a rhythm but my HR being excessively high due to meds wasn’t helping. Ive done several half’s and a full marathon for reference but generally only run 1-2 times a week or do peloton. I’ve switched to Wellbutrin and have been lifting and my HR isn’t as high but yet to begin running/intense cardio.\n\nMy Vyvanse increases my heart rate a little bit, but also makes me feel less tired. I’m on a relatively low dose, so if you start slow with your doctor, you can find a dose that doesn’t make you too amped up to exercise.\n\nI have multiple playlists of varying subgenres ready to shuffle through. I'm constantly playing the first half of songs then hitting next, but even ten miles in I don't crack the surface of my total collection. Music really moves me, though, like what the bass is doing and how a singer phrases things and the way a track is arranged and what memories I associate the song with, etc. So despite my natural restlessness I'm anchored mentally by the song and what my body is doing, if that makes sense. Ninety minutes flies by.\n\nSame! I particularly like drum and bass, always have, and sometimes I use the predictable A B A B C A format to run sprint intervals to keep it interesting lol\n\nI listen to the Grateful Dead and other jam music on long slow runs. Nothing like a dark star to keep you guessing\n\nI love putting on a random live album (usually Mydland era) and heading out for a long chill run! Live Phish usually does the trick too. If it’s an early morning run I’ve been jamming to Tycho or Bonobo. ✌️\n\nI can tell we would be friends irl. Check out the 40 min “simple” phish did 7/27/24 if you haven’t already lol insane\n\nHitting a runners high during a killer Jerry solo just hits different\n\nI didn’t even realize til I started running, and then stopped running consistently, that I had ADHD. It’s that much of a game changer. Every taper, injury, illness, or busy period of life and I’m an absolute wreck. Running keeps my brain level, I think cause it’s just a little too tired to go so fast? lol I feel like it regulates my emotions and stress levels too. \n\nDo I focus better when I run consistently? Only if I don’t have a training plan to pore over when I should be working, or a question I want to ask Reddit and wind up deep diving at my desk. lol\n\nOut and backs..  can't cut the run short out of boredom if I'm exactly the mileage out that I need to get home.  Also, there's a \"reward\" for hitting the halfway point. \n\nAudiobooks and podcasts help too!\n\nAre you me?\n\nI’ve had ADD for a long time and running has always been my goto activity(love playing beer league hockey too). I used to run with music when I was in high school. Anymore I’m too paranoid about getting smucked by a stupid car. I live in rural mid Michigan and run dirt roads most of the time. I’ll do long runs near my house so I’ll just zone out for 1-2 hours on long runs. I’ll think about things that are bothering me or things that inspire me like my kids. Anything that comes to mind, I just let my mind wonder away. I do the same thing with mowing the lawn, great time to just think. As others have posted, trail running is very fun but I’ve yet to find a good route on the trails at the park near my home. The dirt roads are awesome, very quiet and lots of deer and wildlife to watch in the farm fields and in the woods. Wish I would have got into half marathons when I was younger, didn’t get into them until COVID when I signed up for one after the lockdowns ended.\n\nI always heard that meditating was a helpful practice for people with depression and anxiety. I struggle with sitting still and meditating. But somehow long runs, usually somewhere after about six miles, I’m able to get into this state of flow and stay in the present. \n\nFor me, running is one of the most effective treatments I’ve discovered for ADHD, depression, and anxiety. I’m a better version of myself when I run. At least I think. \n\nI don’t set goals. If I go for an easy 3, i forgive myself for going 2.5 but also feel empowered to roll with the for flow and go for 5. I focus best with music and listen to interesting playlists (usually looking for stuff on last.fm I listened to a decade+ ago). \n\nIt’s weird, but distance running might be the best therapy (and I have a therapist) in my life. \n\nThe only advice is to be you, and embrace your own relationship with it. I know not everyone has the same flow experience that I do with running, but I hope you find that place, wherever it may be.\n\nLove running but often start to get bored and have to push to keep going. LOTS of motivational self-talk to remind myself that it’s only boredom and that my muscles aren’t sore yet and that I can still breathe to maintain pace, etc. Loud, driving music. \n\nI’ve been running for years but gotten more serious lately. I knew I was improving when I went for my first “long run” (5mi for me) with no music or stories!! I managed to daydream and run. It was incredible. I  was back to headphones the next time out, but I’m looking at it as a glimmer of what’s ahead. Quiet head time. Mmmm.\n\nAudiobooks are for walking :)\n\nI’m not diagnosed with ADHD but I have suspected having it. Running helps me focus my day. If I don’t run, it seems like my day goes to hell. At the same time, especially during half marathon training, it’s sometimes hard to keep focus on a training plan and I get tired of it about 3/4 through. I just keep pushing but I wish I had better assistance with keeping focus.\n\nI’m a big audiobook girlie. The only time I listen to music is if it’s super early and I’m not awake, or if I’m running with someone and may have to converse. I try to do out-and-back so that if I can at least make it to the turn around point I can’t just get bored and stop. The hardest for me is if weather is bad and I’m stuck on the treadmill. I have a small apartment gym and I used to prefer to be in there alone but I would easily get bored and cut my run short. I’ve tried running on a treadmill on a larger gym and it actually works perfectly. Between my audiobook and all the distractions around me I can’t focus on getting bored and am able to do longer distances.\n\nAudiobooks have been a game changer for me. I can barely run 3 miles with music, but audio books I can do 10+ without noticing. Keeps my brain engaged enough that I’m not focusing on running at all\n\nI listen to very long podcasts.  My problem is getting bored and changing my route a million times.\n\nI find I need a structured training routine otherwise I get bored and stop or can't decide where to run so just don't. Even if I'm not training for an event I try and set a goal (ie improve my 10km by xx ) and find a plan to follow.\n\n I find longer runs much easier because once I have broken through the 30-45min barrier I feel calm and can just zone out and run.   I have a huge list of podcasts to work through. I also break runs into chunks, I know I will stop and have a drink and gel at certain points so it feels easier.  I try and remind myself not every run will be good and try to just enjoy being outside.\n\nYesterday my 7 year old asked me why I like running.  We try to be as honest with them as possible, so I gave him the best answer I could.\n\nI explained to him that with my ADHD, there are a thousand things going on in my brain at any given time, and my brain thinks that I have to address each and every one of those things.  I told him that's why sometimes Daddy gets overwhelmed and anxious.  But when I'm running, I'm able to focus on just one thing for the entire time, so it's like Daddy's break gets to rest.  It's peaceful for me, like taking a break.  If I don't focus on what I'm doing, my pace can quicken too much or I can trip or any number of things, but it's still just focusing on one thing.  Naps are great, but running is better.  \n  \nSometimes I listen to music, but I almost never wear headphones (Shokz) during races because the people watching is too good.  I prefer to start at the very back of chip timed races, laugh as people gas it out of the start and I pass them standing still a few miles in.  I also talk to people during races.  If I'm around the same pace as someone, or if I need to speed up or slow down a little to hang with them for a bit, just easier to pass the miles that way.  Once you get into half marathons and longer, the time really becomes a boredom thing, so find someone friendly and make small talk.\n\nFor perspective, I'm 36, and it wasn't until well into adulthood that I was diagnosed and by that point I already had a coping strategy in place so medicine was never part of the picture.\n\nI listen to podcasts, audiobooks, and sometimes nothing! Running is my medicine. I never regret a run, though it can be super hard to get out there sometimes. \nI definitely need a plan to follow otherwise I wouldn’t run more than 5 minutes or not at all. I started training for races and it’s been life changing. I always need an end goal to focus on to keep me motivated. It was the same when I played the piano. I always had to have an exam or performance or something I was working towards, otherwise I wouldn’t play, even though I LOVED it. Simply enjoying things without a goal is so hard for a lot of ADHD folk. I just embrace it.\n\nI'm following this because I cannot seem to stop my ADHD thoughts during a run and it really takes me out of it. I get bored so fast :/\n\nwelcome to sprinting 🙏🏾\n\nNo audio for me at all, ever.  If I had to decide on what I’d listen to I’d never get out the door.   I’ve had Spotify for about three years and have yet to creat a playlist because it’s just too much work to think about it.  \n\nRunning is the time for my brain to completely lose focus on everything but pace and distance.   Heart rate?  HAH!  I’d have to go thru the trouble of actually trying to determine what it is and that will never happen. ……\n\nDefinitely helps with calming down all the voices and ideas after finishing the run. I love it and I always look forward to running long distances. Trail running 100% made a huge difference to get me more into running. Take it slow and easy and go for an adventure. Don’t look at distance, focus on time and your ability. Once I started looking at time running instead of distance it made such a big difference, because if I’m running in the road I put headphones on most of the time and either a podcasts or a nice playlist that helps me daydream as I run. When I’m on trail I don’t put headphones on and I focus a lot on the terrain and I also talk to myself or hum or say silly stuff, or sometimes I record my thoughts too lol.\n\nOne thing you need to figure out is if you’re taking meds you want to see what dose works best to be helpful enough with adhd and not too stimulant that it annoys your heart rate if you care about that. I’m still in the process of figuring that out, but I got used it and don’t stress too much about my HR being higher when I’m on meds because I know it’s the meds. And on weekend runs I see my heart rate in expected ranges or even better zones with same effort.\n\nAnyway, go run on trails! If not trails then roads and include some parks. Get used to looking around you and observing the places you’re running in, daydream, focus on breathing and take it easy. Running easy and slow for 1hr is amazing. 30 mins runs are also so good and a hacky way to get you going and doing mundane tasks after!\n\ni listen to edm/dance music on my runs. i’ve had several falls etc tho when i do sometimes zone out &amp; down i go. happened as recently as last month. so i try to refocus myself &amp; pay attention to running. plus i ran outdoors (not even track, must be a giant circle that gets me back home). it keeps my attention going as the landscape changes.\n\nUsing virtual coaching thru the Nike Run Club app\n\nOnly easy I could train for my half marathon. Even listening to music I got bored. My loop was 6 miles and many a day that's where I stopped. I wish I had a good out and back\n\nRunner diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago 🙋🏻‍♀️grew up playing soccer and running, and I’ve run about a dozen half marathons. I’m training for a race in November and this is the first time I’m following a training plan, I’m struggling lol I’m putting in the work I need to but it’s really all based on how I feel. Most days I get close to my daily goal (sometimes over, sometimes under) no problem, but ocassionally I have to reaaally force myself to keep going. Those are the runs where I try listening to everything…music, audiobooks, podcasts, anything to keep myself engaged.\n\nI daydream whilst running and go on autopilot\n\nI am not diagnosed although a couple of therapists have suggested it as a possibility. I run to keep my brain quiet.  Sometimes I do a book/podcast in the beginning to keep a slow pace and then switch to music for the last few miles (because I've gotten bored). I do get distracted but I'm not setting land speed records so stopping to watch a bird or ID a tree or photograph a snail doesn't really make much difference to my times. I usually stick to a training plan even if I'm not racing. Remembering to eat well and on a schedule is my challenge.\n\nADHD and running definitely helps me manage my symptoms day to day. I burn off energy and get a lot of the intrusive thoughts out of the way. I don’t usually train with headphones - my run is the one time of day I give my brain full permission to think about whatever it wants to, and it honestly makes the time pass so quickly!\n\nYes, i started running by chance but then kept it up precisely because I found out it helped me manage my mood incredibly well. It has become a form of therapy for me, which helps with motivation a lot.\n\nFeeling this way makes me REALLY not want to skip on runs.\n\nI listen to podcasts and get lost in my thoughts so rarely deal with boredom. But I definitely started running before I was diagnosed to manage my symptoms and still do to this day. It makes a big difference and just brings a calming energy for the remainder of a day\n\nMaybe I'm a freak but I've always rawdogged running, I also have a propensity for long walks as well with nothing but my thoughts. I think the act of that simple movement is really nice for my brain. I do think I used exercise as a form of \"self medication\" before I knew I had ADHD. If I set out to do a certain workout, I always complete it barring threats to safety  The thing with ADHD is that everyone is still going to be able to focus on something and that will vary wildly. \n\nTreadmills on the other hand are the bane of my existence and even with a good show or music, I simply can hardly stand it\n\nReading this makes me feel so much better and not alone thank you guys\n\nI have to have a time (not distance) goal. I set a time goal and promise myself to be out for that amount of time no matter what, even if I end up walking. I find a podcast or a playlist that'll last that amount of time (like 1 hour). For me it's a mental/initiation game of even getting started in the first place and setting the time goal helps me to be like \"it's only 30 mins and then you can do the next thing\" or whatever. Once I'm out though, I'm able to stick to my goal/plan and 99% of the time end up running the full time.\n\nI also like to run hills and/or through parks with winding paths. I get sooooo bored running through flat, grid neighborhoods/city blocks. I live in a place where if I just run a half mile and cross the main road through my town, the neighborhoods offer both. \n\nETA what I listen to: trashy, energetic pop music (boy bands like 1 Direction even though I'm much older than the \"1D\" generation lol), and podcast interviews of people i find interesting, especially if they're funny. smartless has been a great podcast for time and entertainment. Sometimes I will even listen to the same song multiple times in a row. Unsurprisingly, I have a tendency to hyperfixate and listen to the same things over and over while running.\n\nI run because it feels good. The positive impact on my ADHD symptoms is just a bonus, and it's one I tend to forget about until I get sick or injured and can't run, and suddenly my brain is even less functional than usual.\n\nIf I don't hit my distance or time goal for a particular run, it's because something is wrong. I've learned the hard way that if I run through certain kinds of pain or fatigue, I'm going to end up seriously hurt or sick, so I try to cut things short if something feels off in a not-normal-for-me way. I'm still more likely to keep running when I probably should have turned back than the opposite, though.\n\nRunning is my guilt-free don't-have-to-try-to-make-my-brain-behave time, so I rarely get bored. I'm either letting my mind percolate whatever my latest hyperfixation is (usually while listening to music), or I'm listening to an immersive (but not challenging!) audiobook, or I'm listening to podcasts that don't really require my full attention but provide some nice mental stimulation, or I'm enjoying the scenery if I'm running trails. The only time I get bored is when I'm doing speedwork, because that requires a lot of my mental energy and is also not very interesting. This is probably why I prefer to focus on running longer distances than getting faster.\n\nNo ADHD, but I think this could help some people: I listen to the Big Booty Mixes by Two Friends when I run. They are on Spotify and SoundCloud, not familiar with Apple Music. But they are hour long mixes of songs with little quips in between from viral clips. My favorites are 15, 16, and 17!\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD about 4 months ago. I absolutely ran to manage my symptoms pre-diagnosis, I just didn’t realize the symptoms I was managing were because of ADHD. However, now that I am working on finding the right medication and dosage, running has taken a back seat. Eating properly has been a challenge (although it’s getting better) and the anxiety that used to fuel everything I did in life is gone. I am finally able to recognize how exhausting life has been for me. So, I’ve been prioritizing rest.\n\nSetting a goal for distance has always varied. One year I ran a bunch of half marathons and did a 25k trail run with over 3k elevation gain. Other years I focus on increasing distance or speed. I have to change things up, though, or I do get bored.\n\nI feel bored in the first mile or so when running. But once those endorphin hit, I have no problem keeping going.\n\nI prefer podcasts or audiobooks when I run but will switch to music occasionally.\n\nJust makes it really hard to maintain a consistent pace for me.\n\nYep running helps my ADHD by tiring me out so I’m not as hyperactive. I also feel like I can focus better after a run. I’ve stop taking my meds and replaced them with running. The days I don’t run my ADHD is so bad.\n\nPop my addy then run til my heart explodes\n\nI constantly need to change routes out of boredom. I don’t run with music or podcasts because I prefer to let my thoughts go wild. It allows me to focus properly when I need to, knowing that I’ll have time to daydream ADHD style later in the day/week.\n\nWhy do you ask?\n\nI need running to mitigate my partially unmedicated adhd. It’s the thing that brings my brain back online after a workday of burnout. I listen to podcasts/audiobooks and run loops. I minimally vary my routes (unsafe I know by my brain gets stuck on them).\n\nMusic helps a lot. I find myself rapping to the songs. Airpods are amazing while running.\n\nI listen to podcasts or zone out/think (about anything everything and no one can stop me!)/sing to myself. \n\nTreadmills are great bc you can throw any movie or show on and just GO &amp; bonus? you can't get lost or stranded.\n\nI'm here just scrolling\n\nI jam out to my music. I have a playlist of songs that are upbeat. I don’t care how ridiculous I look dancing while running. It’s fun and keeps me from getting bored\n\nRunning helps increase dopamine and serotonin levels. It makes the ADHD medications work even better. I do steady running for at least 30 minutes to feel the benefits OR I do sprinting intervals (HIIT style) for 20 minutes. The key is consistency. I prefer HIIT because of the runner's high that comes after each session\n\nI often to out and backs and let my mind wanders while I run. With an out and back I cannot get back to my car any faster than if I run, which helps finish it.\n\nI play Pokémon Go. Yes, I know it's stupid, but hear me out.\n\nI multi-task all the time anyway. I. Can. Not. Stop....\n \nPeripherals keep me on the sidewalk. I listen to music with proper bpm for pace with my open ear headphones for cars. And the game gives me that sweet sweet dopamine while distracting me from the suck of running.\n\nI make my brain focus all day everyday. So if I ever have time to game on my computer, I normally just let it relax. I have 1 monitor on YouTube, 2nd on Halo or something, and my phone playing a idle game.\n\nRunning like this gets the excess energy out, while still allowing my brain it's \"me time\" like stated above\n If I don't give it documentaries or puzzles, it won't let me sleep. But with excess energy, I also can't sleep. This is a happy-ish medium.\n\nLong runs, audiobooks and podcasts and for shorter runs music helps with high tempos\n\nI caaaaaan not treadmill run unless it's an all out fucking full on tempo 5k haha. I run outside, personally though, weirdly, I like running the same route outside (kinda like how I like eating the same lunch every day). But also i run while talking to my mom on the phone and that reaaaaally helps keep me from getting bored and stopping haha. Also keeps me in zone 2.\n\nEdit to add: also when I run outside I have to do a big loop so when I get 5km away I can't just quit. It's honestly a bigger me tal workout to make the choice to keep going. The more you felt the mental choice muscle the better you'll feel in your whole life and the easier it gets. You have to work our that muscle.\n\nMy ADHD has become my pronounced with age. I used to be able to run forever; just set my mind somewhere else and let my muscles take over. \n\nNot anymore - I need mental and visual distractions now  else, I’m fighting my brain and just want to quit. \n\nPodcasts, scenery and people are the only way I can get through runs and I’m having a really hard time reconciling my need for these “aids”.\n\nI haven't run in a while, but I always listened to the podcast Stuff You Should Know. Helped me zone out while also not getting beat for me to accidentally match my pace with\n\nExercise is the only time my mind slows down and can feel normal.\n\nI can’t run more than about a mile without a good podcast going. When I’m training, I like to find a good long investigative one that has 8-10 episodes and that takes me through a lot of those runs. And then find another one. My regular daily/weekly ones are sprinkled in there too. It’s the only way I’m not just bored out of my mind.\n\nI have adhd and run in the mornings.  \n\nThe running high and the then taking the medication is AMAZING\n\nThe distraction doesn't stop me going long, podcasts can help.\n\nYes, I use running to manage my symptoms. \nI need music when I’m running or else I get distracted, forget I’m meant to be running and just start walking.  This sounds like a joke but genuinely, I lose focus on what I’m doing and next thing I know I’m wondering why my average pace has fallen to 10 minutes per km. \n\nI enjoy running because it’s one of the few ways I can slow down the thoughts in my head.  But it can be very hard to get started if I don’t go as soon as I get up.  Once I’ve started I am more likely to lose track of time and get in trouble for running longer than I was intending.  \n\nRunning is my special interest topic, specifically my own running stats.  I don’t necessarily set out to run a specific distance because I’m always just trying to get in as much run as I can but I track every run, take notice of the things that impact my speed, keep a spreadsheet of my average pace and other stats on a monthly basis so I can track broader trends, etc.  Then I want to tell people about it because it’s my special interest.  My SO does not share this special interest. \n\nTrail running, out and back runs\n\nWhen I WAS a runner my ADHD was very prevalent and hard to ignore.\n\nAnything beyond 10k would be severely challenging for me mentally. I've done a few half marathons, though.\n\nWhat really helped was switching to Triathlon. The Olympic distance was the perfect mix that kept me focused and I thoroughly enjoyed doing it\n\nMusic helps me, and new scenery and people. The other day I was even on a discord call with my friends while I was running, that was pretty fun.\n\nI get bored when I dont allow myself to sprint. Other than that, I find a good constant pace and uselly think about stuff, that keeps me distracted.\n\nI really struggle to stay engaged when I’m running. I find if the run is more challenging I’m more likely to be focused. I use a garmin and if I set a pace guide, like specific split times I want to hit (usually negative splits) I have to pay attention to my pace and to stay on target the whole time. \n\nI only do this on “special occasions” though. Every other time I battle with boredom and try to run new trails to keep it interesting.\n\nDiagnosed at a young age and now in my 30s. I just run, let my thoughts wander as they like, and just have loose goals for the daily run. \n\nIf training for a specific distance, having a workout programmed into the watch helps for me a lot. \n\nI started with music; but now no music or anything when I run. \n\nThe constant movement feels good for me, managing my disorder isn’t an issue on a run. Think about the next step, next gel, and whatever else comes up.!\n\nI get SO BORED running alone but I love running with other people. Even if we run in silence it’s nice. Running manages the hyperactivity part of ADHD for me, but not so much the mental side. But hey, I’ll take what I can get. And if I run alone I will always have music on! It gets me through the miles faster\n\nI really never get bored on runs. I get physically tired and I'm sensitive to sensory stuff like itchy seams or sweaty upper lip (ugh) but one benefit of my mind being a nonstop runaway train is that I can daydream and live in lala land uninterrupted for hours. I'll have whole alternate realities playing out while I run. I have to work so hard to manage it in my \"real\" life but running is when I can relax. \n\nI run because it dials back my symptoms and I can focus a lot better and sleep better if I run. It also silences intrusive or recurrent thoughts, which is great.  For me, running works better for these mental benefits than other workouts like weight lifting or swimming etc.  \n\nI listen to a mix of things. Music I know I'll never skip, a lot of audio books and also podcasts on rotation. When I'm interested in what I'm listening to, the running sort of becomes automatic and I don't need to think about it. It's over quicker and then I can just enjoy the effects of having done the run.\n\nI listen to a book while i run outside. If i run on the treadmill i watch Netflix and play xbox 😂 that’s what it takes for me to stick with it but it works really well for me\n\nI run non stop lol have been since I was a kid! If I don’t run my adhd is so bad hahaha. I track on my Apple Watch and usually do 7-8 k, 6 days a week. I’m getting to skinny though so I’m going have to start weights\n\nRunning generally helps my adhd. I can surprisingly run for hours without being bored, I have enough with the stimulation of being outside. Music sometime helps, I take something fairly energetic and it carries me a bit further/faster.\n\nThe key is to either run at a comfortable pace and get in the zone, or run so hard you need to concentrate on your form.\n\nI run for a certain time, or a certain distance. I never cut workouts short. \n\nI listen to audio books. \n\nI also try to look at the scenery, and run different routes. However, sometimes I get so bored my the possible routes around my house that I almost gag at the thought, and that's when it's great to have a treadmill. I can mix it up by watching sewing videos on youtube while I run.\n\nRunning is like therapy / meditation for me. I deliberately don’t want it to be interesting. It’s the only time in my day when things aren’t overwhelming because it’s just me and the road. \n\nI run very early in the morning (4am due to work), it’s very quiet and I’m mostly alone with my thoughts, some music and usually the same route and distance each day. \n\nMy mind wanders. I’ll be full of aimless thoughts at the beginning, then I find myself totally blank towards the end when I’m just focusing on the road. \n\nDoes wonders for my focus the rest of the day and really helps me process my thoughts early on. Plus the endorphins are great for the depression!\n\nI have found that I CANNOT run on the treadmill because I get too bored. I can hardly make it 10 minutes without needing to do something else. It’s much better when I run outside, there’s things to look at, traffic to pay attention to, and I can change up my route every day. This does mean running especially sucks for me in the winter :(\n\nI have severe adhd with a side of severe ocd lol , running has saved my life, I am proud to say I am now I am an ultra runner, I also do very long distances on treadmills too , my condition seems to react extremely well with the meds and the long distances, adhd impacts every one differently but as my life has been extremely chaotic for decades.   The last few years I have been fortunate to get propper treatment I love the aspect it can be boring I embrace it and remind myself how different my life used to be , and running however boring will always win , keep it up though friend your doing great 😊\n\nHills are the only thing that have EVER silenced my mind.\n\nI love running.\n\nI definitely recommend Prodigy - 'The fat of the land' album and Viagra boys - all albums for running! If you love that kind of music :)\n\nADHD runner here\n\n1. Intervals that are so intense you can’t think.\n\n2. Don’t listen to shit while running. Instead practice meditation and focus during your run. \n\n3. Don’t run loops you know and run along a public transport route so you can run station to station and hop in the bus or tram when you are done. You’ll go farther.\n\n4. Get a coach to increase accountability.\n\nI'm quite new to running (but not to exercising itself). Since knowing about and managing my ADHD I have so much energy that I need that additional exercise, but I also got to the point in my fitness journey where I just want to be a better runner. I follow my Garmin watch's recommended trainings and just do whatever it tells me. I have to \"outsource\" planning things like this, otherwise I'm getting completely lost in minor details and overthink everything (that's also why I don't do my own strength training plan, for example).\n\nPodcasts or audiobooks don't work for me, I can't focus. I just listen to hardstyle (stimulates my brain a lot) and zone out.\n\nI prefer to be training with a plan and end goal. The plan provides structure and a target for each training.\nOn long runs my mind just wanders.I feel it dampens the day to symptoms and lifts my overall mood.\nFor interval training I just set it in my watch. This guides me through it.\n\nI have never cut a training short because of ADHD.\nI often listen to podcasts. Sometimes I stop them when I realize my mind is drifting and I’m not listening.\n\nI’m starting to run. I have a schedule to follow every week, I love the structure it gives to my life, also the feeling that if a do my run of the day I accomplished an important task for the day.\n\nI also mostly do 5k but I LOVE the feeling I get from even just pushing to 7k or 10k! To not get bored, I get off my usual path and start exploring new areas. \nHaving to remember which way to turn and seeing new surroundings might be a way to avoid getting bored if you struggle with that? It keeps your brain occupied having to think of where to go next. \n\nRunning outside is the best for me. For my 5k runs I alternate between 2-3 paths only but since I’m quite competitive, trying to beat my own time gets me motivated each time. \n\nElectronic music keeps me going, podcasts and slower music does not help me at all. \n\nJoining classes can also help! I got faster and pushed my limit more by having a trainer to hype me up and others to “outrun”. \nI haven’t managed to stick to one specific class for longer than 2 months though.\n\nFor me, I found that trying to listen to my body works best, while still having an easily achievable goal every week. \n\nMy current routine is not to run on fixed days but rather to make sure to do minimum one run outside and one gym session with intervals on treadmill (at least 1% incline) per week.\n\nYesterday I went for a run in a historic cemetery to kick the boredom. It worked but I kept stopping to look at gravestones 😂\n\nI run because I love it, and also to manage my symptoms. Looking back on a decade of work, my worst years were the years I didn't  run, and my best times are times when my running has been regular. I try to run my commute into work or at least walk from the train so that I start the day with good brain chemicals, and I use the social aspect of group runs to level out my workplace RSD. \n\nI know that if there is no structure my running tends to drop off, which makes life much harder. So I make sure I always have a few long races coming up - at least one full and a few half maras per year. They have to be long enough that I HAVE to train for them for at least a couple of months. That pressure keeps my running in check.\n\nI listen to audiobooks, podcasts, music. Back when I had an iPod I would listen to my old uni lectures to stay sharp - I really miss that depth of content so would love recommendations.\n\nI have ADHD. I used to hate running, but once I started actually using an effective plan (I use runna) I’ve come to enjoy it. I find once I’ve been in the routine for a few weeks running actually becomes meditative for me - I can completely zone out while listen to a podcast (I’ll hear it but not actually comprehend what they’re talking about kind of zone out lol). It’s quite relaxing mentally, because I’m expending energy in multiple ways at the same time and only one of them is mental (usually I’m expending energy doing multiple brain things at once like crocheting while watching tv or reading while watching tv (with subtitles even)\n\nrunning has helped me manage my adhd so much. i often feel like my brain is running a hundred miles a minute, and i have so much to say and think that important things get lost. running is the one place where i can think about everything and nothing all at once. while i don’t experience total quiet, its blissful. i have one train of though at any given time, and often times it is something negligible that i won’t remember once the run is over. \n\nas for boredom, i guess i have turned running into a momentary hyperfixation. so that may impact my views around it now. but having a larger goal—a race, a desired distance, a desired time—helps me stay focused and accountable. if i didn’t have a goal, i’d likely stop around 5k most times. however, i try to gamify running a bit. nudge my strava graph just a bit higher, finish all five days in my training plan, run this mile just a bit faster, etc. it works well with my brain.\n\nCant do audiobooks but podcasts and music seems to work well. I struggle with running the exact same route and planning helps me with both the motivation and endurance. For instance I let myself get excited about plotting new routes I'm about to run, adding them to my watch, or even doing a training plan and staying targeting different speeds etc while running. Gives me something to focus on.\n\nI feel it helps curb some of the negative aspects of my ADHD. It becomes a bit of a meditation and going through the process feels like I’ve dealt my negative thoughts a blow. That’s in  addition to all the other health benefits.\n\nAlways running to music with a variety of genres to mix up the cadence and keep my mind occupied. Also, the rout that I run has a mix of hills and turns with a lot of bikers so I have to keep my head up for motorized scooters and bikers coming downhill. I love running, and find I’m only ‘bored’ the first mile or so to get into a rhythm.\n\nRunner with ADHD here. I couldn’t have done it without tunes to get started to take my mind off of how uncomfortable I was. Once acclimated to running I had a huge shift in dealing with anxiety, was able to navigate through life stuff and hooked on the “runners high” I would get. I love the change of scenery even when I “mindlessly” hit the same route over and over.\n\nLate diagnosed ADHDer. All the bad times in my life were when I wasn't running. Since 12yo it's been a crucial part of my mental health. It makes me more confident and happy. And regardless how the day has gone, I've got my run in.\n\nI cannot get into running no matter how hard I try. For mostly those reasons. \n\nI’ve switched to rucking with weight instead. I don’t know why it hits me different, but it does.\n\nI've just gotten back into it the past few months. I feel like the running itself helps long term with mood and focus. I just listen to music, but yeah can get boring. I've not gone over 4mi yet - partially because still working up my distances, partially because i do get bored after about 30/40 mins (I'm also exhausted by then now LOL).\n\nI haven't been diagnosed, but I run without a phone and it definitely gets boring at times (I do about a 8 mile run, either before work aka 3 in the morning or after, at about 6-7 PM.) and I just look for stuff to distract me while I do run. Often end up finding a piece of rock from gravel and end up kicking that down the street until it either goes into a yard or I see a car coming in one direction or another and focus on getting out of the way for them.\n\nAdhd is what kids have before they grow up\n\nRunning helps my ADHD.  At this point I simply look forward to sweating and moving my body.  I have a loop route that is 4.3 miles and takes me about 30-35 minutes to run, and 95% of the time just do that route.  It offers a mix of city and country settings, so I never get bored.  As for listening, I either listen to podcasts or nothing.  I can't do music, because it doesn't mix with my ADHD brain while running.\n\n\nI do love running but I have noticed more and more that it’s hard to me to get motivated to run first thing in the morning where I use to be almost giddy to run when I woke up. Even if I don’t feel like running first thing in the morning usually by about 10am or so I will start to crave it. As for the distance I do like you said find myself getting “bored” during the run sometimes. My solution for this is that all my runs are “out and back” kinda.\n\nI start all my runs at home. If I’m going to run 10 miles I run 5 miles away from home then reverse that route. This way I “have” to keep running. Because I don’t wanna walk 5 miles home. Even if I don’t do that I avoid any mind of “laps” or repeating sections. I’ll plan a route that involves never repeating an area to ensure there’s always something new. Even if I repeat those routes I’m not doing so during the same run.\n\nTotally relate to this and I was never able to get into running because I'd get so bored. The number 1 thing for me that changed was the running location. I used to live in the suburbs and would only run in a loop around a neighborhood, but now I live in NYC and it is soooo much easier to not get bored when there are a ton of other runners/etc around you. \n\nAlso I haaaave to listen to audiobooks or podcasts. Can only do music for a race or a speed workout. Otherwise I'm listening to a song while running and my brain is just like \"oh my god, it's only been 3 minutes??\" every single song lol.\n\nI think it helps manage the symptoms and definitely helps with depression. It’s centering. On my long runs I listen to audiobooks to help me stay in it.\n\nI start running then my mind immediately is like “ok I’m done.” The best things I can do are run outside with different terrain, watch Hulu true crime shows while running, listen to audiobooks and other things to distract my mind.\n\nTrail running helps because you need to pay attention or else you’ll fall! Being invested in a good audiobook helps me on long distances but sometimes I switch it up with music or just take my headphones out and listen to my breathing!\n\nRunning is my ADHD medication.\n\nI listen to zombies, run! They have I think 10 seasons now, and I’m only on the third. They also have a marvel themed series and a bunch of standalone entries on science, sci-fi, horror, etc. Basically like a podcast? They have a story told in short bites. I start my music, start the episode, and the first clip plays. Goes back to my music until the next story clip. I can set each episode to last a certain amount of time (around 30 mins is I think the minimum?) or a certain distance.\n\nI don’t have to pay attention too closely (my downfall with podcasts,) and it does help with motivation.\n\nI really enjoy listening to audiobooks or Peloton coached runs. For me my brain almost needs to be distracted from what my body is doing.\n\nIt’s an escape for me - I put on an  audiobook and think in straight lines. It’s pretty cool.\n\nSigning up fa race\n\nRunning has been challenging and rewarding with my ADHD. \n\nI really struggle with monotony, coupled with the physical challenges, it was a real exercise in tolerating discomfort. This has translated to other facets of my life as well.\n\nDepending on my mood/attention, I’ll listen to music with no lyrics. Like, okay, stay with me here: I’ll listen to synth music like Lazerhawk or Com Truise and pretend I’m training for a space fight…the imagination helps me stay focused lol\n\nwhen i first ran for the first time in a very very long time, i remember feeling the exact same positive effects of being medicated multiplied by a hundred. i was so alert, focused, energetic and subsequently happy. when i became a regular runner that high faded - a shame it's not a sustainable replacement for\nmeds\n\nwhat pushed me to get a lot more distance in my runs was gamifying it aka competing with my friends in our own strava leaderboard. but this can get toxic if you don't listen to body's limits/are overly competitive.\n\nTrail running and audiobooks.  Once I discovered both of those, I could run for hours.  Now, I have to limit my running.  Buy an annual 24 book plan from audible, and then extra credits are only about $9 a piece, it's the best money I spend, and I spend a lot on audiobooks.\n\nHi! I'm a runner with ADHD \n\nSo for me, I run because whenever life gets stressful, I look for a physical outlet to let the stress out. I used to be into shooting sports (target, clay) and that got boring after a while so I found walking/running/hiking to be the best use of my energy lol\n\nWhen I run, I always have music on. If it's a slow run and I'm already kinda chill, I toss on some jazz ala badbadnotgood. If I'm feeling weird or in my feelings/sad/mad I pick a pop punk play list. If I'm running before my Vyvanse kicks in, I'm putting on poppy music so I can bop along and be silly \n\nI noticed that I have to give myself a milestone on each run. \"I'll stop for a second after I pass six trees\", \"once I reach that stop sign I can turn around\", or something like that. It keeps my mind focused on anything other than running and keeps me going. \n\nAlso, I run with a run group. I'm the slow one, so I just tell everyone to go on without me, I truly don't mind, but I know my treat at the end of however long we are running is gonna be coffee and chitchat with friends, so that kinda gameifies my run for me and keeps me going.\n\nRunning is the only thing that really helps me manage my ADHD. I can focus/ impulse control decently well when I exercise regularly and I use running as a time to meditate and calm my mind as well. I don't run with music anymore and just daydream, think about random scenarios, picture myself on race day, and wipe sweat from my brow bc I wear contacts and they hate sweat.\n\nSomehow running is the only time my brain can focus on something? Key is a good playlist, specifically EDM for me. Oh and also running outside not in a treadmill\n\nI run mainly trail runs, and ultramarathons (so far up to 50 miles). Generally i’m good with just letting my brain wander to whatever it wants, but when it can only focus on the negatives, then i turn on my music and sing out loud. \n\nrunning helps me fall asleep better, and i find i’m less distracted after a run\n\nedit: my runs are run on vibes. no mileage goals, no speed goals. if i’m feeling good, i’ll keep going.\n\nAudio books are the only way I can keep up with my running.  I do around 75mpw right now split between road and trail and have no trouble staying focused because I kind of tune out of the running and into the book.  I found early on that I can't run in silence and I get bored quickly listening to music.  I also can't run laps - I get bored and just stop.  I have that same problem with races, so when I'm choosing which ultras I want to run, I'll only choose single loop, out and back, or point to point.\n\nKeeps me grounded, sometimes I have music but honestly sometimes I go with nothing and the peace and quiet is super helpful for me to ‘reset’\n\nMusic , I change music often first half could be rock then i switch to country somtimes a podcast, i just enjoy running but it is boring in a sense.\n\nRunning is one of the only times my brain is calm and I don't have to think about, worry about, and manage anything or anyone else. I love running by myself, sometimes with music or a podcast, sometime nothing and just zoning out. I runs ultras, and love zoning out for a day by myself. \n\nI do find that I'm thinking about the route I'm doing and milage a lot during it if I'm on the roads. I love technical trails bc I love only having to focus on where to step. \n\nIf I run after I've taken my meds, I do stop less during my training runs. Without it I look for reasons to stop more often. I haven't noticed an increased HR during those runs. \n\nDuring races I've gotten lost many times/missed a turn and left my gels/nutrition on a table or chair at an aid station. If I take meds before a race, I notice a big difference in my positive thinking, motivation, and focus.\n\nUsed to run religiously before I was diagnosed with ADHD. It definitely helped with my mental health, it was like meditation. Unfortunately I started suffering from really bad IT band pain. The rehab work required to keep that under control is not as interesting or fun for me compared to running, so I am not as consistent with it. Which means I cannot run as much or consistently as I used to love. Which in turn again has been effecting my mental health. It is a struggle, but I some how try to keep fighting to get back to my baseline.\n\nI have found that if I run in the morning then I focus SO MUCH better at work afterwards. I’ve gotten my antsy monkey mind energy out temporarily and relax into tasks more. \n\nRecently I realized when I do something boring, I need a certain level of stimulation to keep going or my focus dies easily. Tasks at work or running can be boring sometimes. Usually trail runs, not running straight for a long time to switch things up, or heavy rock music keeps me sane when I run. I can’t do audiobooks during. Smoking a little bit before a run takes the mental chatter away sometimes and find flow. \n\nYes I set distance goals and usually reach it. I love running only when I try to have fun with it or with a challenge or to just get outside.\n\nPodcasts that match my time. Music is also a must. Typically predefined loops/distances more than defined times. Loops is key more than out and back for my miswired brain.\n\nI run to burn off some of my nervous/anxious brain energy. I also use my running time to try to think through whatever problems I need to solve. My focus is better while I’m running than when I’m sitting at work at my desk. \n\nI get a lot of satisfaction from getting out there and getting my run done for the day. Sometimes I get bored but I finish my planned run unless I’m injured or really not feeling great.\n\nI listen to music a lot but audiobooks and podcasts are good when you want to change things up!\n\nADHD + bipolar + OCD here. Running is SO helpful to my mental health, and a huge part of why I've been stable for the past 8 years without any med changes.\n\nI absolutely have to listen to music, it helps distract the part of my brain that wants to go \"this is boring, I quit.\" I struggle to listen to audiobooks or podcasts while I run, because keeping track of the plot while I run is too much!\n\nI also tend to distract myself by having my brain work on something while I run. Sometimes I do weird math, like \"how many ping pong balls would fit in the neighborhood swimming pool?\" or \"how long would it take me to walk to Idaho?\" Other times, I brainstorm ideas for new D&amp;D one-shot games. I just need to make sure I jot the ideas down when I'm finished with my run, otherwise they're gone forever!\n\nIn the past, I've used the Galloway method, and I find that breaking my run up into tiny intervals that way is a huge help. My brain might be \"I need to run for 30 minutes, that's dumb, I'm giving up,\" but when I do intervals, it's like \"OK I'm only running for 90 seconds, cool, I can do that\" and then I walk for 20 - 30 seconds and trick myself into repeating it all the way through a half marathon.\n\nRunning and walking are the only exercises I can actually commit to and enjoy doing. For one thing, it’s so simple to just walk out the door and go vs paying for a gym I won’t go to or buying a bunch of equipment that further clutters my home. But I also just love the solo nature of it. Sometimes I listen to a podcast, sometimes music, or sometimes I just let my brain wander and do its ADHD thing. And finally, I was always terrible at any other sports that require coordination, complicated rules, and paying attention. 😆 With running, I only have to pay attention to my own two feet.\n\nIf I’m doing distance I need edibles to help keep me from getting distracted or bored\n\nWait, it’s not normal to be bored when running?\n\nI always liked running with a partner with similar pace. I hate running alone\n\nI have adhd, and running is a good way to tamper the anxiety that sometimes overwhelms me\n\nbiking seems to be better for me  \nless stress on the knees and the runners high I get is just as good\n\nI find podcasts that I’m hyper interested in and then I can run forever!\n\nRunning is the best ADHD medication I’ve used. Sitting at the computer all day at work leaves me overstimulated, and I think growing up with crosscountry/track in the afternoons made me rely on the afternoon run to stay grounded.\n\n\nMy first marathon was the first time I followed a training plan, and checking off each day while noticing my progress brought out a structured side of me that I didn’t know existed. I’ve carried that forward in my workday and other hobbies too.\n\n\nI’m on and off with music. I find music-less long runs to be meditative, but if I need to drop the hammer I’ll throw on some LCD Soundsystem. Audiobooks and podcasts slow me down.\n\n\nI get very obsessive about my goals when I’m pursuing them, so if I get consistently bored on runs, that usually means that I need to change something up (environment, workouts, training goal, etc). ADHDers are novelty seekers, so I’ve made peace with the fact that I need to shake up my training from pure marathon prep on a long, flat sidewalk sometimes. \n\nADHD here as well.\n\nPersonally I run 3 days a week. I make sure to keep to the 3 days. Some days I might go out 2-3 times a day depending if my planned session for the day didn't quite sort me out. I also make sure that these 3 days work around family/work. These were some hard fast rules that my wife and I agreed on as we all know what it can be like to start obsessing over something. I find 3 a week also helps prevent burnout and each day is geared towards a specific aim. 1 day long run, 1 day tempo 1 day speed. Hills I incorporate into any one day I feel like it again to keep things interesting.\n\nIf I listen to something it's usually an audio book. I find I end up in the same playlists and a rut with music. I don't really engage well with podcasts. \n\nJust trial and error what works best for you and don't be afraid to ask those who know you best what might help/work.\n\nSorry if the text is a bit disjointed. I tried. But enjoy the experience and try not focus on things to much, tell yourself it's OK if you don't hit exactly what you wanted just run with it and enjoy. Take pride in you are working towards self betterment.\n\nRunning has been huge for me in managing my ADHD, and overall mental health. I’m much more focused on run days and my overall productivity skyrockets. The only time I struggle with getting bored is treadmill runs, those are a real mental game. I prefer to run outside and I switch up my routes regularly to keep things interesting.\n\nI started running to lose weight, but I quickly realized it helps with ADHD symptoms as well.\n\nRunning on a nice trail in a pretty area is great. You can just zone out and vibe, use that time to let your thoughts race with no expectations or consequences. I think of it almost like meditation in a way.\n\nI'm not in great running shape yet so I can't say I've ever stopped running out of boredom alone. I could imagine it happening eventually, though.\n\nI have to run without music or earbuds. Somehow it makes it easier to run for me. Call me crazy.\n\nThe biggest effect of running on my ADHD symptoms is post-run when I'm all exhausted, and my mind feels quieter for about an hour before the ADHD goblins get back to work in my brain.\n\nRunning and lifting weights has helped me a lot with managing my symptoms of ADHD. I can't say I've ever experienced getting bored on runs though, usually, I find exercise stimulating enough in an unstimulating way if that makes any sense. If anything I feel like my ADHD helps me train harder because I'm able to zone out the pain and fatigue on long runs.\n\nAlso, my advice would be to try to embrace the boredom. You'll be able to build a tolerance to it after a while and find yourself with better focus in other areas of your life. Sometimes I go on 5-mile jogs with no music or anything just so I can try to work on my focus. Meditation also helps a lot with this.\n\nI never get bored running on trails or a road with lots of nature or trees or open space. Also, I found that listening to music can feel incessant or even overstimulating. So, if I'm going on a long run, I'll do the first 50% with silence or a podcast/audiobook. Then, pick it up with music in the last half.\n\nI have to say running was just disgusting and discouraging before I got diagnosed. I always thought I was just not motivated enough or focused enough. The best thing I’ve ever done is seek treatment. I’m on medication for my ADHD and it’s life changing. My workouts have never been strong and more focused. I look better, feel better, advance at my goals more consistently- and the adhd meds really have helped with that. \n\nI also enjoy listening to podcasts while I do my long runs instead of music. I find the time flies way more. \n\nSometimes I’ll put a music playlist together that is like a story or throwbacks from high school and I’ll run my intervals with that (chorus pickups or sprints). Sometimes I’ll do movie soundtracks. \n\nKeeping it interesting helps a lot- but the medication helped the most.\n\nrunning is a spiritual experience for me because of my adhd i feel. when i run my head feels quiet and i can visualize the world i want its actually really wild\n\nMusic, trail run, garmin watch to monitor your heart rate for zone 2 training, train zone 2, you have a lot of distractions you don’t even realize the suck. Also trails make you pay attention to where you’re at, but if you get lost your garmin can get you back\n\nFor making ADHD symptoms, do people find it more beneficial to run first thing in the morning? Before or after meds? \n\nI have a lifetime of failed morning workout routines behind me but sometimes after work my legs feel like lead and it can be a struggle"

    "all_comment_text": "I hope they have that rotating \"Sorry\" banner with the picture of happy people like they did last year in the rejection email \n\nGood times\n\nAs long as it’s not that Nick guy from NYC. Fuck him.\n\nBecause of everyone complaining about his picture and becoming a meme, NYRR gave him a free entry into the 2024 NYC Marathon. He's completed it several times but didn't get in this year.\n\nHe fucked himself.\n\nTenth year’s a charm.\n\nSame\n\n8 for me. Wishing you the best of luck!\n\n£10 a week put away in a jar and if you haven’t got a ballot place in 3 years you can use the money and get a charity place.\n\nMost charities are asking for £2000-2500 now\n\nYes but if you book a place early there’s plenty asking for a £1200 commitment and often there’s  places available for £500 from smaller charities near closing date.\n\nWhich ones are asking for 500 or 1200?\n\nThey won’t be offering 500 now but a lot of small local charities will have places. I was offered one for 500 last year but didn’t want to run London again\n\nI work for a charity that has places. I can't discuss exact figures but it's actually scary how little money is made per runner for us.\n\nSo whilst people understandably get annoyed at having to raise such funds, I also hope they understand that we don't have much choice but to ask for the amounts we do.\n\nYeah of course, I’m actually running today for a charity and have tried my best to go further than the target amount. They’re all amazing charities\n\nI'll see you on the start line in a few hours (ironically, the first time I enter the ballot whilst working for a charity that has places is the first time I get a ballot place!)\n\nHaha that’s always the way, good luck out there\n\nI’ve looked at charity places for the last couple of years and it’s a big jump for the London Marathon - most charities will ask for £250-£400 for any races, but for London it jumps to £2000 (cheapest I’ve seen is £1750, but the vast majority are £2000) which has scared me off - I think I could raise over £500 but it’s a long way up to £2k. \n\nI’ve unsuccessfully entered the ballot two years in a row and have entered it again for 2025, but if I don’t get a ballot place I think this might be the year I try for a charity place. I’ve got two I’d like to ask because it’ll be 15 years since I lost a friend who I’d be running for and I’m already trying to think of ways I can hit the target.\n\nPost the justgiving link on here, I'm sure a few of us would chuck a few quid in\n\nAm I right in guessing you have to pay the Marathon organisers for those places, hence this is the case\n\nPrecisely that.\n\nHow did the marathon go?!\n\nIf somebody says they can commit to the requested amount, then either due to their promised sponsors not actually sponsoring them, or they just wildly misjudged who would sponsor them, are they responsible for paying it themselves?\n\nIt varies by charity. Some insist on it, some don't.\n\nBut most fundraisers host a series of events, such as bake sales, other challenge events and brick-a-brack sales to raise the funds and, so long as they've given themselves plenty of time to do so.\n\nInteresting. Thanks for answering. I would never personally attempt a charity place for London because I just don’t know if I could do it, even with those fundraising events etc. I wouldn’t want to be adding potentially over 1500 out of my own pocket. I’d go for brighton or something instead , much safer bet\n\nCan’t wait to get rejected again\n\nGood luck all, entered 10 times and not been successful. \nI’ve got a charity place this year\n\nKeep trying it’s a phenomenal experience\n\nI got a ballot place on my first try 🤷‍♂️ sometimes you get lucky\n\nCurrently sat in my Airbnb drinking a coffee before heading to the start line\n\nGood luck\n\nFinished in 3:56 and raised £640 for my local neo-natal intensive care unit! Thank you!\n\nExcellent. You must be knackered but delighted to have got under 4 hours\n\nI would have been quicker if I didn’t have to queue for a piss at mile 14!\n\nSo jealous. Go well 🙌🏽\n\nFinished in 3:56 and raised £640 for my local neo-natal intensive care unit! Thank you!\n\nThis is incredible! an amazing time and cause well done!!\n\nIf you all could not enter, that would be great :)\n\nI still haven’t heard a good argument against blocking people from entering the lottery if they were successful the previous year (excluding gfa and charities). It will help balance out, at least slightly, the people that do it 3 years in a row and those who are unlucky 10 times in a row.\n\nI think they could possibly use a system where the number of previous entries increases your chances for the next year. So, in the first year you get one entry, second year 2, etc etc.\n\nProblem is the numbers are so massive now that even that I'm not sure that would make any noticeable difference. For example, 578,374 entered last year. So that's, roughly, 550,000 people with +2 next year. And then the same again the year after. And so forth.\n\nYeah that's fair enough. The no two years in a row thing could work. Would be way better than having just one ballot entry per lifetime as that seems massively unfair.\n\nYour odds will still be better than if the system didn't exist. It wouldn't solve the problem, but it would make it better. 1:550,000 is a heck of a lot worse than 5:1,500,000 (1:300,000ish) for someone who has missed it 4 years in a row, or however it works out once all the repeat entries are accounted for. I also think the proportion of those 550,000 that enter more than 3 times in a row is probably vanishingly small.\n\n\nI just skimmed it, but it looks like there is no requirement for having ran a previous marathon for the lottery entry. If they wanted to trim down the numbers, they could require lottery entrants to run a marathon in the previous year like other qualifiers, but just have no time attachment to it. That way it's still open to everyone who can complete a marathon, so it's not exclusive in the way Boston can be, but still weeds out less dedicated runners. I don't know if they want to gatekeep their event like that, but when you have 550,000 entrants, you almost have to start doing something.\n\nI think that you should only get one ballot place per lifetime, given how slim the chances are.\n\nHow do you do that practically? They can always enter using a different email address or whatever.\n\nName and date of birth. ID gets checked at pick up as it is.\n\nPeople would literally change their legal names 😂\n\nIt wouldn’t really change the odds that much.\n\nWere any international (US) applicants not prompted to put in credit card info? Only second time applying, and thought they required it last time so you’re automatically charged if your name is drawn. But could be mixing it up with other lotteries I always lose 🤷‍♂️.\n\nI'm a UK applicant and wasnt prompted for any card details at the application stage today. Guess they'll ask for payment details if you're selected, unlike say NYC where they take them in advance!\n\nStrange, it took the payment straight away and it’s currently pending at the moment. I guess if I’m selected the payment will actually come out.\n\nI wasn't asked.. I am in Canada.\n\nI'm also in Canada. Entered the lottery and hoping that first time is a charm :) \n\nI got into Chicago on my first try.\n\nThey only send the payment request if you are selected then you give the card info\n\nYes, US applicant and I wasn't asked for payment info.\n\nBecause they just send the rejection email to all international applicants, except Bob. Bob gets in, but he is unfortunately injured.\n\nI've applied in the hopes that, against all odds, my 4.5 minute BQ gets accepted and I win the lottery, so I'm forced to do 2 marathons in back to back weeks with a little international travel mixed in for good measure.\n\nI applied knowing there are better odds I get into London than Boston with my 3 minute buffer\n\nCould be worse, I missed by 3 seconds so there could be no cut and I'd miss out. I'm looking for another qualifier before Sept 15, but am not convinced the race I found for June 1 is actually happening.\n\nNot sure where you’re located, but the Eerie Marathon on September 7 is supposed to be a good BQ course. I may run it if I feel like I’m in sub 2:50 shape, but I’ll probably just focus on trying to qualify for 2026\n\nThanks, Erie is on my list and not terrible to get to from NJ. But I ran Philly, all things being equal I'd like to run in new states.\n\nFYI, you can defer London Marathon\n\nOnly once ( unless you're a woman and get preggers)\n\nAnd have to marathon train through two winters? No thank you!\n\nAnybody know what the rough odds are?\n\nAbout 3%. There were well over half a million ballot entries this year.\n\nHigher than I expected tbh\n\nThrew my name into the ring, like an idiot. Figured \"no way in hell will I actually get picked for this, whatever, low stakes.\"\n\nKnowing my running-related luck over the past 4 years, I probably *will* get in, fuck.\n\nAnyone know when lottery results are announced?\n\nThe web page says \"by the end of June\", but my rejection last year came on July 6.\n\nCan’t help feeling that this race has entries that are balanced much too far in the direction of people in giraffe costumes and the like. I ran Berlin a few years ago and there are of course the wacky costumes but a much more reasonable proportion to my mind. I applied for London a few times in the past, unsuccessfully, and can’t be arsed trying any more. Missed the GFA qualification by a whisker a few years ago but chances of one of those are now disappearing over the horizon too :o)\n\nLondon Marathon is one of (if not the) biggest fundraisers in the UK. It raised like £66million last year alone. As much as we all love running, that's worth more than anything else and the spirit of the London marathon.\n\nYeah I know, but ultimately it’s 75% a bit of a circus rather than a serious race event.\n\nIt'll always be a serious event for the elites and sub elites though. It can attract the best runners from across the world being a Major. It makes no sense to change the ratio for those below. Every 1000 spots they take away from charity is like £2mil of fundraising lost.\n\nThat's just a cultural difference. Germans are serious and Brits are \"i was drunk when I made a bet to wear this haha look at me. Did I mention that I drink a lot?\".\n\nI’ll be honest, I get a bit pissed off having been a runner for many years, paying memberships for athletics and triathlon clubs, running umpteen events from 5k up to ultramarathon at significant cost, effectively supporting the sport, then some Johnny come lately in a rhino suit pops up for his first race in London. I can’t really justify a charity place….running a marathon isn’t a significant challenge when you’ve done a dozen or more of them, so I can’t ask my relatives and friends to subsidise my run. Similarly I’m not paying £2000 myself to run 26 miles around London.\n\nYour relatives and friends wouldn't be subsidizing your run. They would be donating to charity and the reward you get for organizing those donations is the opportunity to run. It's a semantic difference, but it's also a philosophical one.\n\n\nThe charity aspect is why almost all marathons exist anyways, so it is a major part of supporting the sport. It also gives many runners pride to be a part of a sport that focuses so hard on improving the community around it.\n\nIn that case, for all your clubs and events, Johnny Come lately could be considered a better participant than you, because not only can he get people to \"subsidize his run\" (ie donate money towards great work), or pay that donation himself, but he is dedicated and kind spirited enough to do so, AND he can run. And in a hot, heavy rhino suit, too (In fact, the rhino guys are usually experienced, talented runners).\n\nThey should charge the entire fee regardless of whether you are successful or not. It would clear out a lot of the chancers who apply.\n\nPretty sure that’s illegal\n\nNot to say they should do it, but given the existence of, ya know, lotteries, I'm sure they could figure it out if they wanted to.\n\nPaying a $10 fee for a lottery $ jackpot chance is different from forcing people to pay the full ballot fee for a chance to be in the ballot\n\nHow specifically, legally?\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf they charge they need a gambling licence and it becomes a whole different thing to how they currently operate\n\nWhy is it? You have the option to donate your entire fee anyway (I always do) - they can just make it a mandatory donation to enter the ballot. No one is forcing people to pay it.\n\nThat’s not an option outside of the UK To do the donation\n\nThey shouldn’t allow people outside of the UK to enter the ballot anyway. That kills two birds with one stone.\n\nHave you considered that we would all just reciprocate?\n\nNot bothered. Nothing comes close to London.\n\nWell, I met some UK runners in my Boston hotel last week who seem to disagree. You may be salty but others are well on the way to getting their six stars. Good luck in the lottery, or work on earning a GFA place, which is unavailable to non-UK residents so at least we are locked out of that route (short of championship times).\n\nLondoner here, who has run NYC and Chicago marathons, thanks to them having international ballot places. They both very much \"come close to London\". In fact, I'd say the NYC marathon easily matches London in terms of scale, atmosphere and crowd support.\n\nJust FYI.  If you commit to a charity before the lottery, you don't have to raise as much.\n\nThanks OP !\n\nDecided if I am not successful again I’ll do Brighton or Manchester. Need another one in my life.\n\nBrighton is a great run, I've done it the last three years the course improved each year\n\nIs it as windy as some say?\n\nI've ran it the last three years and it's was nice and warm each time, little bit of wind and spray from the sea but nothing performance restricting, I may have been lucky tho\n\nThat's what we did this year. A group of 5 of us all got rejected for London so just ran Manchester instead. Not on the same level but still a great marathon with a good atmosphere. No ballot and I don't think you're likely to miss out by the time ballot results for London are announced.\n\nYeah I ran Manchester a few years ago, would like to try and get closer to my PB again after a few injury riddled years!\n\nFeels about as likely to happen as a powerball lottery.  At least it costs nothing to enter.\n\n3 straight rejections, this will be my 4th time applying. I'm a born and bred Londoner but live in the EU. I know it doesn't work this way but I got into NYC last year (first attempt) and I can't seem to get any luck to run my home city.\n\n\nCurious about something, if I register as a UK applicant and use a family address, could this work? I have a UK passport.\n\nNYC organizers definitely favor out of towners so they can bring money into the city (hotels, restaurants, public transportation, etc.) during race week. The same thing happens for the NYC Half Marathon. I live in NY (about 40 minutes from the city itself) and wound up getting into NYC Marathon through the New York Road Runners 9+1 program.\n\nI don't know but I'm in the same boat as you (except I think it's 6 rejections now). If I put down my parent's address &amp; do the donate to double your chances, they can't possibly be asking for proof of address from every single successful UK resident. That would be unmanageable. I think I've talked myself into it...\n\nAnother Brit abroad here - I was wondering the same thing! Did you sign up as a UK resident in the end?\n\nYep I did. Paid in advance to double my chances (the donate your entry fee option). Now it's a waiting game!\n\nI've done the same. Good luck to you!!\n\nAnd you!\n\nI see you went for it. Good luck! I had already applied from a EU address again. Was too worried about missing out entirely if they picked up on me using a different email address through matching my name / DoB. Is that a possibility do you think?\n\n🤞\n\nThanks, open for a week I assume?  I missed last year as I’m busy this time of year and forgot\n\nHere goes nothing\n\nFirst time entering! Good luck everyone :)\n\nLast year was just one big L for me. Denied for  London, Chicago, New York, and WDW Marathon. Here's to starting the circus all over again\n\nI was fortunate to be selected in 2023 (first time applying as well), i got the email about the ballot being open now and i just reminded of how much fun and how special it was to run it. I’m trying again now. Good luck to you all.\n\nlol im getting downvoted by some salty sad people, i hope u guys get in next year, cheers.\n\nReady to be rejected for the 8th year in a row!!\n\nDoes anyone know when the Tokyo lottery will open?\n\nLate summer (so after results for London). Last year it was open Aug 14-25, probably something similar this year. The donation application period for Tokyo will open at the end of June.\n\nThank you!\n\nCool now I can miss out on Glastonbury and London Marathon in the same day! Do you guys go for the extra ballot and donate the entry fee? I think I’ve got four training tops for an event I’ve never run. Kind of wish there was an option to say don’t send the top\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe email says don't enter the ballot more than once as it cancels your applications. Did she use the exact same email and everything? You might be screwed... though I'm sure you can get in touch and explain :/\n\nShhhh\n\nIs it still based on a quota system?\n\nDo they allow you to enter as a team? Having a hard time figuring it out on the site\n\nWhat day is the lottery results released?\n\nLast year the ballot results were emailed out on 6th July\n\nI got in on first lottery entry ever. Race this year was incredible. Go for it even if odds are not great!\n\nI ran it this year after getting through in the 2023 ballot on my first try. It was amazing. Odds are about 3% but you never know — it costs nothing to enter.\n\nDid I read correctly that you can have the option to spend some $$ to upgrade your Brighton marathon entry to a London Marathon entry if you do not get selected in the draw?\n\nOther way around, you can pay for a Brighton spot if you aren't successful in the London draw\n\nThanks!\n\nIs the ‘donate ~£50 to be entered in a second ballot’ worth it?\n\nDoes anyone know if they will reject me if I use a non-UK phone number with my UK address or any experience if they text/call (thinking of using my mum's)?  \nLike some others I currently live outside of the UK but have a UK residence.\n\nAh the time of year we all love…….. time to get our rejection jacket for winter running…….\n\nThe London Marathon ballot is like my teenage love life ….. nothing but rejection …….\n\nDoes anyone know why they make us wait so long for the drawing 😅 do they really need 3 months? Just tell me now haha\n\nGreat. I am up for my 18th rejection in a row. The ballot is a joke\n\nwow this is really de motivating\n\nKarma farming. Last year he posted 14th rejection.  \n  \nThe best way to run is enter the lottery for a few years while saving $500/yr. If you aren't selected, go the charity route or tour operator. This is how I ran Tokyo and will likely run Berlin next year going this route.\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nWhen do tour groups open for London '25?\n\nI have a ballot spot for next year's race. \n\nHad to defer today's because of an ATFL tear, but hoping I can recover enough to run next year.\n\nWhy this : \n\nWhite\nMixed or multiple ethnic groups\n\n[removed]\n\nLmao gatekeeping a race by saying paying to enter and potentially getting nothing is fine and a real insight into who you are by calling certain people \"riff Raff\".\n\nFuck outta here, whether you run one mile or 26 you're a runner, you should get something if you pay for it and get in.\n\nCome on. How many people do you think enter who have barely run a mile in their life, or who have no intention of properly training for the marathon even if they are successful? This is what I mean by ‘riff raff’, and by eliminating these people you can slice the total entries by at least 50% I bet.\n\nFour of my friends enter every year who hate running. They’ve never even done a parkrun let alone a marathon.\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]"

    "all_comment_text": "Here I was thinking I just got a chronic cough every winter. This makes total sense. Thank you for sharing.\n\nI had this but it actually ended up being exercise induced asthma. The\n\nI echo this - I struggle with the cold runs or running indoors in stuffy, dusty gyms because of exercise induced asthma\n\nI actually was diagnosed with this as a child but supposedly had outgrown it. Perhaps that could be a part of it.\n\nMy Dr had me try an inhaler. Said to report back. Sure enough I realized I didn’t cough at all when I used it.\n\nWe call it \"cross cough\" (as in cyclocross) in cycling. A hot drink post race and a hot/steamy shower at home helps.\n\nI race a lot of cross and always keep some cough drops around. The menthol is immediately relieving after a hard race and can keep even worse symptoms under control.\n\nThe layer protecting you from viruses weakens in the cold dry air. \n\nSo what you do kind of restores it.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the cough more in their throat than in the lungs? I feel like all the mucus and gunk practically closes my throat off. It's so unpleasant!\n\nI have been using chewing gum to stop my throat from drying out while running.\n\nAlong the same line, someone told me to keep a menthol cough drop in my mouth. I am going to give it a shot when the winter hits.\n\nPeppermint or spearmint candies work well too. \n\n\nMy throat used to get so dry when I started running so I would take peppermint candies with me. Now as long as I have one at the start it seems to help for my whole run. \n\nyes! i tend to do pre-emptive hacks to prevent it from building up.\n\nSo much mucus for me, I have year-round hayfever so outside running does this. When the pollen’s bad I’ve taken to doing an Azep nasal spray (Azelastine) before the run to stop the mucus building up in the first place, helps tremendously\n\nIm pretty sure azelastine does what Benadryl does including making you really tired. (It knocks me out- I can only use it at night). I’m surprised you can run after that.\n\nI didn’t see any side effects on the box saying it’s possibly drowsy, and I’ve never become drowsy because of it!\n\nA quick Google search says it can cause drowsiness, but it’s a decently rare side effect\n\nmaybe i'm just weird! i told my doc and she said that was normal. (maybe she just meant it's a known side effect - not how common it is.)\n\nThis cough is not always asthma, but this is how I found out I have asthma lmao\n\nExactly the same as me. Exercise enduced usually in the colder weather after cycling and running.\n\nI grew up swimming and playing water polo (as a goalkeeper) and I just thought I was a terrible swimmer - turns out I had a medical condition lmao\n\nAfter getting medicated my swim times reduced by a crazy amount - not elite or anything, but much better than when I was younger.\n\nLol, same. I was talking to someone and was like, \"You know when you run a really good run and then start coughing and wheezing afterward?\" and it turns out that wheezing is, in fact, not good.\n\nRelated: if I wear a face covering, it gets so wet and sweaty. I end up with super chapped lips and skin around my mouth. Does anyone have a rec for a good face covering or any way to prevent this?\n\nLast winter I had a big issue where often if I ran in the cold (and I run all winter in a climate with snow), I would sneeze the rest of the day or my nose would run like a faucet after I stopped running.\n\n\nI found that covering my face with a buff for as long as I could tolerate it was enough to alleviate this. If I got really warm, I would pull it down. Just having it on for most of the run especially the beginning was enough.\n\n\nI also I only wear merino wool buffs. Breathable.\n\nSecond using the wool, it doesn’t feel super wet against your skin and wicks really well. I really only have issues with synthetics feeling soggy.\n\nThanks for the tip. I also suffer from sneeze attacks following cold runs (but it only seems to happen the first few runs in cold weather each Fall).\n\nYou turn it 180 degrees. When both sides get cold and wet, you pull a second one out of your pocket and put it on.\n\n*I'll be damned... it looked like he'd fully soaked his buff on all sides, then he reached in his pocket and, sure as shit, he had ANOTHER one! Damnedest thing I ever saw...*\n\nMaybe a thick layer of Vaseline/aquaphor or even lanolin as a barrier on the skin, in combo with wool? Then snot slides down the petroleum jelly and protects your skin? By the time it's all rubbed off you'll hopefully be home and most chapping hopefully mitigated?\n\n\nWool would be much nicer on your skin, warm even when wet, wicking, etc. Plus it naturally contains lanolin, which is softening and soothing. \n\nYMMV, but I like underarmour’s more recent active masks for runs in the cold (just not the thicker ones they had the first year or two of Covid). They do end up somewhat wet but still help a ton for me. Last season I found them clearanced for $2 at their outlets.\n\nAt a certain point though, I prefer a balaclava to give better skin cover and can have one of those masks used over it\n\nThis is so far the best i have used. You can adjust it at the back and it isn't tightly against your mouth just howering.\nhttps://www.underarmour.pl/en-pl/p/equipment/mens_ua_storm_fleece_gaiter/1373120.html\n\n&gt; I end up with super chapped lips and skin around my mouth. Does anyone have a rec for a good face covering or any way to prevent this?\n\n[Here is the one that I use for my Sunday morning long-runs](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/RkoAAOSwJslbH~EO/s-l1200.jpg)\n\nLube em up. Some basic bees wax or similar chap stick is the best\n\nYou can try getting one of those NIOSH-Approved covid mask. Unlike surgical masks that rub against your face, these masks are quite hard, so your lips do not touch anything.\n\nHear me out: surgical masks.\n\nI am a doctor - this type of cough is very common and usually of little medical significance (doesn't get a doctor's attention because its more an annoyance then a problem). I don't normally dispense medical advice but this sounds for all intents and purposes like cough variant asthma or exercise induced asthma.  Cold, dry air are the most common triggers.  People balk at calling it asthma because it doesn't present with the classic wheeze and shortness of breath.  The suggested remedies of nose breating and wearing a face covering are commonly suggested home remedies, and from personal experience, are very effective.  Adequate hydration can thin your mucus and airway secretions as well.\n\n  \nWould really encourage anyone identifying with the symptoms in this thread to read a little bit about cough variant asthma and consider consulting with your personal physician, as you might stand to benefit from a pre-exercise puff of albuterol for prevention.\n\nCan confirm. Albuterol has massively helped my exercise induced asthma, which felt like a hacking cough and chest tightness, especially in cold, dry weather\n\nThe first really cold run/ride/whatever is BRUTAL on my throat, every year. Then it gets used to it, and I am fine till next year.\n\nIs this related to after a hard effort, if I laugh I end up in a coughing fit? Or is that moreso a tired diaphragm\n\nI would also like to know this! I have a chronic cough that started coincidentally when my half marathon training started early August. Lots of treatment attempts in coord with my doc have mostly taken edge off, but if I a.) have to talk a lot in meetings or b.) laugh, it kicks the cough into gear. Frankly very sick of this!\n\nOof.. I ordered steroid inhalers for this. My GP said I don't have asthma, so can't do prescription. I was told to mind my breathing, which seems to naturally shift to nose breathing after a few miles. Warm up sucks if I up the pace, so sometimes I just go home and call it a day.\n\nFYI Albuterol is a bronchodilator but not a steroid.\n\nThanks! Feels great to know, as I do have my apprehensions with steroidal anti-inflams.\n\nHi, which inhaler you bought?\n\nAlbuterol Sulfate. Got it from ZipHealth. It does help, but I always try going without it (because mainly I'm not a doctor - self-prescribing can be stupid).\n\nThis is asthma then\n\nAlways thought this was exercise induced pulmonary edema: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4969033/#:~:text=Extreme%20high%2Dintensity%20exercise%20can,exercise%2C%20and%20impaired%20diastolic%20relaxation.\n\nYes, if you taste blood/ metallic mouth feel\n\n\nOtherwise it's just your lungs complaining because of the dryness \n\nIt’s not that cold yet. But yeah, being outside and exercising in the cold brings snot rocket season. Just the way it is. Are you blowing your nose frequently enough during your workouts ?\n\nDamn...i am having same issue. Thanks for sharing.\n\nI start my runs at 5 am, so its more cold\n\nAka \"track throat\"\n\nI get this and also just learned about \"Habit Cough\". I bet the cardio cough can lead into Habit Cough, which is basically you cough, which irritates your throat, so you cough, which irritates your throat and keeps you coughing... the recommendation for Habit Cough is to try not to cough and sip water instead so the irritation in your throat can heal\n\nI notice this a lot as the temperature drops going into winter months in Canada! Im totally fine the rest of the year, but I almost get a cold induced asthma in the winter?? Is that a thing??\n\nCold/dry air can trigger asthma symptoms! Technically you \"have\" asthma year round but nothing triggers it in the summer.\n\nso it's not the fat joint i smoked beforehand?\n\nThis is a follow-up from my post yesterday.\n\nI ran today, trying to only inhale through my nose, and added a surgical mask, as suggested.\n\nFirst, the bad news: I had to slow down to breathe well, and forgot to only breathe through my nose a few times in HIITs.\n\nNow for the great news: For the first time in weeks, have not been hacking, coughing and choking all day. I will be able to keep running.\n\nI am so stoked and wanted to thank all of you for your posts.\n\nSuccess!\n\nSometimes I sneeze a lot after an outdoor workout when it is cold and dry. But it gets over in about 15 minutes if I get back indoors and find warmth. I would suggest you find out what naturally alleviates the situation for you.\n\nI feel like this is me all year in Colorado.  I cough after most of my runs but it never impacts me while running and it tapers down after a few hours. I looked it up too and basically got the same results and advice. So I take it as the tax for running in a dry environment.\n\nfirst meet of indoor track was always brutal\n\nyou just get through it though\n\nyep, that tacky clear phlegm. I always took it as a good sign, that I was pushing myself to a good level (cause I do have asthma and never felt out of breath or wheezy. more like... sweat for your lungs? lol)\n\nWhenever I've run into throat irritation that makes me want to cough, I focus on breathing out. I blow out hard and only focus on that. For whatever reason, it helps it stop.\n\nI figured it was just my constant weed use.\n\nI have been struggling with this since I started running. (I just graduated C25K, so I am no expert.)\n\nI marked it off a pollen allergy. It was improved after we had a hard freeze, but is still a significant problem. I could not run in October because I would choke. So much so, that I could not even walk briskly.\n\nThe problem for me is that my phlegm would become thick and both cohesive and adhesive to my throat, and irritate it. This is key, in my solution.\n\nI found that hydrating before my runs, help. I started drinking soup for breakfast, (Asian style). I cut down on coffee. I also bought a plastic squeeze/flush bottle with saline packets to irrigate my sinuses and throat before and after runs. Multiple flushes do better. (NeilMED Sinus rinse). When I do this often, it cleans the throat of the irritants. Without the chronic irritation, my throat can better handle the exercise heavy breathing-irritation.\n\nI also resorted to Vicks VapoCOOL severe menthol and oral anesthetic cough drops for the residual coughs through the day. Before a run, I pop one in my mouth, and it lasts for 5K, If I run 10K, I sometimes suck on a second one. This is a desperation solution, but it is working. It is the only way that I can speak for a full sentence in the evening without going into coughing spasms.\n\nMy solutions aren't great, and I am bouncing around, looking for better solutions.\n\nIs this solely a mouth breathing problem?\n\nI eat cough drops when I run. It helps.\n\nSo many different names! My dad calls it the \"half-miler's hack\"\n\nI feel your pain OP.\n\nStarted to experience this a few years back. Mainly happened when I would turn into the wind and the coughing/phlegm would knock me flat. Tried a few things and eventually was told by my GP it was asthma and I then spent over three years pointlessly taking inhalers, which we’re having no effect, before I got a second opinion from a consultant who casually said “you don’t have asthma”.\n\nFWIW after a few tests he said my epiglottis, dangly thing at the back of the throat, got very agitated running, particularly if it was cold and windy, and this was causing the coughing and breathing issues.\n\nIn order to mitigate it I almost always wear a running buff to cover my mouth and this more or less fixed it. \nDownside is I also have to use it during the summer which makes you look like a bigger dork than you do during the winter. \n\nBut it’s better than not running at all. \n\nAs a freediver I have great lung capacity and breath control and I have zero allergies. But every time I run in the cold, I start hyperventilating and I feel terrible for the rest of the day. Usually I start running indoors on a treadmill but this year I was prepping for my first half marathon so I wanted to actually be able to breathe during the race. First I thought \"I just have to get used to it\" but even the few degrees drop in temperature left me wheezing after 1km. I am very used to breathing through my nose but if it is really cold or I have a longer run, my nose starts to close and I cannot breathe through it easily anymore. I started wearing a face covering and letting my lungs get used to the air slowly (very slow pace, very small increases) and that really made all the difference! It's still relatively warm but I hope this will help keep me going through winter as a I train for my second HM!\n\nFor me it *was* exercise induced asthma! All those years I just thought I was out of shape. \n\nI'd advise anyone who coughs after/while running in the winter to talk to a doctor about it, and see if they recommend getting an inhaler. An inhaler makes a world of difference even if you have a very mild case of asthma that crops up no other time. \n\nFace coverings help a lot for asthma too. I worry people with asthma might read the post above and think it's not worth asking about asthma.\n\nSucking in large quantities of icy air into your delicate internal organs sounds like it might quite reasonably cause irritation.\n\n\nIt goes away, I really wouldn't worry about it.\n\n\nDon't be a doofus and run in a face covering unless you're in a super dusty or polluted environment. You'll do yourself more harm than good.\n\nI know this older asian lady who runs regularly- she says its not too good to run in the cold &amp; get cold air in your lungs.\n\nI know this Finnish baby, she says it's great to nap outside in the freezing cold and get the cold air in your lungs\n\nNapping &amp; running are 2 different things\n\nThat's true, I'll have to get the baby's perspective on running\n\nDid she also tell you that sleeping with a fan on will kill you?"

Love those trails.\n\nI started running as a way to tire out my dog since he had way more stamina than his friends\n\nEventually he built so much endurance that led me to become a marathon runner lmao\n\nI personally enjoy really hard challenges so thats why I kept going\n\nThis! \n\nIt’s a double edged sword, my dog gets a walk and I get a run. The only difference is he doesn’t have time to run back to me and away again. Now he just goes forward..\n\nSo actually he’s only doing half his normal walk……\n\nSame here (except the marathon part lol)! Started running because of my Vizsla dog. Dude gets never tired it is crazy. The best running and bikejouring partner.\n\nThis was my main motivator too, and considering I have a smaller dog I thought for sure he'd tire out after 3-4 miles. Nope. He has yet to show any exhaustion after a run and we just did a 7 miler this weekend (a PR distance for both of us lol), and gearing up to do 8 this coming weekend. I fear I am creating a monster, building up his stamina like this haha\n\nmine is a working line doberman. literally limitless energy lmao just gotta give him a bottle of water every 8km and he's as good as new\n\n&gt;I personally enjoy really hard challenges so thats why I kept going\n\nHave you thought about a career in the United States Air Force Special Warfare careers? \n\nAll kidding aside. \n\nLove seeing people take on hard challenges for the pure joy of completing a said task.

She is highly reactive to cars and other dogs, so a lot of training led up to it. She definitely wants to run faster than me all the time haha\n\nWhat kind of dog you have? I have a lab mix pup but I'm too worried about her hips to attempt long distance with her\n\nWorking line Doberman\n\nWe did lots of strength training before increasing milage\n\nStuff like playing in the sand, playing fetch on hills\n\nAnother dog runner over here with a high energy doodle 😀.\n\nAlso, I 2nd the love a hard challenge aspect.  If everyone could do it, where's the sense of accomplishment?\n\nAs others pointed out progress is very much personal. I think the most important thing is that you are enjoying what you are doing. Are you enjoying running for longer and would you enjoy structured training? Than you could look into a training plan for a 1/2 or full marathon. Are you enjoying running 5-10k at various paces than just do that. There is also the possibility to train for a PB in these distances but this is also not necessary. Other possibilities are including elevation change, differing undergrounds (e.g., trails), mixing running and biking, fixed-time events (like 3/6/12/24h races), ...,. The possibilities are almost endless!\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I only saw people that actually liked the \"type\" of running they did sticking to it for a longer period.\n\nIm enjoying my currents runs which are usually max pace 5k and slower 10k. Longer runs at max pace feel like a mental challenge currently, I may just need to follow a program to get past that.\n\nIf you can run 5-7 miles relatively routinely, training for a half marathon is easy. There are many apps and programs that can help with this. \n\nHowever, I have never run a marathon. The commitment to doing that seems like a lot. But, again, there are apps and programs that coach you to get there.\n\nI’ve done two marathons and feel like the half is where it’s at along with anything below the half distance. The training for the full just feels like I’m beating up my body.\n\nThat’s what I’ve heard. Like, it’s just over the top. Up to a half is mostly pretty chill. My experience with that has been really good. But, a marathon isn’t just double, it’s really a hard commitment.\n\nI started marathon training twoce and got injured (slightly but enough to quit the training) around the 25km mark every time. I decided my health is more important than finishing a marathon so I just focus on 10miles and halves again.\n\ni just ticked over 25-26km as my weekly long run distance, in theory could spin that up to a marathon in a couple of months but so far i feel like runs over two hours are offering heavily diminishing returns, and after about 23km i'm not enjoying the run any more.  \n\nfrom everything i've heard, it gets markedly worse from 30km+ too.  i'd kinda like to do one as a bucket list thing but as far as goals go i'd much rather get a sub 20 minute 5k and faster 10k.\n\nI started running to stave off the looming weight gain turning 40 seems to bring. \n\nI went from running/walking 5k to being comfortable running a 10k but I've found if I run more than 25km a week my knee protests. \n\nI had been hoping to build up to a half marathon in November but I'm now fearing it's a bridge too far. \n\nI'm considering mixing my routine up between cycling and running to spare my joints.\n\nHave you considered doing some strength and conditioning drills at home/gym for your knees? Worked wonders for me.\n\nI am in my late 40s and had the same issue until I started to do a ton of glute strength training.  Most knee pain is because your glutes aren't strong enough to keep your knees from wobbling when you run.  Made a world of difference.  Take this with a grain of salt.. everyone is different but I did see a sports physical therapist for my knee pain.\n\nDon't forget the muscles below the knee, tibialis and calf! For me at least, my knee pain didn't go away until I did glute and lower leg exercises\n\nWhich exercises do you suggest?\n\nDo you have any exercises you suggest?\n\nIt's been on my mind to get some gym work going. I think a good balance of different workouts will be beneficial.\n\nIf you haven’t seen a doc and gotten an assessment to see if PT could help your knee, think about it!\n\nI had what I thought was a weird knee my whole life, nearly 50 years. PT fixed it in under a month. I wish some adult had given me the steer to do that when I was a kid… Addressing the knee led to improving a whole bunch of other things that I never even thought of as problematic. Turns out a lot of our aches and pains are avoidable with a little bit of knowledge.\n\nIt’s less fun, but doing part of your training on treadmills will be less taxing on your joints and allows you to focus on form.  I’m 54, and whenever any joints or feet bother me, I revert to treadmills for 3-4 runs, and then I go back to normal.\n\nI like adding  strength training and swimming as a crosstraining because it's easy on the joints.\n\nJust do what you enjoy, I know plenty of people who run purely for pleasure without ever signing up for a race.\n\nFor me personally, I sign up for races because I need a concrete goal to motivate myself to stay consistent with my run schedule. If I don’t have a race planned I tend to run way less. I also like the process of trying to beat my own PRs. Currently training for a half marathon just because my city has a really fun one in November and I always look forward to it. But normally I wouldn’t sign up for anything over 10K because I like my knees and I want them to last me a long time lol\n\nRunning isn't bad for your knees. Common misconception.\n\nRunning isn't bad for your knees.  Injuries are.  Running can increase the risk of injury.  Running longer distances can increase that risk further.  The op didn't say running was bad for their knees, they said they preferred shorter distances because they like their knees and want them to last, which I take to mean that the longer distances can cause them knee problems.  \n\nYour point is valid, many people may equate running with some inherent wear on the knees. I think mostly when people talk about not running because of their knees they are really saying that running hurts their knees and they equate that pain to something bad.\n\nGood form, adequate rest and maintaining mobility through stretching between runs makes running (or walking) an excellent activity to keep knee joints lubricated and functional.\n\nI had an IT band injury in the past when training for a full marathon which is why I mentioned the knees haha. So far so good with the half-marathon distance though.\n\nI'm with you. Anything over 10K is torture for me, which is a shame because Marathons/halfs usually look like the best events/routes\n\nI was the same until I started slowing my long runs way down\n\nMy city has a 10Mile race and I absolutely love that distance\n\nCurious about what city! Mine does too (Philadelphia, Broad Street) and I'd love to travel to do that distance more often.\n\nThat really depends on how you run the 10K. Longer-distance races force you to pace a little slower to avoid blowing up. 5K/10K are short enough that you can make yourself hurt pretty badly without blowing up or slowing down much. The 2nd mile of a 5K feels much further from the finish line to me than the 9th mile of a half marathon.\n\nPrecisely. Everyone has different preferences. I love half marathons and dread shorter distance races because of the training and pacing involved.\n\nI am the same. I need something on my calendar I know I need to prep for. If I only ever did 5k/10k, I would be nearly as consistant in my training.\n\nExactly the same mindset! I just would like to add for OP that you don't need any goals or progress, do what is fun for you. If 3 times a 5k a week is your jam, jam on! Don't compare to others\n\nI wish there was more variation with race distances... Where all my 8k, 12k and 15k races at!?\n\nI started running post-sobriety for something to do and to get all that anxiety out since I wasn't drinking anymore. \n\nAnd man, what a better cure!! I fell in love with it and I really like my journey because at the beginning I wasn't even timing myself. I would actually just make different fun playlists and see how far I could go.  Just try to make it a little further than the day before. \n\nThen I started getting more of a routine, then timed, then goals. I did a 6.6K local race associated with the hockey team I love, which was super fun, and my first race! It progressed quickly from there because I really like having the goals, and while the races themselves can be a little painful, the atmosphere is so beautiful. I did a 10K and then my first half. To me, being a part of my whole city coming out that day to just support people running was so incredible and fun! And I've never been athletic in my life, so I was like holy shit, they are cheering for me!! Sort of!! 😅\n\nI'm 2.5 years into this and training for my fifth half, trying to get sub two hours and eyeing a full next year. \n\nHere's the thing though: I love the challenge!! BUT I also love what you described!!! Just going out there and feeling it. They both hold special places for me! So I am doing my 6.6K again (now a tradition), my half and another ten mile race this fall and then I will take a break and run just for the hell of it at whatever pace and distance I want for three months or so. I enjoy those periods too - I love getting out there so I'm never worried about falling off, but it takes off the pressure and the times and just gives me that meditative feeling I crave so much. \n\nAnd I'll do that for a while. And then winter will thaw and spring will get here and that little needling voice in me will be like, I wonder if we should start training for...\n\n...whatever. \n\nAnd I'll love that too.\n\nHow often do you run? All year?\n\nI promise you that you'll always find people running further (and faster) so if you judge yourselves by what others enjoy it will diminish your own accomplishments. I just finished my first 100mi race Sunday morning and, although it went relatively well, I was still immediately confronted by posts about people running 200mi races or 600mi+ Fastest Known Time attempts. The cool thing is that the longer you run (both in duration since you started and perhaps longer distances) the more you realize it really doesn't matter. The most significant mile is the first mile, because that means you got off the couch and got out there which is often the hardest part. \n\nThe great news I have for you is that if you can pay attention to your body and stay healthy you'll have a huge world of improvement ahead of you if you want. Times that seem fast now will likely be your \"easy\" pace eventually. Distances that seemed extreme will likely seem easier as well. My advice is to enjoy the journey and chase what brings you joy rather than what anyone else is chasing.\n\nMe dying at the end of a half marathon and seeing people casually jogging past smiling as they complete lap 6 of their 75 mile ultra marathon 😐\n\nThis! Completely agree that the most significant mile is the first mile\n\n100!! Wow that is incredible well done\n\nI think everyone runs for different reasons. I've always been kind of obsessed with numbers and seeing my running stats improve, reaching new PBs etc. is what motivates me (thanks Garmin :D). Other people don't care about any of this and just enjoy going for a jog, or they run to lose weight, or to stay in shape and healthy. All these are valid reasons (and I'm sure there are many others).\n\nSo I think there is no \"natural progression\", as long as you enjoy what you are doing you're fine.\n\nIt's very personal. See, I started running in 2016, got to 10k distance in maybe 10 months. And then I half assedly went for runs until I gave up completely in 2019. Crickets until 2022. Now I am training for my first half but I would say it has taken me a year of taking running more seriously and progressing through 10k and 15k training plans and life happening and covid to get here, to even be comfortable with the idea that I am capable. For me it has been a wonderful lesson in being patient. And understand that reaching some goals takes time. Longer time than I want to spend. It actually became comforting to think this way. I don't need to burn myself out, instead I just keep at it, bit and bit and will get there eventually. \n\nI think for many people their goals start changing the longer they run as well. When I started, I just wanted to move through the mental pain. NEVER in my life I would assume I would capable OR desiring to run 20k lol. But now I do. It's kinda fun to let your mind wander in this way. If you're good with 5k and 10k for now, stick with it. Maybe it will change, maybe not. I am a believer in staying with the flow :)\n\nI started running because a friend convinced me to sign up for a marathon. That's not how I'd recommend doing it. I'd done a couple 5ks before, but probably never run more than 5 miles at once before that summer. I gradually kept running a little bit more as the years went by, and because it hurt less than playing basketball. Two years after that marathon I did my first 10k. 3 years after that my first half. The next year I did my second full, 6 years after my first. With all that running under my belt I did a lot better, and found that even though it was much faster, it still wasn't much fun.\n\nI do 2 or 3 races per year. I joined a running group and have friends to run with. Next week I'm going to have a friend doing an ultra marathon. I'll be joining him 48 miles into the race, so he should be worn out by then. I'm on pace to run more miles this year than ever, but at my slowest average place since that first year. Partly because I'm old and not going to set any more PRs, partly because I run a higher percentage of my miles with friends that aren't quite as fast.\n\nThe great thing about running is that I get to set my own goals. I can try to get faster, or run longer distances, or just have fun running. Every answer is the right answer.\n\nDistance is a metric that matters to some people. Speed is another one. Generally, I find that newer runners are more impressed by distance, and seek it out (hence /r/firstmarathon). More experienced runners tend to run a variety of distances, and instead focus on PRs.\n\nCongrats on the consistency! That's the hardest part to get down. As for distances/times, that's really up to you. I know I like running from 30 up to around 120 minutes, beyond which I tend to get bored... this tends to dictate what I will run or sign up for. Others really love the challenge of pushing themselves to go longer distances, and still others love working on speed. There's certainly a lot of talk of marathons, but there's a whole world of other kinds of running out there beyond that.\n\nIt is generally the way people progress, because as we get older, strength fades, while endurance keeps improving, so longer races become more appealing. At your age, you can concentrate on the short distances and get faster. No need to rush into the half marathon or longer distances if you don't want to.\n\nI am a slight exception to this, as I started running at 35, and have continually improved in both speed and endurance since then. This year, at age 47, I've run my first sub 20 minute 5k, and my first sub 20 hour 100 miler. But I think that's because I started from 100% couch potato status, and it took a while for me to figure out some things.\n\nBut one thing people around my age (let's call it mid-30s and up) agree on is that running 5ks *sucks*. We hate going that fast. A 50k or a 50 miler suck in a very different way, but at least you don't have to run fast.\n\nThe fact that young people tend to stick to shorter races and older people tend to stick to longer races does make it look like a natural progression, but there's no rule that says you have to do it that way.\n\n**EDIT**: also, obviously no one goes in the opposite direction\n\nI first started running before I formed memories, so I can't say why or how. I raced the kids in my neighborhood down the street and around the block. When we got to middle school, PE classes, end of year field days, and the presidential fitness challenge tended to all include a 1-mile run, so I did that, but as far as distance running, that was it. 1 mile. I still PRd at 5:05 in 8th grade, which was good enough to be 2nd best all-time for the school, so I joined summer cross-country practice when I started high school. That was my first introduction to any kind of organized and intentional training for running. I think my best time as a freshman was either 17:12 or 17:14. I'm not entirely sure, but it was a pretty flat course, a league meet on a Thursday, and I attached myself to one of the varsity guys I thought I was pretty close to, went into a trance and stared at his feet until the final half mile, then took off and blasted in as hard as I could.\n\nAfter high school, I never again competed, but joined the Army and it involves at least some amount of running since the 2-mile is or at least was part of the standard fitness test. Something like 13:14 or so was good enough to max the points possible on that part of the test. I usually finished between 11:30 and 12:00, but I wasn't really all that into running as a form of exercise. I swam every day. I did a lot of rock climbing. We typically had a pretty slow 5-mile or so unit run every week, and I did track repeats typically once a week, sometimes twice. That was it.\n\nWhen I got out of the Army, I had increasingly serious spine problems and eventually couldn't run. I couldn't even consistently walk. Really, I couldn't consistently stand up or dress myself sometimes. It took a lot of years, a lot of surgeries, a lot of physical therapy, and a lot of patience to eventually come back from that. I'd lost basically all the muscle I ever had from years of inactivity at that point, so mostly I focused on lifting for the first few years, and I walked. A lot. Probably too much. I got really into Pokemon Go for a while because it gave me something to do while walking. Eventually, I knew neglecting cardio fitness forever was not going to be tenable, but it wasn't clear what I could do. Impact hurt too much at first. I bought an indoor rower but it still hurts too much even now to use it much because of the upright seated position. Cycling was even worse because of the hunched over riding position. I got a membership at an indoor pool but never consistently went because of the requirement to drive. I didn't even have a car for three years.\n\nSo hey, eventually the impact didn't hurt any more, and I started running again. So here I am.\n\nThere is no \"peak\" of running. The most glamorous event is obviously the 100m in terms of popular attention you're ever going to get for being good at it. But speed is the first thing to go as you get old. Endurance is one of the last things to go. So people gravitate toward longer distances because they can still be reasonably competitive if they put in enough work. Plus, a track only has 9 lanes, they usually only use 8, and most people won't qualify for a 100m even if they want to run that. The marathon is the glamour event of road racing because it's the only road race in the Olympics and there are global majors. So I'm sure that attracts people, too. There are also a lot of them and they can sometimes register thousands of people, so they're accessible.\n\nLikely a lot of people do them even though they'd be better at other distances, but they never competed in track and never discovered that. Since I did compete, I know the 800 was always my best distance, and that makes a lot of sense. I'm way too big for a runner, but roughly the fringe of what you might still see at that distance. My physique is near identical to Marcus Arop. Good marathoners, in contrast, tend to be at least 6 inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than me. Realistically, I have a great body for swimming, not running, but man, getting to the pool all the time has always been a bitch. I was able to do it in the Army because they had pools on post.\n\nI started running because I didn't want to be fat anymore. \n\nHowever somewhere along the line it was no longer about my weight, it was about being as physically fit as I could be and to see what my body is capable of. \n\nI started running a mile every few days in November last year, then moved to park runs, tried a few 10Ks.. started doing speed work and realised it's the endurance aspect I preferred. \n\nOver the next few months you'll really start to realise what you enjoy and it'll shape your 'running career'.. I'm not fast by any stretch of the imagination, my 5K PR is 24minutes, but I train for endurance because that's what I love. \n\nTL;DR: Weight-loss is the reason I started, distance running is the reason I keep going.   \nI started at 120kg. 8 months later I'm 78kg and training for a 113KM ultra.\n\nPeople seem obsessed with marathons these days, both in and outside of the running community. But you don't have to progress to longer distances. Your goal can be to do shorter distances as fast as you can (like me, I do track &amp; field), or you can just stay at your current level if it feels good and you're doing this for health and/or enjoyment or other reasons.\n\nYou're the only person who can decide what your goals should be.\n\nNo it isn’t necessarily the natural progression. A lot of people never do a half/full marathon.  I’d like to but have had too many injuries, at this point I’m happy to be able to get outdoors and have some time to myself while I do a nice, leisurely 8-10k.  That’s the great thing about running:  it can be whatever you want it to be.\n\nStop reading those posts is what I say, 😁. Please yourself, you might get bored doing the 5 or 10 k, but if you're happy doing that then continue and please yourself. I find the 10k in particular fits me well, I can come home from work, do a  10k near home and be finished and showered in little over an hour. I do this 5 or 6 times of a typical week, and the body can cope on (52yo male here.)\nI did a number of half marathons, they are OK, but I find the recovery is hard, and messes my routine for several days. I have to do a local club event in October and I'll know I'll be in a mess. \n\nShort version, do whatever distances you enjoy and are able for.\n\nMy best and favorite distance is 10k and quarter marathon. I see no reason to do a half or full marathon except to say I've done it.  \n\nMy running progression was 5k, 8k, 10k, and quarter marathon.  I still do any of these distances, because I enjoy them.\n\nThere's a lot of pressure to do a half or full marathon.  I don't want to, so I'm not.\n\nThe main thing about running for most people who are not elite athletes is that it is supposed to be FUN.  It's a hobby.  A challenge.  None of us are getting paid to do it.  So go do the distance you like best, and run it the best you can.\n\nQuarter marathon? So 10.6km? What an odd distance.\n\nIt's half of a half, so 10.55km.  Even weirder.  I like it.\n\nI started in 2018 to lose weight. Then in 2019 I entered my local half marathon. Then found a plan online and followed it. That was my journey.\n\nIMO halfs and marathons are not the peak of running because it depends on what your personal goals are and what you enjoy!\n\nI personally like distance so I’ve built up to training for a marathon, but after this race my goal is to PR short distances (1 mile &amp; 5k) because it’s something I’ve never trained for before. FWIW I don’t see it as a step backwards either, just trying to meet my goals &amp; have fun.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDo you have any 10k goals? Ive been trying to improve my 5k time as well but usually take 10ks fairly easy without any goal in mind.\n\nYou progress one run at a time. \n\nI'm almost 3 years into running, started aged 50. \n\nCompleted a 57km trail ultra last September, slow but fun.\n\nGor my 5k in to the mid -20s, 10k target this November is into the 42s and half target of under 1:40 in October.\n\nI've done that by being consistent. \n\nI engaged with an online coach last year, it's helped add some structure and I don't have to think about it but that's a luxury, not necessity.\n\nDude we started running at the same time. I’ve also been doing 5-10k, more 5k’s \nI’ve used this new love of running as a spring board for the rest of my health and athletic training. \nNo goals other than a better, happier me.\n\nRaces at not for everyone. I started running 2 years ago and haven’t done more than 8 miles. Totally ok with that. I have lost a lot of weight and looking into running a bit less and weight training a bit more. Just do what makes you happy! And measure progress your own way.\n\nJoin a running club/team. I’ve cut my HM time from 1:46 to 1:25 in just 15 months by training with people faster than me.\n\nNot all clubs are the same though. Some are more social than others. With running becoming more popular, clubs are popping up left and right. Find one that works for you\n\nI ran track in college. And started running again about ten years later. I don’t run races. Running distance is hard enough for me. The mindset is completely different as a competitive runner vs a hobby runner. I just run to stay in shape and because it clears my head. It’s a hobby. One I spend a ton of time and money on. I’ve been running in Central Park for years now. Every year I get a little faster and then winter hits and I lose some of that speed and by about august it’s built back up again. But I’ll never be as fast as I was. It’s about my mind, my body and the fight to not put on weight as I age. Run your own race. Don’t worry about what anyone else does.  You don’t have to get faster or better or wear the gear or eat the gels or whatever running influencers are telling you. Personally people go flying by me sometimes and I get annoyed but then I remember I don’t give a shit what anyone else is doing out there as long as they are following the unwritten rules and not being assholes\n\nNo, running longer is not necessarily a natural progression.  Some people enjoy longer stuff, some enjoy shorter stuff.\n\nHowever, I think there are a much larger number of amateur runners that are training for completion of a distance goal vs training for speed.  This is true in triathlon as well. \n\nI once heard an elite 5k runner tell a story about meeting someone on an airplane. They mentioned they were a runner, and the other person said they ran too, and asked the pro what distance, and the pro said “5k”, and the other person said “well, just keep training and someday you’ll be able to do a marathon!”\n\nI personally like to go fast and try and get PRs at shorter distances, and find longer distances boring.  Other people I know think longer distances are super fun and shorter distances are too painful.  Different strokes.\n\nStarted running in my 30s for general health, after having been lifting for a few months.\n\nFirst I thought \"I'd like to be able to run 5 miles. That's a nice roundish number.\"\n\nWell, it only took me a couple months to be comfortably running 5 miles.\n\nSo then I looked up something like \"how to improve in running.\" I found a blog post with some training info that said \"if you can run a 5k, you can run a 10k. If you can run a 10k, you can run a half marathon. If you can run a half marathon, you can run a marathon.\"\n\nI figured, since I was just about at a 10k distance, a half marathon would be a good next goal. I didn't even have any plans on signing up for a race, just wanted to run the distance. But then I had a couple friends who've done races encourage me to sign up.\n\nI loved the race. Am doing another half this year and have a shortlist of marathons to pick from for next year. And I've already caught myself thinking, well 50k is only ~4 miles longer than a marathon, so if I can do a marathon, I could probably do a 50k\n\nI still lift and enjoy it, but I really enjoy and find satisfaction in the progression of racing. Like, the process of having a training plan to peak before a race, going out and pushing yourself, and setting a new target for myself to beat.\n\nOf course, father time will catch up with me eventually, and I won't be able to beat my times forever. But I figure I've got a ways to go, and if I keep taking care of myself I'll be able to say \"I'm in the best shape of my life\" for a long time \n\nI also just really enjoy longer runs. Get outside, enjoy an audiobook, clear my head\n\nI am trying to get back into running after kids, and many years, I started with a couch to 10k training program and have a 10k this month. From there I am planning a half for the spring, and I will go find a training program for that.\n\nI ran a handful of 8ks with 0 running or training and maybe a couple 5ks before I started to train for the half marathon last year. My only physical activity was playing pickup basketball or soccer once or twice a week. Basically I was no real runner and after doing the half last year I am one now. I don't care for my time in the 5k or 10k, I just want to improve my half time and try a full marathon someday. \n\nI look at running as it's to each its own. Your own goals, pace and distances. \nYou can choose to keep building on the distance, or you can stay where you are and work on improving time there. Do what feels best to you.\n\nI like the challenge that the longer distances provide, I plateu’d at shorter distances 5k 10k etc times just weren’t getting any faster and marathons gave me that extra challenge. Then I moved back and forth between ironman and ultra marathons for a while because I enjoyed the more social side of running for over 12hrs straight you get to talk to all sorts of people and in some instances make good friends\n\nI just got hooked to challenging myself. In the beginning, joining races never crossed my mind but like you I got curious by reading this sub, so I did a 10k, enjoyed it, then a half a few months later. \n\nI just feel like there is a marathon inside of me, I just have to do it, so I'm currently training for it.\n\nI did a couple 5ks in my 20s but hated running. At age 34 I did my first sprint triathlon, having done nothing longer for running. 9 months later I did my first 13.1 as part of my first half Ironman. A month after that I did my first 50k (on trails, too) with nothing over 10 miles in between the two events. I've done through 100 miles though I'm not a fan of distance; my favorite is road 13.1 or trail 15-25k.\n\nI'm not naturally athletic or a fast runner. I'm a middle aged woman built more for lifting weights. It's all about how bad you want it and how much you're willing and able to train that will determine what you can achieve. Not to mention, you can spend years perfecting your 5k before you even attempt to do a half and that's perfectly fine. No one is judging you, at least not anyone whose opinion should carry any weight.\n\nThese days I do a bunch of different sports of which running is just one, and I don't race anymore.\n\nOnce I broke that mental barrier that I couldn't do something, it got a lot easier.  You start to realize that you are much more capable than you think.  It's pushing to that next level mentally that is the hardest part.  Your body can do hard things, your mind needs to stop questioning it.\n\nHalf or full marathon is a goal to work towards. \n\nMany are happy with 5 or 10k races. Then works on speed as new goals. \n\nOthers are just happy running to relax.\n\nI started running about 8 weeks ago with no idea what I was doing and at 46. At first, I was happy to run 1 mile once a week. 8 weeks later, I run, a homemade  5k 3x a week. My pace is still slow, but I'm not doing it for speed. I'm doing it for endurance and overall fitness, especially Cardo and lung capacity. If you're doing for yourself and not to win a race just do what feels right to you without hurting yourself.\n\nI started running 9 weeka ago because i used to tell people how much i hate it and my head cant handle it. \n\nWell i ended up  trying it out with a friend and then loving it and ran my first HM last saturday.  I wasnt fast by any means, but i wanted to know if i can do it. I did it in 2:17.\n\nI also enjoy the challenges of running the longer distances it seems. Also today i ran a new 5k pr of 26:58. I weigh 220lbs so im feeling my running volume in my knee and am having to take it easier for a while now. \n\nIts addicting and fun. If you want to progress but dont want to do the longer runs, just try faster 5ks and 10ks or go do trails and such. Im going to a 13km night trail run at the end of september. So many opportunities in this hobby and im loving it. \n\nOr you can do cooper tests and so on. Fastest mile? Go blast a mile every once in a while.\n\nI started running because I was working in a remote area with nothing to do. People would say oh you must like running since you do it every day, to which I would say no I hate running but Im bored. Now a couple months in I actually enjoy the routine of it, and some time to myself. 5ks have been going well, I tried a mile the other day and I was pretty slow and did not enjoy it but may just need time and repetition.\n\nDon’t fall into the trap that marathons are the peak of running. I’ve fallen into this trap and now my entire running career revolves around trying to break 2:30 in it. The fact of the matter is that running marathons has a lot of downsides, from increased risk of injury, to simply having to do high mileage week after week, month after month. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with preferring shorter distances and it’s a lot easier to train for and for the time in around your schedule. \n\nBasically just find and run whatever distance you prefer, rather than what you think you should be running\n\nI think it’s completely personal and dependent on what keeps you motivated and excited. I have dreams of running ultra marathons in the nearish future but I’ve been feeling a little discouraged over my speed. so, I decided to go into an intentional speed block for the next ~12 weeks before I start building distance again, and I’m really excited to do that!\n\nDo what you enjoy. Want to go further? Start going further. Want to go faster? Focus on that. You can also do both, and there's nothing wrong with staying exactly where you are too, there's more to running than achieving goals.\n\nI personally was building up to a half marathon but injured myself which derailed me a bit, but i now have a 10k race in 3 months so would rather focus on getting that time as low as possible. No idea where I'll go from there!\n\nI started running like 4 months ago in order to lose a little more weight. Stuck with it because I feel more mentally regulated and healthy.\n\nFirst couple of months were spent running 5k 4x a week consistently. I was very slow, I’d have to do run-walk-run a bit. But after several weeks of consistency, i could run the full 5k with no issue.\n\nFrom there, I decided I wanted to build up to 10K distance. So for a couple months, I’d run 5Ks 3x a week and then my 4th run would be slowly adding distance (4 miles &gt; 4.5 miles &gt; 5 miles, etc).\n\nNow I can run a 10K. My pace has also improved from 11:30/min miles to 9:30/min miles.\n\nI’ve decided to start training for a half marathon, but I think that’ll be the longest distance I shoot for. After that, I might just focus on speed.\n\nI’m a very goal-oriented person, so I’m a little scared that I’ll get tired of running after the half-marathon goal…but we’ll see!\n\nWhen I started, I immediately wanted to build up the distance to do a half-marathon. \nI was running up to 5k to begin with, but once that was relatively easy, I started adding 1-2km to a run each week and calling it my 'long run'. \n\nIn doing this, I've found that I just really enjoy running for the 2+ hours it takes me to run 20+ km. \nIt's challenging, but not in the same way that trying to run a fast 5k is, and this challenge feels more rewarding to me than a 5k does. \n\nI've also learned that the half-marathon distance is a pretty sustainable one to run regularly. \n\nSo I'm pretty content running my weekly long runs in the 20-25k range, and then occasionally training for a specific half-marathon race with a goal time in mind. \n\nI am starting to think about training for a marathon some time in 2025, but I don't feel  as strong a desire to run marathons, as I feel for half-marathons.\n\nI just passed my one year mark and still loving the 5k distance. Not too time consuming during the week and I can fit in some lifting without it taking over my life.\n\nI started running for “fun”, stayed at 5k with an occasional 10k for three years. My times came down from not being able to run 800m to 22min. I ran a half marathon last year in 1:52 and it didn’t kill me. I plan to run a marathon next year and it will definitely be my only one, if I get sub four hours. I don’t see this as a progression but as a bucket list item, and it will be my only one. I want my 5k time to get to 20.** and I can retire. 😂\n\nI started running to lose weight. After a year, I went from treadmill to trail, started with 3m. Then worked to 5mi. Then ran some races, a 5k, a 10k, a half. Found i enjoy training at 10k distance and and racing half. \n\nOne day I'll try a marathon. I wanted to do it in my 30s and that window of eligibility is only 15 more months. \n\nThat was all precovid. Now I'm motivated by helping get in shape so I can run with my better half, and medals. I've done long distance relays over days before but never like a Disney one, so doing the Disneyland one next weekend, then maybe I'll try that marathon in 2025 and do dopey 2026\n\nI’m a 60M and I started running in the late 80s and it was basically to drop a few pounds and give me something to do.  But I was steadily getting faster and progressed into racing.  Interesting that the main race distance back then was 10K, I don’t remember 5Ks being a thing, and neither was a 1/2 marathon.  It took me about two years before I had the itch to run a marathon.  As with any racing, or running in general, you look for challenges and then when you meet your goals, you start looking for more things to try.  I’ve gone from marathons to triathlons to trail running to now ultras and I’m still exploring new challenges.  But if you find you like shorter distances, there’s no shame in not running marathons.  Enjoy your running journey\n\nGreat question/post BTW.\n\nFor me I’ll never go over a half marathon. For one it’s just not something I’m interested in. Second, I don’t have time to routinely run 15+ miles with work, family, etc. I’ll progress by improving endurance and pace, doing some sprinting intervals and things like that.\n\nAfter 10K, I personally stuck with Strava's half marathon training calendar. It's unfortunately a very rigid calendar that you should start on before the week starts, but I enjoy the \"do this\" and \"how fast\" aspect of it. Takes the guess work out of \"how much *should* I run and how fast?\"\n\nHalf marathon is where I drew the line. I tried the next training schedule for a full marathon but I just cannot commit the time for training.\n\nYou’ll eventually work out what you enjoy. I have run a marathon but I wouldn’t do it again. I’ve discovered I get the most joy out of 10 to 21km  trail runs… especially those with big elevation changes, lots of nature and spectacular views.\n\nIf you mean progression as the furthest distance or the ultimate goal for running, I think it varies with people, if you're happy with 5k 10k then why not? If you're happy with half and full marathons then go for it!\n\nI started running for 30 to 40 minutes, I didn't care about the distance, but then after a 17 and a 21km run, I went for my first half marathon race and then everything just started there, now I'm chasing the marathon distance, but I wouldn't mind going for ultras! It's what makes me feel happy and accomplished!\n\nAt first 5km seems like the end of the world for me. As it became more and more easy to run these distances without stopping, I tried to add a little bit every run. 1 months later I'm running a 10k for the first time o my life and I'm absolutely destroy after the run. So I said to myself, let's do it again in two weeks. And on and on and on. I now run 30km with ease. I'm training to hit my first half marathon under 1h45 and I lost over 80 pounds. Greatest shape of my life at 38yrs old\n\nI started out running 1 minute 3 times a week. Every time I went for a run, I added 1 minute to my total time. Now I am up to 3 1-hour runs per week, which works out to about 24 miles/week.\n\nI didn't do deload runs or pace runs or anything like that. I just ran a bit further every time. The excitement of having beaten my previous record, to see what was further down the bike path I run on, was a great motivator for me.\n\nFor now I am chilling at that 24 miles/week. I might run even longer in the future, or add in lighter runs in my off-days, IDK. But basically I didn't do any special training programs, I just started VERY small, and built my way up to something that probably 95% of people never achieve.\n\nNever doubt the power of progressive overload.\n\nI started running for health reasons, and once I ran 5k for the first time the sense of accomplishment got me very excited. I gradually increased up to a half marathon over several months with the plan of working towards a marathon.\n\nIt got harder and harder to maintain that training though. To prepare for a marathon you have to spend many hours running each week. After running the half distance a couple of times, I had some difficult stuff happen with work and have gotten depressed, which makes it harder to get up early and run, or go out in the evening when I'm already tired and just want to veg out.  And besides, I'm a lot busier than before, working on a portfolio, trying to skill up, trying to look for another job...\n\nI still want to run a marathon one day, but for now I'm just trying to stay in decent shape &amp; keep up the mental health benefits of exercise. I still run 5-10k a few times a week, and use a bike to get around instead of a car when I can. Still feels really good to get out and run, but I've lost the obsession I had earlier in the year!\n\nI guess in low periods I just try to remember this saying, \"the best exercise is the exercise you actually do\" - which is to say that keeping up consistent, small steps is way better than doing nothing at all! And it's ok for your goals to change depending on where you're at in life 🤷\n\nI eventually did a marathon because I wanted the challenge. I’m still enjoying it, so I’m gearing up for marathon #4 along with shorter races.\n\nI started running about 10 years ago, and did a half about 4 years in, and then a few more halves.  Training for my first marathon now.\n\nI never thought I could do a full marathon, but here I am.  I want to make sure I do at least one just so I can say I did.\n\nI think I like halves more than full marathons, marathon training has been a huge time investment.\n\nI also didn’t run at all for long stretches of time, I find without a goal race, I just dont run\n\nYou can do whatever you want!\n\nIt all depends what you want to achieve. I know people who never run further than 5k, people who train 6 days a week and never race further than 5k, people who literally run nothing shorter than a marathon but do it every week, and a guy who just medalled at both 800m and 1500m at the world masters athletics championship last week etc etc. Running can basically be whatever you want it to be.\n\nMost people start aiming for a 5k/parkrun, and if they find they enjoy it then there is definitely a natural progression from there to 10k and half-marathon, especially if they join a club. Many people stop at half-marathon because with a decent level of fitness and 2-3 runs a week you can basically run a half-marathon any time you want. Going beyond that takes commitment however, and many people simply aren't prepared to do that.\n\nPersonally, my running career started when I entered a half-marathon (the company I was working for were the main sponsors), and I went from not having run in over 20 years to half-marathon in 3 months. I joined a club and got into racing regularly over shorter distances with one or two halves per year, before I went for a marathon. After 4 marathons I was contemplating trying to break 3 hours at 50 and then moving on to an ultra, but foot problems sadly curtailed my running career.\n\nIt's really up to preferences. If you like 5 or 10 km runs, just stay with it, there is no reason to progress to a half Marathon or Marathon if you don't want to do it. It also depends if you are more interested in speed or endurance. Generally, shorter races are more about improving the time, long races are more about the ability to finish. The Marathon is about speed for many runners. When it comes to Ultramarathons many people participate for the challenge to complete the distance, elevation and terrain. But there are some very fast and competitive Ultramarathons as well.  So there are many different ways to progress in running, it can be trying to be faster, run for longer or running on trails vs roads.\n\nI ran a lot in school, but once I got to college onwards, I only ran in the off season when I wasn't playing team sport as a way to keep my head level. Once I retired from team sport, I really picked back up in terms of how much I ran, starting at daily 5k, up to 10k, and then onto marathons. I ran 8 marathons in 18 months because I became a bit obsessed, ha, but this year I cut right back and realised that what I really enjoy is 10-20k runs in beautiful places. Less than 10k and I haven't run enough to ease my brain, more than 20k and I'm bored. 😅 I also need things to look at. I can't do treadmills. I won't bother with marathons again, I don't think. My challenge right now is trying to get my 10k time consistently sub 40. Wish me luck. 😅\n\nIt's a natural progression - my first runs were about 3 km long and I would go back home tired after them. Now I am preparing for a marathon and just ran 36 km recently as my long run. It gets easier.\n\nHowever, I noticed that it stopped being easy at some point - for me, it's around the 10 km mark - from there, I had to put more effort into my runs.\n\nThere's no way around these truths:\n\n* You can run longer by running longer\n* You can run faster by running faster\n\nFor the first few months you will see a lot of gains -- in endurance, in pace, in comfort -- just from getting out there and running consistently, but after that, it's going to be hard to progress to longer distances or faster paces without including weekly training sessions that lead you toward those goals.  Period, full stop.\n\n(Personally speaking, I ended up running my first half &amp; then full marathon the year I was actually trying to focus on improving my 5k time.  I ended up running 40-50mpw with weekly long runs over 10 miles and decided I might as well sign up for a couple of races.  I ran 4 marathons in two years and then decided that was enough.  It just takes too much time per week for me to train how I'd want to in order to run the marathon times I'd be satisfied with, so now I'm back to focusing on 5k-10mi efforts.  I'm 47M.)\n\nI think what you need to consider is that your journey is YOUR journey and nobody else's. You've completed your 10k so how do you feel? Do you think you could it faster? Do you think you could go further? Both are admirable goals. To be an accomplished runner you don't need to run a 5 minute mile and not everyone needs to run a marathon. Just focus on an immediate goal (run you a mile but 10 seconds faster) and a longer goal (take a minute off your mile). Then as you meet each goal, find new ones.\n\nI struggled doing a 5K for the first time... until eventually it became easy and I started working on a half. I did a half morning and struggled so much that I thought, nope, no way in hell am I doing this again! ...then I did sub-2 hour half and start worked on a full. Each time I cleared an accolade I wanted to one up it by doing it faster or by going further.\n\nStopped running one time less than I started it. 5 weeks out from berlin marathon at 40k/week and not at all worried…\n\nI made a bet I could beat a fitness enthusiast relative at a marathon if I trained (they hadn't run one either). I sort of just dove from no running to marathon training and got hooked. Now I'm 7 marathons in and trying to BQ.\n\nFor me it started with a trip to a local cafe on a Saturday morning with my wife and son; there was a decent number of people who had just finished parkrun and I offhandedly said to my wife \"maybe I should do parkrun\", having not ran with any regularity ever despite being a keen walker. \n\nFollowing weekend did a parkrun/walk in almost 37 minutes. From there signed up for a 10K and did couch to 5K which is really good at building a structure to your running. A few weeks after completing C25K completed the 10K which really solidified a love of running.\n\nNow go to parkrun pretty much every week which keeps me pushing myself to edge quicker and quicker (now progressed to a sub-25 5K). Completed a half marathon this year which was mainly a challenge to myself and won't deny I felt pretty emotional crossing the finish line. From there I've just got the bug, and think when family life allows I'd love to do more races (Great North Run, London Marathon etc.). \n\nMy recommendation would be to see whether there's a city based 10K near you and just sign up for it. It's a nice feeling running with a crowd even when you're not the quickest, and you'll soon find yourself pushing yourself either to go faster or further!\n\nI just started running and then that evolved into wanting to be able to do certain things like run a certain distance, or run a bit faster without being totally wiped out. Those things turned into wanting to be able to run a half marathon, and then a full one. Some people who I know are not at all interested in running long distances and are more into running at a certain pace for their personal goal.\n\nIt's okay if stuff like that doesn't interest you, though. Some people just enjoy running as an activity and it's as simple as that.\n\nI started running back around 2016 and worked up to doing 10K runs consistently on treadmills. During Covid I started running and the longest I did was about 10 miles. Past few years I mostly do a 6-8 mile run on the treadmill on Saturday morning or outside during the non summer months when it’s hot and humid in Dallas 24/7.\n\nFor me: by going slowly and not getting injured.\n\nthese days, my average everyday run (I run about 5 days/week) is 3 or 4 miles. my most recent long run was 11 miles (longest I've ever run in one go). a couple months ago I just started getting curious about how far I could go and increasing my long run by about a mile each week. it's cool to see what my body will adapt to. the first time I ran 5 miles I was so proud of myself! and now I can do more than double that. it's exciting every time I increase my \"longest ever\" distance. so I'm just exploring and seeing how far I can take it. I've never done a race, not particularly interested right now but maybe someday.\n\nI was supposed to run a 100miler this year but it was cancelled due to weather. I ran my first 5K a year ago. I’ve trained every week since and up to about 70-90 miles a week combined miles, so things escalated quickly for me. I want to BQ within 2 years.\n\nThere are sprinters who have never done a 5km. Progression for me is just chasing the challenge. I’ve had whole years where I will do max 5km runs and other years I just chase distance the whole time\n\nRunning is both a social and deeply personal activity. Unless you are elite, your only limits are the ones you set for yourself. If you just want to run 5ks until you're 80, do it. Want to become a marathoner or ultra runner, do it. The peak is where you set it and honestly if you never want a greater challenge then a 10k, that's absolutely fine. \n\nI started running fun runs and then thought I could do a half. Took some time and then figured I put I wanted to try a full marathon. I've run a few of those but they are starting to hurt a bit more the day after. I've been thinking about dropping back to half's again. But then I see a location that I want to run, and I sign up for another full marathon. Always remember to run your race and no one else's. Run what makes you happy and what makes you content.\n\nI ran 5ks every other day for 7 or 8 years and felt very happy about it, didn’t feel the need to push for longer. \n\nRecently, I wanted to challenge myself a bit more for various reasons (including perimenopause and wanting to combat some bone loss), so I’m training for a half marathon and enjoying the journey. I think I could have happily kept doing my 5ks - it wasn’t something I felt compelled to do because of those, just a thing I wanted to try knowing I enjoy my shorter runs a lot. \n\nI think it’s perfectly fine to follow your body and your mind in whatever it finds works!\n\nFor me personally - progress is consistency. I don’t care too much about getting faster - however, because I have started as a fairly slow runner gives me a lot of room to set new PBs and get much better over time.          \n\nAs for half marathons (and full marathons) they are a challenge that I can orient myself toward - it helps give structure to my running and though I’ve only done one official half marathon, it was so much fun I can’t wait to do another, and push myself toward a full marathon.\n\nI started running in 2019.  Like 2 months before the world went crazy.  So, I didn’t have the opportunity to race.  And I’m fine with that.  I still haven’t entered a race. \nI’m generally a slower runner.  I’ve done my own little 5ks, 10ks, just to see if I can beat my previous times.  I’ve been part of some group challenges to work on speed for those distances and that was fun.  I don’t really pay attention to pace but it is cool to look back on and see how I’ve progressed over the years.  \nThe most I’ve ever run is 15km.  My big long term, hopefully one day goal is to run a 50k.  Whether that’s in a low key race or just by myself, we’ll see.  That’s a much bigger commitment than I’m used to, so we’ll see how life plays out.  \n\nI like being able to just go out and run whatever distance, at no set pace and enjoy myself.  I do it because I love it, not because I’m paid to.  \n\nIf the shorter distances are keeping you happy, stay there and enjoy it.  Your feelings might change, they might not.  If they do, there are so many options out there!\n\nFor me, having a goal race gives me a reason to run consistently, instead of just here and there when I feel like it, and usually the same route/pace. I first did a 10k probably 10 years ago, then didn’t run much after that besides a bit of trail running. Now I’m gearing up for my first 1/2 and really enjoying the challenge and the different workouts too now that I’m actually following a training plan. No plans to ever run a full marathon, but I can see myself trying to get new PBs at future races\n\nFor a very long time my progression was through the stages of grief, and right around anger is when I'd go out and run.  I'd hit bargaining somewhere in the first mile, depression before the second, and if I was very, very lucky, I'd hit acceptance before backsliding into contempt.  I would repeat this three times a week.\n\nDuring the pandemic, any of the things I might have done upon leaving the house were off the table, and I had a powerful need to do something outside of there.  I'd progress through the same cycle as before, but now...now it wasn't as if I had better choices.  Running was the least bad choice I could make.  That doesn't seem like much, but it was a start.  One day I'd opted for crummier choices first and I when sufficiently...dissociated from corporeal concerns I realized that the abject misery that was running was a whole lot of different bits of information.  To make a long story short, this was how I learned to use the information my body was giving to make running suck less.  And the less I made it suck, the further and faster I could go.  There was no real rhyme or reason to it.\n\nBut then I had other options and I picked up an injury and so didn't run for more than a year.  Life changed, the injury healed, and I decided to get back to it.  Now I'd been physically able to for months at least, but I'd been gun shy about it.  It'd taken a lifetime to figure out how to not be miserable for every god damn step of every run, and I was so worried I'd lost whatever bit of magic had made it possible that I didn't want to find out.  So I went on that first run and it hurt, but not the way they usually had.  I couldn't get enough air, my calves were filing grievances with congress, and my knees had opinions that could only be expressed in a string of curses that require more languages than I speak.  But I could work with that, and so I did.\n\nA few weeks in and I decided I might as well shoot for 5k.  That'd always been about my limit before, and I'd done it once.  It took time, but one day I realized that I'd gotten at least one 5k under my belt a week for a few months.  That run always sucked by the end, but I *knew* I could do it.  I might feel like shit but I could still do it.  So why not 10k?  Again it took some time, but now I know I can do that.  A part of me wants to aim for a half marathon.  I did a full one a lifetime ago after all, and I can run further and faster now than back then.  So why not?\n\nI suppose because of *time*.  As it stands running is already in competition for much of my recreational time and I'm only putting in 3 or 4 hours a week.  If I was able to reliably put away half marathons I'd probably have to double that and I'm not sure I want to spend that kind of time one it, particularly since I've learned that having my long run on the only day I have fully free for that kind of thing tends to cut into any other plans I've got.  Yeah, I can run 10k and then go to a ren faire and I also know that if I do that, a lot of the fun of a ren faire is lost.  I'm not sure compounding that is worth it.\n\nSo I guess I'll hang out at 10k for a while yet.  See if whatever strange madness allows me to enjoy almost half the hours I run any given week can be stretch long enough to make doubling the painful hours seem worth it.\n\nI started running to challenge myself.  Eventually, if you want to keep being challenged, you either have to up the pace or the distance.  The first thought is, “can I run that far?”  Then when you find out you can run that far, the question becomes, “How quick can I run it?”\n\nBut people start running for all different reasons.  Maybe it’s just exercise to you.  If that’s the case you will probably be good with just keeping a routine for as long as it lasts for.\n\nTypically in most running programs, you do a long run on the weekend.\n\n\nI started 4 years ago and ran a 5k on Saturday.  The next Saturday I wondered if I could do 6.  The next was 7.  I promised myself I would add 1km to my long run for as long as I could.  \n\n\nWhen I got to around 14km I said to myself, \"this has got to be half marathon territory\".  I looked up some plans, decided to go for the full thing and ran my first full marathon within 5 months (would not recommend, I needed way more time).  I currently run ultras and I'm training for a full ironman next year.\n\n\nThe point of all of this is that slow increments and consistency will get you anywhere you want to go.\n\nIs there a certain distance where you feel you need to start bringing water/food on runs?\n\nWhen I started out I brought way too much water (ran with a CamelBak).\n\n\nToday I run with a Kiprun belt that can hold two hydro flasks (250ml each).  I will take water water on runs of 60min or more and food on runs of over 90min.\n\n\nMuch of what you need in terms of water and food can be dealt with by eating and drinking properly prior to running.\n\nMeh depends on the person my goal is to be able to do a casual marathon before breakfast on Sunday if I feel like it….\n\nrinse label roll insurance tie hat engine screw memory smell\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nEventually you’ll find the distance you love. For many that’s the half marathon or marathon, but some also specialize in 5k or 10k, or even shorter distances. Lots of factors contribute. Me personally, I like 50k mountain runs so all my training is based around that.\n\nA friend of mine is an internationally known scientist with very little time to train. He specializes in the 5k because he believes he can hit the full spectrum of energy systems and stay in shape in a time-efficient way. The dude is king of over locked and just likes to go fast.\n\nYou do you.\n\nI trained for my first marathon in just a bit over three months as a casual runner. It wasn’t pretty but I finished. Lots of solid training programs online. Very doable with your current progress. Go for it bro! Very rewarding\n\nMy progression has been slow, generally just increasing how long I can run in one session, sometimes trying to go faster. The next goal is to run half a marathon length but it's probably a way off because I don't do many Ks and have changed my schedule. After that my goal might be to do more weekly Ks or try to increase speed for shorter distances.\n\nWe all have different reasons for running. Find yours and make that the focus. Mine is just to stay fit as I age and allows me a bit more calories a day lol.\n\nIf you can run a 10k you can do a half marathon. Try one this weekend.\n\nProgression is good but it isn’t the end all be all. At some point, life gets in the way or you’ve peaked at a certain age which means you can’t feasibly improve in terms of speed/distance to surpass your former best. \n\nI’m 22 and have been running for 1.5yrs~ to lose weight and lead a healthier life. Granted I have no more weight to lose but running is an enjoyment on its own, whether treadmill or outdoors. Furthermore, my academics have only improved after picking up running as an economics major. \n\nIn terms of progression, I’ve peaked at a sub 19 5k/sub 40 10k/sub 1:30 21.1K and ran a 42.2k on my 365th day of running. Im quite happy with it already, I don’t pursue progression specifically now, but if it comes naturally, I welcome it. I still do 1 day of intervals, 1 long run, 1 medium long run and 3 easy runs weekly regardless. \n\nI found running able to clear my mind, focus on my tasks through discipline (let’s be honest it isn’t easy lacing up those shoes, the inertia is always there) to follow through running 60-70km/week (40-45mpw) and being able to eat more food? Sign me up. \n\nI was formerly obese, I love food but after losing 37kg, I’ve controlled my appetite but still love good food. And tbh 1,850kcals BMR without exercising is pathetic, I walk 7,500 steps per day, with a weekly 3hr tennis session on top of my runs. Being a butter burner feels good!\n\nI made it a daily habit. I can't breath without running.  So I say consistency.\n\nProgression is entirely up to you, your lifestyle and your goals.\n\nI got back into running with parkruns and ran just once a week alongside other training. That was for about 2 years due to life commitments at the time. In 2023 I did a few obstacke courses races which I loved and a 15k adventure race in August. Once I had 15k done I said i'd try a half but only got that done in August this year with commitments.\n\nContrast that a young fella I met recently who only started running a few months ago to help him stop smoking. He's doing a half within 6 months of starting and runs 4 times a week but doesnt do other training.\n\nNeither paths of a eunning career are wrong or right but they are both right for each if us of that makes sense.\n\nWas a chubby kid, fat young adult, walked the mandatory mile at school. Lost a ton of weight, in my late 20s, decided to try running to see if I'd like it better. Been running on and off for the last ~15 years. I got back in to it during COVID (wow, novel, I know), and then again was doing it on-and-off as my mom passed in 2021 and that hurt my training routine pretty bad. Last year my sister said she was doing a half marathon in a few months and I said \"ok yeah I'll do that why not,\" trained up for it, did okayish. I'd never run in a race before in my life, not even a 5K, I'm mostly a solitary runner. Just some music/podcasts/book and running downtime feels great. Race itself was enjoyable, the family/friends time was the best part of it for me. Somehow, though, I'm doing another half in a month. I found the training schedule itself to be super helpful for keeping me consistent and giving me a goal to work towards. I don't see myself doing anything past a half at present, but then again, my sister has hinted at wanting to do a marathon by the time she's 40. As an older brother I feel like I can't let her get away with this alone. :)\n\nAnyway, so much to say, I got into running as a trial balloon fitness activity, it really clicked for me, I think at this point I'm just running as much as it feels good to run. Love the hour or so runs I do on shorter days the most because it's not too little or too much, so that bit over 10k (I am not fast :)) is my sweet spot at present, but I think that might go up, or maybe down, as things in my life change. The point is to be enjoying it, I think, more than anything else.\n\nFor me signing up for races keeps me motivated and makes me stick to my training plan. And I notice that the feeling of beeing at such great fitness and having a running routine makes me feel more balanced.\n\nWhen I ran a half marathon, I just googled couch  to half marathon training plan and followed it weekly. It was for several weeks. Then did that and thought well, might as well go for a full. Followed another googled plan and it worked! Just make sure you stick to it and listen to your body.\n\nI’ve done a half but I don’t know if I ever really wanna do a full…. Or even do another half again at that.\n\nFor me, I started my running journey training for a half. But after that was done and in the past, I started focusing more on watching my speed increase/challenging myself to see how many miles I could do in X amount of time… and just staying consistent.\n\nI’ve never been a crazy fast runner so it’s just proving myself to myself!\n\nI don’t think distance is the marker for success/ability - a really quick 5k runner may show no interest in even trying a 10k but that wouldn’t make them less of a runner. I’d keep your training specific to the type of running you’re doing and if you want to change things up, you can! After all, you can always change back later 🙂\n\nIt’s a very personal thing. \n\nI started in November last year. My first run was 4km at 7:34/km pace, and I was stiff as a board the day after. \n\nFast forward 5 months, did my first mara in 3:39 and absolutely LOVED IT. Event days are truly something else. The atmosphere, the help on course, I loved every minute. \n\nNow I’ve done an 18:55 5k, 38:44 10k, 1:27 HM and should be right for 3:10 in my next mara in 7 weeks time. I’m currently sitting on 105km a week. \n\nI have an all consuming addiction for the sport now, and run 7 days a week. I’ve never been fitter or faster and I’m middle aged. \n\nI think my favourite distance would be the marathon, as the emotions you feel toward the end are truly something else. Having said that, it’s a big commitment in terms of training, fuelling etc so I can see why many prefer the half.\n\nI’ve been running for 24 years and still finding ways to improve and get faster. Changing your training programme every couple of years is key. Increasing the frequency of training also helped me a lot.\n\nI started maybe...7 years ago, and for a couple of years only ran 5ks and nothing else, and after a bit of moving around for work I decided I want to try lots of social run groups, and definitely trail social run groups as my wife and I liked hiking, and I thought maybe I'd like running and hiking in one activity. Definitely was good to do this, you meet so many people with different takes on running, and you learn so much about what running can mean to you. There is no peak, not really, but generally as you get stronger you might find you wanting to challenge yourself. So trying a half marathon and maybe eventually a full marathon are...good milestones to strive for, I guess? If you want to. If you can run 10k fairly comfortably you can run 21k, and you definitely do gain a sense of accomplishment and pride being able to run those distances, as well as just becoming a healthier and stronger person. So yeah, it's about seeing what you want out of running. \n\nAlso for the record I STARTED running at 27 so yeah, age is just a number.\n\n31F I've been running on and off when I was younger, last year I had another urge to get back to running after a few years break and so far it's been the best stretch of my running journey so far although I did get injured a few times (guilty if not stretching so that's on me).\n\nI think I never stuck with running for long before because I wanted to do too much too soon and was getting frustrated with no progress. \n\nThis time around I check my progress about monthly making sure that at least one of the general goals I have is achieved: longest run, fastest 5/10k, improved overall pace. Improving any of those is a progress, and giving myself some flexibility helps to avoid frustration on weeks where I wouldn't be able to smash my personal bests etc\n\nI feel like this gives me a more realistic and achievable goal while being quite flexible. If life gets busy and I need to cut back on time I spend out running I can do more speed work. If I'm feeling meh and want to do chilled runs most of the times I take it easy but run for as long as possible.\n\nI restarted my running journey last year at the age of 42. For the first time in my life I enjoy running - I‘m actually obsessed with it. I follow a training plan and I found out that I love long distance running. That‘s why I signed up for a half marathon last year and will do my first full marathon next year. \nI‘m not a fast runner but I have endurance and I can (and probably like to) torture myself. Maybe that‘s why I prefer the longer distances… 😅 \nI think it depends on what you prefer/are good at. 5K/10K races are very demanding too.\n\nI run 5k mostly, sometimes 10, definitely not more. The longer distances are too boring for me.\n\nPut one foot in front of the other. Repeat.\n\nI’m on the end of progressing at age 69 and a spinal surgery this year. I can still run a little but long races are over. But, my message to you younger folks is to make goals! That’s how you progress. I started running late in life at age 54 after losing 110 pounds. I made goals. I completed a goal of running an official race in all 50 states last April. So, to progress as a runner, you need goals. And one more thing….it has to be fun! Good luck!\n\nIt’s different for everyone, and it depends what you want to get out of it. For the longest time I was happy with 10K max, but then I got curious about trying a half. I’m attempting a marathon at the moment but it remains to be seen whether that’ll be a one and done or not. \n\nI know a lot of runners who have zero interest in a marathon.\n\nI bounce between 5k, 10k and half marathon distances. \n\nI pretty much only do races, there's typically some event of those distances on each week that's within driving distance of where I live. Doing any longer distance is going to require me to spend time training and that would take time away from lifting/recovering from lifting, which is my preferred exercise. \n\nFind what works for your lifestyle OP. I get that you feel you should always be progressing, but that doesn't mean constantly upping the distance to half marathon &gt; marathon &gt; ultra marathon... because where does it end? Instead focus on improving your time, perfecting your running form, add stuff in like elevation, maybe do a trail run or obstacle run or mud run. Plenty of ways to vary things up, add challenge and progression without just increasing distance.\n\n4k, 8k timetrials to a 15k race then halfs, full marathons and a couple of ultra's (Comrades) Now back to the shorter stuff 10s and halfs cause I don't have the time/ energy to do 100 plus km weeks.  Might get around to doing another  marathon at some point if I can summon the enthusiasm.\n\nI’d love to run a half or full. Farthest I’ve gone is 8 miles 2 years ago and I’ve been injured plagued ever since. Kinda wondering if I can even run that far\n\nI was running for years got board started pickleball. No regrets\n\nI think it’s mental. The first time I did a half marathon I had never run more than 6 miles ever. I run very slow so I had less risk of injuring myself and I did track / cross country in high school. But ultimately it wasn’t about training for me, it was the mental attitude that I could do it and then I did\n\nI agree with the sentiment of many here, consistency &gt; progression. For me, I ended up getting into marathon running each time a shorter race got easier (and I felt like I wanted to/was able to run farther). So it went from 5K to 10K, then half-marathon to full marathon. I run at a slower pace (10.30 minute miles). I've kept this pace the whole way through my running journey and increased my distance instead because I wanted to.\n\nDon’t forget that progress isn’t just improvement in pace/duration. One of the biggest points of progress I’ve noticed in myself is tolerance. A half-marathon distance run used to completely wipe me out for a few days. Now I regularly run that distance and more and feel totally fine!\n\nI started with a 5k and then went to a half marathon 3 months later and then a year later did my first full marathon. Every runner is different. I know runners who have run for years and have not done 26.2 . I think it depends on your goal. For some it’s speed and for others it’s distance\n\nOver the last couple years I've really found progression isn't for me, I don't enjoy it and it just ends up with me quite burned out or frustrated \nif I run my 5k at the same pace for rest of my life I'm not fussed, I'm here for the experience and vibes\n\nTotally up to you. I found I really absolutely love trail ultras. I also trained very hard with lots of speed work and whatnot for a road half marathon last year and really enjoyed that. I have very little interest in training for and racing other distances on roads, though. Some friends ask me every now and again when I'm going to do a road marathon, and tbh I really have no idea. Maybe as a bucket list item, but I don't have much interest in racing one, I like trails too much. Half marathon on road is perfect racing distance IMO, anything more on the road and I'm just not interested, and shorter distances just aren't really what I care to do.\n\nProgression is definitely personal. Personally, I ran track in college for distances of 1500m and 5000 on the track and I ran cross country too. After college many of my teammates moved up in race distance to marathons. I did not. We all ran at least a half marathon’s worth of distance weekly, so for our subculture completing that distance was never a question. But I’m someone who ran 90 mile weeks who never ran a marathon. I still run, but it doesn’t look or feel the same, only about 12 miles a week. I have zero desire to run a race ever again, but I still like to lace em up and step out the door for a jog. You would never know my background by looking at me and I don’t care at all. You can make running whatever you want. I would really suggest finding some local parks with good trails if you can. Running in nature is one of the things I miss most from my former life.\n\nI just saw all my friends doing half or full marathons and wanted to join in, so that's where my progression went. It took 7 months to go from a lifetime of being sedentary to running a half marathon, 7 months after did another half and now three months after that I am halfway through training for a full marathon.\n\nI'm gonna stop after that and just focus on daily 5ks to stay fit and mix other exercises into my routine.\n\nMy first race was a trail ultramarathon! Then I realised I didn’t like running alone for so long and it added nothing to my speed, so I trained for a few road races from 3k to half marathon &amp; found out 10k to be my favourite, with maybe a HM to finish off the year. \n\nProgress doesn’t have to be for distance, I personally find it a lot more impressive seeing someone run a 17 min 5k than a 4.5 hour marathon. \n\nBut I’d suggest trying a few distances and see which one you like the most, and especially what kind of training you like &amp; have time for\n\nAs has already been stated every runner's progression is their own. Some people love running 5k and don't do any longer, others live long distances and don't bother with shorter distances.\n\nAs I've gotten older and slower I have started enjoying the longer runs more. I can settle in to a comfortable pace plus honestly it often takes me 3 to 4 miles just to get into sync. This past weekend I ran a 12k and at mile 2 I felt like shit and was thinking \"you're just off any injury, no one will judge if you stop and walk\" by the half was point I felt great and at the end I was wanting to do more.\n\nYou do what you want to do. Setting goals like marathons is often used as a reason to train. A reason to get up and go for that run. At least that’s how it is for me. I’m in an “off season” at the moment and without a big race to train for I’m struggling with motivation. I know that come the new year I’ll start to focus and train again though.\n\nKeep running\n\nI ran casually maybe 15-20 miles a week. One day I decide I wanted to train for a marathon and started an 18-week plan. I think that’s probably the case for a lot of people? It’s not some sort of natural progression that happened out of nowhere; most people train with intent\n\nTwo reasons why ppl often do: 1) It takes time to grow your base mileage, and it's a lot easier to train and race a marathon if your mileage is higher.  2) It gets harder to PR short races as you get older, so a lot of serious runners increase their race distances as they get older (for example, many collegiate track athletes may turn to marathoning post college)\n\nI was never a runner. Ran in HS for football and baseball but nothing substantial. Then again in boot camp at Pendleton. Didn’t really enjoy it then either. Fast forward to two years ago. We sold two businesses and our home in the city and bought a 10 acre ranch. Started getting bored of retirement and decided to build a running/walking trail for the wife and I to enjoy with our grandchildren. I went from walking 3 miles every day to literally running 5-6 miles 5 days a week. It became a sense of accomplishment at 48. Right when I was starting to lose interest in goals or anything motivating I found that pushing myself a little farther every week is now my goal and driving force. I hope to run a 10k before the year is over just to prove to myself that I can still accomplish anything I set my mind to.\n\nDistance isn’t the only way to make progress. If that’s YOUR goal then that’s amazing!But many ppl stick to 5k and 10k and just focus on improving their pace :)\n\nYou could decide that you love the mile or 5k and spend the next 40 years finding the perfect score for you. Run what/when/where/and however much or little you want to.\n\nI personally find anything over 10K a bit tedious. I just get bored, I figure my ideal distance is about 8K and once a week a 10K and I’m just happy with it. No peer pressure!\n\nThe longer you run, the better you'll get\n\nGetting a fitness tracker and watching my distances go up and times go down is what changed me from a casual runner with no goals to an enthusiast. Once you start seeing progress for 6-12 months sign up for a half marathon and then a marathon. Just find one and sign up. You can find marathon plans on Strava and many other places and those help. I trained for about 9 months for my first marathon after already having gotten in shape for 6 months. That allowed me to ramp up and avoid injury as well as well cushioned shoes and not overtraining\n\nI run 4.35 miles on my favorite route every time I run.  Haven't run a race in 10 years and have no desire to.  I guess I progressed to inner joy and contentment over races with.... Lots and lots of people ... Gross.\n\ni am running ultras now at 37 after running the last 17 years of my life. my first half marathon was a decade ago, my first marathon 6 years ago, and i've participated in 3 ultras in the last 2 years. i'm in between training but about to begin again with ambitious goals on speed, diet, and distance. i run for fun, but running distance is what is fun to me so gaining a quicker pace and leaner body has become goals for me."

I weight lifted casually twice a week and hit 10k steps when I would work my part time job, no moderate-high intensity aerobic exercise experience. I randomly signed up for this race in December, and just knew I wanted to commit to it hard. I was bored with lifting and wanted to challenge myself to something new (and wanted to see the newbie gains again) I started not being able to run a mile straight in late November of 2023. In december, I started doing some infrequent runs of 1.5-2 miles each and by the end of december, I was finally able to run a mile in at about 12:30 pace. I prioritized getting good sleep every night and not drinking through the entire training block. I also strength trained mostly legs once a week and core+yoga once a week. By the end of January I saw massive improvement, getting my 5k time down from 43 to 38 minutes and my mile time down to a 9:30. I trained mostly with a friend. My mpw ranged from 12-15 in January. In the beginning of February, I was starting to enjoy running more as we had some warmer temps in minnesota. I also ran with my cousin who was a long time runner on vacation in florida. She helped pace me to an amazing 6 mile run, at a length and pace that I didn’t even know was possible at the time (11:30 average pace). My mpw ranged from 15-18 during february with a down week every 3 weeks. I mostly kept to easy running, with interval/tempo/fartlek work once a week and a long run on Saturday. I ran 4 times a week. In march I hit a 10 mile long run and a 33 minute 5k. I started setting my eyes on a sub 30 minute 5k. I never did a 10k race pace but my tempo 10k was 1:13. My mpw in march ranged from 19-21. In April, I did a “practice” 10 mile run at tempo pace of 11:15 min/mile with an average HR of 165. I was feeling locked in. Shortly after I also ran a 5k PR of 29 minutes and 7 seconds which I was so happy about. I had my last 10 mile long run two weeks out for race day at an easy pace. I then started tapering and relaxing for the race. I played kickball and capture the flag (involving a lot of sprinting) two days before the race, which probably didn’t help.\n\n\nPre race: I got 8 hours of sleep and woke up 2.5 hours before the race (not used to waking up at 5am but felt awake), ate my usual meal of whole wheat bread toasted with PB and honey and banana. I stretched, did my hair, and took a shit. We left later than I would have liked at 6:40 and got there at 7:10. It being my first half marathon, I gravely misjudged how long it would take to get ready and go to the bathroom before the race (really long lines). I ended up being late to the start and not having time to warm up (except with running to and from the bathroom)\n\n\nRace: I started out fast at my high tempo pace of 10:00 flat because I wanted to catch and run with a pace group. I took 5 gels (one at the start then one every 30 minutes) and drank a total of 18oz of water. I quickly caught the 11:27 pace group which was my first time goal. We were going down a consistent downhill so I decided to get an ahead of them in anticipation of the overall 530 elevation gain later on. I realized I was going faster than I planned, but I felt so good! I eventually caught the 10:41 pace group that I sat with until mile 8. It was still comfortably hard. I was nervous looking at my watch that said I was running consistently at 185bpm-195bpm but I was still able to keep the same pace, so I just kept going and I WAS COOKING. I’d never done such a long run at this high effort before but the race vibes were hyping me up. The temperature was perfect and the scenery through a huge park and around a big lake was so pretty. My pace was holding steady until mile 11 (steadily got faster from mile 8 seperating ahead of the 10:41 group) when there was a big .5 mile hill. I slowed down a little, but was still able to speed up for the last mile of the race. Those last two miles was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done physically, pushing my HR to around its max at 205bpm. I was so amazed that I was able to run this fast (at a pace I would do for only 4 mile tempo runs at a time). I even had the energy to sprint to the finish at the end with my family and friends cheering me on.\n\n\nPost race: I was so amazed and also gassed at the end of the race, PRing my 10k, 10 mile, and of course half marathon and getting my 3rd fastest time in the 5k and 2 mile. I stretched and walked while waiting for my friend to finish. I drank 60oz of water (half included electrolytes) About two and a half hours after I finished, I ate a large impossible burger and hash browns. I ate a lot because I thought I’d be hungry and need to fuel, but it actually gave me a huge stomach ache to the point where I felt like I would throw up. I didn’t though and overall felt amazing about my first race and running in general. I spent a lot of time reflecting on my progress and the race. It was an amazing experience and I can’t wait to do more!",

    "all_comment_text": "Congratulations on completing your first half marathon.\n\nThat is an OUTSTANDING time for your first half marathon! Congratulations! My half in Vegas in February was one of my favorite experiences ever… topped off with an In n Out double double with fries, both Animal Style. And a shake. Those things never appear in my diet anymore haha. \n\nHaving said that, the first thing you put into your body after crossing the finish line is critical. They throw all of this stuff at you (hopefully) but it typically includes alcohol. For the love of God, do not do that. Your body will be craving some of nutritional value; when the awesome volunteers offer you a banana, I always ask for two (to have one later or first thing next morning if it’s a night race). Water, some electrolytes, potassium… and you definitely did the right thing continuing to move/walk/stretch.\n\nI hope you felt a great sense of accomplishment and self-worth. It’s a daunting first time task but hopefully you’ve been bitten by the bug and want to continue doing these races! The running community is pretty great. Onto the next one :)\n\nThank you for the kind words! Yes those shakes are DEVIOUS for the stomach.\n\nThat’s a great accomplishment!   Congratulations!   I always celebrate with a ridiculously large piece of cake on the night of the race.  I hope you did something similar to mark the occasion!\n\nThank you! For me, its gotta be apple crisp and ice cream.\n\nSo in 7 months you went from not being able to run a mile to a half marathon? Impressive.\n\nHere I am having been running again for over a year and just now getting to 4 mile sessions. Jesus I’m slacking apparently\n\nThank you! Once I get my mind locked into something, make a plan, and see myself improving it becomes a little bit of an obsession for me....\n\nTaking a shit is very important…congrats on the strong finish! 💩💪\n\nCongrats! I just did my first half a few weeks ago. It was one of the most challenging and rewarding things I have ever done.\n\nCongratulations! I was super scared reading that you were started out the race super fast but I’m glad you finished strong! Super cool post and I’m inspired by you friend.\n\nYeah, after running my second half, its crazy how much more capable I am during races than I think I am based on training. Now I feel like I like starting out more aggressive instead of playing catch up later!\n\nI ran this same race! Congrats.\n\nEdit: first half marathon for me. Ran it just under 1:49.\n\nwoahhh thats crazy! it was a beautiful day.\n\nAmazing and inspiring\n\nThank you! Just ran my second one. I think I'm hooked.\n\nGreat job!! That’s an awesome time, keep it up!\n\nGreat write up and congrats on the race! I am in the very same boat as you! Weight fitting consistently for a long time and I am trying running for the challenge of it!\n\nIts so novel, it somehow works? I think I'll keep the winter for focusing on weight lifting, then go into another running block. Might be the reason I haven't gotten injured yet despite going from 0 to 850 miles ran so far this year!\n\nWhere is Maple Grove? What city? Or what state? Or what country? Congrats on your accomplishment!\n\nMinnesota, per OP\n\nWait, you haven't heard of the restaurant capital of Minnesota?! /s\n\nThis is so late but why is it called that?\n\nBecause their tourist org decided it was: https://experiencemaplegrove.com/dine/"

    "title": "Being a runner in a small town",
    "body": "I have begun my running journey in December 2023. I am 26F and live in a rural county in NC with many back country roads to run on. I go on many of my runs alone near my house and I do not have anyone I regularly run with. I’ve checked Strava and Facebook for nearby running clubs which have turned up nothing. Though I don’t mind a running alone for the most part, I can’t help but envy those who have easy access to running clubs/communities in more urbanized areas. Anyone in the same boat? How have you made connections with other runners if you are someone living in a rural town/county?",

    "all_comment_text": "Here's what I did. Check or make Strava segments on runs you like (make sure the segments are not too long or too short, of course - you can delete segments you create if you want but note that newly created segments take a day or two before old runs are added to them). Then look at who's recently run on the top ten list (note that you can check women and men separately, do so, so that you get ten of each, unless you pay then you can see a longer list) for the segment and who is the \"local legend\". Give those runners kudos on a recent run and, if they kudo you back, you can probably follow them. After following for a week or two (so you've kudo'd five to ten runs of each others), find ones whose running is similar to yours and comment on their post that you'd like to meet up some time.\n\nThis is the way I’ve done this many times. I feel a little stalkerish but it really works.\n\nThat’s what I was thinking, but I think I will go this route\n\nI was just thinking - make a little trap, then gently stalk?!  Then - \nAhh, that’s how to use strava!  \n\nI’ve made running friends doing exactly this!\n\n*The playbook*\n\nI understood that reference\n\nI would never install Strava if I was a female for those reasons.\n\nFair enough. Strava is explicit about its goal of serving as social media for bikers/runners.\n\nThere are privacy options to disable this though.\n\nExcellent advice!\n\nThis is absolutely the best way to even meet running friends on vacation. I have a few across the country now and will run when ever I travel\n\nCouldn't agree more! As much as I enjoy running solo, having running friends are the best!\n\nI tried this around my area, but out in the country my fiance and me are the only ones that use Strava (or run on the roads, I think)\n\nI did find one cyclist that rode down our road like a decade ago and that was exciting lol\n\nThis is a great idea, I’m definitely doing this\n\n[removed]\n\n100% it's like my meditation.\n\nSo much so that, just like in meditation, if you get distracted the autopilot takes over and you either run too fast or too slow\n\nTons of studies have proven that repetitive right-left motions are healing, and help your brain process thoughts/memories/events.\n\nIe, REM sleep--right-left motion of your eyeballs is tour brain triggering each side over and over to sort through things.\n\nButterfly pats--right-left pats performed by people trying to calm down from panic, anxiety, or a traumatic event.\n\nEMDR -- therapy using right-left motions to stimulate each side of your brain as a therapist walks you through past events and traumas, and helps you process them.\n\nAaaand running? Right-left‐right-left-right-left. For an hour or two or three at a time.\n\nThis makes me want to try hopping on one foot for an hour or two or three. Pretty sure it won't be as nice as right-lefting it.\n\nI do a big trade show every year and they always have a 5K fun run....which I never participate in \n\nRunning is for me and me alone\n\nSometimes it’s really nice but sometimes I’m tired of being my own hype man; I wanna be able to complain about running one time and for someone to yell at me and hype it up\n\nI totally agree and usually run alone, but for women it’s not as safe. I definitely can’t lose awareness of my surroundings. Running with a good partner is quite peaceful because I can let down my guard.\n\nThat inner peace is never a waste of energy\n\nAgree\n\nI've been in small, rural areas since I started running 11 years ago and even more so since I moved where I am now (out in the boonies) about 8 years ago.  I do 95% of my runs alone.  I've just kind of got used to it.  I've recently joined a running group in the city where I work so I do get a group run in typically every other week.  It's nice getting some interaction, but the downside is that I can't usually do my planned workout/run.   I get my main interactions online, here and on FB with that trail group.\n\nThe upside to the rural running though is never having to worry about cars (usually) where I run. I have a better chance of getting run over by a cow or tractor, and I can usually outrun the tractors.\n\nYour username makes me think you live in NC. I live in Boone NC. Im an old ling distance runner. Just lost some weight so i may try to get back. It does make a difference when you have like minded running friends nearby! Good luck! Maybe join the closest running club. Travel to run with them once in a while...then invite them to your area for a run!\n\nUsed to live there.  Grew up in Hillsborough and then moved to Rocky Mount later where I graduated high school.  Now I am in very, very rural Kansas where our county has one stop light.  One.\n\nOh my gosh! A lot of people run with a dog! Thank you for the info! I really wish you the best! Good luck!!\n\nHi, hometown!\n\nRunner in NC?\n\nI'm in Los Angeles now, but I remember those days!\n\nI've never been able to out run a tractor :(\n\nI live on a big city and always run alone, I'm not interested in races, for me this sport is a lonely one.\n\nThat is where we find peace. Most of the time I'm running away from other humans. To the deep trails\n\nRunning is my hour, maybe two, of alone Me Time.\n\nSame. Sometimes I just want to go outside and run. Don't want to be pressured to start and stop at a certain time, or beat a particular pace. Also, going inside your home afterwards and not driving all sweaty is kinda nice. Sometimes you're just not in the mood to run, racing I feel like you're forced to get into the mood which for some people is ok but not for me.\n\nExactly THE OPPOSITE of what OP is asking. Thanks.\n\nSame. I’m a selfish runner — I want to run my own pace/distance and I want the options to change any of that up at any time. \n\nBut living in a major city, I’m never truly alone.\n\nI need to run my own pace and distance.  I’m older and my running ability varies from day to day.\n\nThis is 100% me, and I’m happy with it! 🐌\n\nI’m happy that I can run at all.\n\nRunning solo is the best\n\nAmen to that. Boss to yourself. \n\nI live in a metropolitan area with plenty of access to run clubs and I still don't. I think the thought of it is more romantic than the reality.\n\nI think it depends on self motivation. I think people who find themselves unable to get out the door consistently could benefit from the idea a third party is holding them accountable.\n\nOh for sure. I definitely fall into that category when it comes to strength training. Even if I'm not working out \"with\" other people just having others present holds me accountable.\n\nSame - I see IG reels of running clubs having fun and it seems like a blast, but they have a schedule and certain paces that doesn't align with what I'm doing, so solo running it is!\n\nTrue, and most of them are night runs... personally, I like running in the morning\n\nFellow rural NC runner here just saying hello. Hello!\n\nGirlfriend of a runner here — he is cursing the day I made him move to NC because my town hasn’t yet figured out that people like sidewalks. :/\n\nMy brain mashed the first couple words of your reply together and read it as “Feral runner,” and that’s my new goal title now.\n\nI’m starting to look pretty feral in this heat\n\nHello :)\n\nGo to road races. I grew up in a small town. live in a larger area, but I still find this is a great way to meet other runners. You'll know who runs your pace based on who finishes close to you. After you have finished, its super easy and natural to strike up a conversation with someone who finished close to you to tell them good job, or ask what they are training for next. \n\nIn small town road races, nearly everyone is from the surrounding area so you'll probably be within driving distance to meet up for a run sometime.\n\nAgree! I like to run alone day to day. But I like the feeling of belonging, and seeing my runner friends at races. Then you connect with them on social media and stuff, seeing their little victories, and it makes you feel connected even though you might run alone a lot.\n\nThis is the way! Also it is a good way to discover clubs in the area, almost none of them are Strava clubs. \n\n\n I live in a small town in Europe (population 2500) and the local running club has about 30 members plus a bunch of people that often go running with some of them. Same for neighbor towns. \n\n\n I often cross paths with people that I didn't know, so after nodding them a few times it is just natural to start a conversation when you come across around the village.\n\n\nI do prefer to run alone, but it's good to feel you belong and to have colleagues to char about running or to encourage each other.\n\nI kind of like running alone. It’s peaceful and the cadence helps keep me in a focused and relaxed mental state. I do live where the suburbs meet rural, so it’s nice having a choice. There are quite a few runners in my neighborhood I’ve thought about approaching but I’m new to that subject too. I’ve always wondered if female runners carry protection with them when running alone. Every run either in the city, suburban, or rural I have protection even being a middle aged male.\n\nThe one upside of me living in a small town is that I don’t have the burden of feeling unsafe. I live in a town where nothing really happens and it is generally free of crime, but that may be naïve of me to think so I will consider carrying around some sort of protection.\n\nMollie Tibbetts lived in a small town and she was murdered during a jog. Please be careful when running by yourself, OP. I sometimes run by myself but I try to stay aware of my surroundings and I’m always in public places with lots of traffic and other people walking and biking around. Not trying to be a buzzkill. I just listen to too many true crime podcasts.\n\nI’m not sure why this got downvoted. It’s the truth. Who would’ve thought someone would get kidnapped and murdered in Brooklyn, IA. This wasn’t a one-off either. It happens everywhere, even to men. Chris Lane in Oklahoma was shot and killed while running.\n\nI second this comment.  Unfortunately, some people prey on women, and female runners are vulnerable targets.  As a dad of a female runner, I always try to keep a watchful eye for them since i run at night to avoid the heat.  Don’t live in fear, just be aware and have a plan.\n\nI’m rural-ish NC. I live about 10 minutes north of downtown Asheville. During the week I typically run alone in neighborhood. I go to a Greenway at the French Broad River for my long runs on the weekends and even though I’m running “alone” I kind of feel part of the local running community even if it is just nods as we pass each other,\n\nLove Asheville! Yes, I appreciate a good nod from a fellow runner\n\nHere’s a trick for rural runners! When you see a delivery truck, make sure you follow it to someone’s house. Wait to see if they’re dropping off a Running Warehouse package or some other running brand at someone’s house. \n\nIt’s usually safer to wait until it’s dark out, because you’re gonna need to look in their window to watch them. If they immediately unpackage the shoes to try them on and then do that run in place thing to “test” them out, congratulations! You found another rural runner!\n\nNow just wait outside their house. When they go out for a run, come jogging around the corner and wave. BUT continue running. You don’t want to come off as desperate. Repeat this maneuver for 4 or 5 of their runs until they get comfortable with you, then ask them if they want to run with you. \n\nIf a bigger group is desired, repeat all steps above for as many people as you need. Good luck!\n\nThis is how I met my current girlfriend and her husband! He's really slow so it's just a matter of time until he's out of the picture.\n\nI love this community\n\nThis is hilarious!\n\nI’ve tried running clubs and find I run better with a significant other or by myself. I prefer having my alone time and then sharing achievements or stories with an online community or with my friends who don’t run because then they’re always impressed.\n\nImpressing others definitely is a plus\n\nFellow female rural NC runner here as well! It's the dogs that bug me on the back roads!\n\nFor me it’s the bears 😆\n\nDefinitely!  I've learned which routes and houses to avoid for both the aggressive dogs and the very friendly dogs that won't go home.\n\nAre there any local races? Pretty much every town has at least one 5K at some point during the year. And if not yours then maybe a larger neighboring town. Running races (and volunteering at races!) is a great way to meet people.\n\nSpend a week or so running on the track near the school. That’s how we always found our small town running buddies in rural Texas! 😂\n\nLove this idea\n\nI like running because I don't like other people. Same with gaming.  \nI'm only half kidding.\n\nI understand😂\n\nI live in NYC and run alone.  But there’s always so many other runners on the road that I feel like I’m part of the community.\n\nDo you have a running or sports store nearby? Some clubs meet there and/or the store will know of groups that organize regular or semi regular runs.\n\nLike 2 hours away. But this is good to keep in mind!\n\nI don't have connections through other runners face to face but I have a lovely Strava community. I also have a lovely bunch of friends mostly older who are dog walking etc that I see daily. This is lovely. One gentleman high fives me seeing as he knows o was in chemo this time last year. \n\nDo you have facebook? When I lived in a more rural area, I found that a bunch of runners made a running group for my county. They would schedule runs at different places and even set up carpools to get to nearby trails and races. It was pretty cool. I hate facebook but things like that make it impossible for me to fully quit it lol.\n\nI moved to Atlanta about a year ago and was so excited about being able to run with clubs. I have done it exactly twice, lol. Most clubs run at like 6:30pm and I'm a morning runner, so it just doesn't work out. Even when I run after work, I definitely don't wait until 6:30 since that means I'm eating dinner at like 8pm and it messes with my sleep schedule. I'm logistically challenged I guess.\n\nYeah finding running groups rural areas is hard. My wife and I helped start a group in our small town but it fizzled. There just were not enough people to maintain. I’m just getting into Strava and there’s not much going on.\n\nIt’s kinda tough out here\n\nOn the other hand I hate running in the city because of all the intersections and traffic lights and stuff 😠\n\nI live in the countryside as well.\n\nI buckle up with my dogs and run with the pack.\n\nI train my dogs in bikejoring and will someday add skijoring as well\n\nNo phone, no internet, no kids, no pets, no cars or bikes at the local park I go to - just me and my music. Like others said, it’s like a prescription for me - alone time! Especially if u have a very interactive job with many people all the time as a sales rep like me.\nIt works!!\n\nI'm in the same boat, however I prefer running alone. How close are you to an urban area? I'm about 40 min away from a city and there are plenty of races and such I could join if I wanted to. If you're close enough attend a few and you may find people who live close to you. Also have you posted in local community groups? Could be another option to find a running pal\n\n2 hours away from the nearest city unfortunately. Good idea to post in a local community group! Thanks!\n\nI live outside Raleigh and recently just started running &amp; i find that it’s more motivating to run with a club. I’ve had to drive a bit to the meetups but they exist! The one I’m in is @/urbanrunclubraleigh on instagram &amp; if you join the raleigh sub I’ve seen some ppl post about run groups there as well. :)\n\nFellow rural county NC runner here (NE NC near the Va border). I have checked on Strava, Facebook, and nothing. I don't use Strava to track my runs, I use the Adidas running app and nothing there either. I run the same area all the time, and there are a people there I see everytime I run, but they are walkers. I would love to have a community of runners to help push me a little, but for the most part I enjoy the hour or two I get to spend putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nI relate a lot! For my whole running career I’ve only ever run alone. There are a few running clubs I could technically get to, but they’re too far away to be practical, and it’s too hard to get away regularly at the times they meet, as an often-solo/working parent. I’ve tried starting running groups on Meetup and Facebook, but I got zero interest… Everyone wants to run closer to the city, I guess.\n\nSo I’m sorry, I don’t have any tips! But for myself, I guess I try to see any runners I pass on my trail as my running buddies and give them a smile, and use this subreddit as my source of running connection.\n\nI moved to a small town 6 months ago after living in a bigger city where I could run with people any time. I tried the Strava segments and nobody else was running them. I have just gotten used to running alone, I also invested in a treadmill so I wasn’t always out running alone.\n\nI recently moved from Western WA to rural AL. How do you feel safe running in the county roads? I haven’t really gone since being here because all the roads are like 55mph with no shoulder so I have felt unsafe and have a lot of concerns about getting hit by a car. Any advice? Are their certain types of roads you avoid?\n\nEven in the city (I was visiting my daughter in Bham a couple weeks ago) I was noticing a distinct lack of sidewalks/pedestrian spaces...\n\nThere’s definitely some places that lack it. In the city there were a lot of places that were missing sidewalks, however, I felt like generally they were slower roads and had a big shoulder or some gravel I could run on and feel a safe distance away. Here in AL it feels like everybody drives 60-70 and there’s no shoulders and I don’t trust people here as much to be attentive while driving :S\n\nCheck your local breweries if you have any. Also, running supply stores will definitely know. If none exist, work with a popular business and ask if they would be interested in you hosting one. Put out fliers. \n\nIf that’s not successful, take a day or two and travel to Upstate SC, there are plenty of groups there.\n\nAll the more reason to envy the Upstate... There seem to be several in the Low Country, too, but I've not had much luck around Lexington. \n\nFor OP: not sure what part of rural NC you're in, but I've come across many running groups when attending races/events in NC. Maybe you could reach out to one of the groups in your nearest urban/Metro area and they could direct you to something closer.\n\nRaces.  You have tons of time before and after the race to stand around doing nothing.  If you're comfortable walking up to a stranger and just starting a conversation you can't miss.\n\nI actually met two of my best friends at a race I put on.  I did 5 yearly 5K's to raise money for a park I was volunteering at.  These guys showed up to each race and I eventually started doing morning runs with both of them and we eventually became inseparable.  Even now when I'm the only one who still runs.  The one is injured the other has a newborn at home.  We still hang out a couple of times a month, we just don't run.\n\nMe!! My town is 1 sq mile and when I say I’ve ran every street 100 times I mean it lol 😂 I’ve made segments in town and found a couple other runners that way too.\n\nPut on your headphones and bump your fav tunes- I NEVER run w/ others- only my dogs and they’re a pain in the ass. Running is MY TIME and that’s the best part of my life. Problem solving comes naturally and the rush is exhilarating- but never did I want to attempt a conversation with someone when I can barely breathe myself :)\n\nMy small town had no running club when I was young. \n\nSomeone started one. This was about 20 years ago. Once they put out information slowly it started gaining members. There always has to be a first person to start a club! No one had much experience before but people learned. So give it a go! \n\nIt gave me a love of running as a young teen that I never lost.\n\nThis year our running club will have our first Olympian! She started in our club as a kid. She then went on to college and trained as an elite athlete. If the club never existed back then, then she may never have found running.\n\nI lived in a rural village for 6 months, and I was the only person running there. The only other person I saw running was when I was on the outskirts of the town over, and it was someone who lived there. The only connection we made is waving to each other once. I really enjoyed running solo and rarely running into people at all, different kind of feeling entirely.\n\nAnother option is to drive to the nearest town with an active club. They will usually have any number of regular group runs that you can join. My suggestion would be a weekend run at a local coffee shop. Most of the clubs have a FB, IG and/or Strava presence. We have new people show up all the time at ours.\n\nThe other post talking about the Strava segments is also a good idea.\n\nI used to be in the same boat, but I eventually moved. Even with a bunch of runners around, it can sometimes be difficult to find your match with proper pace, social compatibility, etc. I do enjoy the group runs though. You'll probably have more luck finding someone there.\n\nI don’t connect with people because I don’t like people.\n\nI am now in a bigger city but had been in a smaller town with no run club in sight. I would find my running community online but then on my actual runs would call my family and friends to catch up and chat. Before you know it your hour easy run has flown by. Its a great way to set aside time to stay in contact and it feels a lot less lonely when you're talking to a living person! (even if they aren't running with you)\n\nI'm in a medium-sized city with a newer run club rapidly gaining popularity. I've had friends and family members say variations on, 'oh, you should go run with that club in town!'\n\nBut honestly, running in a group (other than on race day) just isn't my speed. For me, this is a monastic activity. I'm happy to be out on my own!\n\nIf you are an adult and it's an option and you are looking for some kind of running community, check into being an assistant coach with the high school track and cross country teams.  \n\nBut also, I live in a city and have never been to a run club even though I follow a bunch of them in my area on Instagram.  Yeah, it might be fun, but part of what I like about running is that it doesn't take much planning to do.\n\nI live in a rural area that has a running club, but I still prefer to run alone. When you train in groups the faster people usually set the pace and the slower people run too fast trying to keep up.\n\nI would check with the closest running specialty stores, go to local races/fun runs, check meetup.com, and reach out to any local HS or college Track/Cross Country coaches to inquire about local running clubs and the like. If all else fails consider starting a walk/jog/run in your area via meetup.com which will cost a little money.\n\nBy being like. Extremely annoying lol I ask everyone I meet if they want to run.\n\nWill try this approach 😂\n\nIf you ask enough people yknow... somehow managed to get like a group of 10 to run a half w me? Now it's just going to be so embarrassing if I'm the worst\n\nI've used Strava segments to find new friends before.   Doesn't have to be clubs.\n\nWithout getting specific, what county are you in?\n\nIsn't this a broader problem of being young in a rural place?\n\nIf you already have a social circle, ask among them.  Maybe you're a member of an organization, school, or religious institution where you could try to meet other runners. Maybe try to run in nearby towns where you might encounter other runners.  Maybe try to \"convert\" friends from other endurance sports, like cyclists, into runners.\n\nI actually live in Caldwell County, not sure if you’re in the east or the west of the state though. I live in a small town, pretty close to downtown. I can’t find any groups in my town but there’s one in a larger town about 20 minutes away that I attend. I would recommend checking other social medias platforms since most runners are younger and probably not on Facebook. Also, if you’re comfortable with it, try starting one yourself! I know the lady who started the one I go to.\n\nFor people saying running alone is peaceful. Yeah true, but running with others or groups is a terrific way to push yourself to increase your pace and growth as a runner. That motivates most people. \n\nYour main option would be to travel to the closest running group, or start one yourself.\n\nBrainstorm idea: \nStart a weekly run at a close winery, pub, brewery etc.  \n\n\n\nGood luck!\n\nI feel you. I live in a tiny, rural town and very few people run as a hobby. One gal is a traveling nurse, so she’s constantly out of town. Another person works IT and has odd hours, so he runs during business hours. The other person likes to run alone. So I mostly run alone and have no one to talk running with 😂 I do appreciate how safe it is to run in my area and how my neighbors look after one another. Plus I have access to endless country roads and zero harassment from creepy assholes.\n\nI think I am in the completely opposite boat. I just came to enjoy running when I started living in a small village with plenty of forests for almost me alone. Running with people around is quite annoying…\n\nSame - I’m in Gaston County. I moved from DC and got a peloton for this reason. I’m scared I’ll get hit running here and I don’t always want to drive out to a park.\n\nI used to live in the middle of nowhere. Although it sucks to run alone, there are pros and cons, I miss the lack of traffic and beautiful scenery. If you go out on enough runs people will start to notice you. I was known as the marathon guy where I lived, but where I live now I'm more of just an obstacle in the road to drive around. Where I use to live there were few runners, but it meant more to see each other during our workouts too. Where I run know, other runners don't even acknowledge you existence when passing by, to each other own, just not what I'm accustomed to. \n\nI know it sucks to not have many local runners, but if you enjoy where you run it may be worth driving a bit and doing a meet up with a running club like once a week. I lived 45 minutes from a club that I would go to for group runs, but it was worth it to me because I lived running in the country setting. It was also easier if I coordinated with my commute to work.\n\nOur small town has a huge running community, maybe you can start one!\n\nI'm 44 and I've run alone most of my life. I do coach so it's nice that I can run with my kids sometimes. But my personal training is done alone. Podcasts are your friends! Lol listening to Armchair or something makes the time fly and you feel like you are a part of a conversation\n\nDownload tenjunkmiles podcast…. Running friends for people like you and me. I sometimes laugh so hard I pee a little.\n\nThey have a slack channel too so you can meet all the other people in the nation. It’s a really great bunch. Come check it out.\n\nJust started running, 55 year old male. Started serious exercise 2 years ago.\nHow do I train to run faster without getting gassed!\n\nThis is charlotte running club, they do meetups often\n\n[https://www.strava.com/clubs/50745](https://www.strava.com/clubs/50745)\n\nTo be fair, I live in a really urbanized area and barely ever run outside because there's so few running routes without a ton of interruptions. SO many crosswalks. I'd love to feel comfortable just walking out my door and running or even going somewhere less than 30 min away to run\n\nI love running alone. But I’m a man and I don’t think I’m ever in danger, not sure if that’s ever a concern of yours. But yeah I ran in the desert in California for my first couple months\n\nYou can start a run club. Make some flyers and post them along your running route.\n\nI live in a small town and prefer running alone. I suspect there is a running club in my town as I have seen them running together every Tuesday, but I’m never interested in joining. I have my own training plan and pace. Plus it’s a perfect meditation time. \n\nI would like to join an online community and share my achievements though. Also, in my town there are quite some runners and bikers, so it does feel like you are kinda in a local community, which is nice.\n\nWhere in NC? My sister in law is in SC (she’s an ultra trailer , kinda atm, just had a baby haha) and we’ll be moving down near the Asheville area next year. My wife and I both run. Get a puppy!\n\nYou’re not missing much. Running with other people is hard. Paces vary. If you are truly training for improvement there are very specific paces you should run relative to your lactate threshold and running with others can disrupt that. \n\nOP, look up Hash House Harriers in your area.\n\nI felt the same thing when I was training in Murphy NC where my dad lived. I did have a friend that would meet me at a nearby park and we’d complete some workouts together.\n\nI run alone mostly but have found a beautiful running community on Twitter with thousands of runners posting their daily miles, races, struggles, injuries, and support for others.  Join Twitter and only follow people with running in the bio.  You can find everyone quickly if you join \"Runchat\" on Twitter ..  follow everyone who follows that page, most will follow back.  See you there :)\n\nLiterally same, even the the state we have in common \n\nI travel alot for the sole reason of running in different places because my town is too small no where to run\n\nAll trail app is amazing for finding places to run 🏃🏽‍♂️\n\nI run with my dog. Recommend.\n\nIf I had a dog, I definitely would and probably wouldn’t have made this post😆\n\nI'm from the middle of nowhere in NC as well. It's hard finding good areas\n\nWhere is your nearest running shop or sport shop where people likely go to buy running shoes? Ask there.\n\nDo you have a local Facebook group? Ask there, and if nothing then ask if people are interested in starting a group\n\nDo any of your local schools have a running track? If yes find out who uses it outside school hours.\n\nLook at local race results - are any clubs listed?\n\nStart a parkrun, make your own community.\n\nMove to the UK - we have more running clubs than you can shake a stick at!\n\nSmall town runner here as well. Linking up with coworkers on Strava and remotely doing challenges with (versus?) each other has helped it feel a little more social.\n\nRunning with a group or other person is over rated. Alone you can run at your own pace, fart, burp or talk to yourself. I would suggest investing in a good pepper spray pistol. Google Kimber pepper spray.\n\nI live in a city. I'm friends with several runners; my best bud lives less than a mile away, and we ran Boston together. There's a run club that meets a mile and a half from my home, several other clubs besides. *My wife runs.*  \n\nI run by myself about 95% of the time.\n\nI always run alone (whenever I get time) from 3 to 5 in the morning, but during those time I encounter someone always running behind me, we don't talk at all but I guess he/she likes to give me some company every now and then, I tried to talk to him/her but whenever after completing my 20km run I stop and look behind he/she is never there till last, I guess he/she I not able to keep up w/ me 😂, btw I am 19M\n\nI live in a small town, do all of my running by myself.  I actually enjoy it, I can head out the door when I want and adjust schedule as needed.  Can run any pace or distance without worrying about what another person thinks.  So suits me.\n\nNot sure if anyone else mentioned this, but in our small town there was a pretty decent cross country team at the only high school in the county. They were always looking for parents or volunteers.  Generally, if the kids ran, their parents ran or the coaches were plugged into the local running culture.   That’s the closest we had to a running club, but we had a strong cross country and wrestling team since those sports didn’t need big money to support and both tend to require lots of mileage.\n\nPersonally never really cared for running with other people, but that’s just me. If I want to participate in a group running event I just sign up for a race nearby… doesn’t need to be in the same town.\n\nI’m in the same boat. I do see other runners out and about but I don’t really have anyone to actually run with. I asked someone from work if she wanted to run with me and she didn’t get back to me. Someone else where I used to work is also a good runner but I think she does most of her training with her club on a track and I’d probably hold her up, given the standard that she is.\nThe problem with running partners is that it’s very difficult to find someone who runs at the same pace as you as everyone is so different, different experience, different training goals and stages etc.\nRunning alone can be a great way to clear your head and get outside. The best thing to do is to appreciate the joys that it brings.\n\nYou can find running groups through Gleet Feet\n\nNC??\n\nNorth Carolina!"

At first I don't have any plans to start running, but since I got a daily suggested workout notifications all the time, I thought what the heck. I also tried Garmin's coach features and I follow them by heart. Despite its limitations, I would say that Garmin Coach, especially coach Dan was really helpful for a beginner runner like me. \n\n\n\nTraining as an overweight person, with little to none exercising experience was a pain. I got some injuries every time I tried to run more and more. I guess I over trained myself. Thankfully from the redditors in this subreddit, I found the myrtle routine which helped me alot, along with some visits to physiotherapists.  \n\n\n\n### Pre-race\n\nI am living an hour away from Stockholm, hence my friends and I arrived there 3 hours before our start time. It was really fun to see a lot of people coming in, with some expo going on. \n\nAs this is my first race, I thought to just wear my running clothes so that I don't need to change at the place. It was a bad idea. The day was hot, and I'm sweating like crazy before the start of the race. \n\nTwo hours before the start, we started to get into our running shoes and wait in the shades before leaving the race-pack to the organizers and start to wait in our starting group. As we are doing our first half marathon, we got the last group. It took us about half-an-hour to wait from the first time the elite group started running.\n\n\n\n### Race\n\nI have said to myself to start slow, as in 7:30 to 7:40, to keep my energy level high until after midway. But guess what, everyone was so quick that I unfortunately got carried away with it as well. My plan was to maintain my HR to be less than 170, but well, it got to 180+ real quick.... I was thinking to slow down, but I thought okay, I can still maintain my pace and I was not feeling that exhausted. Let's just go.....\n\n\n\nStockholm is rather hilly. I knew that from the start so I need to be smart enough to pace myself. The first hill was at the 3rd Kilometer. It was hot, hilly and the sun was at our face. Not gonna lie that it was a pain. I was so glad to finally reached the 1st water station,  and they were kind enough to provide us with some water shower, energy drinks and normal water station.\n\n\n\nKilometers 4 - 10 went by quite okay as we were battling the hills and some sun but as the day goes by, it got better as the temperature drops slowly. The thing is, I bought a drink gel when I was training, and I was trying several flavours. I didn't buy them again as I still have 1 left. BUT, it was something with caffeine, which I have never tried before. I never drink coffee as I have a weak stomach, hence have little to none caffeine throughout my life. \n\n\n\nAs I thought to refuel, I thought ah the gel would be really nice for me. But bam, I suddenly felt my heart rate was exceedingly high, like 190++ high. That occurred to me at km 13 hence I need to walk a bit to try to bring my HR lower. I don't want to have any heart problems from this event lol.\n\n\n\nAfter the little incident, I continued to run, after KM 17, my mind was slowly hitting me, on how everything on my body was so tired. I have trained a long run before, but 18 KM was my longest run. Hence I was entering some uncharted territory there.\n\n\n\nI am really happy that I could still push through, and even got a burst of energy when doing my last kilometer. I got too carried away and sprinted a bit further than I expected. I should have just sprinted the last 300-400 meters, but nooo.. I started to sprint when I was 800meters out. And of course, I could not follow through, hence I walked a bit to regain my breath. well, lesson learned.\n\n\n\nBut all in all, I was quite happy that I managed to finish the race. It was not sub 2.5 hours, but hey! it's my first one, and I can finish it! \n\n\n\n\n\n### Post-race\n\nPost-race, we get into some asian buffet and it was fun to chat with my wife and friends and telling stories about the race itself. \n\n\n\nMy feet hurts, or rather sore, and I got a small blister. But considering that when I was training, I always have problems with my knee, I thought that this was a win for me! No knee pain!\n\n\n\nThis week, I doubt that I will do a lot of running, maybe some. But, this will not be my last, as hopefully many more will come.\n\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, and thanks for all your suggestions in this subreddit. You guys are awesome!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

I remember finishing off with that lap inside the olympic stadium, with your video on the jumbotron screen\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt’s for accessibility. Having it mid day allows out of towners to take the train in for the day without having to pay for a hotel night. It’s kind of a lottery too, for the big 10k last week it was 16 and overcast. One time it was snowing at the marathon in june. \n\n\nIt seems likely they’ll change it in the future though.\n\nI have the opposite problem with races in the US. I have a half marathon on November 3 in Boston. It won’t be warm! Yet we’re starting at 7 freaking am!\n\nIt means getting up at 5am at the latest. I don’t get it, it’s a Sunday. \n\nPeople sometimes say it’s to not impede traffic. Which may be the sad truth in car-obsessed America.\n\nFor Singapore, our half is starting at 430 am.... I'm going to have to change my entire sleep schedule for a week to get prepped!\n\nHello fellow SG reddit runner!\n\nyeah--with races in the US it's almost always about traffic. Cops often won't approve later start times, and you need their cooperation to close the roads.\n\nI'm going to guess there's a full marathon that starts even earlier?  Even if there isn't they expect people to still be walking in until 11a so yeah, they probably want to be rapping up and opening streets again before lunch. Sad but true.\n\n Meanwhile the elite runners probably went home, showed, and went back to bed and are just heading out for brunch as the last runners are finishing.... /jk I have no idea what elite runners do after a race, I don't know any.\n\nNope, half only.\n\nThanks! Yeah, it's a sad reality though, but we'll see in the upcoming years\n\nVery proud!\n\nThanks!\n\nWell done. It was way too hot yesterday!!!\n\nThankss!! Eller hurr!! Det är september för faaaan 😂\n\nAll my races this year were about 10 degrees hotter than they should've been. Yesterday was just awful. Looking forward to the fall races now.\n\nMassive congratulations! Almost exactly the same as my time for the London half marathon recently - looking forward to the next one being a sub 2hr30 🤗\n\nWe will make it! 💪 Thank you fellow redditor!\n\nGreat job! The route looked amazing! Im starting to get an itch to run the half next year!\n\nGo for it!!\n\nCongratulations!!!! You did it!\n\nThankss!!\n\nCongratulations on your first half marathon!\n\nThankss!!\n\nCongratulations. You are an inspiration for my first half marathon.\n\nYou should try it! It's an experience :))\n\nDefinitely, I will try. I miss running in Gothenburg 😌\n\nCongrats, ran it too. My debut half-marathon. It was hot as hell.\n\nRight!! I was so thankful for the water stations and water hose. Or else I might not finish\n\nCongrats! Just keep it up.\n\nI ran today for 31 km and I am quite taken.\n\nOne day I hope to reach that goal distance!\n\nYou will, just progress slowly.\n\nI am only running for 4 years and did my first 10k after a year. Once you run a milestone like that, it is no longer a problem.\n\nKeep it up!\n\nThanks man! :))\n\nWell done \n\nIn Swedish\n\nYou did great! And it sounds like you picked up some valuable race experience for next time, too!\n\nCongrats!!!\n\nNice job! I ran a half in May with a loose goal of breaking 2:30 and ended up within a minute of your time (I also started too fast)… I’ll bet we can both break 2:30 next year!\n\nAbsolutely! I'm impressed how our bodies can adapt if we train them :))\n\nWow thank you for this report it is very inspiring, and instructive as i will participate to m'y first half marathon next february 😜\n\nGreat work -- my own first half is in exactly 6 weeks, and it's good to hear from someone who runs at a similar pace than I plan on, most of the other reports are so fast! \n\n\nI just hope the afternoon weather in Antwerp won't be near as hot as Nordics was yesterday.\n\nCongratulations! \nThis was very inspiring and real to read for me as a new runner. My aim is to run a half marathon someday - right now struggling to get to the 10k mark.\n\nWell done! I was there as well and it was definitely more challenging than other years because of the heat. No race for beating personal records. Saw a couple of people collapsing, not as bad as the race in Gothenburg in may but still pretty concerning. \n\nFor me it went quite well. Missing my record on this course with 30 seconds and a 1:38 finishing time. Very happy about the result under those circumstances.\n\nCongrats on the first! Always a special one, getting that first finisher's medal. Well done!\n\nCompleting your first half marathon is a huge achievement, especially at such a prestigious event.\n\nGrattis! Jag sprang Helsingborg lördags och det var också svin varmt.\n\n![h](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c85d566535ebb5317b3bfb726abe6d76/2a4e8a02762095e7-d0/s500x750/11d359843fb7fbe6a774f9310fbd8c2e91a827f2.gifv)\n\n&lt;img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c85d566535ebb5317b3bfb726abe6d76/2a4e8a02762095e7-d0/s500x750/11d359843fb7fbe6a774f9310fbd8c2e91a827f2.gifv\"&gt;\n\nDid you get Stockholm Syndrome?"

    "title": "Why is El Guerrouj's 1500m World Record from 1999 Still Standing Despite Modern Advancements?",
    "body": "Hicham El Guerrouj set the 1500m men’s world record in 1999 with an incredible time of 3:26.00. Over two decades later, it still hasn’t been broken, which seems surprising given all the advancements in the sport.\n\nWe’ve seen massive leaps in technology like carbon-plated super shoes, wave plate tech, and other innovations designed to improve performance. Tracks are now more responsive and optimized for speed, athletes have access to superior nutrition and supplements, and training methodologies have evolved significantly.\n\nDespite all of this, no one has been able to surpass El Guerrouj’s record. Why is that? Is it because his record was so far ahead of its time? Are current athletes focusing less on middle-distance events? Or are the gains from new technology not as impactful in middle-distance races as they are in sprints or marathons?\n\nI’d love to hear what you all think! Is this a testament to El Guerrouj’s greatness, or is there another factor at play?\n\n",

Fucking IDIOT!! 🤬”\n\nReddit hive mind\n\nIt’s possible that people read the question as sarcastic or dismissive, which would look mildly ridiculous after a quick google (scholar) search. I don’t think anyone, including myself, actually knew the exact answer to the question if it’s considered earnestly. It’s also probably the case that there’s more to the claim about hip flexors than the one source I linked suggests.\n\nAlso, ElG was almost certainly doped to the gills, as much as I idolize his performances…\n\nKind of spitballing here, but here's some thoughts. The 1500m is a tactical race, generally. Arguably the most tactical distance. You go out too fast, you most likely blow up and lose (see this year's summer Olympics). Shoe advances don't make that big of a difference over 3.75 laps of a track. Wave lights certainly help with pacing, but I don't think we've seen a solid attempt at a men's 1500m world record with wave lights any time recently? Lastly, I think that the current record was fast enough that it seemed out of reach for the athletes at the top of the sport until recently. If races were being won with sit-and-kick tactics at 3:35, nobody's going to feel a great belief that they can get up to 3:25:xx.\n\nI would argue pretty much every diamond league 1500 was a world record attempt, at least the ones Jakob was in. And he ran 3:26 high, so he got pretty close this year. It’s just a matter of time for El G’s record imo.\n\nYea, I think it will fall in 2025.\n\nAbsolutely! I remember a TV commentator's remark that they're doing a 3-lap warm-up for a 300 meter sprint!\n\nHow in all of that did doping not get mentioned\n\nEh, I thought about it, but there were already plenty of comments about doping and the whole topic gets exhausting since it's all just speculation and assumptions.\n\nOk fine. Tactics aren't a great argument in a wr attempt with pacers. Yes the 1500 at the world championship or Olympics is carry tactical, but no one is expecting a world record.\n\nThey also dope now\n\nthey are carefull not to overdo it. Back then it wasn't the case.\n\nDumb mid-pack question: why isn’t the tactic to run a world record pace if you have that in you?\n\nAnyone who's able to hang on to the leader gets a mental and physical break from not being in the lead. They get a small bit of wind draft, but they also can just focus on staying on the person's pace rather than trying to set the perfect pace. At the end of the race they will have more energy left over than the leader and be able to out-kick them. The men's 1500m championships have been an excellent example of this in recent years. Jakob Ingebrigtsen is generally the fastest athlete in the lineup, but he's not so fast that he can outlast a kick by others at the end. At this summer's Olympics he went out at WR pace, but ended up getting outkicked by three people and didn't even medal.\n\nHm… there have been great advances in shoe tech, training, nutrition, and drug testing. What could possibly explain it…?\n\nThe myth that carrots gave you better night vision was busted, so athletes stopped training at night.\n\nDid they stop eating carrots?!\n\nAs someone else commented, EPO testing picked up in 2000, and he was almost as fast then.\n\nAnd Lance Armstrong was never caught either.... Drug users will always be a step ahead of WADA, it's a constant cat and mouse game.\n\nAnd that doesn't apply to current racers because... reasons.\n\nDon’t say that in either of the Tour de France subs. The Pogacar/Vingegaard fanboys (cultivated by the Flix) will eat you alive lol\n\nAll of them are on it.\n\nTesting for EPO came in for the Sydney Olympics in 2000. And obviously El Guerrouj was an incredible talent\n\n[removed]\n\nhe was extraordinarily fast in an era when all the extraordinarily fast people were doped to the gills. That's not definitive but it's strong circumstantial evidence.\n\nThe poster before you is as sweet a summer child as it gets\n\nYour performances are still enhanced if you stop using. Once you used, you benefit from it all your life, there’s no coming clean.\n\nDespite being downvoted on this you are correct. Numerous studies have shown long term performance benefits of PED use even years after stopping.\n\nLance Armstrong didn’t slow down in 2001 either\n\nmy natty hero\n\nHe was as clean and pure as the lakes on top of the mountains he rode up so fast that he had to apply the brakes at the turns.\n\n/s\n\nThey then started with ye olde blood doping\n\nThat means nothing lol. He could also have doped until 2001 then stopped and have gained huge benefits from prior doping\n\nBecause El Guerrouj was a beast.\n\nWeird that this answer is this low. He was just GOATed, ran many many of the fastest times ever. Was a 'time trial hero' before his double golds in athens after a lot of near-misses that included countrymen making the final to pace him to a fast race. He eventually put it all together taking down bekele, lagat, a young kipchoge, etc. His run was at the tail end of decade ish that saw a huge drop in mid distance running times, and im sure he was especially inspired by Saïd Aouita before him. Culture, theory of the sport, personal connections, and the body to withstand all that training and speed all came together. It's not super different than Jakob's path if you step back and compare\n\n[deleted]\n\nI think there's two problems with that. \n\n* 1 is that pre-testing they could just take so much EPO that your blood was in danger of coagulating at night because it was insufficiently liquid. That's how many red blood cells they could generate. Without knowing the specifics of what's out there today, I find it tough to believe that it's as powerful as that kind of doping.\n\n* 2 is regarding him being the greatest ever. There's no doubt that without epo he'd have been great. The thing is that different people respond to doping differently. So it's hard to say if he was actually the greatest or just very good with the best response to EPO....\n\nThe point is not saying he wasn’t better than others at the time (ofc he was, they were all using), but that it is why the record still stands today. It wouldn’t otherwise.\n\nI think the thing he is stating is: Everyone else was doping and setting records then that have since been beaten.  Why hasn't this one?\n\nThe reason can't be just because he was doping, as the other records would still be unbeaten.\n\nIf you visualize performance as a graph of genetic / physiological potential, training, luck on race day, and PEDs, you’d probably find El G is a statistical outlier (among elites) in all of them, and that probably does explain the longevity of the record.\n\nIt just so happens that recombinant EPO was made commercially available in 1989 and there was no laboratory test to detect it until an experimental assay in 2000.\n\nHe would still have the fastest time ever if you only looked at this times after they started testing for EPO. 2 years after his WR, he ran 3:43.2 in 2001.\n\nLance Armstrong never \"tested positive\" for epo or other PEDs and He was winning the tdf in 2005. He just had people out him. Tests have been proven faulty, inconsistent, and easily manipulated or covered up.\n\nHe even tested positive for EPO at the 2001 Tour de Suisse\n\nOnce you used, you benefit from it all your life, even if you stop using.\n\nExcellent\n\nPerformance\n\nOften\n\nwow so that's the secret!\n\nEveryone else had access to the epo or whatever peds. So that said why is he still better?\n\nBecause he was still that good. A regular person can't take EPO and become a world champion. A natural world champion can take EPO and get enough of a boost to run world records. Lance Armstrong and Marion Jones were both world class talents before EPO. Then the drugs boosted them to a bunch of gold medals and tour de France wins.\n\nYou still have to have the genetics and years of training regimen to be able to take advantage of the EPO.\n\nSimple answer: EPO.\nThis is the same reason why in cycling most climbing records are still from the 90s even the bikes have improved a lot.  \n\nOnly prime Pogacar can match them.\n\nI'm sure it's part greatness, but also some special sauce. \n\nThere are zero credible accusations of him cheating\n\nWe live in a world where the greatest athletes in every sport imaginable have taken substances to be the greatest, set world records, win Olympic medals. What makes track so special that the world records here are clean but no other sport is? \n\nJust because there are no credible accusations doesn’t mean we can’t see the context and the glaring reality, that in order to set his WR, he had taken substances to achieve it.\n\nWait, are we going to accuse every long-standing WR holder of cheating now? Why are some athletes considered cheaters, and some not?\n\nEdit: Typical Reddit behavior, downvote without any reasons given.\n\nIf the world record is in running, yes I believe it’s been accomplished via doping.\n\nYou mean all of them?\n\nYes all of the running world records have been done through doping. Also I didn’t downvote your other comment, complaining about it is soft though.\n\nYou sure like to make bold statements without any proof to back it up. I think we can end our discussion here. That's enough for me.\n\nYou literally just asked “all of them?” You want me to write a dissertation on that response? Get over yourself. People cheat to be the best, it’s a fact of life\n\nDisagree\n\nTests for EPO were litterally invented a year after the record. And once you use EPO, you benefit from it all your life, even if you stop using (so his time from 2001 means jackshit about him being clean).\n\ndo you believe in the Tooth Fairy? Santa Claus/\n\nDo i believe in things that have zero evidence? No\n\nIt's a little bit insane if you know anything about what was going on in sport at that time to imagine that the guy winning everything was the ONLY guy not on EPO. It's santa claus-level of make believe.\n\nPeople race to win, not for time. Not everybody is like prefontaine. Inglebritson will change that. Now, you'll see multiple people challenging that record.\n\nTo the gils\n\nHe’s simply built different\n\nObviously he was doped but then is every other person going for the WR. Just a really hard record and he was a special athlete. Tbh I think it's more achievable than bolts 100 m.\n\nHe was a dawg\n\nSame as it always was.... \n\n Drugs + Talent + Training. \n\nNot everyone respond to drugs and training the same.\n\n Other races have seen times dropped because fast 'middle distance' runners moved up earlier. 10k-Marathon isn't just for slow guys who moved up anymore. \n\n 1500m is stuck because 400m/800m ain't moving up because they will lack the endurance. \n\n I think it will take a true 400m/800m guy to move up to really challenge it.\n\nI’d make the argument that some of the biggest innovations we’ve made are notably less helpful at the 1500 distance than to many of the longer distances where we have seen records broken recently (5k, 10k, HM, Marathon for both men and women). First, the shoes seem to have diminishing returns at shorter distances. The shoes seem to make you more efficient rather than just faster, so an event like the 1500 where speed is more important (relatively) than efficiency, they aren’t quite as helpful. Second, threshold training is vastly superior training for longer distances than whatever athletes were doing back in El G’s day, but in the 1500 the higher intensity/lower volume stuff isn’t actually that bad. I still think threshold is better, and that’s why most guys running the 1500 use it, but you can still run very fast on more old school 1500 training.\n\nThis is the best answer in the thread.\n\nI will have a controversial opinion on the topic.\n\nI don't think modern advancements make you run faster for the most part. Yes, somethings do help like energy return from shoes or better running surface. But what I think modern advancements do is they make large number of people avoid majority of the mistakes and train productively, consistently, close to their personal limit. This makes for a higher chance that a singularly genetically predisposed person will also do everything right in training to get as close to the absolute limit as possible.\n\nIf you look at the training of people in the middle of last century you will notice they were doing some strange, unproductive things. And they would still be getting pretty good results. Only for very few people things would \"click\", but they didn't know much about how or why.\n\nEPO\n\nNah - he ran 2:43.2 (only 0.1s slower and still faster than anyone else ever) even when they were testing for EPO in 2001.\n\nOnce you used, you benefit from it all your life. This means jackshit. \n\nDelusional. The testing then was notoriously terrible. He was on EPO. Done it myself and it’s quite effective.\n\nThat guy was fast. I'm not a track guy, and I was only 13 in 1999, but I will always remember him as a speed demon of that era.\n\nTo those who say doping, why is this one still standing and others from the era (e.g. Komen's 3000 record) aren't? Not saying anyone was or wasn't doped but this can't be the only answer\n\nTbh I think there are people now who have a decent chance of breaking it in a dedicated attempt with pacers, lights and everything, it's just that these rarely come up. The Olympic final was won in 3:27.65 which is pretty close for a race with no pacers, where everyone has had to go through heats and semis and where the favourites are explicitly racing to win as opposed to racing for a time.\n\nEPO\n\n1999 was the height of EPO era!\n\n  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping\\_at\\_the\\_1999\\_Tour\\_de\\_France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_at_the_1999_Tour_de_France)\n\nBasically the test for EPO only was invented in the year 2000\n\nHow much did he weight? 105?\n\nThere was no test for EPO in 1999\n\nfor those saying doping, all these guys dope, u don’t get to the top without using at some point, there is always an equally talented guy who uses.\n\nEither EPO, El G was an extremely talented runner, or a bit of both\n\nThis WORLD RECORD May NEVER BE BROKEN, Here's Why || The Greatest 1500 Meter Run Ever\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJiSuLSz_DY&amp;t=10 \n\nAnd a shitload of epo, obviously 😆\n\nThis subreddit is funny, nobody gives any credit to El-Guerrouj and keeps talking about EPO. You do realise that athletes are still on gear nowadays with even better sauce that they used to have?\n\nI remember watching El Guerrouj at the time, he was just fast as fuck.\nYou need to remember his great rivalry with Haile Gebresellassie that pushed both of them to heights one probably wouldn’t have reached without the other.\nDef no drugs involved he’s never had anything other than straight negative tests.\n\nArmchair experts here claiming EPO and totally ignoring the fact he won 2 gold medals in Athens after winning 1500m and a few days later winning 5000m.\n\n3:26 is averaging 55 sec for every 400m continuously. For most people, 55 sec for a lap is a sprint of not all out/PB sprint so these guys are pacing at that speed from a stand still. Fastest 800m is essentially two 50 second laps and that's considered essentially an extended sprint. All out sprint for longer than a minute is hard for anyone"

    "title": "Do you have plans to visit Seoul? Here's a good place to run",
    "body": "As a Korean, I hope more people will share good experiences in Seoul.\nSo let me summarize the good places I ran here in Seoul.\n\n- [seoul botanic park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wcMq8YXFv1XJUXNt9)\n\nIt’s my favorite place. It's not a most \"fun\" running place, but it provides a very enjoyable running experience.\nIt is mainly wide and neat, and there are some hills, but the angle is not large.\nThere is little odor, bugs, garbage, and unstable land, and bicycle traffic is prohibited, so you can run psychologically comfortably.\nThere are four toilets in the park and convenience stores and cafes, so convenience is very good.\nA locker is running at a nearby subway station, but honestly, I only enjoy running with bags and water bottles thrown in front of a bear statue in the park. But I don't recommend it!\n\n- [Ujang Neighborhood Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LfJdgw49rwkDfJwD6)\n\nThis is where I'm looking for hill training. There are a paved road circulation course with steep uphill and downhill roads, a hill course that is difficult to climb to the top of the mountain, and irregular tracks.\nMainly asphalt and urethane coexist exceptionally. I like to step on asphalt on the uphill road and urethane on the downhill road.\nIn addition, there is a track used as a starting point on the soccer field, but it is not suitable for speed training because it does not meet the standards and is a right angle corner. But many runners love this track!\nYou have to pay attention to the environment here, and you can see several wild animals. (In fact, most mountains in Seoul are like that) I won't go here to run at 2 a.m.\nAlso, be careful of steep downhill!\n\n- Yeouido runner station &amp; Yeouido Hangang Park\n\nIt is a runner station at Yeouinaru Station on Line 5 and a nearby park course.\nHonestly, I am come yet. Currently, it is expected to be quite crowded due to various events, so we will visit later. However, it looked pretty cool and the response of the runners around it was good.\nRunner Station is equipped with facilities such as a non-powered treadmill, changing room, and storage box.\nPlease check [this page](https://mediahub.seoul.go.kr/archives/2011230) for more information.\n\n- [mokdong stadium](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xYGuDQK3A3GmvHd4A)\n\nIt is a track where amateur runners who run best in Korea train. Several passionate clubs are based here.\nFree use is available from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m., making it the busiest during this time, and it can be used for about $1 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. after maintenance.\nIf you are a competitive runner, I think your training experience here will be a great motivation.\n\n\nIn addition, there are many attractive running places in Seoul, such as Namsan Mountain, Seokchon Lake, and Seoul Forest.\nIn particular, no matter where you stay in Seoul, you will be able to find a good course not far away.\nIf you're a runner planning to visit Korea, don't miss a good experience! \n\nThank you for reading it :)\nIf you know any other good places, please let me know!",

It's great to have recommendations just in case I'm ready and willing to hop out for an early morning run.\n\nMy favorite route was along Cheonggyecheon from its beginning in Gwanghwamun all the way to the Han River. And then crossing over to Seoul Forest when I wanted a longer run.\n\nCame to say this! Miss running in the cold, sunny Korean winters\n\nHow long is this course?\n\nIt’s around 11 km long but you can turn around any time and there’s many small bridges crossing the stream. It can be quite longer if you cross the bridge and go into Seoul Forest\n\nI mostly run at Yangjaecheon and Olympic Park and I was looking for new recs so thank you. :)\n\nThank you for this post! I am visiting Seoul next March and planning to run daily. I’ll be training for a marathon, so I was hoping there would be a lot of parks and other runners. I’m going to save this list! 😊\n\nI would always run underneath the ''70'' highway. It feels like your running in a hidden part of the city. Like your in a Nike commercial or something. Start at Hapjeoung Station and walk down Jeoldusan Martyrs' Shrine. Then run until your done with running and find a subway station to go back.\n\nIs it under the Gangbyeonbuk-ro? I remember riding cycle there. great course!\n\nVisited Seoul I November and I just want to say, what a beautiful city! Had a great time and ate amazing food.\n\nI'll be visiting Seoul in October, and I hadn't even thought about going for a run until I saw this! Thank you!\n\nI was stationed in Korea from 1991-1996. North of seoul. Been to Seoul a few times. I am actually planning a trip to Korea for early next year so this info is good. Is there a good web site that shows all races occurring in Korea? We have runtheusa.com\n\nRunners in Korea use this http://www.marathon.pe.kr/schedule_index.html\nHowever, there are sometimes missing races\n\nThanks\n\nThanks, this is great! I'm going to Seoul later this year and was planning on running but wasn't sure where would be good. Do you know if there are running clubs in Seoul? Would love to meet with other runners while I'm there\n\nBookmarking this. Ty\n\nOmg I wish I had this 8 months ago 😭 I was running multiple laps up/down cheongyecheon every day of my visit. Saved for next time, thank you!\n\nWow thank you for this post! I’m a runner and will be I be in Korea in July. Will save some of the places you mentioned! Do you know how long the paths are?\n\nSeoul Botanic park has many crossroads, but my favorite course is about 2.3 km.

    "all_comment_text": "I find that it makes a significant difference to how I run. I really struggle during luteal phase, particularly in 3-4 days leading up to menstruation. When it finally comes I’m badass again and feel like I can do anything. It’s infuriating but I am trying to accept and adapt rather than push against the grain. \n\nI haven’t been able to entirely alleviate the impact on speed, stamina and recovery, (which gets progressively worse until period day) but supplements and diet changes have really helped. There’s a few resources out there - books and online - but I’m not a nutritionist and wouldn’t want to recommend anything. \n\nI’ve been lucky enough to be out of the phase on race days but I would think twice about booking races that sat during the phase. I certainly wouldn’t be aiming for a PB. But it helps to know that stuff like hot weather can also be a reason to change approach to how one races on the day. \n\nI’m similar - about 3 days before menstruation I really lose so so much of my energy and everything is infinitely harder. I have yet to figure out a solution, and it usually lasts for the length of my period as well. \nI am trying out a few different things, op, I just suggest looking into different supplements and your diet. I know I get like crazy hungry during that time and tend to eat a lot of low nutrition stuff and that isn’t helping. So I’m working on changing that out personally now in the hopes that if I make some (not limiting those treats though) healthier/more energy giving food choices during that time will help.\n\n\nETA: I have the unfortunate experience of almost exclusively racing during this time. And I absolutely hate it. Awful for me. But I also am just struggling so much during that time. Last year I had a half I worked so hard for all summer, and about 7 miles in I was absolutely tanked. I still finished it but definitely walked way more than I wanted to.\n\nI've tried eating only healthy stuff in the 3 days before my period and it only made me more miserable and hungry. Now i just accept the cravings. Its only a day or two a month, my life can handle it. \n\nWorse is how I treat my boyfriend in those days 🙈\n\ni'd like to validate your miserableness and hunger and say that there is apparently a connection between carbohydrate cravings and progesterone. \n\nas soon as we reach ovulation, our body needs to produce enough progesterone before it can go on and shed the uterine lining. to achieve that goal, progesterone needs glucose and low cortisol levels. otherwise we miss a period - like when we're stressed or out of a healthy bmi range. so it seems that progesterone affects how insulin works and how sugar is stored in the body.\nso basically since learning this, i try to satisfy these carb cravings with complex carbs. i mostly fail to avoid sugar but i try not to indulge too much as it messes up my hormones.\n\nedit: and since i educated my boyfriend and explained to him how i feel on different days (and he can see it for himself, like how i am so bubbly and energetic in my follicular), he tries to be involved and cooks an iron-rich meal on my first day on menstruation which helps a lot with our relationship.\n\na study here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7039319/\n\nWhat kind of supplements?\n\nMostly just making sure I’m having protein (I’m bad at this) and actually taking like my vitamins. I also am from a long line of (women in my family) where I don’t have enough vitamin c and d, so I do try to make sure I’m getting those through my multivitamin/food.\n\nI have only been running for 2+ years, but mentally, I have done a good job (I think) of shifting my focus from omg this is it!!! This is the race you're going to X!!!! To let's give ourselves a bunch of different opportunities to maybe hit some different goals. And if we don't, there is always another race. \n\nMy first half was omg my first half. I aimed for two hours. Hit 2:01 and I thought that was great. I could make some minor changes and be good. \n\nMy next two halfs were on back to back weekends in places with significant elevation coming from my home city of sea level. So 7,000 feet up was an adjustment as was back to back races. 2:10 and 2:28 respectively. \n\nFourth half I was injured five months before it and recovered enough only to half ass train for seven weeks. 2:09. \n\nAiming for that two hours in October again, but I've truly enjoyed all my races and realize there are just way too many factors to put all my eggs in one basket. My cycle is another thing to take into account. Easier to predict than the weather, so I feel if I can avoid my \"down times\", I will, but really it's one of a million things going into this!\n\nHow many times have I feel beat &amp; leaden legged &amp; wonder what the heck is going on &amp; then check my tracking app &amp; realize I’m about 3 days out &amp; things suddenly make sense? So many. And I’ve been tracking for years 😅\n\nFor me it makes a big deal actually, my legs feel heavier somehow and it takes more energy to move faster. But hopefully the race endorphins kick in! Goodluck you will do amazing :)\n\nThere's really nothing you can do except if your cycle is regular, calendar it out to not try to PR or otherwise have a high performance race during that part of your cycle in the future. Otherwise hydrate and eat extra carbs and just enjoy the race atmosphere and give whatever you have that day.\n\nI don't have significant differences in performance because I always had relatively minor periods and I've been on Mirena for many many years now, but I know plenty of women who shifted a traditional 3 week build, 1 week recovery training cycle so their recovery week is during the luteal phase and have reported seeing more consistent performance over time.\n\nDo you have any recommendations on where to find a 3/1 program like this? I use Run With Hal but it’s defeating when I’m in my LP and my performance tanks.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI love this recommendation! Thank you for sharing. that’s generally what I do as well but I beat myself up for being slower. Thanks for helping normalize it; I’ve gotta give myself more grace!\n\nThe 3/1 cycle is a pretty standard approach so many training plans have that built in. Or just ignore your performance during your off week. You’re still doing the work even if the numbers and your body senses aren’t showing it.\n\nFor me there is a few differences from 8 to 2days before period. Physically I usually gain a lot of water weight and whatever I eat I’m always bloated. I’ve noticed I have a slightly higher heartrate during the luteal phase, my legs feels heavy and I get side stitches at a lower heart rate. I feel like I just ate 3burgers and then went running lol. However except for my higher heart rate I can still run, it just won’t be as nice. I keep that week for z2 runs and biking only. I have a race coming up in my luteal phase, I won’t do it with a time in mind, I’ll just want to enjoy the mood. It is as it is.\n\nIt definitely makes me slower and makes running more of a struggle. Vs follicular phase where I feel like I’m flying the whole time\n\nCame here to say the same. I feel like I’m working so much harder only to be slower and not hit the distances I can during other phases.\n\nI think it comes down to how it impacts you.  How has it been impacting you?\n\nThis is the best answer so far. 👏\n\nThe comments here make me feel so validated. I just got back in to a good running schedule after quite a while off the wagon. I've been great about pushing myself to go for a run about 5 times a week, even when I don't want to. I didn't go today or yesterday, though, because I'm probably less than 24 hours out from starting my period and I just feel *drained*. I have no energy, I feel like I weigh 1000 pounds, my boobs hurt, and everything is just harder. I also have a tendency to get awful cramps if I try to run in the days leading up to my period. For those reasons, I decided to just pause the run schedule until maybe 2-3 days after I've started, when the cramps are gone and I feel like a human again. But I feel guilty because I was just starting to form good exercise habits again and with PMS and all, I could certainly use the post-run endorphins right now.\n\nIt messes me up badly. I have way less endurance.\n\nI’m just crankier. That’s really it.\n\nSame, which makes it easier to race on pure hate, which is actual rocket fuel\n\nHonestly, the thing that has helped the most is continuing to train through my luteal phase. It's hard. So hard. I feel tired and my legs feel really heavy, but it reminds me that I'm still capable no matter where I'm at in my cycle. Do the speed work. Do the zone 2 work. Do the work to remind you that you can and that you're a badass \n\nI've raced two triathlons this year and I've been in my luteal phase for both (just a couple of days before my period). I didn't hit PRs, but I stayed strong and steady in both of them. This weekend I have a race coming up and I'll be in my ovulation phase and I am so stoked!\n\n:Googles luteal:\n\nMaybe something is wrong with me, or I'm lucky, but I literally feel the same all the time? I would have never known of this concept before.\n\nAre you on hormonal birth control? I didn’t notice monthly differences very much until I got off of it, now it’s night and day \n\nI'm just off it for the first time in 17 years. And day and night is exactly right!\n\nSame.\n\nTo save everyone else the pain, it's like the 12-16 days before your period. So... I'm glad I've never noticed anything?\n\nI was okay up to my 40s, 40s and up its god awful. Cannot race around my period- the days before completely wiped and the first 2 days of my period is impossible. Wish my ignorant younger self knew how humbling hormones can be. Do what you can and don’t compare yourself to others. I simply learnt to not book races far in advance. \n\nIt SUCKS. Just putting it simply….Everything sucks, you’re slower, &amp; more irritated. And when you lift/strength train, everything feels much heavier. God forbid you do any explosive movements or CrossFit like workouts… but, as with everything else, you can adapt and overcome it. What you feel and go through will be completely different from what others go through, as you can see by the mixed replies in the comment section.\n\nSomehow I ran a half marathon PR during this time. I was really nervous but it went a lot better than expected.\n\nIt definitely impacts me. I have extremely irregular cycles due to PCOS. They range anywhere from 40-70+ days. I don’t track ovulation in any way but can always tell when I’ve ovulated as I am suddenly struggling to breathe even during an easy run. It’s due to increased progesterone levels after ovulation. If you’ve ever been pregnant it’s the same reason you can feel out of breath during the first trimester. \n\nI don’t think there’s really anything you can do short of not signing up for races that fall during your luteal phase if it affects you like it does for me. My longer cycles are almost a blessing since it doesn’t generally happen monthly for me. I just keep running as much as I can during that time and then I’m back to my normal level of fitness once my period comes. \n\nI think it really depends on the person. I don’t notice a big difference except for maybe feeling more heavy-legged, but I know some people experience pretty significant differences in performance. I’m pretty lucky in the fact that my cycle is mild- don’t have a heavy flow, super bad cramps, and am regular.\n\nI used to schedule my deloading weeks during half marathon training for my period week. It is what it is. I notice immediately when my period is about to start because it feels like I’m running with cinder blocks tied to my legs.\n\nI'm much more injury prone at the tail end of the luteal phase. From what I understand, the hormone relaxin kicks in after ovulation just in case you get pregnant and I find all my tendons get really moody. Also I gain about 6-8lb of water weight which overall makes me a bit sluggish.\n\nWhat do you usually do when training? What symptoms or issues are you trying to avoid?\n\nI don't think it really makes that much difference.\n\nFor me the week of ovulation i can't lift even like 2/3rds of what I can the rest of the month. I finally figured it out on month 4 by going back and comparing it to my cycle tracker. It has really helped my self esteem. I do try to not let it be an excuse I use though, I feel a bit like im giving myself a pre-excuse to be a bit lazy, but it was very clear pattern before I considered that it was a pattern for me.\n\nOvulation time is the worst for me, too. I get bad cramps and I’ve had cysts rupture while running and end up walking 2 miles home. Now I try and pay more attention and stick to the treadmill in case that happens.\n\nWomen on social media have begun acting like having a menstrual cycle makes us handicapped 3/4 of the month for some reason\n\nMaybe because for some (a lot) of women, their hormones actually do affect them and the luteal phase comes with an extreme lack of energy and strength\n\nThank you for saying this. It’s wild to see the dismissive comments about this on the thread. Performance dips during luteal phase are very well-researched. It’s great that some people are the exception, but that’s definitely not the rule in regards to having a cycle while not on birth control. We’re hungrier, weaker, etc. and that’s for a well-known scientific purpose. Pretending it’s not true is an unhelpful and inaccurate blanket statement.\n\nMost women do not have an extreme lack of strength due to their menstrual cycle unless something else is going on at which point you should visit a hormonal specialist or maybe check your iron and diet and not go running if you are that wiped out. Thats not a normal part of menstruation.\n\nI never said most, I said a lot! Just because it doesn’t happen to you doesn’t mean it isn’t normal for a lot of people :)\n\nAlthough I agree that we must have empathy and understand that not everyone experiences periods in the same way, I think there's validity in the idea that feeling terrible is probably not normal, sometimes we normalize feeling uncomfortable because it's all we know but ideally it shouldn't be like that.\n\nYeah i very much oppose that its become like this widely ”known” thing that women are just fragile and weaker the majority of the MONTH because of their menstratution, it goes hand in hand with the whole ”women arent made for lifting just cardio because of our fragile physiology” and if you oppose it especially when its not true youre denying someone their ”truth”. I feel like a lot of regressive stuff from older generations is coming back in brand new instagram packaging.\n\nWomen are not more fragile but women’s hormones fluctuate and more individually affecting them. I am in my 40s. Up to that had zero issues- yeah maybe was a little more tired. Now its very different and some empathy goes a long way to women of all experiences and ages. I do think its very wrong to shame women for not being a ‘one size fits all’. The misogynistic ‘weaker sex’ profiling is also wrong. \n\nI dont not have empathy for women. I am aware that hormones affect them, i am a woman. I am also aware that being in your 40s its likely the decrease in estrogen affecting you, which yes is a hormone and part of your cycle but its also either perimenopause or menopause that is the culprit and is causing way higher differences in your body (which obviously you know better than me). Its not the average cycle which the average woman has for decades before reaching menopause. Women can also have pcos. Women can also have endometriosis. This also causes them to be more suseptible to hormonal fluctuations, but its not the cycle or womanhood thats at fault. I still do not believe women who have entirely normal hormonal function and cycles (which you yourself said you had no issues with up until your 40s) should go around with the attitude of hmmm the majority of the month im just like this because im a woman!! Because thats not necessarily true and is also harmful for women to believe.\n\nseems like you're upset for women. yet act misogynistic yourself.\n\nNot speaking of going around with an attitude. Speaking of even amongst normal women with normal cycles there is a variance of how they feel and perform. Good for you if it has zero effect on your personal performance. \n\nDon't you think telling women that it's basically all in their head is way more regressive than encouraging women to understand their bodies, hormones and overall health? If you don't feel energy fluctuations based on your cycle, more power to ya, that's great. But a lot of women do, that's a scientific fact, not a social media fad, and I would argue it's more empowering than regressive for women to better understand their bodies (and that doesn't mean acting fragile, I'm kind of confused where you see women athletes claiming that).\n\nSome is not a lot. Its just the ultra right and unknowing/naive fake feminists working on laying the ground work for taking more of women's hard earned rights away, and the new \"I can't function 75% of the month\" needs to be believed by society first for that to happen.\n\nAs others have already stated this is a well researched phenomenon that’s has been scientifically documented in large populations of “healthy” women who have no underlying hormone issues. But nice try at making it political!\n\nUnderstanding your cycle hormonally is really helpful for training. I don’t think it’s the end all be all, but it has definitely helped me.\n\nGarmin's period tracker often gives me unhelpful advice about the phases of my cycle. I respect that other women might have different experiences, but for me, the only question about my cycle and running is, do I need to plug up my blood hole, or no?\n\nIs that what it is? I’ve been wondering why there are suddenly a million questions like this popping up.\n\nBecause for women with endometriosis and ovarian cysts and fibroids it literally does make you handicapped. Imagine walking in someone else’s shoes for a change.\n\nRight? it’s likely a very minor change in performance and it’s about as controllable as the weather, so there’s no real use in worrying about it, unless OP wants to change races. Just train as usual and show up to your day planning to do the best you can on that day given all the factors\n\nThis is a pretty broad brush to paint. My performance absolutely tanks in my luteal phase and it knocks about 20 seconds/mile off of my 5K pace.\n\nSame for me. I couldn't tell you which phase of the cycle is which, or what phase I'm in now. I train on a schedule and the run is when the calendar says the run is unless there's something truly emergent going on. If I let myself get into ephemeral but otherwise insignificant things like motivation, my menstrual cycle or the weather (within the limits of safety), I would find an excuse not to run or work out the majority of the time.\n\nSame, I just don’t pay attention to what phase of my cycle I’m in, always focus on effort- which is controllable\n\nMe neither. I just had a crazy high altitude run PR in luteal, and have had fantastic races all throughout my cycle (and not good ones too). I may notice dead legs during shakeout runs in luteal, and for sure higher hunger and being tired, but that doesn't seem to reflect actual race day or times. I don't put much stock in my phases, personally, and I don't think having bad performance expectations due to that is helpful either.\n\nIt absolutely makes a marked difference for women with balanced (or relatively balanced) hormones who experience traditional cycles wherein there’s a follicular phase and a luteal phase. The exception is women with irregular periods, hormonal issues, and/or who are using hormonal BC that inhibits “proper” cycle functioning.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGood to know! Happy training!\n\nUm.  You just told me that my experience is incorrect, and that I must be wrong in thinking I'm a healthy woman who doesn't have a serious problem running at any part of the month. Because all normal healthy women are debilitated by their menstrual cycle. \n\nAre you sure that's what you meant to do?  \n\nAre you a male doctor and it's 1875?\n\n“Debilitated” is a dramatic word choice that I didn’t use. I’m not debilitated by my cycle at all, but I do see performance dips during my LP, even while running and absolutely while lifting. And I did not say you were unhealthy; I simply asserted that some women who don’t experience this have irregular cycles or are on hormones, neither of which is a bad thing. Thanks for putting words in my mouth though! Happy running :)\n\nI said, I don't experience performance dips related to my menstrual cycle. \n\nYou said, actually all hormonally normal women do.\n\nI did not say all. I said women. Not *all* women. Perhaps that was too much of a generalization for your taste but I did not attack you or your body. Honestly, good for you that you don’t see performance dips. It’s certainly easier that way. :)\n\nETA - just to be clear; that’s not a dig. I’m genuinely saying you’re lucky.\n\ni really notice a difference in my endurance and speed. for my last half marathon i was facing the same issue so i used a pill from Wisp to delay / push out my period so i would be in a different phase (not sponsored but here’s a link if you’re curious -  [link](https://hellowisp.com/products/norethindrone). it worked for me! if you’re on the regular pill you can do something similar with the period week/ skip the next one to change the cycle dates\n\nHey there, thanks for the shoutout! We offer Norethindrone Acetate to delay your period at [hellowisp.com](http://hellowisp.com), along with other sexual and reproductive care. This medication is doctor-prescribed and we offer same-day pick up or free delivery. Hope to see you around!\n\nI need more calories and have to prioritize regular meals during luteal to keep my blood sugar stable. My appetite is usually calling for fast digesting carbs and I have to really focus on more protein and complex carbs to keep my blood sugar stable. During follicular I don’t have to think about food as much and just tend to eat whatever/whenever.\n\nMy anxiety/heart rate/wierd body feelings/tiredness all super increase ten days before my period and during I’m exhausted. It’s SO hard to do anything during this time except eat.\n\nRead “Roar” by Dr Stacy Sims. It will walk you through exactly what to do.\n\nJust do your best and see where it gets you. Sorry, I know it isn't very helpful. I feel really cruddy during the luteal phase as well, worse the closer the period is. Tired, sluggish, and I bloat so I feel like I can't fit in my clothes and everything is just difficult, my attitude becomes sour and I feel overtrained and overfatigued. Realising it is because of the hormones and not a personal failure of laziness or losing all my fitness, and that a spike in performance is waiting with all the water weight melting away so I feel comfortable in my body again, has done absolute wonders to my self-esteem. It didn't use to make such a difference, but I suppose our bodies and hormones change over the years, I'm not on BC either. I approach it like knowing a massive heatwave is going to hit: not much I can do about it, I'll do my best and I may still be able to break my PRs, but I'm not going to beat myself up if it won't go my way. Just one of them things. In training I'll take it a little easier for a week.\n\nAh that‘s so frustrating! It does depend on how it affects you personally. For me the main hit is to energy levels so I carry extra snacks and rely on a bit of extra caffeine/ sugar but at the same time, I also know it’s probably gonna feel harder so I also back off on effort and just focus on finishing if it’s not going my way. Similar to running in heat/ humidity – it’s not ideal but powering through and finishing is an achievement in itself and if I have to run slower to do so, so be it.\n\nIt’s hard going. I always find that phase I’m exhausted and runs are harder. When my period starts I feel (usually) super charged. When I have races during that time it’s hard. I usually feel I won’t run great. I try to ignore it and just try to go with it. \n\nI did my first marathon in April during this phase and although I did ok, and got the sub 4 hours I wanted, I think I would’ve done better if my cycle had allowed.\n\nMy 5K PB was on day 1 of my period - I'm one of those people who gets so happy for her period to start because all of the crappy hormones of the week leading up to it are gone and I'm suddenly sleeping better and feeling like I can conquer the world.\n\ni ran my fastest half race in ten years on my period, 1hr 38! but i also get stressed about running and being on because i worry i will be heavy. I'd like to feel like that all the time without the blood :D\n\nNot at all. My cycle never affected me whatsoever. The *most* I had ever noticed was that I played basketball better during Aunt Flo than other times. Zero changes with running… And as I had gotten older (pre-IUD), my period would just come and go. No symptoms, nothing.\n\nI may be the outlier here, but I run best the 1-2 days before, and the first day of.  It's actually sometimes how I can tell it's almost time - I have a GREAT run, breathing is good, feel like I can go on forever.   All that to say - Could be your best race ever!\n\nI feel like I have better blood oxygen levels in my follicular phase and during my luteal I have less. How do I notice this? I just notice it? I track my cycles and am not on birth control. I feel stronger close to ovulation and am currently in my luteal phase and just feel more fatigued. Moreover, my HRV has been shit since I ovulated and my recovery on my garmin since strained because my HRV is so bad. I feel like I haven’t recovered from my 11 mile run this weekend as well as I’d normally recover.\n\nIf you're training to knock out your distance when the stars align and conditions are perfect, you're not really training at all. Stuff goes wrong on race day *all the time.*\n\n\nIf it's too damn hot, too damn cold, too damn humid, or you can't sleep the night before and stagger to the start line, you should still be able to perform on race day even if you don't manage some physiologically perfect finish time. \n\nThis is a great reminder.\n\nThis is gonna sound crazy but bare with me. I’ve had situations where I was supposed to be in luteal for something important and I didn’t want to be. And, 90% of the time, my cycle would randomly change just enough so I could avoid being in luteal for the important thing. Like my past cycle, I was randomly 4 days late which perfectly moved next month’s luteal to avoid an important date. I swear if I think about it enough my body just adjusts. I know it sounds crazy but it’s worth a shot.\n\nI get a crushing fatigue so horrible I can’t even see straight, much less try to run longer than a half mile without getting lightheaded. It’s nasty &amp; getting worse as I get older (hello perimenopause!). It takes a few days to recover before I can do anything useful training-wise. I had a half marathon two days after one of these episodes &amp; I felt like I was running underwater 🥺\n\nI started running again 4 weeks ago. I went from 0 miles to starting a marathon training program. Before that I was strength training 4-6 days a week and about 45min on the peloton 5 days a week. I swapped out 4 days on the bike for runs. First 10 days felt great. Then I hit a wall. I was exhausted and couldn’t understand why. A few days later I got my period and it all made sense.\n\nI am in the same boat!!! My first half ever, and it’s right around day 21!!!!! I have severe PMDD so I stick to a pretty strict regimen (supplements, no processed food, (vegetarian) high protein and fiber, no grains, no dairy) and have been keeping my long run training the same during my luteal phases leading up to my race. Few things I have found that work kind of ish: 1) SLEEP- honestly if you do nothing else sleep at least 8 hours. 2) hydration, obviously, but go crazy and have so many electrolyte the night before too and during, 3) I carb load the night before bc I need more food during luteal, but I keep them complex aka beans and other fibrous veg and carbs!! (If they are hard on your stomach- don’t do this lol), 4) ASHWAGANDA- I use it sparingly during luteal to treat my Pmdd and I take it the night before my long runs and it makes me not a total miserable person the next day so that (hopefully) I can be in a good enough mindset to continue the run once it gets hard- mindset is everything!!!, 5) finally- advil lol. I never take OTC meds if I can help it, so it works well when I do. I have  small (4oz) coffee, my 2 advil, and half a banana with maple syrup, a tbsp of pb and a sprinkle of salt about 30 mins before, the morning of. That way by the time it starts to hurt… it doesn’t (or doesn’t as bad)- this might be totally wrong for runners, I hate shutting off my inflammatory response, but I am out of options bc my body would be otherwise glued to the floor on my luteal long run days!!!! Hope this helps or gives u ideas!\n\nFor those saying “just don’t do it during luteal” lol- that’s not an option for me or you, so just remember that you choose your experience and you literally can do it!!!!! Just practice coping mechanisms in the meantime, and race day just give it what you can, hope for some adrenaline, and be grateful to your body that it got you through it, regardless of time.\n\nYep, like a snail. My last HM was in luteal fase, and the weather was hot and humid. Worst HM ever.\n\nI’ve never noticed or been aware of how that’s affected me. But I feel like there have been way too many other factors to account for to really tell.\n\nThis is so personal and many women have won championships and Olympic medals during this time of the month so please don’t assume it’s going to negative impact you. I’m not being dismissive of others but there’s no reason to mentally sabotage yourself before you even start.\n\nLady here. What is luteal? Never ever heard this word.\n\nGoogle is your friend.\n\nFor whatever reason my marathons offen falls during my luteal phase. I’ve PRed multiple times. Don’t get hung up on it. I made sure to stay on top of hydration and I had carbs every 25 min instead of every 30\n\nI find week 4 and my period week is actually my best time to train/race, ovulation is horrific!\n\nMy uterine activity has nothing to do with my running performance. Asthma, reflux, allergies, and being prone to runner's trots are the things that mess me up.\n\nNot sure you can do much really, sorry. It sucks. Focus on what you can control (current training through other luteal phases, nutrition, sleep, etc). Good luck, it's tough out there for us gals\n\nYeah I have done races during luteal and it sucks, but I think it is still worth doing the race. Long term, you just have to keep up the consistency regardless and it’s a shame to quit just because the conditions aren’t perfect. Just pay extra attention to your fuelling, water and rest in the lead up. You won’t die.\n\nLook into oxeloacetate as a supplement. It was originally marketed as a metabolic support supplement, but then the creators learned an additional benefit - that it helped with the symptoms of PMS as well. I bought it for the latter, and then was pleasantly surprised that it helped a bit with the former!\n\nIt sucks.\n\nSeriously it's significantly affected! Does anyone else actually think the treadmill is lying to them, on a run after your period just finished and when you're the well leading up to getting the period? Like I am seeing drastically different numbers I feel like I'm seeing things. It makes me wonder how much people get unlucky when they attend races right before they get their period!\n\nI’m sorry I don’t have an answer, but r/XXRunning might be more helpful\n\nCan you not with this sort of thing?\n\n\nOn all of the generic sports subs, it's non-stop men's testicles, their made-up \"low t\" nonsense, and any other huge number of topics about the male body specifically, but every time a woman posts it's \"go to the xx version of this sub; we don't talk about that here\". \n\n\nWhat that does is reinforce that maleness is the default and femaleness is a \"special condition\".\n\nRelax. I was not saying it was inappropriate here. As a woman, I fully support normalizing these things. When I commented, the post was decently old (1-2 hours) and had 0 comments, so I thought she may get more responses on the XX sub. \n\nOh boy with the condescending \"relax\". \n\n\nNo matter your intent, your actions have the same outcomes as when a dude makes a similar comment, and should be judged accordingly.\n\nare you okay?\n\nLow testosterone is absolutely a real condition. But it is about as common and about as relevant to performance as this menstrual phase obsession is. Which is to say, not a whole hell of a lot for the absolute majority of people with those hormones.\n\n100%. For the majority of cases, it's just pharmaceuticals capitalizing on male insecurities around masculinity, coupled with men looking for tidy excuses to justify PEDs use. \n\n\nAnd like the nonsense around menstruation, it all speaks to the right-wing backlash moment we find ourselves in. \n\nI personally would opt out of a race during my luteal phase. There’s just no way I would want to push through that\n\nI have been tending to feel more anxiety during the latter half of my cycle, which can make anything involving logistical planning — say, plotting out runs or strength workouts — a lot more time consuming, if it happens at all. I also tend to be a lot more unfocused and have brain fog since I started getting periods again (I went without them for a good 3-4 years) but I don’t find this affects my running. "

I planned my weekend route specifically so I could hit a couple gyms during my regular 10k.\n\nI'm a scout master and we have a gym at our meeting place. I often get bullied by the kids for controlling the gym. But the response is the same. \"Get gud scrubs\"\n\nExperience has taught me that the bar for trusting a fart is much higher when running.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is legitimately how I discovered I am able to maintain a much higher pace than I thought and for longer than I thought.\n\nGot the “feeling” like 3 miles away from my house. Not a portapotty in sight, nor even some woods for a dignified nature shit.\n\nI broke some serious mental barriers that day and ran faster than I thought I was capable of just to reach home and the porcelain throne of shame.\n\nWhat about when it gets so bad that feel as though you have an inflated balloon in your tummy, and every step feels like a cave troll trying to pound the gates open? For me there’s definitely a point where I have to slow down.\n\nYeah, bubble guts is definitely a thing too, especially too soon after a fatty/large meal.\n\nMy situation was more like... torpedo loaded in the tube and launch is imminent lol.\n\nI prefer “turtling” or “crowning” but I also love how many choices there are.\n\nPrairie-dogging, if you will.\n\nYea, there's a sweet spot, where any slower won't get you there fast enough and any faster makes it worse.\n\nThe username checks.\n\nI’m dying\n\nOr if you absolutely can’t hold it in and have to stop to visit the porta-john, it’s on the day those precious seconds will cost you a PR or BQ. I lost a BQ TWICE because of emergency trots 🤦🏻‍♀️\n\nThe ole shit sprint…\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, what is a good binding food?\n\nCheese? 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nI hear your gator story, but can do better.  In junior high track, I was running the 3200 and was dead last.  Everyone finished and I came up behind them, crossing the line and everyone pity cheered for me, but I still had a lap to go.  Some lady in the crowd said REALLY loud (while laughing), \"How many laps does he have left?\"  Literally 35 years ago, and I'm still dying with embarrassment thinking about it.\n\nJust think of it this way, the lady in the stands probably couldn’t finish a lap at all.\n\nI would've ran to the stands and shat on her shoes\n\nReminds me of my failed track and field excursion in Jr. High. Got a great time on some 100m or 200m sprint in practice, but when the actual meet came around, I placed dead last. The teammate, whom I probably beat in practice, was laughing and joking about how \"fast\" I was. I did not sign up for track again. Was such a toxic team with coaches who didn't know what the hell they were doing. I don't actually remember if I was even coached on anything I was doing once. It was a laissez faire style of leadership. Now I'm my own coach running marathons with an authoritarian type leadership style.\n\nI made my Strava username Big Slut because I thought it was funny. Promptly forgot. Years later realize that anyone in my neighborhood who's on Strava must get emails that say \"Big Slut dethroned you\" when I pass them on the app. Also recently started getting follow requests on Strava from strangers that don't seem very active on the app.\n\nAhahaha. You were the local legend!\n\nBig Slut is the Local Legend. 🤣🤣🤣\n\n😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\nI ran a 10k race, and afterwards when I was bending over catching my breath I noticed I was wearing 2 entirely different shoes.\n\nLook at it this way, everyone else probably thought you did on purpose.\n\nWere they at least both yours?\n\nThey were mine, but this is the really embarrassing part; one was a bright coloured runner, the other was a black leather-topped runner I would wear to work.\n\nStill have no idea how I left the house like that, and at no point leading up to or during the actual race did I notice (and no one else commented, maybe they figured it was for a medical condition or something).\n\nnext time you should do it again but swap them out at 5K to balance it out 👍\n\nI’m jealous of people who can just throw on shoes like this and run. I’m so uptight and persnickety about the fitment of my shoes.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSame! I usually get about a mile in before I have to retie them. Most days, it’s just once - but some days I just can’t seem to get them right. Doesn’t help that I have narrow feet through the middle but require at least a medium sized toe box, high arches, and my left foot is ¼ size smaller than my right (I’ve been told I’m close to needing two pairs of shoes - one size for each foot). \n\nWhat helped me out was the heel-lock tie method. It doesn’t work on all of my shoes, but for a few styles it’s been a blessing. \n\nhttps://www.locklaces.com/blogs/resources/how-to-tie-a-heel-lock\n\nIt also helps stabilize your ankle and cures shin splints.\n\nThat’s great to know. I’m fortunate that I’ve never had issues with either. But now that I’m middle-aged I should probably make sure I’m taking these sort of preventative measures to ensure they continue to stay at bay.\n\nI’m beyond middle age, started running/exercising at 54. I have very weak ankles and this tying method made a significant difference. \n\nGive it a try, as always, your mileage may vary.\n\nFor sure. It works really on some of my shoes. Others, not so much. I like a snug fit and that can be hard to achieve with laces that slip a lot when tying them.\n\nWhen I was young it didn't matter that much but now I need that support and extra width for those long runs. I understand completely.\n\nThat’s hilarious\n\nThis is amazing\n\nHow 😂\n\nI tripped on concrete in front of a family taking senior pictures for their daughter. Pretty sure they captured the descent, too, but didn’t ask them to prove it.\n\nI sometimes wonder how many pictures exist where I've been in the background looking doofy!\n\nThe best are the race photos where I look like I’m suffering. It’s not inaccurate but still, they don’t have to out me like that.\n\nDon’t worry, I’m pretty sure there’s only a tiny percentage of people that manage to look human in race photos. Even when I try to smile at someone or a photographer I can’t get the corners of my mouth to go up so I just sort of…gurn?\n\nNobody saw me do this thank god but APPARENTLY I didn’t completely empty my colon before going out on a run and around 4 miles in ended up hiding in a copse of trees by the side of a country road.  Did I mention it was winter and the ground was frozen?  So I had to scrape dead leaves over my shame like a cat in a too-shallow litter box.\n\nI got bubble guts on a solo hike with my dog once when it all hit me like a brick building coming down. Thankfully it was the middle of a week day but there's like... No cover. Tried to use a dog bag. Twas the wrong choice. At least my dog had a bandana.\n\nEmphasis on “had”\n\nThis story legit made me lol 😂\n\nIt's definitely funnier now that I've survived the embarrassment!\n\nThis happened to me and it was haunting. Worst part was did a similar run a few days prior and almost shit myself 6 miles in but finished another 4 miles and rushed to the bathroom. Then I do the same route a few days later and get the bathroom urge at almost the same spot but this time I just cannot hold it. Thank God it wasn't a super busy road and there was tree cover but still I can't believe I shit in someone's yard and covered it with leaves 😭\n\nHappens to me several times a year 😢.\n\nDoing a threshold run on a trail near my house.  Checking my heartrate on my watch at what was apparently the same time another runner was doing the same thing coming the opposite direction.  \n\nFull speed ran into each other on an 8 foot wide trail, in broad daylight.\n\n😂atleast it's their embarrassing story too. Would've been worse if it was a woman with a pram or something\n\nOh what I would give to have seen that IRL\n\nOk, this wins!!\n\nYou did a hell of a lot  better than the kids who never went to cross country at all.  My most embarrassing running story is the time I fell off the treadmill at the gym in front of everyone because I was wiping the sweat off my face with my tee shirt. Apparently blocking your vision on a treadmill causes you to immediately lose your footing.\n\naware husky terrific snobbish square chief different plant grab bear\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\n&gt;Apparently blocking your vision on a treadmill causes you to immediately lose your footing.\n\nAs does stopping and crouching down to tie your shoe.\n\nI was running on a treadmill and I thought there was sweat dripping down my leg, but it was actually my period. Cleaning up the mess in public was a nightmare because everyone noticed and thought that I was hurt. They kept offering to help. \n\nLike, no. I'm just a woman with an irregular cycle. Nothing to see here, folks.\n\nOh, noooo!\n\nOh no! This didn’t happen on a run but I once started my period in the middle of a choir performance. I could feel the blood dripping down my leg for ages and had to try to prevent it from dripping on the floor. You can’t imagine how quickly I ran to the bathroom after the set\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe winner of the last half marathon I ran, with over 3000 participants, was rumored to have shit himself.  I was not close enough to him to confirm lol.  It at least prompted an interesting discussion in our group about the things we would do to get a big PR.\n\nI smell/see this on one or two runners just about every marathon I run. I try to quickly move away so I don’t puke. 🤮\n\nI had to shit in a bush next to a police station and a policeman saw me\n\nwas going inside and asking for the facilities not an option? not on your radar? genuinely curious\n\nhopefully you didn’t get into trouble!\n\nThat shit takes too long\n\nLiterally\n\nI was power walking to the nearest place that had a toilet (which was closer than the entrance to the police station) I could use and just couldn’t make it. The police station is very large and he saw me through a window, through a chain fence. He didn’t say/do anything, just looked away and I walked off.\n\nDid they say anything to you or give you a ticket?\n\nNope. It was through a window, through a chain mail fence. We locked eyes and then he looked away\n\nGot the runs in a popular national park at a weekend, whilst I was in a race. Somehow managed to find a quiet spot to go and bury it. \n\nIt did get me to re-evaluate my entire food strategy for longer races, which has definitely helped prevent a repeat.\n\nWith me it's not so much a food strategy as a poop strategy. I try to give myself a full hour of attempts just to make sure I'm empty.\n\nDefinitely! I noticed that a cup of coffee gets things going, so I'll down one and wait. 😄\n\nShoot a coffee then star jumps to \"warm up\"\n\nBoth for me - eat the wrong thing during the race and it's going to cause problems!\n\nAny recommendations on what to eat?\n\nI find it's really personal, so get out there and experiment on your training runs! Practising eating strategies is often overlooked.\n\nFor me, pre-race must have a strong coffee to help start \"empty\" as it were. \n\nI tend not to like sweeter things, I usually go for salami, cheese, Bombay mix, coated nuts and some of the specialist flapjacks you can get, plus cereal bars. This is what I would take for a day out btw, rather than a half marathon or marathon.\n\nI do sometimes use powdered drinks to help the energy intake. I use Mountain Fuel (who also do the flapjacks) but others are available. \n\nGood luck finding something for you!\n\nAbsolutely splatted on a run and looked up (from the ground) to see my dog trying to eat a girl's breakfast sandwich out of her hands. He'd swerved and basically bodyslammed me just to get a chance at that sandwich.\n\nWas doing a night run and jammed a press-on nail against my thigh, making it snap off and fall. I had an event literally the next day that I had just put the damn things on for, so I stopped, turned on my phone light, and started hunting for it. Like two minutes later a couple stopped alongside and went \"oh what are you looking for, we'll help!\" Didn't want to tell them it was a stupid *acrylic nail*, so just pretended to pick something off the ground and went \"omg my earring, got it, thanks!\" and ran off.\n\nThat's so painful! Breaking nails is the worst.\n\nI was running around the lake on the walking path and going really fast and these 2 ladies parted way to let me run between them. Right then, I tripped over the concrete that was raised like 2 inches for no reason. Went flying like superman past them and skinned my hands so bad. They were super sweet though and asked if I was okay. Said they thought I was coming up behind them on a skate board I was moving so fast lol.  \nOn second thought, more embarrassed from that time I ran my first 400m just for kicks. Ran 1:02 and everyone else ran 47-53. Absolutely smoked me in front of a huge crowd. In my defense, was exhausted from the 1500 &amp; 3000m races. Was kinda special circumstances because it was a summer usatf meet where I was in the older 17-18 age group (even though I was still 16 for awhile, but it’s based on age by dec). That age group is very sparse compared to younger age groups so everyone could fit into one heat with no qualification standards. Got like 15 long seconds of pity claps.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, they had me do one of the long distance track races because the number of entries for it was so low that we would get team points even if I were last.  (I mostly ran 800s at that time.) I had a whole lap left after the others had finished and I had to go around them to keep going as they were just standing in front of the finish line... In retrospect I probably could have just stopped as the people running the race clearly weren't counting my laps.\n\nI have a counter story, more annoying than embarrassing. I was a distance runner in track, for fun the coach stuck me on the 100. I was actually a fast sprinter, just the best distance runner on our team so I was always reserved for distance. Anyway. I clearly came in second place but whoever did my time clock must have confused me with the last place person and so that time was forever on my stats. Anytime I asked my coach to do another 100 they laughed at me because my one stat for that race was so slow :(\n\nWas running at night, flying along and hit a chain that was across a path.  Hung there for a while.  Pissed blood for a week.\n\nNot embarrassing but nasty—dropped my AirPod case in a porta potty during a race. Ewwwweeww\n\nDefinitely gagged a little reading this. Did you pick it back up??\n\nPick up the case???\n\nI think the rule is you have to burn the actual AirPods once the case touches that porta-potty blue.\n\nI lost a water bottle to this one time.\n\nLeave everything outside on the ground in a small plastic bag - it serves two purposes. 1)lets everyone know that it’s occupied, and 2) keeps things from touching anything inside (or falling in).\n\nThe good news is the airpods inside the case will stay clean!\n\nAt my first high school track meet, I got confused about where the race ended and stopped way too short. My coach yelled, “WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GO!!!” so I picked back up, but it was too late. I got an incredibly slow time and coincidentally never got a chance to run that distance again, so I was just at the absolute bottom of the leaderboard for that event for the entire season. It’s the closest I ever got to a school record, just in the wrong direction!\n\nAlso, a few years ago, I was training for my first marathon during the winter and wasn’t paying attention to my fueling. I was in a park and way too far from home when I got super thirsty…so I waited until I got in a secluded area and ate some snow off the ground haha. It did the trick for both quenching my thirst in the moment AND making me realize the importance of hydration.\n\nUghhhh. Your first story reminds me of my last 5k. They had THREE strips across the ground at the finish line, so I stopped sprinting after the first one, thinking that was the official finish. When people kept running past me, I realized the third one ahead was the actual finish line that recorded your time. I'm still pissed about that.\n\nUghhh oh no!! That’s so frustrating. Hopefully that means a PR the next time! Haha\n\nRipping massive farts that sounded like atomic bombs... shouldn't be doing that shit when you have noise-canceling on.\n\nThat's why they call them \"Shokz\" -- the headphones that allow you to hear your own butt trumpeting. 📯 👍\n\nFirst ever half marathon was a very small local race, no port a potties at the starting line. None. I had gotten there early to do a couple nervous tinkles but obviously...could not. Ok, I think, it's probably gonna be fine. It was not fine. 3 miles in and I'm like yeah I really do have to actually pee for real. I ducked off the course into some trees so hide from the other runners but in my hurry did not realize that my ass and stream was fully visible to the cars driving on the other side of said trees. Until one honked. \n\nLast September I stepped off a curb in the last kilometer of my run and felt my ankle go sideways. I tried to get my arms under me as I fell but only ended up landing on my left elbow and breaking it in two places. I had to call my neighbor to come pick me up off the curb and take me to the hospital. \n\nI also landed in a patch of grass that was full of sticker plants, so she had to pick the burrs off my butt before I could get in the car.\n\n&gt;I also landed in a patch of grass that was full of sticker plants, so she had to pick the burrs off my butt before I could get in the car.\n\nThat sounds like some aggressive farming, u/[Aggressive-Farmer798](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aggressive-Farmer798/)!\n\nHoisted by my own petard, I was\n\nDid you manage to save your ankle?\n\nI turned it pretty good, but the swelling went away after a day or two. I didn't even feel it, mostly because I had Bigger Problems.\n\nI’m here for the poop stories lol\n\nRight?? Shocked (not really) there’s so many\n\nThat story goes to my grave ROFL\n\nLast week I had to run into a brewery, wait in bathroom line while sweating profusely, and shit my brains out. I think the stomach pain and panic of shitting myself in public was the making me sweat more than the actual run. Made it by seconds then took the shit walk of shame past about 20 people who knew what was going on in there.\n\nI made the mistake of eating beans before going on a run. Let's just say the only running I did was to a toilet and not much else.\n\nMy first half marathon took place in and around a city park (in a city I had never been to). The start/finish line was in the main area of the park near all the parking lots, playgrounds, picnic areas, etc. At the start of the race, the course took us straight out of that area and onto trails. Most of the course was running a big loop on these trails and doing an out and back section on a road.\n\nThe end of the race took us back into the main part of the park, where apparently to make it to 13.1 miles, the course turned into a convoluted mess of a route weaving around and between the picnic areas and playgrounds. For some reason, this was the only part of the route without people directing the runners, and instead there were just small signs stuck into the ground next to the sidewalk. It was a stormy day and several of the signs had blown over. I ended up totally messing up the route, taking the wrong path, and running through the finish line from the wrong direction. As I approached the finish line, there were a bunch of people just standing around on the path, and totally confused, I was yelling out “LOOK OUT! COMING THROUGH! ‘SCUSE ME!” I crossed the finish line, went to stop Strava, noticed I had only run 12.5 miles, saw runners coming from the opposite direction, and noticed the confused and dirty looks I was getting from the people around me. I realized what had happened, sprinting back through the finish line, retraced my steps, found where I had made the wrong turn, and finished the route from there. But my chip time was obviously already inaccurate.\n\nI was absolutely mortified in the moment and embarrassed afterwards when my friends asked me how it went, so much so that I ended up running another half a few weeks later.\n\nI was running a race and I felt great and was pushing the pace, trying to finish strong, as I was passing someone a bug flew straight down my throat, I made a noise like a dying cat and then threw up.\n\nTried to out kick a guy at the end of a 10k who was coming on quick in the 400m. Downtown small town during a festival. People are screaming for the dude. I'm just trying to have some fun at the end of a 10K PR attempt. Turns out, the dude was the winner of the half marathon that ended in the same place. I felt like an idiot.\n\nI ran a 5k race and after I finished at the time station the attendant said “hey you were sixth in your age category!” I said “thanks, how many in my category?”\n“Six.”\n\nI was running at a park near my old middle school that I always go to. Well on this day I guess the gym class sent the kids to go run/walk at the park where I was. Eventually I started getting yelled at by the gym teacher for going the opposite way…. I was 30 years old at the time\n\nDid he think you were a student?\n\nYeah he thought I was one of the kids in his class even tho I’m a 6 foot 4 thirty year old\n\n8 miles in to what is currently my worst half marathon time, I had an every gel EXPLODE on me. Combination it was a hot day and I ripped it too aggressively… it went everywhere. For the rest of the race my arm, my leg, my hand, part of my face- all sticky. I tried splashing with some water at an air station but at that point it had baked into my skin. Instant motivation killer and I’m sure I looked absolutely foolish to everyone else.\n\nI was looking at a cute dog and I stepped off the sidewalk and ate shit on concrete. The lady walking the dog pretended not to notice but I can tell that she knew.\n\nOne time, during an awards ceremony, after a 5 mile run, they were doing the top 3 women overall. I averaged 10 minute miles during the race. When they announced 3rd place overall they called my name. I was very confused and went up on stage. As I stood on stage they announced the time of 35 minutes. That's a 7 minute mile. Everyone started clapping and the second place woman congratulated me. I could feel my face turn red. Come to find out they placed my chip on the faster woman's bib. So when she crossed the finish line my name came up.\n\nI've shit myself running more times than I can remember, but the one time I'll always remember was freshman year during summer training. My high school was in the San Gabriel Valley near Los Angeles and a few of our runs took advantage of river trails. One of them I stopped in some bushes, knowing I could not possibly make it to a toilet, and possibly the luckiest thing that ever happened to me happened when I found a roll of toilet paper hanging from a bush exactly where I'd stopped to squat.\n\nSome homeless person who has probably been dead for 30 years will never know they saved my day that day.\n\nHad a bloody nose on a trail, with heart rate up during a run the amount of blood that comes out of a bloody nose is impressive and all ended up on my shirt. To get home I had to run back on the trail and through downtown looking like a crime victim or zombie\n\nnew fear unlocked\n\nWas on mile 25.99 of a self supported marathon and immediately my stomach started gurgling. Had to pull over behind a dumpster in an alleyway and release the demons\n\nRan a half marathon less than a week after recovering from a stomach bug. You can guess what happened but I still thank god for that gas station i ran past at mile 8.\n\nHigh school cross country camp. Coach puts us on a trail to a waterfall, my guess is about 15 to 20ks. About an hour in I am holding on with all might. I stop to walk so people can pass and when it is quiet I sprint up between the trees( logging camp) and have the most magnificent shit of my life. Grabbed my cheeks and spread em wide cause I had no paper.\n\nAnd sure as the shit sliding out, two groups of runners pass me, completely unaware of the majestic turd I was dumping about 10 meters away from them.\n\n\nSecond one, had greasy chicken for lunch. Wemt for a long run beforw dinner. 4km loop and 2ks in I, once again am holding on, sprinting to the start cause their is a public toilet which I proceeded to destroy before doing the remaining 8ks.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I shit my pants about a quarter mile away from being done running and back to my house. For my husband and I, this was the fastest part of our \"kick\" and me, being ugly competitive, didn't want to slow down. We weren't near any woods, and truthfully, our house was the closest toilet at this point. My husband kept telling me to slow down because I wasn't going to \"outrun the shit\" and that going faster would make it worse.  Well, the inevitable happened, of course. In the midst of all this, a person walks by on the other side of the path and no doubt figured out what was going on. \n\nNot gonna lie, the first few runs following this incident were very anxiety inducing. Now that it's all said and done, my husband confessed he felt awful because he was trying so hard to be supportive and not laugh. 🤣\n\nI was running along a trail that I run a few days a week. A large family of geese were crossing in front of me, there were a lot of (goslings I think). I stopped and let them cross and waited until they were out of the way to start again. As I started running one of them comes after me making this crazy sound that I'll never forget. I sprint about 10 steps maybe before I trip and fall landing in a big pile of rocks. I have cuts all over my face, arms, and back. I get up to dust myself off and the goose had given up the pursuit but there are about 10 cars backed up at a stop sign that all saw everything transpire.\n\nI went running in Austin a couple years ago and about 5 miles in had to take a shit. I was in a park with lots of bathrooms and porta potties so I thought I was good. Every fucking toilet had shit smeared all over the toilet seat and walls and they pissed on all the toilet paper. I didn't shit myself but I had to take an Uber somewhere because I had to stop walking because I didn't want to make things worse. After that I plan all my runs to be closer to fast food places or places I can use the bathroom.\n\nWhen I was a newer runner and didn’t know anything about fueling and had never taken water out with me on a run, I was out at mid day on a hot day. I got light headed mid mile 4 and got a terrible pounding in my ears. It took me an entire 6 months to realize I was just dehydrated and needed fuel and didn’t have a health problem.\n\nCursed with ADHD.I struggle with paying attention. I misunderstood the instructions. There was two ways to run in primary school , on circular track, or sprinting by starting on a circular track and finishing outside of it(so it was a single long straight run with no turns).\n\nOn turn one everyone makes a left turn and i ran straight , smashing into most of my classmates. \n\nI still cant comprehend how i managed to hit so many of them. It was like one of those big cycling crashes.\n\nRan a few long runs in my new shoes and was getting mysterious toe pain. Randomly checked the size of my shoes after a run - turns out I’d managed to buy a pair way too small for me. No idea how I’d managed that! -_-\n\nBought a new pair of the same shoe in the right size and no more mystery toe pain!\n\nshat myself on km 17 of a 23km run in berlin last summer. tried to hold it, realized i couldn't, ran to a cafe, they rejected me as i didnt have any cash, ran to a public restroom - it was out of service. in the center of berlin. shit through my pants. saw a construction site in the distance with a portapotty. ran there with poo starting to come out - it was all locked up. body gave up on me. the worst poo you could ever imagine. just a pile of brown mud everywhere. was basically naked on the side street of berlin covered shit trying to use nearby leaves to clean up as best i could. felt so bad for the construction workers that would've showed up the next day to that mess. ran home in shame and showered in all my clothes.\n\nI once tripped and fell right by the pier. Loads of tourists and other people about. Like 10 people walked past me, one woman stepped over me to get by 😂 hobbled home ashamed and grazed\n\nWore the shock absorber ultimate run sports bra. After 2 miles the back came undone had to jog back holding my boobs\n\nJust did a half marathon this past month. I knew i was on the edge of my goal time at mile 12 and really had to pee. I was actually holding it the whole race. It became unbearable. I just let it go. So gross. Im sure several people noticed as it was happening. But i PRd and hit my goal time. Win?\n\nI was going through some serious health stuff when I first got into running - at that point in time I would get these waves of nausea out of nowhere but I had it kind of down to science that there were certain things I can do to make myself feel better but ehen I got on the treadmill that day, in a public gym, for some reason my whole body just like shut down and it was to the point that I had puke stuck down my throat and partially in my mouth and I knew that if I were to look a certain way and if I stopped focusing on the wooden beam in my gym that I was just going to puke everywhere so I went from running at what I felt was full speed at that point in time to slow walking on the treadmill covering my mouth for like 10 minutes until it passed and I felt well enough to dash out the door. It was really bad, I swear. I've never been so close to projectile vomiting in public in my life and to this day I get ptsd looking at that treadmill 😭\n\nI did cross country one season in high school (I was god awful) and after one of our first long runs, my mom picked me up and about two minutes into our drive home I could feel my insides trying to become my outsides. The closest place to stop was a Hardee’s so I ran in there and just destroyed that bathroom. I think every last bit of stuff I had consumed in the past few days left my body. I didn’t make a mess of the bathroom, but I was in there an embarrassing amount of time and clearly only went into the Hardee’s because I desperately needed the bathroom. Lesson learned - after long runs, know where the nearest bathroom is at all times.\n\nIt was cold. Running in a hoodie. I took it off and tied it around my waist round mile 5. Then the shit pains hit. I did the shit in the bushes thing. No one saw me. I was golden. Fast forward to the end of the race. I got a little chilly and decided to put the hoodie back on. When I lifted the hood to cover my head, all the poop  landed on my head, face, shoulders, etc.  yup apparently I inadvertently shit in my hood when I popped a squat\n\nMy worst run was in the evening on the first day I decided to go from being a pescatarian for a few years, back to a carnivore. I ate a small hamburger that day and went out for a run that evening, ended up doubling over in tummy pain because of the burger and limped home. I had to drink a LOT of water to get the cramping to stop. I realized that if I was gonna go back to animal protein I had to do a slower introduction.\n\nI went around a hurdle during an away track meet in hs 🤣 i placed last in every race except one, it was myself and another first year runner and i won but juuuust barely!\n\nWasn’t paying enough attention when the sidewalk made a jog around a fire hydrant. Right foot landed on the edge of the sidewalk and I fell flat on my stomach, breaking my ankle in the process. Was on a pretty busy road, too.\n\nI tripped and fell in the middle of a run because I crossed paths with a frog. In my effort to evade it, I fell instead. This was almost 10 years ago and I still cringe/laugh when I remember it. Lol.\n\nI’ve had to sprint to a bush for a shit multiple times and wipe with my socks. Always say to my mates that if you see me out with no socks on or even just the one then you know I’ve been caught out haha\n\nCame off a 3-day fast (for religious purposes) the night before (on a Friday). Ate all kinds of junk in foolish celebration of breaking the fast. Woke up on Saturday for a usual weekend long run. Got 1 mile into it and...drums in the deep. I think I can make it to a restaurant or something about a mile ahead, but the cramps get worse with each step. I see a lady getting out of her car to go in her house and I run up to her and try to explain that I have an emergency need to use her toilet. I go in the house and she's a cat lady/hoarder. I sit down on the nastiest toiled seat (vinyl covered foam) I've ever sat on. The bowels evacuate to absolute completion in the loudest manner possible. I walk out and avoid eye contact, thank her for her hospitality, and carry on with the run. A few miles later I stop at a Starbucks with the same problem. Use the phone to call my wife to pick me up. I learned many lessons that day.\n\nI've shat myself 3 different times running. The worst one (disgusting warning) &gt;!it got so bad while i was rushing to my home 1 block away, my pants filled with poop. it dropped and rolled down my leg and dropped into the sidewalk. Nobody saw me but i legit wanted to cry. Had to clean the mess after in my home, and also clean my floor.!&lt;\n\nAdittionally, i shat on a park in 4 different occations because i needed to poop and i could not get to a toilet without shitting myself.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was training for my second 50 miler Trail race at the dirty German outside of philadelphia. I had an up and down training. Turning my ankle a number of times but still able to feel like I was ready for the race. Two days before the race walking down the street towards my birthday dinner hit stretch of uneven sidewalk and turned my ankle so hard it's swelled up like I had a golf ball under my skin. To date my only DNS and embarrassing way to have to miss a race simply walking down the street.\n\nWent to a community run and when we started, I decided to check if the GPS works. I collided with a street lamp resulting in cracked rib and pinkie finger. Couldn't run more than Z1 for next three weeks\n\nHad a bathroom emergency during the Berlin Marathon… no toilet paper in the port-a-potty. Ripped off all my KT tape and um, improvised. 😂\n\nWas out for a long run early on a Sunday morning and became desperate for a restroom. I'm in Utah and it was in an area of endless residential tracts. Spotted a Mormon church and figured it was my best shot. The outer door was unlocked but it seemed empty and mostly dark inside. After wandering a bit I interrupted what I assume was the bishopric meeting in one of the offices. With many apologies I asked if they could direct me to the restroom. They kindly did, but I couldn't find any light switches so I had to feel my way around.\n\nI relate to your high school XC trauma 😭 Thankfully I found my love for running in college on my own terms but those were some dark years lmfao\n\nWent running with the belly rumbles after a night out, years ago. My whole platoon was running the same trail, at our own pace, and I was flying because A)I was still a bit drunk and B)I REALLY didn't know how long I was going to make it. \n\nThen I hit the wall. \n\nNot the typical runners wall. No no no. I reached a point where if I ran any further, I would shit myself and have to run back with it in my shoes. \n\nSo I did the only thing I could think to do, I took several steps off the trail, dropped my silkies, and unleashed a muddy river of what the fuck into the bushes JUST AS MY PLATOON SERGEANT AND PLATOON COMMANDER CAME AROUND THE BEND. They saw it all. \n\nNothing was ever mentioned about it. They kept running. I cleaned up with my socks, and continued the run. Never a word was said. There after though, every time I looked in one of their eyes, I felt like they were thinking about that time they caught a Corporal with the liquor shits blowing up the dirt on a trail between Horno and SOI. \n\nI never did learn my lesson though. Most of the runs I went on for PT, I did with bleary eyes and an overtaxed liver.\n\nHow’s pretending to fracture my ankle to not finish the season? Not my brightest moment. 8 years ago.\n\nOvertaken by a dachshund.\n\nI feel this. I once got passed by a fit young woman and her two wheezing pugs.\n\nI went for a run along the canals, came up on mama geese quite unexpectedly and she was not happy about my presence. Ran at my and squawked so hard I almost fell over backwards, yelped and ran away only to see a guy on the other side of the road literally bent over double from laughing so hard at my capitulation. Geese are my nemesis man.\n\nThis probably isn’t actually my most embarrassing but one of my destination/50 state challenge halfs I ran last year, I guess after all my pelvic organs were super irritable immediately after from the hard effort. At the after party, obviously I was there alone… so I was just chatting with random people. This one couple started talking to me and I didn’t notice that I was actively peeing myself while talking to them. Like full flow, pee dripping down my thighs. I only noticed when I suddenly was thinking “why are my legs this sweaty??” The couple gave each other this awkward look and politely excused themselves from talking to me 😂\n\nI was doing a mud run with my eight year old daughter. I wanted to be the “fun mom.” Towards the end, there was this blow up castle you had to go in and climb through, and my butt was a little bit too big to fit through the entrance (I weighed like 160 lbs so I think the hole was unreasonably small lol) so I was stuck with my front end in the castle and my back end out, like Winnie the Pooh. And then I just felt someone give me a big shove in the ass! I’ve never been so grateful for a kick in the butt. I slid into the castle head first.\n\nI haven't read anyone's response yet but this will be fun to guess. Shitting oneself is going to be a popular response.\n\nCurrently dealing with poison ivy on my WHOLE UNDERCARRIAGE. Yep; I had to urgently run off to the bush to deal with a BM and low and behold I looked down to see I was in a huge patch of poison ivy and my butt cheeks were fully touching the plants. Needless to say to say I am in absolute AGONY. be careful out there!\n\nHad a cold for a couple days and took a couple days off, and the first run back I'm 1.5 miles from home when my nose starts gushing blood.\n\nWalk into Subway to ask to use bathroom to clean up (running into my neighbor I had a crush on) and spent 15 minutes stopping the bleeding, cleaning the blood off myself, and cleaning up the sink.\n\n5 seconds after I start running again, the bleed comes back. I say fuck it and walk home holding my nose closed.\n\nI was running slowly while healing from shin splints, and my run took me through my favorite nearby park. It was springtime and a Saturday morning, so there were a lot of little league baseball games happening. Some teens were hanging out near the bleachers of one of the games (I assume they’d been dragged along to their younger siblings’ game) right by the trail through the park, and as I ran past they mimicked a doofy slow run with exaggerated arm swinging and huffing and puffing. I was mortified and avoided that area for weeks afterward!\n\nShit my pants about a block from my house one time\n\nLost track of time and went for my lunch run at work one day, had my usual breakfast of wheatabix at around 07:30… half way out on a 6 miler I’m feeling ropey. Check my watch, it’s 14:45! I had to forage some blackberries from a bush to make it home 😂\n\nI also saw a “lady of the night” servicing an older gentleman at an underpass one other time…. Good luck to them!\n\nLast week- I was on the treadmill. Someone else came in and went on the treadmill right beside me. After my five minute warm up, I started running. I immediately dropped my headphones and my phone came crashing down. It was so loud in a small hotel gym…. Ugh\n\nTripped over a tree root* and skid landed face first in front of a ton of people. Normally that trail is empty, not this time though - the most people I’ve ever seen there before or since. Due to the toe plate, I didn’t even know I had tripped until I was damn near horizontal and couldn’t get my legs under me fast enough.\n\nI was never a runner. In high school, I threw shotput and discus. At one meet our 400m runner had to drop out, so I volunteered. Not only was I the slowest runner (by a LOT), I didn't even finish.\n\nWhen I ran middle school track I legit forgot my uniform for a meet.\n\nI thought the sweats were a uniform alternate. I wore them with nothing under. Time to run- oops, can’t take off my sweats. \n\nI quit the team the next day and didn’t run again for 15 years.\n\nI did an early morning 14-mile run, but started to get bubbleguts around mile 9. As soon as I got home, it suddenly vanished. Instead of just taking care of it, I decided to make my bed. Then the urge came roaring back, and with a vengeance. I did my best to act quickly, but even if the bathroom were a foot away, it would have been a foot too far. \n\nThe moral of the story is, trust your gut. Or don’t. I’m not sure.\n\nRunning a 15mi in my neighborhood,  its a 1.5mi loop; felt great for about 12mi. Enjoying the night and about mi 13 panic sets in; stomach rambles.. I'm in distress and a half mi away from a turn to get to the house.. pace picks up.. turn the street and can see the house. Gaseous fumes are pouring out as I clinch my cheeks together.. nope not making it. Huge blowout less then 100yrds from my house. The worse part is I can see me on my camera waddling home in shame. \n\nBlow outs suck and I've never had one till then.\n\nI once went for a run, was feeling myself, listening to my music, really a great run. And then, at a bus stop, in front of some people, I tripped on a bump on the sidewalk and planted myself on the ground. Nothing happened to me, I just got up and went on, but I wasn't feeling myself so much anymore 😂\n\nIt took me a long time to realize why people recommend dark colour running shorts. I would sweat right through the liner and shorts. They were blue and it looked like I pissed myself.\n\nBack in highschool I had gotten really sick but I knew I could beat my 5k record. So I went to this meet knowing I'd probably throw up a few times. I made it through the whole race without puking once. The last 300 yards I sprinted to beat my little brother across the finish line. I beat him and my time. He turned and told me good job. I turned to reply and proceeded to projectile vomit across his face and slightly shit myself. We were still in the line up to remove our race tags. So everyone could see it happen.\n\nI was running in Ottawa on that trail behind the parliament and enjoying the view of the river, when all of a sudden I go down hard in a face plant and am completely sprawled on the trail, shins bleeding. \n\nI look back and realized I tripped over a goose! I total didn’t see him, he didn’t move as I was literally running into him, *and* he had the audacity to look smugly at me after I fell. Fucking Canada geese.\n\nMy phone fell in the beginning of a race.\n\nPooped in the woods during a 10k. I can laugh about it now but it was really not good.\n\nMy first 25km trail run, I had the nervous shits and shit in the woods in my first 3km only to find a portal potty at 4km\n\nWent for a run, ran about 0.5 km, had a take a bigggg dump so rushed back home!\n\nLast summer on the first day of a vacation I was in the middle of a long run, feeling amazing. Cut across a small grassy section on a golf course—and suddenly the ground vanished. I stepped into an *enormous* groundhog hole. Sprained my ankle something awful and the hole was so deep I almost snapped my leg! Thankfully no one was around to see me rolling around on the ground and cursing out every gopher in the world, but so embarrassing explaining that injury to everyone for the next two months 🤦‍♀️\n\nHad to shit on the side of the road a couple weeks ago. Wiped with a sweatshirt that I really liked. Drove back to get it so I could throw it in the trash and it was gone. \n\nA little over a year ago I was on a normal morning run - 5 miles, easy pace.  About 1.5 miles from home I was distracted (looking at new construction) and just fell off the side of the road - caught the edge of the asphalt that dropped off about 6\" onto dirt.  It hurt, but was just so unbelievably random and stupid, I was in denial about being badly injured so I just slowly walked home.\n\nTurned out, I broke my leg at the ankle.  \n\nThe worst part was later when people asked about the cast and what happened.  I'd brush it off, citing a fall while running.  They'd kindly reply that it was easy to fall in the dark.  At that point I didn't even have the heart to tell them that when I fell it wasn't very dark.\n\nSo embarrassing.\n\nI feel like everyone has a poop story, but really if you don't have a poop story have you ever really run?\n\nI was training for a half marathon along a trail in the burbs and right at the turnaround point, 5 miles out, my bowels started churning aggressively. I have no idea how it came about but it was immediate go time. Luckily, there was a strip mall nearby. I couldn't even walk straight I've never clenched so hard! I go to the first store I find and walk right up to the cashier to ask for a restroom. There's no restrooms for customers. At this point I'm sweating and can't even stand up straight. I'm sure everyone around can tell what's about to happen. But I steel myself and shuffle very awkwardly and very quickly across the huge parking lot over to a grocery store. I beelined to the restroom and just barely made it to the toilet.\n\nI was in no condition to run after that so I walked the rest of the way back to my car. Five very slow miles.\n\nPurchased some running gels and in the package was a free packet of stuff to put in your drink.  Tried it on a training run with my neighbour.    You can probably guess, but pretty much immediate cramps and had to say to my neighbour \"you run ahead, i just need to pop behind this tree for a wee\".    Yeah was pretty much a wee but not from where you'd expect!!   Also was wearing hi-vis and it was winter so hardly inconspicuous.   At least I tested it in training and not race day!!\n\nI used to run with some guys from work, and one of them had worked out a good route nearby. Did it with them a few times, then went out solo when they were otherwise occupied. Somehow, I completely forgot the route and got lost. Luckily my random, lost wanderings at least took me to an area I knew, allowing me to find my way back.\n\nAt least I put in a good distance.\n\nI once was running fairly happily through a bit of grass... then my foot got stuck in a rabbit hole mid stride.... proper cartoon style instant fall flat on my face....\n\nSo I was at Ripon College for Badger Boys State one summer. I decided to go on an early morning run, and I never run that early. My stomach did not appreciate the change in schedule. Luckily out in the trails there just happened to be a nice circular area tucked away surrounded by trees. Perfect! I do my business hoping to never think of it again.\n\nA year after I'm back for a college tour and the lady is excitedly explaining the map of their campus trails. Low and behold I pooped in the outdoor classroom. I can only hope I can only hope I became a specimen for someone studying the local wildlife\n\nI was running with my gf on city sidewalks at dusk and then BAM! took a shot to the huevos grandes. It was an unmarked guy (support) wire for a power pole that I straddled at full speed. That was a longest mile home. Usually they have pvc pipe or something over them but not this one.\n\nRan track for a year in high school and was the last leg of our distance medley which was the 1600m. Our team was real bad, and at one meet we had been lapped during the first three legs of the relay. I crossed the line to start my fourth lap as the leaders were finishing. The officials were confused and told me that I was done, but I had to explain I had only done 3 so far and had to shamefully run another lap as the only person on the track. That was my last year running track lol\n\nAbout 15 years ago on an unusually hot summer's day in the UK I decided to go out for my scheduled 10 mile run wearing thick jogging bottoms and a tee shirt.\n\nAs I left the house my mum pointed out that it was hot, and I should wear shorts and take water.\n\nI told her it was only 10 miles I'll be fine (I was very fit at the time).\n\nFour miles in I had to call her for a ride home after I basically keeled over in the heat. She found me laying down under the shade of an apple tree in a north Wiltshire village green. She brought me water and a big \"I told you so\", all I had to offer were feeble gratitudes.\n\nMum knows best.\n\nListening to music on a long run in a busy park. Between songs, I kept hearing this really rhythmic bird chirping. After the 4th song, I thought “what is this bird and why is it tracking me?!” Except it was just the sound of my thighs scraping against each other in my new tights.\n\nI got lapped in a 300m sprint 🤦🏾‍♀️"

    "all_comment_text": "Yes! Let's do it again! Even though I fail it every year when the finals come 😅\n\nSame here! But I have a feeling this will be the year I can stick with the plan \n\n(This is also what I have told myself every year)\n\nHey, you wanna fail it together?\n\nthis kind of reminds me of slowtwitch's a mile a day or something\n\nRad, good challenge it is well and truly achievable. I am on day 692 of this exact challenge \"5k a day\"\n\nI run about 8km 5 or 6 days a week (this year so far 260 of 327 days = 5.6 runs/week, total of 2,163km, average of 46km/week or 6.6km/day) but running every single day for 2 years.... that's really something !!\n\nI realise the answer is going to be \"*just get find the time and get out there*\" but any particular tips or technqiues for specific challenge such as holidays, bad weather, ill health, family commitments etc ? \n\nI had 2 flights of over 25 hours this year and let me tell you they don't like you running up and down the aisle of the plane at 35,000 feet (I did consider running around the mid-flight terminal but thought better of it)... what's been the toughest or proudest times of keeping that streak going?\n\nHonestly I just make the time, will run at 11pm at night if I have to, I run in the rain if i have to and that is it, there are no excuses. I have been really fortunate not to get sick very often but when I have I just ran slow, apart from a week of phenomena where I was physically not capable to run nor did I feel safe trying. My response to this was walking the distance instead.\n\nAs for the travel, i have had two overseas trips in that time to the USA. I just made sure I ran the day I took off and the day I landed. I can't help the date line issue it's out of my control and it's not fair on others on a flight to try and impose myself on them by trying to clock a 5k distance that probably wouldn't record properly anyway.\n\nHappy to share my Strava for anyone who want to call BS on my effort.\n\n&gt; it's not fair on others on a flight to try and impose myself on them by trying to clock a 5k distance that probably wouldn't record properly anyway.\n\nI'm impressed that you not only considered the option of \"just run up and down the airplane aisle\", but rejected it (at least in part) because the effort wouldn't count on Strava. That's a whole other level of commitment above the usual push to get those miles in! \n\nHow many \"laps\" to make 5k in a typical transoceanic flight?\n\n&gt;How many \"laps\" to make 5k in a typical transoceanic flight?\n\nAn A380 cabin is almost exactly 50m long (50,68m). So it would be 100 times that. Definitely doable but highly suspicious if someone would try this!\n\nBut just measure the distance over ground and you're done with a trip to the bathroom :)\n\nlol it was less about the recording and more about practicality. But yes lol\n\nAbsolutely *not* calling BS, just genuinely interested.\n\nI'm in the UK and while the winters aren't too bad... the British weather has a reputation for being .... grim... so although I actually tend to run the most over winter, there are times when the dark and the drizzle and icy pavements just makes things a little discouraging. On the other hand, a month in Australia (hence the long flights) I tried to keep up my running but even tho I used to live there and am used to the weather, I just found it too warm most of the time to be able to run (plus.. life...).\n\nPersonally I find I don't mind running in the rain or in the cold, but I do dislike *starting* my run in the rain or the very cold so I find I'm waiting for a break so I can start. I'm not really a treadmill runner but I guess that would make life easier.\n\nI've run every day in January in rural Britain. Headtorch, banging soundtrack and off you go. Some days the weather is shite and you don't want to leave the sofa but if you've committed to the challenge, you go out. I'm often very glad to finish my run and come back in to the warmth and dry but I'm always glad to have done it.\n\nAgree - I managed every day but one last January (250km for the month)... wife thinks I'm mad taking up running at my age but I tell her it keeps me off the streets... er... well.. it keeps me on the streets but you know what I mean :)\n\nI’m in Brisbane so it can get rather hot during summer, and I can appreciate winter being tough in UK, but at the end of the day it’s all mental. I think of a quote that also helps drive me. “Be prepared to sacrifice for what you want, or what you want is your sacrifice” I really think that is perfect.\n\nI have definitely ran at the Paris airport during a 5 hour layover to keep my streak alive. You can definitely find time! It just means that when you wake up that you think about when in the day are you going to do your run. My rule is if I can get it done early I will instead of being like I have time later tonight as things might always come up.\n\nwhoa, how did you do this? is it in the terminal or outside? i want to do it in my 2-3 hour layover in an upcoming flight connection but i think anything beyond walk might be really awkward.\n\nI did it in the terminal. I only had a backpack so brought a change of clothes and had to do 4 laps. I did run at a more casual pace and tbh I think most ppl thought I was just trying to chase my flight. Only when I did the 4th lap and ppl saw me again did they notice but honestly it's more in your head than not! Think about if it was switched and you saw someone running and realized they were running and not chasing a flight, you would probably say good for them 🤣 if anything I provided them entertainment.\n\nthank you for a detailed response! i am def gonna try this now. i might do a casual pace too but kinda worried if i can pack everything into checkin and have a small backpack only to carry on, will figure that out. i would be really happy (and envious) to see someone running! xD \n\ni assume you were running with your backpack on as well?\n\nYes I did run with my backpack. I was hoping to find a cart but unfortunately wasn't able to.\n\ngreat!, wow, running with a cart is more fun, specially on the 4th lap.\n\nI have a streak of nearly three years now of at least one mile a day. Usually I run about 4km.\n\nThere have been days where I ran around an airport terminal for a mile and I have also done rounds around my tent on a plateau in Sweden. But I never had to quit. But sure, I don't do 25 hour flights\n\nSame, my run this morning was day 3,855\n\nEveryday without a day off ?\n\nCorrect, it’s been over 10.5 years now. Even with multiple trips between the US and Africa where I run in the morning, fly for 19-25 hours, and run at 7pm after I land there the next day.\n\nWow that is hectic, I definitely thought 1k was a lofty goal man. That is outstanding. \n\nI do however get how that could happen, 25min each day isn’t too much to spare and when it’s the norm is very easy to roll on with\n\nDamn. I've been doing 5k on weekdays for two years. I couldn't imagine doing it 7 days a week.\n\nSame… the bod wants recovery days\n\nMine wants pizza and beer days\n\nThat why I run so I can have those pizza and beer days ha\n\nNot really, everyday isn’t full tilt. Some days I just cruise and I am hardly even trying. I don’t feel fatigued feel like I’m pushing myself, your body kinda tells you hey it on today or it’s not when you first get going 🤣\n\nCurious what your body type is.  Do you do any weight lifting?  I’d love to run daily, but worry about maintaining muscle and having the energy to still incorporate heavy lifting days.\n\nI was thinking that if we ran further than 5k on our running days, we could bank the extra distance and take days off. But I'm a rebel that way.\n\nI can't help myself, I've got to be that guy:\n\nchallenges are fun, but for most people it's not a healthy/sustainable idea. Training needs recovery, period. So either\n\na) running 5k is that much below your fitness level that the training stimulus is super low and you won't need a rest day for the next 4 weeks - or\n\n b) running 5k every day becomes challenging after a couple of days and it would be a decent training stimulus, if you body would receive adequate recovery.\n\nScenario a) simply won't improve your training much, but at least it won't hurt you.\n\nScenario b) is unproductive at best and harmful at worst.\n\nAll this said, do it if you find it motivates you but if you feel sore/super tired/fatigued don't push through it just to earn some Internet points. Do the sensible thing and take a rest day instead.\n\nI feel like you're leaving out scenario c) vary the pace you run at day to day so the majority are easy and 1-2 a week are harder to provide training stimulus\n\nGood point.\nAnd while we're at it, why don't we turn one 5k into a 12+K long run, one into a 9+K medium long run and...eventually we have a great training plan!\nBeyond my sarcasm your point is absolutely valid. But my issue is that there are so many misconceptions about how to do sustainable running training already. This challenge can be modified so that it is useful, IF you already know what you are doing. If you don't know much, you will likely see this challenge and think \"oh, so grinding it out every day is what I have to do to become a better runner\". It's the same with all the \"100 pushups every day!\" etc. kind of challenges. Reading \"listen to your body: if you're sore, recovery is the best thing you can do at that time to improve your ability\" is way too boring and doesn't score any ego/Internet points.\n\nI could do it 3-4 days a week, but not 7. ~22 miles a week is already well above my record weekly mileage.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou'd feel garbage after 4 weeks of running 1/3 your usual mileage?\n\nSort of agree.... but equally I see the challenge aspect that motivates people\n\nI did the [10,000 kettlebell swings](https://t-nation.com/t/the-10-000-swing-kettlebell-workout/283408) thing a few years back and did it, as suggested, mostly as 2 days of 500 followed by a days rest, and repeat.. if only to avoid straining my grip (and it's bit funny to take a 24kg kettlebell on a train trip to a weekend away).\n\nIt was sort of interesting but I didn't notice any radical effects that others report (although by the end I could easily do the 100-rep clusters as a single set without breaking down form).\n\nI find the odd challenge useful, but I tend to keep them private... some people are goal oriented but I find I just enjoy the process\n\nI found it fun and useful-ish when I was a newer runner with an established base that could support it, but not such a high base as to trivialize it.  It was a fun way to run through the holidays, and I varied the runs (recovery, tempo, intervals, one TT).  It wasn't ideal for training, but it was near-enough to still be useful.\n\nSome years later I'm less interested.  My day off is for recovery from hard efforts rather than a lack of drive to get out the door and the mileage no longer makes much sense.\n\nStill, I think there's a group of people who run around 15-25mpw that it's not hugely destructive for.\n\nFor a month timeframe, it’s an ok novelty activity.\n\nBut yeah, for longer, streaks start to get into awkward spots when you realize it’s not gonna end and the novelty’s gone. I know someone who is over 1000 days of running at least a mile a day. At that point, surely the idea of getting a goal is accomplished?\n\nIt feels like the inevitable outcome is that you’re genuinely sick or injured, and you try to force yourself to run anyway so as not to break your massive streak. Not great.\n\nI am one of those people. I'm on day 1089 now. \nAnd it started with this challenge three years ago. I did the whole month of December, than a had a race coming up on the 15th January and just keep going and going and...\n\nA mile a day is easily accomplished. It's just ten minutes getting out of the house. I don't have to run fast or something. \n\nDoes it have a training effect? I do have a normal running schedule outside of that mile. With two longer runs in the weekend and a bit of sprint training under the week. So I'm definitely getting better at running even with the streak.\n\nAm I more prone to injuries? Not really. I'm not an extreme runner with going above and beyond, so the free extra steps per day don't really hurt. \nBut I'm definitely less sick since I started. Except for a case of COVID at the beginning I hadn't had a cold or something in three years.\n\nAnd it massively improves the mental health.\n\nDo you weight lift as well?  I run about 25 miles a week, but lift on days off/3 times a week.  I don’t think I’d be able to run every day and also maintain lifting schedule.  I wish I could.  I love running more.\n\nI probably should. But I don't. \n\nIn theory we have strength training every Wednesday but I skipped it for quite a while now.\n\nI like running more. When I have time, I bike a bit, bit other than that it's mostly running. \n\nOh, and yoga.\n\nAnd I don’t want to come across as telling you that’s all a bad idea. I did it for like 6 months, only got to like 200 days. A mile a day to keep the streak alive isn’t gonna harm training or injury. For me, it was a simple jog around the block in the morning to start the day. If I wanted to really train, I’d do it after work.\n\nI am amazed that there is not a day in 3 years where you just simply can not run. I’ve had days where I was bed ridden ill, or on flights for 12 hours from another continent. Just some windows where running was not gonna happen\n\nIt helps that I don't fly intercontinental. And maybe that I life a simple live. Most days I work from 8-4 pm, get home, do my chores and after dinner I go running. On the weekends I do the longer runs. \n\nWhen on holiday I just run in the morning. \n\nI had maybe ten days where I had to do a dumb run. Like running around an airport terminal or a stadium like at the Olympics in Paris this year. But other than that there weren't and extraordinary runs \n\nAnd for illness: I hadn't had a cold or something for three years and I would say it's because of the running. \n\nAnd to be honest: a mile isn't that much. That's like 1600 steps. That's the bare minimum one should walk in a day. I just happen to jog it.\n\nthis. i wanted to do a 5 km a day challenge the past two months but instead did it 150-155 km a month on average. having a few long runs, short runs and occasional 1-2 day break made it so much better.\n\nBest I can do is 0.5k before my shins start hurting\n\nFor years I had this problem, I genuinely didn’t understand how people could run more than 1k. A friend of mine who is a pretty decent runner said It was shoes. I went and got proper shoes and never looked back.\n\nThat was my situation, not saying yours is the same, but there is something you’ve go going on that causes this. I started running at 100kg so not the lightest and I found my problem and it wasn’t being heavy.\n\nAgree regarding the weight\n\nWell, do that 10 times a day and you're fine\n\nMan, I would be all over this but for a trip to Vegas which will kill it for at least the travel days.  I'll have to think of something.\n\n5k on the plane\n\nJust count the distance over ground and you're done with a trip to the bathroom\n\nNah, gotta follow my plan. Good luck to yall though!\n\nI did this is August. Such an awesome challenge.\n\nI'm in!\n\nI've been on a slump recently, haven't had the motivation to get out in the last month. I think this might be my inspiration to get moving.\n\nI totally want in! How do I join? I just personally hate Strava because they miss at least one run a week and my watch is supposed to automatically sync. Grrrrr\n\nNot me, I need my rest days, but best of luck to all involved.\n\ncount me in..5k in addition to my winter marathon training\n\nI'm on a 5+ year streak of this! 🤙🤙 less maybe 10 days off total (covid, ankle sprain etc)\n\nMy running completely fell off after my A race in September this year so definitely looking to do this. Have done it 3 of the last 4 years just hope I'm not starting from too far behind this time around.\n\nI would love to do this but I can’t run a 5k without taking walking breaks, especially since I haven’t gone running since I failed miserably at a half marathon back in February.\n\nThen you shouldn't start with a 5k a day challenge.\n\nBut maybe this is like a wakeup call to get into running again. \n\nRunning is a great sport. It's easy to stay, good for your cardio and, if done moderately, not even hard on your knees and bones. \n\nJust go out there and walk-run a few meters. Where I live the weather is great today for running. Maybe where you live too?\n\nThat’s what I was thinking too. I’m going to use what’s left of this month and December to work on building myself back up to a 5k and hopefully can do January as a 5k a day challenge for myself\n\nIn again, follow on from 10k a day november.\n\nThe last time I tried this I injured my left calf about 2 weeks in. I'm in much better condition now, but will be running my first full marathon on December 1st, so no chance this month. January could be the month! \n\nmight be just the thing I need to keep running through the grays here.\n\nOkay I'm gonna try this!! I have a loose training plan for this month but will add a 5k on the rest days, even if it's a chill jog. Will be fun!! I have a couple difficult days around the month but shoot for the stars right?\n\noh why not ...lol i just bought shoes.\n\nI'm in! Just joined the group! Let's go fam!\n\nI'm in! Great plan!\nI was just thinking about not running for a month, since I hate these colder months. \nRunning 5k a day is doable and doesn't take up too much time. And that way I still do plenty of distance in the last few weeks.\n\nReady to try again!! Last year was what I considered success. (I created some rules for myself which helped me to stay consistent). Thanks for the reminder!\n\nYou should check out Marcothon, it's the same thing (3 miles a day every day in Dec). Always a large following of supportive runners, in case you need any extra motivation. Good luck!\n\nThis sounds smart but most people it will affect them negatively for over training or running under not good enough conditions\n\nDay 5: My hip hurts like hell, everything hurts even though my BMI is 22 and I am slim and young. This challenge will be tough\n\nI'd be up for this but I'm solo parenting for 4 days when my wife will be caring for her mother. Is it cool to do 4x10k days to compensate?\n\nThere is no right or wrong. There's no prize and no first place. It's a challenge just for you\n\nBut it's about consistency. And not about doing 155 km in the month of December. So I would say no, it wouldn't count. \n\nBut do it just the way you want. Nobody will hold you accountable\n\nDoes it count on a treadmill on 3% incline ?\n\nIf you are running, why not\n\nI just wasn't sure, i do 95% of my running on the treadmill."

    "all_comment_text": "There was about a 4 month stretch before my taper where getting up from sitting a long time caused knee pain.\n\n\nAnd there was my shoe tongue chafing the top of my ankle to the point of bleeding.  (I've since then abandoned my no-shows in favor or ankle socks)\n\n\nAnd the side stitches that hit every few weeks randomly with zero rhyme or reason.  \n\n\nOh, and can't forget the toe nails falling off.\n\nI was not prepared to lose my toenails after my marathon. \n\nAlso, if I sit for too long my feet are sore when I stand up. I have to walk a few minutes before they feel normal again.\n\nYou what now after a marathon?!. OK then, I guess I'll look forward to that\n\nDoesn’t happen to everyone. I’ve kept all my nails so far (3 marathons so far).\n\nThe second toenail of mine is in a forever state of both falling off and regrowing.\n\nNo matter the shoes or socks.. \n\nI do ultra distances and rock up 100km weeks in training so the feet take a hammering.. \n\nIt’s never painful, but the toenails just don’t stay in tact 😂\n\nMorton’s toe\n\nI’ve also never lost a toenail (13 marathons in)\n\nI'd lost one big toenail and was well on the way to losing the one next to it before I got the memo that I should have sized up on shoes.  Haven't lost any since, knock on wood.\n\n\nSo make sure you do that lol.\n\n\nThat said, YMMV.  I'm told some just fall off no matter what.\n\nI lost the nails on my big toes. It was like two weeks after the fact.\n\nI probably won't mind losing those for a while, they're ingrown as shit\n\nYou can wear shoes with roomy toe boxes and completely avoid this problem.\n\nIt’s fun when they start turning purple and begin falling off lol\n\nI didn't lose mine after my first but I DID lose both my big toenails after my second... and it wasn't even immediate. They turned black... then they turned white... and then finally after 6 months, I had new toenails growing underneath the old toenails and had to cut it off so I had half toenails--it was actually kind of crazy how both had the same exact growth cycle. Anyway, annoying when it got to that awkward stage where the new one was growing, but other than that, less creepy than you'd think.\n\nI did my first half last Saturday and one toenail is a very ugly purple ☹️ I def did not know this was a thing lol\n\nSame for me and the soreness. PF can be a real bitch sometimes\n\nProof the taper fixes everything\n\nWhat is “the taper”?\n\nDuring training for a race (half or full marathon) the last two to four weeks before race day you gradual taper off your weekly mileage - the theory is you’ve built up your legs over the prior 14 to 16 weeks and want “fresh” legs by race day. Tapering off the overall mileage on the weeks leading up still keeps you loose and engaged in the act of running, but you’re not doing the hard miles on your legs and (hopefully) not feeling tired. Hence fresh legs on race day!\n\nNice, thanks for taking the time to explain this.\n\nToe nails are probably due to too small toe box/shoes. I’ve never lost toe nails from running … only soccer\n\nSome of us have something called Morton’s toe\n\nYeah that’s fair. I’m just said to see all the comments about people losing toenails from running\n\nIt happens mostly on big downhill courses. Your foot repeated pushing forward hitting the big toe. I run a lot and the Revel race in Big Bear is the only time I lost my toe nail.\n\nYour shoes might be laced too tight or it's just small. Toes should be able to spread as feet impacts the ground.\n\nI was not ready for chaffed nipples\n\nOh man I slather mine up in Vaseline if I'm doing anything over 6 miles. That was a tough lesson to learn.\n\nWaterproof medical tape does wonders. Just a little bit across the nipple itself does the job, and it won't catch any hair. You might need to go through a few brands to find the stickiest for you.\n\nAs a runner that has DD boobs, it is a really REALLY big problem for me. I’ve tried tape and it does nothing. After 6 miles I just literally hold my boobs while running to keep them in place.\n\nI use a hydration vest always and it works like a second bra. I’m also DD. I like the Nathan Vapor Howe or something like that. It’s designed for women, I can’t run without it. \n\nInvest in a good shock absorber bra! I’m a size C so I know the boob pain well, specially when I’m PMSing. It also significantly improved my running time.\n\nHave you tried a bra sized bra? Panache is my go to. Anything that comes in S, M, or L is a no go for me. They'll never fit right. \n\nYes I’ve tried this brand. I bought a few different sizes and didn’t find them comfortable.\n\nDouble bras are also a thing (disclaimer: not personal experience. I'm a plus size woman that has to buy bras without a cup size because they're all too effing huge).\n\nIt took me so long to find bras that would work for me and then to learn the lesson to put chafe-prevention around the bra edges!\n\nAs a friend with similar issues - coconut oil! I get friction issues under my boobs with the bra and I use coconut oil on it. I think it lasts longer than glide and does a better job than Vaseline.\n\nGreat tip, thanks!! I use glide now. I’ll definitely try this\n\nI wear nipeaze for anything longer than 10k or if I expect to get wet. They stay in place well and are small enough to only apply where my chest hair isn’t. I keep a few in my running belt in case I get caught in rain a few miles out.\n\nmine bled the other day\n\nWear really tight athletic shirt or no shirt\n\nThat’s why I apply chamois cream\n\n[deleted]\n\nI mean…who says bras are exclusive to women? Unless you’re looking for something “shaping” to emphasize a bust, you can probably try some long-line, unlined sports bras like [this from Nike](https://www.nike.com/t/zenvy-womens-light-support-non-padded-longline-sports-bra-bDS7N4), binder tops like [this from Iguana Trend](https://iguanatrend.com/en_US/p/Binder-Sport-black/257?currency=USD&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw57exBhAsEiwAaIxaZup4aXBcqGB1qzOJ69HD--KbxguRQAF1beM6S3dmw7RqdOAJlJ9NyhoC3nUQAvD_BwE), or even compression tank tops/short sleeves/long sleeves like [this from Under Armor](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/p/shirts_and_tops/mens_heatgear_compression_tank/1368352.html) depending on how much support you need.\n\nIf you plan on wearing it under a shirt, no one has to know so do whatever works best for you. If you plan on running shirtless, eh, you may get some looks or comments from ignorant folks, but you’ll be comfortably flying past them and getting a PR, so who really cares.\n\nAs a larger lady, I like wearing under armor-style compression tops and bike shorts because they hold in all the flab that jiggles on my arms, stomach, thighs, and butt while also helping wick away moisture and preventing UV exposure. I add a thin, loose tank top over if I feel self-conscious about looking like a can of busted biscuits. If you’ve never tried a compression top, I’d encourage it!\n\nLook up 'GPS tracker vest'.  Its what professional soccer players wear and they definitely look like bras.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou can get one that's just the vest and that doesn't have the tracker for $35.  And yeah, I totally get why you'd want one, no shame from me.  I have boobs and thus have been wearing bras my whole life and have never had to deal with chafing so I get why they're nice.  Just thought you might get a kick out of there being something that fits that exact niche you need of 'nipple covering device but for dudes'.  Here's the $35 one, btw.  https://shop.statsports.com/products/statsports-vest-2-0\n\nBandaids\n\nHonestly, I bought tighter fitting camisoles for my bf from the women’s section. They don’t give him that discomfort and he’s still able to wear loser shirts over them. Even I wear them instead of bras from time to time\n\nEvery sports bra in existence is available for men to purchase. There’s no law preventing you. \n\nIs it really a serious problem when strapping tape is very cheap, takes 10 seconds to put on, and solves the issue?\n\nA lot of people are weirdly resistant to using tape. I think because they're imagining pasties rather than just a little piece. I use Nexcare brand tape and it got me through a lot of 2+ hour long training runs in Central Florida.\n\n\nEdit: Coincidentally in the first warm run of the year in PA my tape fell off because I got a bit of bodyglide on it. FYI, tape then body glide.\n\nMy hubby just wears compression tanks under his shirts and it’s solved the problem for him.\n\nBody Glide works for me,  https://a.co/d/5BOInGs\n\nFew things I struggle/struggled with are:\n\n1. Knee discomfort but that’s because I’m weak from being an office worker for the last 8 years \n\n2. Foot pain but because I had a pair of brooks as my first shoes and hated them.\n\nWhat shoes do you have now? Just curious. I have Brooks and I love the hell out of them.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI just left Ghost 15 for Saucony Endurance Speed and LOVE them!\n\nBrooks ghosts felt like they were trying to break my feet. Swapped to Saucony Endorphin and haven't had any issues since! \n\nThat's not to say Brooks makes bad shoes, only that you should wear the shoes that work for YOU and the Brooks didn't work for me. If you've got persistent pain, different shoes are worth a look.\n\nHad the opposite experience-saucony endorphin absolutely wrecked my feet but the brooks have been amaaaazing! Wild how different shoes can be for people\n\n[deleted]\n\nRecommend Saucony for sure. On my second pair and hundreds of kilometres.\n\nI will second this. Ghost 13-14’s were fantastic. The 15’s I find rather uncomfortable sometimes. Going to try something different here soon\n\nAdrenalines every time for me now. I had a few knee operations in the past and the wrong shoes mess me up fast. Ran 13.1 this morning in adrenalines and feel good!\n\nI got the Adrenaline GTS 23 for Christmas and I love them\n\nIs there much difference between the ghost and adrenaline?\n\nI’m an Adrenalines advocate. Comfortable and SO durable.\n\nSame! Love Adrenaline!\n\nGlycerin 20. Hated them and just use them for dailies to walk in and go to the store with.\n\nI love my glycerins. Absolutely hate my ghosts though.\n\nAll depends on your foot. Best to go to a running shop and get properly fitted.\n\nI hated my Ghosts and returned them. I just took my new Glycerins for a run for the first time yesterday and I like them.\n\nAny tips for the knee discomfort for desk people? I’m trying to get into running, having never really been good at distance running, but I’ve worked at a desk for a long time now and my knees tend to hurt. I assume just stretch and strengthen?\n\nFor me, good shoes (I can also tell when mine hit over 350 miles because I get little aches), time on feet, and strength training! Squats, heel raised squats, deadlifts, lunges, plus hip work with monster walks and side steps with a band. \n\n[deleted]\n\nI’m running a half in a few weeks and have been going 13.1 every other Sunday for a few months to build up for it. I’m so ready to not worry about going longer than 10k again.\n\nI’m in PT school so have student syndrome, anything that goes wrong I suddenly think I have some terrible pathology. If I go a bit too hard I feel it in my knees. My hip knee and ankle used to hurt but it was because I needed some stability shoes. It’s crazy how multifaceted our lower extremities are\n\nI finally just got over being 100% sure that I had posterior tibial tendon insufficiency. Super scary 3 months\n\nInner knee aches, ankle aches, sore calves, sore glutes. Requiring extra sleep. Probably unique to me, but a unilateral hip thing that flares because that area needed some s&amp;c. I thought it was pretty interesting when I went through it \n\nDid you manage to get through it? Sounds awfully familiar!\n\nYep! With a lot of icing, elevating, and being attentive. (Not all the time, but I remember I needed it more often back then)\n\nGood luck! I feel like if I maintain a reasonable heart rate I can go forever from an aerobic point of view but my muscles and joints keep failing me. I think just need more easy miles to build up endurance\n\nYour legs will catch up before you know it! You've got this!\n\nAwesome thanks for the encouragement!\n\nI had unilateral hip impingement because my glutes are weaker on that side (according to the physio). Irritating thing to try to fix!\n\nBy that, do you mean only your left (or right) leg socket cracks when warming up your hips?\n\nNah, they both make funky noises occasionally, that one just gave me pain with running (and rowing) for a while. Worked on the glutes and abductors a bit and it cleared up.\n\nDo you maybe have more info on the unilateral hip thing? Legit I’m dealing with that now and I’m just a beginner runner (going from 4-6 mile fast walking to one of those 5k training apps). One hip is giving me a lot of trouble and I’ve been stretching but I’m about to go to the doctor over it, or have to give up on the idea of running.\n\nI don't have any facts, sorry. It doesn't hurt to go to the doctor. Idk if giving up is necessary. I thought it was bad for me, but I just needed to ramp up a lot more gently. Slower and steady and eventually it was like I was running forever.\n\n\nOne of several non-medical tips that worked for me though is to use a cross-trainer/treadmill to \"cushion\" the impact transition from walking to road running. \n\nMy shins hurt sometimes :p \nStressed out about shin splints and stress fractures now\n\nIf you're gonna take a supplement to prevent stress fractures at least have it be vitamin D and not the ester-c tablets the other guy is talking about\n\nFollow up to this - I take “pro Calcium +” which combines calcium, vit D, zinc and magnesium\n\nShin splints are almost never stress fractures! Way more likely to be musculotendinous in nature.\n\nTib raises\n\nThe only complaint I really had when I first started running was sore iliopsoas muscles (front of the hip). I guess it's not something I used all that much before running.\n\nI also had some pain in my right ankle, and figured it was just something that happens. But then I got on a treadmill in front of a mirror and realized I was making a kind of circling motion with that ankle every time I brought that leg forward. 🫠 Once I made a conscious effort to keep that foot straight, the pain went away. Would definitely recommend running in front of a mirror sometimes to see if there are posture issues or weird movements you might not be aware of.\n\nI had a sharp pain in my knee that would come on at mile 1 or 2 and I could barely even walk. Wore a support for a while and eventually didn't need it. 23k miles later ... no more injuries.\n\nSounds like you may have dealt with IT Band Syndrome. I had that this past winter and it was a nuisance to say the least.\n\nCurrently struggling through it. Any tips that helped you shake it?\n\nI’ve dealt with IT band issues coming and going for years! It sucks. \n\nBut I’ve found a routine that really helps me after doing a ton of research! It’s called the MYRTL Routine. It helps strengthen weak glutes, hips, etc that are the cause of the IT band issues. Here’s a link to the exercise video I use: https://youtu.be/Mj8uZ1Qtx3M?si=5Y8Qz27Ur6mXXxSX\n\nThe first week, I did this everyday and it pretty much erased any pain I had. I then started doing it more like 3-4x per week. If you can really feel the exercises, you definitely have a weakness! The donkey whips obliterated me but felt so good at the same time! I now incorporate some resistance bands into the routine as well to keep strengthening as my body gets used to the exercises.\n\nThank you for posting the video reference!\n\nThank you for sharing this! I probably need to incorporate something like this into my training for the foreseeable future\n\nI found strengthening the glute medius worked for me. Clamshells, side leg raises with leg slightly behind you so you feel it “in the back pocket”.\n\nBased on what I’ve read and my own experience, it seems like the solution varies a lot from person to person and multiple methods is probably wise. \n\nThe response by u/jrblackkat is a huge piece of the puzzle, various leg and hip strengthening exercises helped a lot. I also got a foam roller and used it near daily. I tried taking several weeks off and easing myself back in with short runs, but that didn’t seem super effective for me. I also would run through the pain, to mixed results. The final thing that seems to have worked for me was getting more walking in. The pain started when I quit my job and was doing a lot of freelancing from my computer, so very little movement. I got a new 9-5 that has me walking 5+ miles a day and in a couple weeks the pain had left me altogether. I still have been hesitant to up my weekly mileage but am on the cusp and think my body will respond well.\n\nHope this helps. I would recommend doing all of these things to whatever extent you feel comfortable and using your best judgment.\n\nI would also accept and tips. So far the only thing helping me is Ibuprofen and sucking it up along with glute strengthening moves. But going down stairs kills my knee.\n\nshin splints, mild knee pain, plantar fasciitis, peroneal tendonitis, piriformis syndrome, toe and top of foot pain, to name a few\n\nthis is a sports where you seriously have to have the ability to troubleshoot your body and adjust accordingly. both fun when you figure it out, and extremely frustrating when you're struggling\n\nHow did you fix your shin splints?\n\nI struggled with shin splints too. What worked for me was to not drastically increase the distance, and taking a rest day after every run.\n\nIncreased cadence helped a lot. Now run 180 steps per minute or higher\n\nI had a big eureka moment when I increased my cadence up to 160. Injury went down, breathless went down, heart rate stayed lower for longer. However, I can't imagine running comfortably beyond 165 (6ft. here).\n\nI had them since my mid 20’s. Im now in my 40’s and found the solution only this year. Losing weight to the point of having a “normal” BMI and wearing shoes with a lot of shock absorbing/cushioning, currently Hoka Clifton 9’s\n\nI came to running from cycling and was very fit. This and my ignorance of pacing and what I was really capable of made me think I could charge around like a pro, leaving me with extremely sore quads and calves. I spent a few days walking up and down the stairs one at a time and holding the handrail.\n\nplantar fasciitis, clicky IT band, knee pain\n\nIt's been almost 18 months since I got plantar fasciitis and I just told my wife after yesterday's run that I didn't think about my foot all during the run......of course my hip on the opposite leg was keeping my attention focused 😊\n\nThere is really just one (permanent) injury, and it moves from place to place 🤔.\n\nand your wife was thinking \"will he shut up about plantar fascitis for one day?\" 😨\n\nExactly....you get it!!!!\n\n10 days ago had just finished my run.  Was stretching out,  doing good.  Then I put my leg up on a table to focus on my hammies. My entire lower back seized up,  dropped my ass to the ground and laid me up for an entire week.  Today is my first pain free day.  I'm hoping to start jogging Wednesday.\n\nI never realized how annoying my shoe laces could be. After a couple miles their flopping would drive me to distraction, the noise and the feeling. So now I tuck them. It also helps keep my shoes tied.\n\n\nThat and just waking up sore in the middle of the night. Workplace depression and some foot pain kept me sidelined all winter and now I'm remembering that adding mileage is just constant soreness.\n\nI’ve collected a bunch over the course of my running ‘career’ which is 4 years long now. Twisted ankle, shin splints, IT band / knee issues and the worst was an infection of the pubis symphysis (let’s call it an hip issue) which stopped me running for ca. 9 months. \nI had to do plenty of rehab for the last one which I kept as a habit 2x to the gym now each week for 45  in or so strength training. Has kept me totally injury free for a year now and has massively benefited my running performance. I think dropping from 4-5x running a week to 3 to fit in time for gym also contributed to that. \nThe guy who treated me for the hip thing told me: we never get triathletes here - only runners. Basically saying you need to cross train\n\nPainful tight calves and Achilles stiffness. Finding it really frustrating as I used to run loads and I just want to get back to it.\n\nI've been getting the same, though I've just about solved of the issue. For me, I added too much too fast and the symptoms were a sign of overuse. I've been strength training and lots of dedicated stretching while running a lighter load and it has helped. I went for my first long run since it all started today and had minimal soreness.\n\nYou might be pushing yourself too hard or not stretching enough (or both, like me).\n\nHunger ‘pains’? There were days when I was hungry in a way I haven’t experienced in years!\n\n[deleted]\n\nFor me, that’s true in the short term. I can be a bit hungry, then start running and I’m fine while running and even an hour or two afterwards. But when training ramps up and start doing those hard long days back to back and I know I have to start eating more, or I’ll just be so tired and grumpy I can’t really do anything. \n\nI love food but when I run I want nothing to do with it. I hate force feeding too 😔 but gotta keep that metabolism machine going\n\nSame!!! I'm balls deep in training at the moment and I'm ravenous!!! I've put on 5-10 pounds. 4 weeks today until marathon day. I think I'll need to go on a diet afterwards 😅\n\nI gained 20 lbs in the lead up to New York. Shed it quickly after but it probably didn’t help my time.\n\nseconding the toe nerves thing, sometimes i’d get out of bed and get a sudden spark of pins and needles down the side of the pad of my foot and be like WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT. gone now, but nice to know it’s somewhat common.\n\ni always figured my hips and glutes were quite strong because i spent so long wandering around a VERY hilly area as a student, 30k steps a day type of walking… not so. and now i’m in PT because they weren’t strong enough to stop me hurting my knee. running will show you deficiencies you didn’t even know were possible\n\nFor like two years, I pretty much constantly had a black toenail. Whenever one side was healed, the one on the other side would start acting up again. Seemed like there was no correlation to what shoes I was wearing (and yes, I do cut them. My guess is that it had to do with the fact that my \"pointer toes\" are freakishly long).\n\nMy second toes stick out past my big toes as well. Those poor toenails are constant victims. They need their own ASPCA commercials. I think I've completely lost one of them 3 times over the past decade.\n\nI’m a pretty new runner but know this from long distance hiking in trail runners: buy your shoes up half a size. Should be about a thumb’s width of space at the end, counters most toenail banging / loss.\n\nStrained calf that never heals properly.\n\nI’ve been working my way up to 30 miles/week from 20 and I have weird hip pain whenever I wear a brand of shoes that my legs don’t like (an expensive riddle I’m trying to solve). I also get foot cramps in some shoes, have had off-and-on shin splints for like two months, my Achilles is a little sore on one leg and my left quad has been twitching while I sit and work all day.\n\nOne thing I haven’t tried is literally stretching anything other than while it’s hurting me, so.\n\nPeroneal tendinitis. It flares up in both feet, but thought I broke my foot after my first half marathon it hurt so bad. Added hip strengthening to improve my gait. Used to get hot spots between my toes, but now use toe socks and wide toe box shoes. Flare ups in my shoulder from an old volleyball injury 15 years ago. Strength training to the rescue. Running finds all.\n\nI always used to do like 2-4 mile runs, but when I finally committed to doing a half-marathon 11 years ago, I had this terrible pain on the lateral side of my knee whenever I would try for longer runs. I did like four 9 mile runs and then did the half and it was killer. I took a few weeks off after that and have been doing marathons and half-marathons since without that specific pain ever coming back (but have had a few others along the way).\n\nSo when I hear people tell me all about how they can't run because of their knees, I always wonder if they felt what I felt and thought it was just something they couldn't do. I played sports in a fairly competitive environment up until my mid-30s, so it was an adjustment transitioning to long-distance running...especially at 6'5\"\n\nLegs stay sore for so long. I was a lifter and always hated doing legs because the soreness would last NO LESS THAN 3 days if I did a real good leg day. Day two after would be the worst. Training for a half marathon I felt like from abt a month out until a week and a half after the race there wasn’t a single day my legs weren’t sore or in pain (continually got plantar fasciitis too)\nOnly thing that helped was doing stretching/ yoga like 30 minutes a day 5 days a week + sauna which I always loved so I do that anyways just for enjoyment almost every day. I’m just built stiff and not naturally mobile but I started loving endurance running so I kept working at it. Also I got into running at 25 and had hated and avoided cardio (as much as possible while still playing sports through highschool) all my life so it was just a big learning curve but\n\nRight now it's a bit of ankle pain and swelling (posterior tibal tendonitis), most likely from ramping up the miles a bit too fast. Currently following a great PT plan that's helping a bunch.\nSore It bands in the very beginning (foam roll to the rescue!)\nBut I think that's been about it so far... *Knock on wood*\n\nAlso struggling with post tib, started seeing a physio a few weeks ago so fingers crossed for us both\n\nim probably just as new as you, recently went through the numb feet stage, luckily that seems to have passed after 3ish weeks of consistency, I also gave myself a quarter sized blister from bad socks, getting a few good merino wool pairs has been a life saver.\n\npatellar tracking disorder took me out of running for like 8 months before i figured it out but now i'm back &amp; prepping for my 2nd half next month :)\n\nMy left big toe hurts.\n\nWhen I go into overtraining territory, the first indicator is that my left ankle starts to hurt. I strained it when I was 15, but it wasn't even bad or anything, it just hurt for a bit, didn't even see a doctor about it. But that's the first body part to nope out.\n\nThe classic toe nail not trimmed and your toes got stabbed and everything is full of blood.\n\nOne actual injury I had when I was 12, very out of shape and in gym class: we stretched our cold muscles before a run, then we started running and I tore a muscle, no fun, it hurt a LOT.\n\nMost recently, lower back pain when running. When I don't train my lower back, it's because these muscles for stabilizing are underdeveloped and that's why it's a limiting factor. When I do train them, the lower back hurts because they're still sore. I realized I cannot deadlift the day before a run!\n\nWhen it's very cold, I have run outside but if I don't gradually get accustomed, I cannot run when it's below freezing as breathing hurts my lungs. When I put a scarf in front of my mouth it gets nasty wet and gross. When I go running regularly and get used to the cold when it gets gradually colder, it works and I've run in -10 degrees Celsius too.\n\nI've never had much issue with chafing for some reason, only after the marathon a bit but I didn't feel it.\n\nKnee pain when I was first adjusting. It was specifically during my run-walk phase. I kept stretching before and after and after a few months I would notice it occasionally but it always went away after 5 minutes of easy running.\n\nThen when I was ramping up for marathon training, it was knee and arch pain, specifically after long runs. The knees I dealt with, but wearing calf height compression socks really saved my legs on long runs and kept the foot pain to a minimum.\n\nI did also invest in some oofos and those really made the foot pain diminish (I'd wear them around the house post run).\n\nMy left hamstring gets shooting pains down the middle of it and my right glute is so tight I can’t cross my legs anymore. \n\nConsistently have had IT band irritation on my right side on longer distance runs.  \n\nWas true when I just started out and would do a 8-10k long run... to now when I do &gt;30k distances. Seems just to be trainable and avoidable as I've increased mileage, just something I've noticed.\n\nKnees.  The first few weeks would find me icing both knees after a run.  Then it went away.  I credit new shoes.  The first run after I switched from Nike to Hoka Clifton was pain free.\n\nIt band and super tight hip flexors from office work!\n\nEvery single one. Take it easy and take more time off than you want to. Your body will be very happy with you. If you just push through and run every day, you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nInjuries are a constant issue, not just at the beginning. My current formula for avoidance is 1) cushioned shoes with a rocker sole (eg Hoka Clifton) 2) run slow, keep HR &lt; 135 3) keep lower legs quiet &amp; relaxed, propel myself with glutes &amp; hips 4) mix in cycling so I run less/wk 5) if something’s hurting, wait it out and try to adjust my stride. This has gotten me back to comfortable 8-10mi runs, from 4. From “I don’t think I’ll ever run a half marathon again (sad face)” to I could do that tomorrow (smiley).”\n\nMy hands swell up.\n\nWeird pain up the side of my knee into my thigh. \n\nStopped for a bit , wore better shoes , wore a strap on the knee and it stopped. \n\nI get pains in my ankle if I run more than 10k. I don't run more than 10k very often so haven't conquered that pain yet.\n\nLost a toe nail on my right foot after it bruised. That's just about grown back now.\n\nAll of them\n\nWhen i started running i would get an acute pain in my foot sole preventing me for running for sometime. I was kind of frustrated because there was no reason at all for this pain, no leg pain, not out of breath, it was just the sole of my foot burning. You know when you get that period of motivation to do things well but then something like this happens? Well that was it for me. I had to take a rest before continuing to run again. Anyway long story short i got used to it by buying a new pairs of shoe that had cushions to reduce the impact on my foot. Then didn't have the pain anymore.\n\nCurrently dealing and working through right leg lateral stability. It just wants to move side to side way too much causing discomfort and pain on both sides of the ankle that weirdly settles down after a mile. This is why running is so fascinating. It mirrors life in a way that no other sport does. Constant pain, elation, highs and lows and finding and fixing esoteric issues almost every day\n\nThe bloody nipple dilemma\n\nMy body would itch so bad when I just started running.\n\nLong runs for marathon prep, once above 14 miles i developed \"lace pinch\". Laces digging into the anterior crease of the ankle.\n\nPainful, uncomfortable and made me fail my 20 mile (longest run) long run.\n\noutside hip pain and lower back pain after some strenuous runs or super long ones. I really don’t have too much leg pain. I did however struggle with feet pain due to an accessory navicular bone I had to get surgically removed last year, pain is crazy better since.\n\nToenails for me. I've sized up but my big toes are so sensitive and tender. I stubbed my big toe this evening and the pain was something else. I wanted to cry. Definitely think I'm gonna lose a few toenails in the near future 😑\n\nI have a few things going on. My backside is aching almost consistently now. It’s been better since I’ve increased how much protein I eat but training is literally a pain in my ass. Speaking of eating, I have never been so hungry in my life. I can be eating my meal and planning my next while chewing. This is disconcerting as I love to just enjoy my meals. This is just food == energy which is off putting. My left hip is tight after 8 km, my left foot has plantar fasciitis. This week is the heaviest load in my training plan before I taper. What is getting me through is that the thought of the taper, seeing my ART doc and my masseuse. Oh yeah - and the celebration dinner at Mother India!\n\nMental exhaustion is a very real concern but CURRY!\n\nMy hips were in a lot of pain when I started. I used to ice them all the time. It was so bad I had a hard time sleeping. Then it went away. When it came back I was seeing an acupuncturist and she needled them for me. No pain since. I was a lot heavier when I started so I think that is why my hips (fronts and deep inside) hurt so much. It hurt to walk too. I had a goal of becoming a trail runner so I pushed through. I have noticed less pain in general if I am running trails instead of pavement. I’m more tired at the end but I recover better.  \n\nI can relate to this. I’m fit but definitely not a runner but I do like adding speed to my cardio by running at times. Let me tell you… that hip pain… definitely flares up after running. Like super uncomfortable externally and deep inside, as you described. I wondered if it was from just the muscles and other tissues around the hip/upper leg that weren’t used to the impact. Nothing really makes it better than rest. So I haven’t really been able to push through consistently. And amazingly, I have been able to work out with the soreness/pain but it gets worse after.\n\nTerrible hip bursitis from heel striking… went away once I adjusted to landing more forward and got better shoes.\n\nShin splints from increasing mileage too quickly \n\nPlantar fasciitis\n\nTore a muscle in my calf… no idea how that happened\n\nSkin peeling from the sides of my feet, due to shoes. Changed shoe type, problem solved.\n\nPeroneal tendonitis from overuse in a training cycle.\n\nLost a couple of toenails, but worst one was when I developed a mega blister between my bone and toenail during a marathon… blister burst a week later and off came my nail. Weird stuff \n\nAlso, frostbite.\n\nShinsplints\n\nPlantar fasciitis\n\nHard do not recommend to both\n\nHas a bout with plantar, it sidelined me for awhile and I was depressed over not being able to run.\n\nBest thing I did was listen to my body and rest, despite wanting to \"fight through it\" and keep running.\n\n\n\nHappy Running!\n\nSame here! I didn’t/couldn’t run for 6 months. Easing back in now, so far so good. Thank goodness for my peloton bike.\n\nThigh chaff and under arm chaff-from against my bra.\n\nTop of my foot pain…was tying my shoes too tight 🙄\n\nA bruised ego. I thought it would be easier.\n\nFortunately only foot blisters to me. Leukotape fixed that instantly.\n\nDid my left achilles in, don't recommend that (should have more work to strengthen it before sprinting up hills). Black toenails, and numb feet after about 5 miles until I learned to keep my shoes very loose at the front.\n\nITBS since 2010, have tried everything but can’t get rid of it. Kicks in after 6-8km, sometimes 10km if I stretch thoroughly.\n\nMY CORNNNNNN\n\nI get numbness in my back for some reason, like around my left shoulder blade. Didn't attribute it to running originally, but it disappeared when I took a 2 year covid/new father break.\n\nIt doesn't bother me, in fact I rather like it - it reminds me that I'm doing a good job\n\nI've been running for 2-3 months. But I'm taking it slow, less than 3k per run.\n\nThe first two months, I had knee pain so sometimes I had to wait a week before starting to run again so I wouldn't injure it more. It's been a few weeks where I can run steady and keep the running to every 2 days with no pain. Not sure if it'll start again once I increase from 3k to 5k\n\nI get blisters under and around my toes (well my big toe)  too.\n\nSorry, too tired to read thru comments in this sub.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions for how I can fix the blisters issue? Pretty sure it’s from running longer distances, either on treadmill or outdoors. Not sure best way to address it.\n\nHave you tried toe socks? I think because they wrap each toe separately to minimize rubbing it prevents blisters. At least that’s my experience! I’ve been wearing Injinji toe socks.\n\nCurrently readjusting. I have midfoot arthritis, and if I'm too long on concrete, my foot hurts (there, and also in the big toes - I feel like I might be getting arthritic there too). Same issue with knee pain - it's fine on dirt, but anything over 4mi on sidewalk, my knees are letting me know about it. In the first mile, I get this weird lower shin pain just above the bad foot. It goes away once I'm in a groove. \n\n\nWhen I first started running in high school many years ago, it was shin splints that were my biggest issue. Interestingly, after that, I never had shin pain again until just now (20some years later).\n\nI'm a new runner too and for me:\n\nPins and needles in my feet during the later stages of a run\n\nPain in the arches and balls of my feet\n\nAnkles and knees aching the following day\n\nHip pain\n\nKnee pain\n\nPlantar(sidelined me for awhile) I don't recommend \"fighting through it\" You'll recovery faster by fighting that urge.\n\nSore calves and hammys\n\nTakes a bit of consistency, but all of these does go away(the plantar was just one of those random injuries imo(\n\n\nHappy Running!\n\nFew months of my ankles, knees and hips being SUPER bad! But that’s expected when I was extremely sedentary for years and drinking too much and then start to suddenly start running 3-4 days a week.\n\nCramping in my pelvic/ groin area. Didn't know that area can cramp....\n\nI had a discomfort behind my left knee cap for a few weeks until I started strength training alongside the running. \n\nHad a few leg pains but thankfully nothing serious.\n\nThe bulk of my first marathon training was in late winter and early spring in the snow. Biggest adjustment was when it finally got warm out and I had to bring water on my longer runs (15+) and not pass out\n\nWhat did you mean by better socks? I did a long run yesterday and I have 2 callouses on each foot. I’m a new runner so not sure what kinds of socks I should switch to?\n\nWhenever I get back into running after a break, my lower back is sore the day after that first run back. Subsequent runs are no issue, it’s always just that first one. Not sure why.\n\nI’m getting back into running after stopping for 7 years. It’s been incredibly interesting to witness the comings and goings of different discomforts. This 30-something body is having a much different experience than my 20-something body did.\n\nFirst month, I had weird pain in my ankles. Took a week off and it went away. Ran pain free for a while. Then, a couple blisters on my left foot. Then some weirdness in my right knee, which migrated to my left knee. Last week, I had a little pain in my left heel. Now the arches of my feet feel uncomfortable. Aside from the initial ankle pain, this has all been pretty mild. It’s like my body is just learning how to do it again, and not recovering as quickly as it once did!\n\nThis thread has brought me so much comfort knowing I’m not alone in constantly having some ailment to combat!\n\nGet yourself a scraper on amazon\n\nI love my scraper for my lower legs 🦵🏼\n\nIt has been a gamechanger for me. Lower legs and feet.\n\nMy shoulder hurts when I run. Maybe from holding phone?\n\nPost tib tendonitis on both ankles last year - rehabbed 6 months (and continues to require weekly maintenance with physical therapy), left foot going numb with no rhyme or reason as week ass just ankle stiffness, burning achy feeling on outside of lower leg &amp; ankle (also no idea what causes good days &amp; bad days). Now just yesterday unlocked new pain in top of right foot when scrunching my toes which sounds like a new form of tendonitis 🫠. If it ain’t one thing it’s another!!!\n\nIf I stop running for a long time, I dread starting bc I get really itchy for the first few weeks. Thigh, stomach, waist just start itching about a minute or two into the work out. I tried researching it. Something about blood vessels expanding to let more oxygen through? It gradually stops the more in shape I get. And it encourages me to keep up the running habit bc I hate going through that phase whenever I start working out again.\n\nThe whole training block for my first (this Sunday!) has been me trying to manage failure of various parts of my legs.\n\nTight calves, then hamstring, random showstopping blisters, arch pain, now a hip issue that couch stretches are slightly managing (but I'll still be running with some degree of pain on Sunday).\n\nMy left foot's big toenail is slowly turning brown. I'm glad this is over lol. It's taught me that a HM is a real nice distance that doesn't take too much out of your life to train for. With a HM you can still go do other activities without performance being affected in either.\n\nBest thing for toe friction are toe socks, like Injinji (https://www.injinji.com). I've worn these for 15+ years and have had 1 toe blister.\n\nI went to my first PT appointment last week and was told that I have Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction (“PTTD”), aka Posterior Tibial Tendonitis, which is not uncommon in beginning runners (particularly if you are running on inclines outside). I have flat feet, which may be contributing to the condition. They instructed me to stay off of running on hills for 2 weeks, and I also got Superfeet inserts for arch support (I use them in my ASICS Gel Nimbus 26’s). I can continue running on flat surfaces for now, just have to take it easy… which is admittedly much harder to do than I thought!"

    "all_comment_text": "I know where every publicly accessible bathroom is within a 10 mile radius.\n\nYou are more conscious of new construction sites and whether or not they fence off their portapotties. You read the cleaning schedules posted inside public portapotties.\n\nMy city cleans the park porta potties on Fridays so an early Saturday run is the best time because the bathrooms are clean and stocked with tp! If I do my weekend long run on Sunday I bring my own tp and pray\n\nLMAO seriously so true!!!\n\nI swear I thought I was the only one who looked for these.  Crazy in the US how few public restrooms there are sometimes.\n\nNever go to Europe, 100x worse there\n\nI know where the publicly accessible water sources are too!\n\n100% this ⬆️ I’d like to also add that I know the location of every water fountain along my path and will bring a little toilet paper just in case a bathroom break in the woods is needed lol\n\nWhen you gotta go, you gotta go\n\nLong runs over 8 miles got me eyeballing bushes to see which ones could hide my pasty white butt if I needed to squat!\n\nAs a dude I was like Da frig you shittin for.... Then I realized probably not a dude HAHA\n\nLOL! Totally a chick over here!\n\nOnce I started doing runs longer than 5 miles, I made sure to have a few bucks in my pocket to pay the Tinkle Tax at a gas station (I hate using a business' bathroom without buying something). If I had to, I could buy a Gatorade or some pretzels.\n\nTinkle Tax, thank you for this gem.\n\nI became much less discerning about the condition of public toilets.\n\nI know where can I find drinking fountains within a 15 km radius, and know when they operate and when they don't.\n\nSimilar, but it's wooded areas I can be concealed in, for me. I always have some wipes in my running gear.\n\nI've become acutely aware of how towns and cities are isolated from their surrounding countryside.  It's more pronounced in some places than others.  You reach a point in some urban sprawl where the built environment is absolutely hostile to anyone on foot, but if you can get past it then the country roads are once again inviting.  It's weird that there are towns that are unpleasant to enter and exit, but the inside and outside are both fine.  I also notice how trail systems end or simply don't interconnect - it's all designed and used by people who can't conceive of moving even 5km at a time just using their bodies.\n\nWhat country? As in the UK, there are so many public footpaths and bridleways that there are tons of connections between places.\n\nI agree that there are a lot of paths in the UK, however I do think OP’s description applies here - too often a path exists but then ends without being linked to another, dumping you out into a ridiculous or dangerous spot e.g. a fast road with no pavement. We probably have this worse than a lot of other countries because at least their networks would have been in some way planned and designed rather than mostly happening by accident.\n\nI guess it will somewhat depend whereabouts in the UK. I'm near the South Downs Way which is a rather terrific 100 miles and there are lots of paths that connect to it locally to me.\n\nCanada, in the more populated bit.  We like our cars almost as much as our neighbours to the south.\n\nAt least in the interconnected trail system front, a lot of times it’s not that the designers can’t conceive using the distance it’s that if you wait till you can build it all at once it’ll never happen so you have to slip it in piece by piece and hope it comes together eventually because something is better than nothing.\n\nThe problem with rural routes in my area is loose dogs. It seems every aggressive dog is rehomed to ‘life on a a farm’\n\nIndeed, stupid underestimate how dangerous are dogs. The statistics are there: they are the most dangerous animal by far in injuries and deaths. Carrying weapons while running is a must\n\nI like the way that you've described the invisible wall around the constructed world. While it is completely different, I've come to relate to time very similarly. I run in the morning and in the afternoon. In the morning I'm on the road shortly after 5am. Chicago is mostly asleep still. The roads and sidewalks are all mine until about mile six, when I enter the loop. It's about 6am and people really start moving around. So my last couple of miles are filled with construction workers and building maintenance folks filing into the Loop. People on bikes start to appear along with other runners; particularly if I'm commuting along the lakefront. Generally, it's very civil. But, it's also the polar opposite of my afternoon run. During the day there's lots of aggression from bikers and drivers. There are also inattentive pedestrians that need to be moved around and so so many pets. Everything has gotten louder and more demanding. In morning, I tend to run in the road without worry. But I find that in the afternoon, I run where I can and I'm much more aware of everything. Morning or afternoon, it's the same space but my experience of it completely shifts.\n\n1. I see other “regulars;” people heading to work, dog walkers, other runners, cyclists, walkers, etc…. People with the same daily routine. \n\n2. Runners don’t wave unless I initiate it - 90% wave back. \n\n3. Wearing shorts below 0° C can cause chaffing if the shorts start to lose their suppleness due to freezing. \n\n4. More urban wildlife visible before sunrise.\n\nCombining 1 and 4, eventually you recognize certain animals as regulars too, to the point that you get sad and worried if you stop seeing them. (A very beloved cat who frequented the local trails passed away this month, and my feed has been *filled* with runners and cyclists posting pictures of him.)\n\nEventually, the deer recognize *you* as a \"regular\" too and just ignore you.\n\nYes! There’s an amazingly fluffy dog in my neighborhood. I loved seeing it because I always admired how sheep-like it was. I didn’t see it for weeks and was getting pretty worried about it but finally saw it the other evening. The relief!!\n\nI’ll just say that I don’t miss that regular surfeit of skunks I see in cooler weather. 🤧.\n\nWaving back or waving to a huffed and puffed runner makes my day though, it should totally be a more common thing to do :)\n\nI run multiple loops of a 2.5km circuit around my village about 6 or 7 days a week ... boring but I know it and it's convenient.\n\nSome of the pavements are pretty narrow and there are often lots of couples, or parents with children, or older people with less mobility, so whenever possible I always leave them the full width of the pavement and run in the gutter taking care with a glance over my shoulder for traffic etc and give a quick wave of acknowledgement to indicate that I'm giving them the pavement (esp if they already started to crowd into the hedge etc).\n\nAfter 3 years of this there are now quite number of (non running) people that I've never really met but see often enough that they wave at me any time they see me even when I'm not running, and it's turned the usual \"wall of strangers\" that we get used to seeing into a more friendly smiling and waving crowd of people I still don't know.\n\nI love getting the occasional \"keep it up!\" It's almost always worth it to wave at someone to get a smile back. Can't expect kindness from the world if you don't try putting it out :)\n\nI do my weekly speed/interval runs on the flat paved path around a local lake that comes out to be just shy of a 5k loop, so it's popular with older folks in the mornings.  They usually walk in small groups, sometimes with binoculars to birdwatch, and they are \\*always\\* so ready with their waves and hellos as I run past and wave hello back at them.  Every so often I get someone who will do a fist pump as I go past, and they'll say something like YOU GOT THIS!, and my god, it is the absolute best feeling.\n\nI love seeing the walkers and runners (and dogs) I know from repeated sees but don’t actually know. Sometimes I imagine us all meeting up at the park on trail.\n\nIt's so funny because I am a \"don't look at me, don't acknowledge me, don't perceive me\" exerciser/runner and my partner is the opposite - he's a \"wave hello to everyone you see\" person and I'm always like, \"no put your hand down what are you doing\"\n\nSometimes you have to break the “tension” with a wave if they are looking directly at you as they  approach from the opposite direction.\n\n&gt; Wearing shorts below 0° C can cause chaffing if the shorts start to lose their suppleness due to freezing.  \n\n  \nThank god i live in a place where my main worry is not dying of dehidration and heatstroke so I can never deal with this issue lmao\n\nRe #3, if you don't already have windbriefs, check 'em out.\n\nThanks for the tip. I’ll look into them. \nI currently wear spandex shorts under my shorts to prevent chafing In cooler conditions.\n\n2 is funny! Everyone waves here.\n\nI’ve noticed that people who are really into running g like me will wave. It’s one of those things where you acknowledge someone who is into your hobby too. I’ve heard that motorcycle people do the same thing, I’m sure there are others too.\n\nCyclists can be pretty good at that.\n\nI'm now familiar with all the local trails, woods and river paths.\n\nGoing out in the rain no longer bothers me.\n\nI have developed an irrational hatred of dog owners who use long leads.\n\nI've found women's running gear is generally on sale more often than men's with better discounts and most of it is unisex.  I also now know I'm a size 14 or a large lol.\n\nI say good morning and hello to random people as I run past them.\n\nI've joined the national trust so I can use the car parks for free.\n\nThere's probably a lot more but overall running has made me a far happier person\n\n&gt; I have developed an irrational hatred of dog owners who use long leads.\n\nSaaaame. I run often on a paved pathway that sees a significant spike in foot traffic from out-of-towners on weekends and the number of doofuses who have their dogs on those extendable leads, not in their control, stretched alllllll the way across the path ready to clothesline any runner or cyclist that comes by, is far too high. That and oblivious groups of people who take up the whole path.\n\n&gt; I have developed an irrational hatred of dog owners who use long leads.\n\nI’d much rather face this than dog owners who use no lead and have no control over their dog which regularly chases, barks at and/or bites runners. Something you’d think common sense and the law would prevent (I’m in the UK too, and having a dog dangerously out of control is illegal, no matter what an entitled dog owner might try and tell me), but nope it happens to me regularly!\n\n[deleted]\n\nSadly, being injured or maimed by a dog it’s not an if, it’s a when question.\n\nIt is important to carry weapons to deal correctly with the attack when it comes. It will protect you, and the next runners that would been assaulted \n\nSigh, I got bitten by a dog on a run because “he’s never done that before!” 😒 Now I have a distrust of any dog and dog owner unfortunately. All it takes is one bad seed (likely the owner, in this case, not the dog necessarily).\n\nThat really sucks. I’ve not been bitten but I think it’s only a matter of time. I’ve been charged at by multiple loose, unmuzzled rabid dogs including one where the owner said ‘watch out, he bites’, thankfully I was on a bike for that one and put it between the dog and myself. I was just speechless though, some unbelievably irresponsible dog owners out there.\n\nThe most recent one told me that he charges and barks at people but ‘never bites’ and I told her ‘all dog owners say that until they suddenly do’ and she got very offended angrily told me I need to educate myself. So I politely suggested she educate herself on the law about having dogs dangerously out of control and she walked off, lol.\n\nI'm lucky that I have never encountered a vicious dog.  I prefer dogs that are running free to the long leads.  At least if they dart in front of you there's nothing to trip you up.  The ones that are running free I generally just hold my hand out, let them have a sniff and they leave me alone.  \nI get your point though I'd imagine it could be pretty scary if a dog was barking and trying to attack you\n\n&gt;I have developed an irrational hatred of dog owners who use long leads.\n\nYup, i literally yell \"DUDE, CURB YOUR DOG\" when they aren't paying attention.\n\n&gt; Going out in the rain no longer bothers me.\n\nMe too. Honestly, I even enjoy going for a run in the rain.\n\nI used to think 76 degrees Fahrenheit was a nice temperature\n\nI don’t get a runner’s high. I get a runner’s cry. I often cry when I run, not from pain. Emotions bubble up very easily.\n\nI listen to audiobooks on easy runs and sometimes a sad part hits and you just have to do the ugly cry run.\n\nGood idea, I need to start some audio books for my longer runs, music is getting old.  Occasionally I get a runners high that is so powerful I actually feel like crying (for perspective I've cried twice that I can recall in 40 years) so this is a pretty powerful feeling for me.  Cry run.  I like that lol\n\nOne and the same I think!\n\nI thought I was “crazy” to experience this. If I run when stressed and push myself a bit, I sometimes want to cry. It’s a little awkward though since I run in a busy park.\n\nSunglasses with mirror lenses are your friend. People can just assume the rest of your face is just red from exertion lol\n\nI used to think my city was pretty flat while driving around. Now I feel all the little or  long hills.\n\nright? i live in the midwest US and all i hear about the terrain is how flat it is. you try running on it then. doesn't feel so flat now\n\nMy husband and I started out running and now we hike a lot of the same trails. I feel like you can really tell exactly what grade something is on a bike and there are so many spots in the trail where we say ‘oh this is a very subtle hill! No wonder this part of my run feels like crap!’\n\nAbsolutely lol. I haven't been running very long but it's amazing that a road Id used to think was flat I can absolutely see/feel the slight grade now.\n\nAlso can tell grade by HR... On a long easy run I can see/feel my HR go up or down 5bpm with grade.\n\nA quirky one for me is I can immediately tell when my HR hits 158bpm for the first time is a run because I \"sigh\" lol.\n\nI have a friendly competition/ rivalry going (in my own mind) with a neighbor I've never actually met but who keeps nabbing the Local Legend status on \"my\" segments. I'm coming back from an injury, but look out, Molly M! I'm taking 'em back this summer! \n\nRight? We moved to a rental in a different part of town while our house gets worked on and I’ve lost my local legend status on two of my segments! But I’ll be back and I’m getting them back.\n\nWhat is this local legend status? Is it part of a running app?\n\nI believe it's on the Strava app.\n\nYes in the Strava app.\n\nI have become very aware of the unspoken \"lanes\" that sidewalks have. I abhor when incoming pedestrian traffic takes up multiple lanes and makes no effort to give space. It's not that big a deal when I'm running against traffic, because then it's not super dangerous for me to run in the street. But when I'm running with traffic, it's more dangerous for me to suddenly step into the street to get out of the way.\n\nI also have this almost parasocial relationship with the \"regulars\" that I see.\n\nPeople litter. A lot. If I get burned out on a run and decide to walk home I’ll pick up trash. And the quantity and diversity of rubbish is wild. A lot of food wrappers/containers.\n\nHave you already found this site?\n\n[https://www.plogging.org/](https://www.plogging.org/)\n\nI hadn't, thanks for sharing!\n\nI'm a morning runner and don't care what I look like in the dark winter months but the minute it starts to be light out in the spring I'm all of a sudden self conscious and want to look like a \"runner.\"\n\nI see so much wildlife it's now to the point where I only get excited for those higher up the food chain. I accidentally chased a fox a few weeks ago and it yelled at me (yes, I now know what the fox say), I got within 10 feet of a coyote last Sunday, and a couple winters ago I would see several great horned owls that were so cool! You would hear them hoot and I just had to find the tallest tree or building to spot them. \n\nI wave to everyone, even the unhoused, and I'm always shocked how many smiles it puts on peoples faces. Generally the only people that don't wave back are those too cool for school in their elite running gear (whereas I happily rock Decathalon and Costco).\n\nSeeing a Great Horned Owl was the highlight of my half marathon training one year. I developed a whole point system for the wild life I saw- squirrels were 0 points, small bird varieties I could identify 1 point, deer 3 points, snakes and turtles 5 points, fox 10 points and coyote is lose all your points in my game.\n\nShoot, I guess all those points I've built up are all gone! :D  \nI usually see 10-20 rabbits and at least 6 deer each run so I was running on a pretty high score until that coyote came along. :)\n\nI live in a semi-dense neighbourhood so other than squirrels we don't have much wildlife around. But I remember the one time I saw a cat and the other time I saw a fat racoon up a small tree. Made my runs. Don't think I'd want to encounter a coyote, though!\n\nI'm priveledged enough to live in a suburb with plenty of parks, trails, and even an urban forest which attracks all sorts of wildlife. While I'm no expert, I understand that coyotes are a little misunderstood and don't really pose any threat to humans so long as we leave them alone and don't feed them. The one I saw  was even quite small, smaller than a Golden Retreiver but much bigger than a fox, it's size and demeanor (just ignored me, qickly getting out of my way) quickly helped me get over being startled. I've heard of some people's small dogs being attacked but even that is fairly rare and the less responsible pet owners still walk their dogs off leash in the forest. \n\nAll of that is to say I've never seen a racoon in nature! Only ever rummaging through garbage in an urban setting and I would absolutely love to spot one. :)\n\nI know which crosswalks give me a better chance of getting hit by a car.\n\nLeaving the house feeling like “bleh” sometimes results in a really good run. \n\nMy wife and kids no longer ask how my run went, or are impressed by my “long runs”\n\nI wish gray shorts didn’t display how much swamp ass I’m experiencing on the hotter days I’m out there. Also unsnapping my belt after a long effort feels amazing.\n\ni can relatively accurately gauge the distance of a mile, which i was completely incapable of doing before. \n\nseen a lot of cool birds in my area that i didn't know about before.\n\nIf I travel without planning on running I get jealous of all the fun running options in the area! To combat this I do try and sneak a run in on most trips, even if it's just a short 5k!\n\nI am acutely aware that drivers don't look right when they are making a right turn. \n\nI try to stop at the limit line of stop lights. I used to be a \"creeper\" but after tons of neighborhood running during lockdown I realized how terrifying it is when a car starts moving!\n\nWhen I'd just gotten my license, I was one of those \"forget to look right\" drivers. Until one day I almost hit a man (I may even have gently tapped him, I'm not sure, he kept going). Since then, I've always double and triple checked both ways before taking my foot off the brake. \n\nLast week, a driver waiting to turn right out of a driveway almost hit me. It was near the end of my long run and I was kind of gassed, but I still had the breath to yell at him to look both ways. Guy was very apologetic. I hope he learns like I did all those years ago.\n\ni have yet to encounter a well-behaved dog on my runs and dread seeing them. i know the owners are to blame and it’s so hard to ignore all the ways they’re failing their pets.\n\nI know every port-a-potty and park bathroom within a mile of my house in every direction.\n\nWater fountains too.\n\nPeople can be really oblivious to their surroundings\n\nNot only inner elbow sweat, but also inner elbow tanlines\n\nCame here to say the same. Mine is so sharp, almost perfect 90° angle when I extend my arm\n\nI am so curious now! What do inner elbow tan lines look like?\n\nSo when you bend your elbow in your running position, imagine the part in the inner elbow that doesnt get any sun when your elbow is bent being much lighter than the part outside if that makes sense haha\n\nNoted. I'll be on the lookout for them this summer. I've already developed a watch tan line for the first time in over 20 years, what are a few more.\n\nI’ve been running for fun for a few years now. I can no longer stand to walk through a parking lot. Gotta go fast.\n\nI wish it were more appropriate to run places. I often slow down as to not scare people.\n\nI know where all the dogs live now.\n\nI'm more afraid of dogs, now.\n\nWow, this post is full of comments about dogs.  I know all the dogs on my regular route that if they were to get out would try and kill me.  One throws himself at the window so hard when I run by it'll likely break some day.  I carry mace with me when I run now in preparation for the day.\n\nI run in the morning and get dogs barking at me from behind fences. I tell every dog that barks at me that they are a good guard dog.\n\nWalking is so fucking *boring* now!\n\nI almost always look over my shoulder when stepping off a curb onto a cross-walk and I always assume a driver pulling out to a stop sign isn't going to look right before proceeding.\n\nI run very early and also live in an urban area where a decent amount of people hit the bars on the weekends. \n\nIt's funny being a runner and also now sober. \n\nSO MANY people forget/pass out and miss their doordash/Uber eats/grubhub orders after a night out. I would say I run past three or four bags of food/whole pizzas/etc. on people's doorsteps on Saturday and Sunday mornings after a decent party night. Sacrilege. Even on my worst nights, I never abandoned the food. \n\nPeople leave random shit in the middle of the roads after partying too. It is my gift to the neighborhood to clear the roads at 5am when I see party debris from the hoodlums. While I wasn't a litter-er, I consider it proper penance for my own hoodlum days. Monday, I removed a hoodie and a pair of jeans from the middle of the main drag. Hope they had a good night! 😁\n\nI’m afraid of birds during nesting season. I’m weary of small dogs. Every dog that has harassed me in the last two years was like less than ten pounds. There are trail regulars that I recognize and love seeing.\n\nI had somebody’s mangy little terrier thing try to hamstring me a few months back.  Lucky I was wearing sweats of it might’ve broken skin.\n\nI’m a lot more conscious about the kinds of shoes people wear! Before I started running and taking my shoes seriously, everything was just “sneakers.” The last time I was at the airport I actually noticed a bunch of people wearing Hokas and Brooks.\n\nBeing jealous while seeing other runners out and about while I’m dealing with another injury\n\nHow other muscles are also used during running, muscles that you wouldn't think of at first. I also lift and lately I've been doing it more, and it's wild how my run can be limited or be somewhat impacted by muscles like the biceps (you need to keep your arms up) or the back (for standing/running upright, stability?).\n\nEdit: Another quirk I have is when I see a cat, I try to pet it. You can quickly tell if they want to or not. I usually don't take any breaks but for cats I do. I at least greet them in a baby voice.\n\nI always get a little thrill when I see a cat out and about. But I restrain myself from petting them because I don't want to potentially bring anything transmissible home to my two seniors. I'm glad you're getting the pets in!\n\nSomething with the way I hold my left hand always makes it sweatier than my right when I run. Haven’t figured out how to change it yet because I don’t think about it until I feel the sweatiness lol\n\nMy first two weeks of running, I noticed my right hand always kind of formed a weird claw. I'd have to shake it out sometimes because I thought I looked like t-rex. Since then, it's mysteriously gone away on its own.\n\n1. Now when driving I think as a runner would when I see how many miles a destination is away an think of the running route I have that \"matches\" it best. \n\n2. I now realize that most people driving are oblivious to their surroundings and everything around them. \n\n3. \"Yield to pedestrians\" and crosswalks seem to be just suggestions to drivers. \n\n4. I'm now familiar with most of the runners and cyclist in my area and we all acknowledge each other when out in our runs/bikes. \n\n5. Seeing other runners inspires me to keep going if I'm struggling for any particular reason. \n\nHappy Running everyone!\n\nWalking distance is about 2 miles. Anything outside of that is a bit far. But it’s only 2 miles, I can walk that in 32-35 minutes… \n\nI regularly head about a half mile for a work day lunch  coffee. I’ve taken several people with me. They have never joined me again.\n\nWhen I started longer runs, training for half marathons, I once chaffed my nipples. To my surprise, I realized that was a thing among runners when googling about it, and I wear nipple covers for long runs and on rainy days ever since, for the joy of my wife who looks at me with a funny face every time I take my shirt off. Not the kind of reaction one expects when taking the shirt off in front of the wife 😂\n\nThere is more. I recently discovered my testicles retract after long runs. I googled that too and learn about the cremaster muscle, and of course I learned that’s a common thing for male runners 🫢\n\nI learnt races get people together more than United Nations does. No matter race, religion, gender, politics… everybody is there to have a good time, to help, the public cheers no matter what… I wish that would be a common thing outside of races. \n\nI learnt one can say “that was a fun run” and non runners will never understand that concept 😝\n\nI had to drop my car off to get its AC fixed. Instead of taking an Uber back home, I just ran the 3 miles back instead\n\nTotally agree with your second point! Ever since I started running when I walk ten miles around Disney world I think dang it’s really not a big place lol\n\nMy perception of distance has changed so much it's actually kind of disorienting sometimes. There's a local mall that's anywhere from 15-35 minutes drive away, given traffic. I always thought it kind of far, but it's only 6.5km away! A totally manageable run distance for me now. During rush hour, it might be just as fast to run as to drive. I haven't quite wrapped my head around it yet.\n\nMy concept of distance is so messed up lol.  But as a park one time when I had to drop my car off at the shop I didn’t need a ride home.\n\nThere are truly so many unforeseen benefits to this new hobby.\n\nI learned that roosters start crowing around 4:30am! And I’m so glad none of my nearby neighbors have any.\n\nI learned which streets have streetlights. This weekend I drove down one of my routes in the daytime and it was a little surreal to see everything beyond what the streetlights reach. \n\nThere are two other cyclists that I see some mornings. One runner I saw three times a couple months ago, and I guess he either gave it up or found a different time/route, and I’m slightly sad about it. \n\nIt also makes me sad that as a woman running alone in the dark, I feel nervous. I carry pepper spray. Once I turned around and changed my route because I had a bad feeling about a person standing around at the end of the street.\n\nI play minigames like \"match the car to the person/house it belongs to\" or \"identify the junk food wrapper from afar\"\n\nThe permanent lack of pigment under my Garmin.\n\nI only really noticed the terrible air quality of central London until I started running through it. The black bogies are real\n\nI’ve lived and run in central London for 3 years and never got black bogies - where are you running?\n\nNorthern Line tunnels\n\nNah northern line is my commute, it’s nowhere near that bad\n\nOof\n\nWhich trails the mosquitos love. I’ve also perfected spraying deet in a way that doesn’t make me nauseous\n\nI am noticing race stickers on peoples cars more, everytime I see one now I say outloud “oh look! That person ran a XYZ!”\n\nI went from being disgusted by nose blowing to being a top-tier snot-rocket launcher.\n\nPlease do a shoulder check before launching. \nI’ve been on the wrong end of a launch. 🤬\n\nI know which crosswalks give me a better chance of getting hit by a car.\n\nLeaving the house feeling like “bleh” sometimes results in a really good run. \n\nMy wife and kids no longer ask how my run went, or are impressed by my “long runs”\n\nNose/outer nostril sweat more annoying than a runny nose 😂\n\nMy rock climbing balance is incredibly applicable to running. I always forget that limbs have weight and the movement of them really affects the way you can move when running uneven terrain.\n\nI now scout out running routes on Google Maps when booking holiday accommodations. Running in new places is my favourite thing (is it my husband's fav thing as we plan sightseeing around my running? Debatable lol)\n\nYou are spot on!\n\nI don’t have as much energy after 12, so I get my 6-7 mile runs in early…. So every time I see someone running at night I wonder if I could do that. \n\nI notice other runners and sometimes use that as motivation to get in a run instead of an indoor (Peloton) workout. \n\nI revisited my college campus recently and what once felt huge now seemed small.\n\nHey, Peloton gang! A couple weeks after I started running, I discovered Peloton’s outdoor classes and their 5k pace setter collection. It’s been so great, I never realized having an instructor in my ear would be so helpful. I got my bike in 2022, but it’s really the other classes that I’ve fallen in love with.\n\nI’ve never tried one of the outdoor classes, typically listen to music and go\n\nI'm so glad I'm not the only one with the annoying inner elbow sweat - I thought there was definitely something wrong with me!\n\nI was confused the first time I noticed it. Like, why do my inner elbows feel weird? Look down at arms. Is it sweat??? Note the discomfort. Continue running. lol.\n\nI usually hiss back at geese but the other day one flew at my head so now I stare them down maintaining eye contact until my head won't turn that far anymore.\n\nI watch people’s running form and any bags, belts, bottles, etc they have.\n\nI always admire how everyone else seems to run so effortlessly, while I'm kind of wheezing along. \n\nIt's also fun when I cross paths with the same runners multiple times in a run as we do our own loops around the neighbourhood. Makes me wonder what route they took.\n\nI pay attention to shoes way more - on friends, other runners, or even strangers.\n\nRunning in the bike lane is easier than the sidewalk. 😩 Sorry bikers.\n\nWhen I am out and about cycling driving or walking nowadays I notice entrances to trails and paths that I haven't run along yet.\n\nDry shampoo is a godsend lol\n\n* my navigation skills became much better, I know the city better, than my partner, who only uses public transport\n* the city is not as big as everybody thinks. I have to run to the other side of the city, if I go on really long runs (20 km+)\n\nIm a really sweaty person by default so when ever I run I am drenched in sweat. When I get home and take off my apple watch it always flicks a ton of sweat into my face, every time without fail.\n\nI find myself noticing shirts and hoodies that commemorate a running event and feel a morsel of connection. (I then assume the wearer is a marathoner, while I’m in the 5K and 10K pack.)\n\nI know the distance between every road around. If my kids are considering biking anywhere, I can calculate the exact distance for them.\n\nnow i know when the sun rises every morning bc that’s when i time my runs for - and it really shows during transitional seasons! i’ve moved my run time earlier by 10mins at a time every week for the past couple of weeks as summer rolled around and sunrise got earlier\n\nYour relationship with pedestrians is completely different to when you’re a fellow pedestrian which I find quite interesting. I always find it super awkward running past one person like it must look like I’m hurtling towards them which I imagine is quite funny.\n\nOne thing I noticed, but it took me about 20 years of running to notice. As I was running one day, I was wondering why I used to get “stitches” when I first took up running, but hadn’t had one for years. Then I noticed that my body had adapted to time the exhale for the same moment as the foot strike. I think this is the reason I no longer get stitches.\n\nI am even sexier than before. 😁\n\nAs an amateur runner, I've found that the more my resistance increases, I can tune out easier and just start to deeply reflect on what's bothering me. It's almost getting to the point where it's automatic."

    "body": "Hi!! I am a first time pacer for a marathon next Sunday and finding myself a bit nervous. I primarily run ultramarathons now but have done a few marathons as well. I chose a pace I know I can be comfortable at, trained properly, etc. I’m actually using the marathon as part of my training for an upcoming 100 miler. Still, I have never paced before and don’t know the ins and outs. Luckily, I am not the only pacer for that time and I am running with another person. What should I know? What should I do and not do? I sometimes wear aftershocks to listen to a book or podcast during long runs. Should I avoid this ? Thanks!!!! ",

    "all_comment_text": "I've only paced half marathons.  Its really fun for me.\n\nSome Dos:\n\n- Talk to those around you.  They are using a pacer because they likely aren't confident in their abilities.  Talk to them before the race.  They will find you when you hold up the sign.\n\n- Stick to your pace.  This should be like a 'duh' moment.  The first marathon I ran my pacer took off a full minute ahead of the pace and I fortunately let him go.   I passed him standing still at mile 10 when he was clearly way ahead of the pace.  \n\n- Adjust pace for the course.  If you are on a 4 hour pace slow down to 9:45 going uphill and maybe 8:45 going back downhill.\n\n- Be a cheerleader.  If someone is being paced by you it is likely they are new to marathons.  Sometimes you can cheer them on, ask them how they are doing.\n\n- Let them go.  You will lose people during the course of the race.  That is ok.  They may have overestimated their abilities or were using your pace group as a stretch goal\n\n- Walk through aid stations.  So many people don 't get enough water during the race.  Walking through the aid stations allows them to do this.\n\n\n\nThe only don't I have is to not listen to music or a book unless you can do it while still communicating with their group.\n\n-\n\nThis is all the advice you need! Hopefully you'll be with someone who has paced before but if not make it as fun as possible to the people around you.\n\nI had a lovely pacer for my first marathon and it really helped!\n\nTowards the end tell everyone you want to see their backs crossing the line! Was a nice way of pushing them right at the end. \n\nEnjoy yourself too!\n\nInstead of walking the aid stations I will do a little sprint and clear the aid station ahead of my group and then sort of jog for a couple seconds so any of my runners that are walking the aid station can get what they need. If you can grab a couple extra gels you can hand to anyone that missed them.\n\nIf you are using a printed pace chart on your wrist print a couple of extra to give people in the starting coral. If you can get your pace sign the night beore having one lamininated on the stick can be handy as well.\n\n*edit* Talk to your co-pacer ahead of time and find out their strategy. I've had people that wanted to finish 5 minutes ahead of pace for people trying to go to Boston (vice just qualify). As the pacer I don't think that is my job but if that is what they want to do make that clear to your group. We ended up splitting (If you want to finish 5 minutes ahead go with him, if you want to finish on time stay with me). I am not a fan of trying to bank time for your group but it's come up enough times that I make a point of asking the question before we start now.\n\nThat’s what is disappointing. I don’t have any of my co-pacers contact info. We are not in a group chat. Pacers were supposed to post an introduction in the marathons Facebook page but they never did that so I have no way of reaching them. Hoping to do some quick catch up before the race starts.\n\nI've never met the people that I've paced with before.  We usually meetup on race day.   One other thing that is nice about having 2 pacers is that you can take a bathroom break during the race if needed.\n\n&gt; Walk through aid stations. So many people don 't get enough water during the race. Walking through the aid stations allows them to do this.\n\nI usually walk through aid stations when I run marathons because I'm a larger runner and I typically need to take at least two cups of water/gatorade. If you look at my mile splits during the race you can't even tell which miles have an aid station and which don't because it's like 5 seconds of very fast walking/shuffling. I'm constantly surprised by how many people refuse to do this. I've met a lot of people who try to sprint through aid stations and then end up dehydrated by the end. They act offended when I suggest they walk through the station.\n\nWalking never affects my race time, but trying to run through the aid station and then becomming dehydrated almost always affects my race time.\n\nYeah, I don’t ever walk, but I still get enough fluids. I use the pinch the top method with the cups and I actually run with the cup taking several small drinks until it’s gone. Cups do suck though, I’ve run a looped race where there was a bottle drop and you could grab one of your bottles on each loop. That was awesome.\n\nTypically in marathons I need more than one cup per aid station, so even the pinch the top doesn't work too well for me unless I walk because I can't drink it fast enough. One of the reasons I kind of prefer the massive races like the world majors is because they have almost an aid station every mile, and when they're that frequent I can take one cup per station and run them. I've run a bunch of smaller races with an aid station only once every ~8k-10k and I definitely need multiple cups in those to stay even close to hydrated.\n\nI ran a small 4 miler last summer. It was a 4th of July run in the Florida panhandle. So it was easily in the low 90s and very humid. The run had absolutely no shade or trees as we were running on pavement along the beach. It was SO hot. They had an aid station every mile and the 3 mile aid station ran out of water! They had big jugs of water, but no cups to put it in and most people didn't keep their cups from the previous aid station. It was brutal. I saw someone cross the finish line and then faint. \n\nI plan on doing the race again this year, but I will 100% bring my own water bottle just in case.\n\nEvery 8-10k??? That’s crazy. I’ve run in smaller marathons and I’ve never had them more than 3 or 4 miles apart. I can definitely see why you would need more than one cup then.\n\nSkip the head phones,  get to know your runners,  walk the water stations,  don't talk too much about yourself, during a hard part of the race be sure you are talking and getting their mind off it,  ask questions. And if you lose someone close to the finish,  go back and get them! I got the best review for doing that! 😌\n\nI’ve only had the pacers once. Didn’t do that much talking myself because I was locked in at a stretch half marathon goal pace, but really enjoyed having the conversation between pacers and other runners to keep me distracted.\n\nThat is awesome!!! I know a lot of people count on others conversation!!\n\n+1 on talking and being a cheerleader. For my first half, the pacer I stuck with was super nice and encouraging. Of course, the interactions were few and far between, especially as people at my pace might struggle to keep pace and talk\\*, but they were always positive. She did basically everything on this list and I was really happy with the experience.\n\n\\*EDIT: Because we're slow. Not because we're fast.\n\nIve seen couple of times pacer walk into the first aid station and almost whole pack running past way faster and losing the pacer. I'd rather the pacer clear the aid station fast and run a bit slower after it.\n\nI always told my pace group that we were going to walk for 5 seconds at each aid station so they could actually drink water instead of splashing it on themselves and reminded the group during the race that I was walking.  I also have only paced smaller races so perhaps this wouldn't work as well with big groups.\n\nThank you for this!! Very helpful. I was concerned about the aid stations.\n\nOne thing that I liked about my 8:42 pacer was that they (and the group) would just.. count.  Like the pacer would shout out numbers, and the small group around them counted up, one number at a time. It was a simple activity but really added to the sense of comradery.\n\nEugene?  I'll be there!\n\nI've run in one marathon (Houston) and followed a pacer the whole way.  He made my experience. \n\nWhile this isn't really advice on how to pace, it's more of what he did to make the race better.  He would constantly tell us what to expect as we continued along the race.  He'd warn us of an uphill, but tell us not to hit it hard, we'll make it up on the way down.  He'd encourage and chat (but not too much).  He was great and I credit him with me finishing well ahead of where i ever thought i could.\n\nNooope Toledo Glass City Marathon!\n\nWell, just know that you're pacing services will be appreciated.  I tip my hat to you.\n\nThank you!! Hopefully I’ll do alright for my first time at it.\n\nYay! I'm running Glass City again and am planning to use the 3:40 pacers. Calling out splits and doing the math, letting people know we are say 15 seconds ahead, 10 seconds behind, etc is really helpful. I try to turn my brain off and just run so the reassurance along the way that everything is going according to plan is helpful. Also when coming up to aid stations, which side of the road is it on, and is water or gatorade first is handy to know. It's a great course, thank you for pacing!\n\nOh I loved Glass City Marathon! Such a fun and shockingly fast course!\n\nMe too!\n\n\nI followed a first time pacer for one half marathon and hearing his story of how a pacer pushed him to PR was cool. He also was funny a good cheerleader and storyteller. Really pushed us all the last couple of miles. He made sure he acknowledged everyone running with him but also didn't make everyone talk because he knew we were all out of breath and concentrating on getting our pace done.\n\n\nAlso I couldn't get over how he was talking the whole time, not out of breath 😂 \n\nSeconded no headphones. Be sure to know the race course, major elevation changes, mile markers, aid stations, etc. Runners will be looking to pacers for guidance, so be prepared to answer any questions about the race. \n\nBest of luck!\n\nI figured no headphones but just wanted to check, I’m good at making convo lol. I haven’t ran the course but it’s my hometown marathon so I am very familiar with most running routes.\n\nI have paced many, including three Chicago marathons. \n\nThis is their race, not yours. So think of yourself as a gracious host. Start conversations, keep them going. If you find someone struggling, you do what an ultra pacer would do - distract, encourage, help problem solve. Know the route. We always held even splits but stuck to even effort in hilly sections. My favorite thing to do from mi18-25 was to let runners take turns holding the stick. I tell them it is a magic wand and gives you a boost of energy. And it invariably lifts their mood.\n\nI love that 😭\n\n[deleted]\n\nOh heck yeah. Do it. But do it with a group. If running a marathon with friends or a pace group is amazing, wait till you sign up with a club to train. \n\nEndurance running is a team sport.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSlow? \nOur club has pace groups from 3hr to 5hr\n\nTell the group before the start of the race what your strategy is. Faster in the first half? Even splits throughout, and if so, how will hills affect that? Planning to walk through water stations? Etc. I really appreciate when pacers tell me details like that ahead of time so I can decide if I want to stick with them the whole way or what. \n\nScope out the race course ahead of time so you can give runners a sense of what's to come at various points throughout the race.\n\nYea this annoyed me when I was trying to use pacers. I tried twice. They took off extremely fast for the pace (once a 10k and the other the marathon I did) and it was demoralizing. I tried to keep up at first but then had to let them go because it was killing me to run that much over pace. I felt shitty the whole time until the end when I ended up catching up to them (in one case passing). I guess they did the start fast method and slowed down later, but I really try to pace each mile to not burn out which was a problem for me when I started running.\n\nI hate this. As a pacer I consider my job (besides being a cheerleader) as a metronome - keeping time for the other runners. My goal was always to hit each split to the second. If someone has a goal time but doesn’t know much about pacing, I want them to be able to look ahead/behind them, see my sign in the distance, and get a sense of how behind/ahead of their goal they are. \n\nRelatively even splits is the best way to pace any long distance running event. Pacers that go out super fast are usually inexperienced and shouldn’t even be pacing. That’s literally the worst thing you can do as a pacer.\n\n'Strategy' for a pacer should always be as close as possible to exactly on pace the entire time, including up/down hills, so that people know if they're ahead of you they're good. The clock doesn't change speed throughout the race or pause at aid stations, so neither should you\n\nRemember the course will be slightly longer… I paced a 4h marathon. I put the pace into my Garmin watch so I just had to glance down and made sure it said “time ahead” as long as it said somewhere between 30sec-2min I was happy. But I thought I was 30 seconds ahead of time, and finished 30 seconds behind, because of the little bit of extra length there always is. Rookie mistake. But now I know. And I thought the goal would be to get at least one person to a sub 4, and ended up finishing alone. But I met some new people, and paced a guy almost the whole way, he was very greatful. People will join and fall off. It’s kind of awkward when people just fall off behind you, but everyone is running their own race, and that’s just how it is. The reason I decided to pace was having a really great experience with a pacer who I was only with for a short time, but he was so positive/funny/encouraging… I wanted to be that for someone else! Would do again!\n\nIf you load the course and use Garmin PacePro I believe it will correct for where you are on the route rather then expecting an exact 26.22 distance.\n\n+1 on using PacePro on Garmin. Adjust the setting so that it adjusts pace based on changes in grade, especially if it's a hilly course.\n\nOne of the times I paced a race, I used an app like [this](https://starttorun.info/peters-race-pacer/) on my watch. I don’t remember the actual app (it was many years ago), but it let me correct the distance to the nearest mile with a LAP press, and showed me how many seconds ahead or behind I was from goal pace. I highly recommend it for any over (but practice it on a training run or other race first!)\n\nThe things you should know are much much more about interacting with the runners, helping them understand the course and aid stations, motivating them, etc.\n\nAs far as running, just run the most even splits you can to aim for finishing 1 minute before your allotted time. Not only are you pacing the people around you, you're also pacing people you don't even know are keying off you. Don't bank a bunch of time or go for negative splits. Just run an even pace as close as you can to what you need to do.\n\nDefinitely no headphones \n\nAnd don’t go out too fast. Pick a pace you can comfortably hit, not anything that’s remotely a stretch\n\nDefinitely no headphones. You're there to pace and motivate your runners. \n\n\nHow are you pacing? GPS ? Old school with timer between mile markers ? \n\nGPS, I have a Coros Apex. But planning on going off mile markers instead. I also printed a race band that says what each of my splits should be.\n\nDoes GPS work for your race? If there's any interference then it can be quite a bit off.  It's still good as a guide but I find mile timers to work really well if the course has been set up properly. \n\n\nGood luck with it. \n\nI’m planning on ignoring my gps and using the mile markers instead. Hitting the lap button at each marker.\n\nAt my last race the pacer yelled out time elapsed at each mile marker, along with if we were right on pace or in some cases, a little ahead of pace. I found this helpful as I don’t like looking at my watch or phone much while running.\n\nThe pace bands I have used have mile time as well as total elapsed time from the start.  Between those 2 metrics it was really easy to stay on track.\n\nI printed one off today! Planning to use it!\n\nI've paced a bunch of halves, but not a full marathon.\n\nDon't wear your shokz.\n\nTalk to the people around you.\n\nTell them before the start that if they need to stop for a toilet break not to  sprint to catch you up but to do it gradually \n\nKeep a steady pace \n\nYou don't need to give out gels or water. Everybody is responsible for their own nutrition and if they fall short on that, it's not your role to help them. It'll be a lesson for them for next time.\n\nGood luck\n\nYes -- don't get heat exhaustion and vomit at mile 9 of a half-marathon\n\ngot it, wait for mile 10 ;)\n\nYeah anybody that does that obviously had no business pacing for that pace in the first place.  It should be a relatively easy pace for the pacer. Not a hard, PB type effort. Unless it was like 110 degrees F or something, in which case no one should be attempting a half marathon.\n\nHaha yeah... this happened to me.  I paced this race before and it was 20 minutes slower than my normal HM pace... it was just a brutally hot day and I stupidly didn't hydrate enough.  I was sweating at a rate that I've never sweat before.  It's something that hasn't happened before or since.  Totally sucked missing my pace time by a full 4 minutes.\n\nCommunicate the race strategy clearly. Splits for front and back as well as how your going to pace and significant hills.\n\nWear something bright and easily recognizable, even if just a bandana on your head. The only time I used a pacer they wore the event t shirt just like 50% of the pack and it was hard to find them when I had dropped back.\n\nDefinitely no headphones.  Need to be engaged with your group.\n\nOthers have mentioned, talk to the group A LOT!!\n1. Talk to everyone around you in the corral, tell them your plan.  Such as what to do at aid stations.  Target completion time (i.e. target is 30 sec under the pace time). Anything about the course, like there is a big hill at mile 22 so we are going to try and be 1 min ahead of pace before the hill, etc.\n2. Call out every mile split and how far under/over the group is.\n3. Tell anyone to let you know if they are struggling at mile 18, 20, etc.  Sometimes a pep talk or a gel can get someone out of the dark zone instead of letting them tail off.\n4. Know all the aid stations, locations and offerings.  Remind people if a certain aid station has gels, food, etc.  If there is a big break between aids, remind everyone not to skip the one before the gap.  Help them manage the race.\n5. Call out any portos.  Remind them if they need a stop to slowly catch back up.  Depending on the group size and your pace partner you could drop back with someone to bring them back.\n6. If it’s a crowded race may need to call out turns coming ahead so the pace group can be aware of corners coming up.\n7. Early in the race there will probably be some that want to chat you up about your running history, be friendly and try to help everyone have fun.\n\nLastly have fun and enjoy helping your group achieve their goal!!\n\nI also have only paced half marathons but I was also nervous about it.  I mostly agree with /u/pacific_crick with a couple of additions.\n\n1. I actually decided NOT to adjust my pace for up/downhill and told my group i was going to go super steady pace the whole race and they could adjust knowing that I would be their beacon for goal time\n\n2. I was/am still not sure if pacing should be driven by gun/chip time so I don't have a good answer for that but I did make sure to tell people what group i started with or what my chip time difference was.  I was in a pretty small race so this didn't really matter much but in a bigger race, that can be important\n\n3.  Someone mentioned carrying some gels, etc for people.  This is great and I did it.  Also I carried tissues but my race was a cold, windy day.\n\nReally, I was super worried about doing a good job but it worked out fine both times (-30s of goal time) so everyone was happy...I think.\n\nWhy would there ever be confusion over using gun or chip time? The pacer is going to start pacing when they actually cross the start line/timing mat. Whoever wants to go with that pace group should start with them from the beginning. In a big race, if you didn’t start with that group you can’t expect your chip times to end up the same. But I don’t think this is ever an issue. People using a pace group line up in the corral with and start the race with that pace group.\n\nI never paced a bigger race but I did run Chicago and the mixing of start times after 10 miles or so seemed to be pretty extreme so if I am running and see a pacer just ahead of me, it would be kind of nice to know which corral he started in.....as an example.\n\nI guess if I started with the pacer in my group, this would be a non-issue but latching on to a group later in the race is something I have also done.\n\nI agree that chip time would seem to be the only way to do it though and thats pretty much what i did.\n\nNo advice because I don’t run with pacers personally but just wanted to say thank you and it’s awesome you’re doing this, it’s really so valuable for so many runners!\n\nUse the manual lap function on your watch so you can accurately assess your pace at each mile marker, just in case GPS is incorrect.\n\nMy buddy ran the Eugene Marathon last year and just shared this story yesterday:\n\nAt the half, all but one of the 3:00 pacers dropped off (no one knew why), and when my buddy went up to the remaining pacer and asked about their speed and the guy said, \"I don't know, my watch died.\" My buddy missed 3 hours by 6 seconds.\n\nSo if you have a technical malfunction, get someone to sub in for you (or join you) as soon as possible to provide accurate pace info.\n\nAlso, I'd say (and this is just me), no, listening devices are out for pacers. If you're pacing, people are depending on you not just for a proper pace but guidance, so you have to be available to talk to them.\n\nThat is a horrendous pacing situation on all fronts\n\nJust stick to a consistent pace. I’ve been at races where the pacer wanted to do their own strategy and some people weren’t expecting it\n\nI've never paced a race, but I've run with pacers for stretch goals. I've always appreciated it when the pacer engages with me and other runners. Talking about random topics helps take the mind off the pain and helps pass the time.\n\nCame here to say to say this as well! I’m just an average HM runner so I’m commenting with a racers perspective. The pacer at my last race was amazing! She, and a few other runners, made a game of counting dogs. It was so much fun and helped me to keep going when the race got tough.\n\nLots of good advice here, I've paced a few full and half marathons now, and I'd agree with a lot that's been said in here. I know I had a target pace and wrote down what times I should be at at different target distances (10k, 20k, 30k, 40k) and I had a strategy of going a little faster in the first half but slowing down a little in the second half, but best to go by course and really just stay dialled into a particular pace. \n\n  \nFor the marathon in particular I can tell you that you might have a good entourage for the first half, but when the second half starts lots of people might drop off, and you might end the race with only one or two people running with you. The marathon is a brutal distance for newcomers and many underestimate the challenge, don't be discouraged by this, just be open and communicative and supportive of those around you, and work with those who are still with you at the end to make sure they keep pushing that last kilometre or two.\n\n  \nUltimately try and keep a steady pace (hopefully you've been practicing with some long runs just so you can really dial in that pace), keep your own fluids up as well (you might end up being out there a bit longer than you yourself are used to, so do keep in mind you still also need hydration/fuel) and try and make it as pleasant an experience to those around you, and keep in mind that on the course you are a cheerleader not just for those you are pacing but also for those you pass and those passing you. Just be a source of good positive vibes and you'll be golden haha\n\nDon't overthink it. Keep a metronomic, consistent pace -- the exact pace advertised on your sign. Don't \"bank time\" or do anything fancy -- and don't try to coach anyone unless they ask you to. It's tempting to try to push people harder with encouraging words, but you have to let them figure out what they have left on their own rather than risk pushing them to blow up.\n\nHeard an incredible anecdote about a pacer in the Milan marathon the other week in my favourite podcast. \nThe pacers had balloons to identify them. About 15 miles in, the pacer this guy was following stared looking at his watch, muttering, and shaking his head. He then said, “Damn, I’ve fucked this up,” popped his balloon, did a hard right, and got on a tram!! \nA whole group of 4.5 hour runners left a bit bewildered and angry 😂😂\n\nI’m running with a pacer for the first time this weekend and reading all these tips just got me super excited! Hopefully the pacer is already doing these things and if not, is here reading them 😎\n\nThe rest of your runs from now until race - run at pace\n\nEven if you are alone, you are not.  People will tell you they kept you in their sight.\n\nI echo all of these great suggestions! I’ve paced countless half marathons and marathons before I had kids, and I could go all over the place anytime for races. \n\nI’d the race doesn’t give out pace bands, I usually printed out and created myself a pace band that is course specific (you can get most races through findmymarathon.com and get one mailed, too). I’d also mark it up with where there are water and electrolyte stations so people can be ready with their energy gels and whatnot. \n\nThe pace band shows overall elapsed time, too, and I’d make adjustments in pace based on the mile markers on the course and if we’re hitting the elapsed time. Generally, your pace will have to be a teeny bit faster assuming the course won’t be exactly 26.2 on your watch but slightly longer. \n\nI prided myself in being able to hold people steady with pace, keep their effort manageable, and then let them inch ahead once we hit mile 23 or 24. Pay close attention to pacing to not burn anyone out early on. \n\nIf you have people who do stick with you past mile 20, and they decide to make a move, tell them it’s like pressing 0.1 mph faster on the treadmill, not a whole 1 mph. You don’t want to end up passing them in the last part of the race. \n\nDecide what to do with the pace stick if there is only one between the two of you. Usually, we’d take turns switching off after every aid station. \n\nDefinitely no headphones- in bigger races, I’d ask where people are coming from and we’d figure out who traveled the farthest for the race. I’d sometimes look up a couple of landmarks or notable things we’d see on the course. I’d learn a few names so I can cheer them on as the miles went on. \n\nHonestly, just have fun, be the source of positivity… and also just keep pace/effort steady for the racers!\n\nhttps://www.marathonguide.com/fitnesscalcs/PaceBandCreator.cfm\n\nSo many great comments here.  I'm sure you'll do great!  One of the pacers at my first half marathon carried mustard packets for muscle cramps.  I'm not sure how much truth there is to mustard combating muscle fatigue and cramping, but I liked the idea!\n\nThe race organizer's should be telling you what they expect. Some races it's even pace, some, especially if it's a hillier course, even effort.\n\nI recommend not use head phones as with pacers people like open communication and keep the experience friendly. Often sometimes other runners will consult with you about cramps etc or if they should hydrate or not, best to keep it looking friendly and be open to communication all around you.\n\nIf you’re the only pacer and need to use the bathroom during the run, please tell your group that you’ll meet back up with them - approximate the time if you can. I had a pacer leave for the bathroom 3-4x on the course without letting us know if she was coming back or what we should do in the meantime…Maybe see if anyone in the group wants to be the de facto pacer for the few minutes you’ll be gone.\n\nMy last marathon my pacer wore jeans shorts.  Try that.  I loved that guy.  He also knew all the cops.\n\nHow did you land your first pacing gig? I’m interested in pacing a half one of these days\n\nI’m sponsored by a local running shop in my area. They reached out to our racing team first to see if anyone was interested in pacing. I’m not sure how to get involved otherwise tbh 🧐\n\nHi, long time pacer here. Some tips in no specific order:\n\n* Garmin Pacer Mode FTW.\n* No headphones.\n* Talk with people around you. I am very introvert, but it is kind of different on the run. On the last kilometer I normally stop running and cheer people to run faster.\n* Run the distance and the pace you will be in charge of at least once before the final marathon.\n* Enjoy! It is the ultimate milestone.\n\nBest thing pacers do - yell at anyone blocking the route ahead. Usually, pacers collect a dense clump of runners surrounding them, and it makes it hard to move around. Pacers are basically driving a school bus.\n\nMany races gave this big helium balloons with pace expected time written on them.\n\nTry to hold it at least for 5 better 10 or even more km.\n\nIf you lose your group - they race ahead or drop out, please remove your pace info - unless you decide to stay at that pace.\n\nHad a 2:30 half marathon pacer race ahead of me at a half marathon which totally bummed me out - and then I finished at 1:48.  Psych\n\nNo advice but thank you! My last half marathon PR I ran with a pacer and he was awesome. I’m running with a pacer next weekend!\n\nI've paced a bunch of road and trail races, half and full distances. It's best if you have the split breakdown on your pole and try to run on cruise control. It's ok to be ahead of pace in the beginning though. \n\nTalk with those that want to talk to heighten their experience. I like to praise others that are silently grinding through it, especially when it's a small group that has gone silent. I'm big on giving folks milestone updates at the race is coming to a close: 5k left, 2 miles left, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, ECT... I look around and encourage others to pass me in the final mile. Give as many high fives and praises at the finish line.\n\nHey there, just checking in to see how you went with your pacing gig.\n\nGot any feedback on how it went?\n\nStart out super fast for the 1st half so that your group can have an easy last half.\n\nI like it.  Then they can rest for the hard part.\n\nThat’s definitely what my pacer did!\n\nRun even pace throughout but, shoot for 20-30 seconds faster per mile then the your calculations require.  courses are always long and it absolutely sucks when you have to sprint the last mile to make your pace time.\n\nIt’s moreso the GPS adding distance than the courses being long. But it’s more like 4 or 5 seconds per mile usually, not 20 or 30. Sometimes in the downtown sections of cities the GPS is really wonky because of tall buildings as well.\n\nYou can check your watch time at each mile to gauge the discrepancy"

    "all_comment_text": "I live in MN and winter running is a point of pride :D  The colder more challenging the more you see people are up to the challenge to do it.  On funny thing is when I sweat and run in sub zero snow your eye lashes / eye brows and facial hair turns to icicles, then you remove hat and you have what looks like a smoke stack from your head as warmth hits the hold air.\n\nI always feel like an anime character when frost is all over my face and hair is fuming when I take off my hat. It's a really fun moment! Or when you're practically a snowman.\n\nLove it. I also live in Minnesota and I also run year-round outside. You know what it's like, on those really cold days we have the trails and roads pretty much to ourselves :)\n\nWho is plowing your trails? I can't imagine running in deep Minnesota snow would be fun\n\nHere in Peterborough (about 90 minutes NE of Toronto) nobody plows the trails, but there are a fair number of hikers.  Within a couple of days of a snowfall (maybe 4 or 5 for a heavy dump), they've packed the trails down enough for running.\n\nThe problem comes in the spring, when it all melts.  The snow in the woods melts away soon enough, but the packed snow on the trail turns to ice.  There are a couple of weeks when the snow is all gone, and the trail is just a ribbon of solid ice winding through the trees.  The only part of the entire forest where it's difficult to walk is on the walking trails!\n\nTrail networks are great here. The Minneapolis Parks board prioritizes plowing and cleaning some of the trails around the lakes and rivers almost before some of the roads. This is for your year-round bike commuters and walkers and runners. Then a bit farther out from the cities many businesses and homes will shovel or plow their sidewalks. \n\n\nFurther, the roads are always plowed. So if you hit up a business area on off hours or the weekend, you can run right down the roads with no traffic at all. \n\n\n Rarely do I actually have to run in moderate to deep snow. But sometimes I do on purpose for fun! I also have snowshoes designed for running, so I'll do that as well\n\nI’ll remember this the next time I’m grumbling about it being too cold for a run when it’s not even below freezing 😂 I actually do like winter running though to a point, it feels refreshing!\n\nLol.  For me, just above freezing is perfect running weather.  Within a mile I'm down to shorts and a t-shirt, but barely sweating for the entire run!\n\nYes! The steam coming off your head is hilarious.\n\nI saw steam coming off of a mound of manure this morning on my run, on a CA farm....it was cool and nasty smelly. And I saw my breath being 41 degrees and thought yet I'm pretty bad ass....but then you guys talk about sub zero David Goggins stuff, and thought may be I'm not so hard.\n\nMy ultimate steam story:\nThe Canadian (cross country) Ski Marathon in 1979 began with a mass start of maybe 1500-2000 people at dawn.  And that day, it was about -30 Celcius (-22F).  \n\nAt that temperature, there's not a cloud in the sky.  The air is simply too cold to hold any moisture.  So it was kind of surprising that 3 or 4 kilometers into the race, it began to snow.  At the top of a hill, I stopped and looked back.  Maybe a hundred feet above the column of skiers, going back for miles, there was a narrow but solid cloud; the steam from our collective breathing.  Looking ahead, i could only see a few hundred meters before the skiers went around a bend and were obscured by trees, but above the trees I could see the snaking cloud of condensation that marked where the column must be.\n\n The snow that was falling was entirely made of water vapor we had all just exhaled.  We were skiing through falling snow we created ourselves.  \n\nIt was amazing, but also kind of gross.  Not the kind of snowflakes you want to catch on your tongue!\n\nRemember walking past the  pub with all the locals at the windows laughing at a bold runner standing by the pub sign looking like a giant match or a cone head from the movie!\n\nMe too! One of the MN streak runners (13 years). Ever hit a nice patch of ice under snow and done a pirouette? :)\n\n.\n\nI took figure skating lessons when I was a young girl, I expect that and a low center of gravity might help me when I need it XD (MA based for me, though, not MN; also have worn trail sneakers when it's dicey but not so slippery I can't go out on the paths, which they try to clear.)\n\nI wear track spikes that are two sizes too large. They are great. The larger size gives me a wider toe box and I can run full speed on flare ice!\n\nWhat type of shoes do you wear for this? Do you wear microspikes? This is my first winter in MN.\n\nJust regular shoes with thicker running socks but I add YakTraks. For city running you really don’t need it as they clean the sidewalks quick but nice to have for icy days.\n\nTrail running shoes are good as long as there hasn’t been a thaw or rain. If there has been a thaw or rain, big slick sheets of ice are a real concern. In those conditions, I wear studded shoes (Icebugs.)\n\nI live in MN and I do not like running in the winter here lmao. Too icey. I slip and fall every 3 steps. Not fun.\n\nIt’s nice to know we have so much in common with our southern friends.\n\nMy dumbass ran in those -35 wind chills 2 years when Christmas was bad. That was an experience, took a picture afterwards that I have saved and my face was straight frost  😂. Usually fall at least once or twice during the winter and I just live with that lol. I love winter running.\n\nNew England here. Same.\n\nUp here in Toronto! Love winter running. It's like an ice bath or cold shower - you feel refreshed afterwards. First ten minutes suck tho.\n\nNever dress for mile 1 that’s my rule for sure\n\nAnd don't step on the puddles/wet patch on the sidewalk. It's a black ice trap. \n\nOther than that, I love running on the snow.\n\nOr ends in a wet cold sock and a frozen foot.\n\nThat’s a good rule, but I find it so much harder to get out the door knowing I’ll freeze for the first few minutes!\n\nso which mile do you guys ideally aim to dress for? serious question Or I should phrase it, in a typical run with even split all the way through, from 0%-100% which % dictates how to dress\n\nSo I’m a bit obsessive about what I wear 70+ tank top and shorts, 60-70 t shirt shorts, 50-60 long sleeve shorts, 40-50 light tights and light quarter zip w shirt 30-40 light tights and heavy pull over 20-30 heavy tights and heavy pull over, below 20 will mix in pants and tights depending on how cold and a gator. I dress for miles 2-4 because after that I’m getting sweaty and I start pulling my sleeves up or opening the jacket to cool off. You can’t dress for the end or you sweat way too early. Also rarely do speed work in winter or I’d dress lighter. Also all Fahrenheit (since I see your handle). Hopefully that helped instead of think I’m crazy. The middle 50% to answer your update\n\nHow does rain or rain + wind impact your protocols? Go 1 step colder or just add a thin shell?\n\nAnything above about 50-55 I’ll just deal with the rain bc the shell keeps it warm and traps the sweat. Lower I would add a shell but if I add the shell I typically bump up a level bc the shell traps the heat so I get hot faster.\n\nHonestly depends how long the run is. Shorter it matters less you can't really get that cold nor if you get too hot will you have enough time to really sweat then get cold. So for non long runs I just slap together my usually gear and hope. It's good enough. For long runs I usually aim to be cold for at least the first third but not my hands or feet because once they go you are not getting them back. They need to be warm by mile 2 or 3. If I need to take off a layer gloves are an easy layer to do so.\n\nWisdom here.\n\nSame here. It's wonderful... When they finally plow a bit of snow...\n\nYou can always call in the army to help with that  😉\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm not far from Toronto.  I run in [icebug Newrun's](https://icebug.com/product/newrun-mens-bugrip-gtx-blackgrass).  Enough of a stud to grip the ice, but not such big spikes that you catch then on anything.  And Gortex to keep the feet warm and dry.\n\nFirst 10 and that walk back after finishing (and drenched in sweat is the worse). Good thing the loop I take is close to a subway, so the first time I ran in cold weather I made a quick dash all the way back.\n\nGot smarter after that and started running with a jacket tied to my waist to keep me warm during the cooldown\n\nI like winter running because the cooler temps help keep my heart rate lower, so I can push harder.\n\nAs well, with winter running gear comes more pockets. I can carry phone, keys, etc without having to strap an extra waist pouch to my waist, like in the summer.\n\nOccasionally I'll run commute to work (11km with a nice net downhill). These runs are always planned in advance because I bring my clothes and stuff to work the day before. One time, I woke up to knee depth snow. Ran through it anyway. Took 50% longer than unusual, but it was nice not having to worry about struggling with my car.\n\nThat is impressive!  🫡 Am in CO and you def get more snow than we do.\n\nI've had multiple winter runs where the water in my camelbak hose froze. Sometimes it has just been in the mouthpiece, and I've been able to work the ice out. But others, the whole hose freezes and that means no water for me.\n\nAlso, there was a February race two years ago, on a really, really cold day. I was not in this race, but a buddy was. He relayed to me that almost all the water at the aid stations froze, and his personal hydration froze as well.\n\nAnother time, I ran in rain, sleet, snow all in one run. It was warmer when I started, so it was raining. By the end of the run, it had gotten colder the snow was really coming down.\n\nI've heard the tip that you can blow air into your hose to push the water out of the hose to the reservoir where it's less likely to freeze.\n\nI’ve heard the tip that you can mix in a bit of vodka and that will keep it from freezing.\n\nI just tuck the hose under my clothes against my body between drinks to avoid the hose freezing.\n\nThe skiing camelbacks have an insulated tube that doesn’t freeze.\n\nThis is a fall running story- I trail run a lot; I fall 1-2x a year, but usually without damage. A few weeks ago, I was on a nice trail run. At one point, I tripped, fell more heavily than usual, and got some bruises and a broken finger (must've smashed my hand into a rock when I fell). This past weekend, I was on a longer (17 mile run), and hit the same trail, going in reverse direction, about 12 miles in. Sure enough, I wiped out \\*again\\*, in almost the same spot. It wasn't a particularly gnarly section (yes, there were leaves which covered roots, rocks, etc., but nothing unusual for the trails I run). I'm convinced that trail is haunted.\n\nIt just is too dark for me to run\n\nHeadlamp is a game changer!! Chest light bounces too much but I just bought a headlight from Amazon and it was perfect. Give it a try!!\n\nShout out to my Instinct 2X watch with built in flashlight.  I wouldn’t try to use it for a whole run, but if you’re like me and only have a few short stretches that don’t have good streetlights, it’s perfect.\n\ntrue, but it isn't about uthe dark It just doesn't feel very safe for me I guess.\n\nAh yes, that is an entirely different matter for sure. I joined a running clinic over the winter (organized by a local store) and we run in a large group in the dark which definitely feels much safer.\n\nI run in the dark on the road with a headlamp and lighted vest. I’m a woman and live in a city, so I also avoid certain areas in the dark. So far so good! For trail running in the dark I try to run with friends when I can. \n\nI just ran a 100k and a good bit of it was at night; it can be so lovely and peaceful.\n\nrunning at night can be very peaceful...and for someone like me who gets really bogged down and dispirited running in heat and humidity...night running is so pleasant\n\nbut man it is very scary. I'm a man so obviously i can't speak for how much more dangerous it is for a woman...but there's so many distracted drivers and while I keep to the sidewalks, there's just some times you can't really control those things \n\nthe early darkness is what sucks most about winter running. The cold, snow, and ice are what they are...but the night is by far the most dangerous part of it imho\n\nHip lamp is even better IMO! I use the fitbelt attachment lamp and it’s great. Lights up the path, stable, and doesn’t blind others.\n\nHmm interesting…I’ll reconfigure my chest light to attach to my flip belt as a nice back up to my head lamp. Thanks for the tip, kind redditor!\n\nI have the clip on Nitecore Thumb 85 . clips to your hat (I literally never run without a hat). I think this is perfect. I can turn it off, leave it on my hat once the sun comes up.\n\nIt is still a bravery test. Dark things lurk the forest. A man it’s the forest lord in the daylight, at dark, he is but a blind, deaf, slow prey\n\nIts not a bravery test. Its a test of whether ot not the Media successfully brainwashed you with fear. The World is much much safer than the media makes it seem. There are no dark things lurking The forest at night. \n\nAnd my countless nights of sleep in such forest during my backpacking trip prove it.\n\nYour forest are weak and young, then\n\nRunning through fresh snow in total calm/quite is a next level high .. you need so get some tracks for your shoes, headlamp and do it!\n\nI’m a morning runner and go out with a vest and a headlamp. I also have sidewalks on most routes, but I still have to watch for animals.\n\nMe too!  My favorite are the deer-- two glowing eyes from about people-height is way better than two glowing eyes from skunk-height!\n\nYeah, I basically have to run in the morning now.  I really dislike running in the dark, especially if it's wet or icy.\n\nNox gear is your friend.\n\nThis is my issue\n\nAfter a while, you don't mind the snow. The cold sucks, but if you have gear it's not too bad.\n\nIce is very dangerous. I've fallen twice. One time i ruined a good pair of windshield pants which sucked but whatever. The second time, I tweaked my knee to the point where there was definitely aches for a few days. \n\nBut it is by far the dark of night that makes me most nervous. I don't live in a dangerous area, but man it is not well-lit where I am. I mostly keep to the sidewalk but even so I am still very scared of erratic drivers, especially since so many of them are not paying attention (you see so many people on their phones on the road these days)\n\nToo dark to run? Thats a train of thought i will never understand.\n\nI wonder how dangerous your area is and how vulnerable you are\n\nReality is much safer than you think... its just that media, movies, series.... developed a false sense of reality within you. If you actually look at the data, its highly unlikely that you are going to get robbed, beat up, raped.... especially as a runner at a point in time where the youth (most criminals) are getting lazier and weaker than ever before.\n\nJust dont be stupid and you will be fine.\n\nDoing a 16 mile long run out and back in England in Winter. \nFirst half was fine but then it rained and the temperature dropped on the way back. Pavements turned to ice and I couldn't stay up. Had to navigate back running on grass when available or in the road in tyre tracks. Awful and slow. Absolutely freezing by the end of it. Never had that before or since. Weird. \n\nI like winter running to a point.  There is always that point in the depths of winter and the depths of summer where I hate the extreme cold or extreme heat/humidity.  I get out there so long as there isn't ice since the sidewalks where I run are next to a busy road and one wrong fall could be fatal.  \n\n  \nI had one fall where I hit the ice patch and flew up in the air like Charlie Brown when he gets the football taken away by Lucy .  It hurt but I always brush myself off and keep going.\n\nA couple of years ago I had a fall on ice that I described as a cartoon character fall. I swear if I could have watched a replay I had the whole arms and legs flailing going on before I absolutely wiped out\n\nthere was one time when i ran where I was going at a careful pace to avoid icy spots...but i swear my brain just paused and the next thing i remember i was on my ass wondering \"Wtf just happened?\"\n\nLove winter running personally.  I get very hot when running (oddly enough I’m usually freezing) so the cold weather feels really nice.   One of my favorite things is when you’re out on a run and it starts snowing, what a cool experience.\n\nSnow is fine. It's actually really beautiful and you learn to appreciate winter\n\nit's the fucking freezing rain and ice that really makes me hate winter running. Also getting pitch black at like 3 p.m. That's lame as hell\n\nI love running when is cold, more than when it’s hot\n\nSame.  I would rather run in 20F and wind than a humid 75F and sun.\n\nExactly. When it’s cold you can wear everything to keep you warm and when running you get warmer. \nBut when is hot, there is nothing you can do other than drinking\n\nExactly!  I’ve run in as cold as -5F, which is when I start to have some problems breathing the super cold air.  I will wear a fleece balaclava with a face mask which helps, but it’s not ideal since I’m breathing through the fleece. \n\nIt does kinda suck even at 10-20F if the wind is strong…everytime you change directions, you wish you had more/less clothing.\n\nsame. although bump that up to 80F (25C for every NORMAL person who uses metric unlike America gawdamn it) \n\ni will say this, 12-15F is probably my breaking point. I tried running in 2 F once. Worst mistake i ever made. Returning to my apartment, i think i coughed my guts out for 45 mins\n\nWhen I run below 10F/-10C or so, I wear a synthetic fleece balaclava with a mouth covering.  It gets a little tricky to breathe out of as it gets wet due to condensation, but it’s not too bad.  The worst part is as it gets wet, anything not directly over the mouth starts to freeze, and eventually it loses its elasticity and the mouth cover starts to fall down.\n\nSame!\n\nI always enjoy it, though winter here in the UK is often fairly mild compared to elsewhere - though it's often wet. \n\nA post Covid distance run I did involved 5ft snow drifts, plus some weird otherworldly moments when I thought I was being chased by a cloud. It was a beautiful day overall, makes you grateful to be able to get out.\n\nI mostly hate how early it gets dark here\n\nI live in Quebec, around mont Ste Anne. Running here during winter time is really is something. Hubby goes for a run at least 3 times a week regardless of the weather/month. I accompany him 1 x week. I find it hard to run in the snow, at -15’C/20’C with the wind. I am 4’10” and having snow mid calf while running is not nice! He’s 5’10”, he doesn’t have that problem! 🤣 it gets very dark quickly and he has lights on him so it’s like I’m chasing or running toward the 💡\n\nOh, dang! XD Yeah, I'm shorter than you are and I think I'd try to find a route that was somewhat cleared or move my schedule around if it was more than a few inches. There are drifts which make it worse, though.\n\nI used to switch to the treadmill around October and would use that for my runs until March/April.  When COVID forced the closure of the gyms I knew that I had to adapt or lose all my fitness.  I invested in some good gear for winter running and got out there.  The first winter was rough because I was still learning what kind of layers would keep me warm and comfortable.  Sometimes I didn't layer up enough and froze, other times it was too much.  Now that I have a good sense of what works well for me I love winter running and have no intention of going back to the treadmill.  I find trail running shoes with Gore Tex are a must to give you good traction on the snow and keep your feet dry.\n\nLove running in all seasons. Dont like all the laundry with winter running\n\nCan be a pain or pleausure.\n\nThere's a hilly 16 mile race in New Hampshire in late January. It's often very cold. One year it was forecast to be -4F/-20C at the start, and the organizers sent an email telling us that we weren't allowed to race in shorts. I was scratching my head at that one. Why would they have to tell us that. Who in their right mind would run in shorts. Then on race morning, some guy came to the start line in shorts. The decided to let him run anyway. I just don't get people sometimes. I was much faster than him, and I didn't see him on the course.\n\nWhat's the name of the race? I've got a friend who is looking for a winter race.\n\nBoston Prep 16 mile race\n\nHere's a link\n\nhttps://www.gdtc.org/bostonprep\n\nThank you!!\n\nThe only trail race I really do anymore is in the Ouachita Mountains in eastern Oklahoma in January. It was 26 and sleeting at the start the first year I did it!\n\nYes, I love it! I have an autoimmune disorder that makes body temperature regulation a serious problem. For whatever reason I cannot tolerate temps much above 70 F for running outdoors so the whole summer, I am on the treadmill or running outside in the dark hours. But I love winter running; with the right layers, I am always comfortable and run well. And I live in one of the coldest and snowiest areas in the U.S. \n\nThe one thing I don’t like is when it’s sleeting in my eyeballs- that can sting. One day I was doing a hilly winter 20-miler by my house and a horrible blizzard kicked up and the wind was really cutting through me. I was struggling the whole last half. A beautiful hound who had sometimes joined me on that route for a half mile or so before turning around decided to keep me company for a very long stretch. He ran 7 miles with me and took me right to my driveway. I don’t know how he knew I was home, but I’m really not sure I would have made it without him. I kept saying thank you to him. \n\nI had planned to drive him home because I knew the farm where he lived, but he just turned and ran home. He gave me a great gift.\n\nI run with my watch next to my skin to track heart rate, but being a warm runner, the sweat buildup under the watch began to freeze even though it was covered by my jacket and / or long sleeve tee. I even tried to limit the time looking at the watch when running in cold conditions but it didn’t help. \n\nI have since gone to a chest strap and wearing the watch on top of the sleeve.\n\nI prefer it to summer running when it's deathly hot and humid. I've never cut a run short due to cold. Can't say the same about the heat.\n\nA couple years ago it was around 15°F but the wind was howling 20-30 mph. And out in farm country there's nothing to protect you from the wind. My gloves were not up to the task and my hands kept getting colder and colder. Around 14 miles in, there was a barn, so I stood next to it to get out of the wind but still needed to warm up my hands. So in full view of anyone driving by, I'm standing there with my hands shoved down my pants. \n\nAlso, in balaclava weather, if your cheeks get cold the obvious solution is to pull up the balaclava over your nose and mouth, but then your breath freezes and the ice makes your face even colder.\n\nA few years ago some freezing rain moved in sooner than expected, and the paved roads turned into black ice and I even saw a car slide into the ditch. Luckily I was running on a rail trail with pea gravel so I had enough traction to run normally, but I had to run on the soft shoulder for the mile or so between the trail and my house.\n\nWhere I live, one of the best winter running paths is along the frozen river. I like telling people that for a few months out of the year I run on the river.\n\nI'm actually bothered by the lack of daylight than the cold.  I've been threatened by coyotes and winged by passing cars in the dark.\n\nIn Florida panhandle it’s currently less than 70 degrees so I really have to suck it up buttercup\n\nJust completed my fun in 28F … feels good after! The only funny thing is self reflection“I can’t believe I’m out here running when I could be in a warm bed for an extra hr.\n\nI had one back during lockdown where I thought I could repurpose one of my cloth masks as face covering because it was really cold and I kinda had an upper respiratory infection at the time - so anyways I now know what being waterboarded feels like…\n\nNo its horrible. I have to stop many times to pee during my runs. When you have to stop you can feel the sweat and then it gets so fkn cold. Running on wet clothes.\n\nI'm a total polar bear. Give me 10 degrees over 90 any time.  It just feels better.\n\nIt isn't real winter running unless I have little icicles in my beard.\n\nAs someone from Texas winter running is PR season\n\nWinter running is great, it's the in-between months in the 40s that I struggle with; is it long pants or shorts, high socks or not, long sleeve and vest or just long sleeve, or do I need a jacket...? Once it's snowing I don't have to think about it, but just above, and maybe rain and wind, ugh.\n\nI lived in Virginia &amp; North Carolina for 38 years of my life and I have slipped on black ice more times than I can count.  Sometimes just a mild skip, sometimes a total wipeout.\n\nI live in NL and hate it with all my heart because here winter running doesn't only mean running in the cold but also with wind, lots of it, and half of the time rain also. So yeah, getting cold and wet while struggling with the wind is not so fun. Still do it though, my love for running is stronger.\n\nI live on the east coast of the US, and I run outside regardless of the seasons. Years ago, it started snowing unexpectedly during my long run. It was a very light snow, but there was just enough cover on the ground for it to be pretty slippery on the back end of an out-and-back route. I slipped on the rubber mats around a railroad track and fell hard on the ground. Imagine the way a cartoon character falls when their legs get wiped out from under them. That was me.\n\nA very nice driver stopped to see if I was okay, which I was (although I was so embarrassed that another human was around to witness the fall). I ran home slowly (and wet) only to discover that my sunglasses were not on my head. Stubborn me had to head out again and rerun my route to recover them. And there they were--at the scene of the fall--right on the railroad tracks. While I did have some pretty gnarly bruises, I still laugh thinking back on that moment.\n\nI love running when it’s cold. Also [obligatory video post since no one else has done so.](https://youtu.be/JKZj2W2YyKY?si=zhAqH6UL9mlr40_n)\n\nthank you\n\nI’d take winter running over summer running any day! 🥵\n\nI live in the Seattle area where snow is relatively rare but I always enjoy running in it if it's the light stuff. Not as nice when it slushes out, and one year I had to run on a sidewalk for a block when the cars had turned it into sandy snow. That was not fun.\n\nIn the cold, wet, dark, PNW I change my mindset from fun, beautiful, peaceful runs, to the mindset of “embrace the suck”. Sometimes I pretend I’m a Viking training or heading into battle.\n\nI live in Australia and spent a decade in Perth. \n\nSub 20c and I am debating a hoodie. \n\nSub 15c and I’m debating getting out of bed. \n\nAny rain? Not happening. \n\nA true Aussie fair weather runner now. 30c plus no problem 😂\n\nAs a Dutchie, if we wouldn’t run in the rain we could never go out😭\n\nI grew up running on country roads in Kansas. Winter runs were awesome. Crisp clean air, blue sky, little frozen puddles to “skate” on, or crunch underfoot. Now I live in the PNW where winter runs just means darkness and rain, so it’s less of a thing I enjoy and more a thing to get through.\n\nYup. Just ran 5K today in 30 degrees. Much easier than 90F degrees out nearly passing out\n\nRan up a hill in Switzerland. One corner had ice, so I slipped on my backside. I ran the same route a week later, so I went round the same spot super super slow.... slipped on my backside again, harder!\n\nI’ve run a couple western Canada winters. Getting out there at -40 is a point of pride. Also the pictures you get of every facial hair being frosted can be pretty fun. The big problem is the number of ass bruises. Ice is no joke.\n\nI love hate winter running. I really don't mind the cold but I don't like the darkness nor do I love the ice grenades, black ice that hides under a thin layer of fresh snow. Not enough snow for traxx but just enough to hide the ice. My personal nightmare. I winter I always try to run some trails, the snow dampens sounds so it's incredible peaceful and tranquil.\n\nWinter time is the only time I feel truly fit. My heart rate is so low 😝\n\nAs some one in FL, I look forward to it.\n\nbest air you can breathe IMO\n\nI like trail runs at the end of winter.  Will the ice hold me? How deep is the void underneath it? Will I have *any* ability to change direction once I'm on it?\n\nThere is a few lakes near my home where the snow is cleared and a path is groomed on top of frozen lakes .. I have always wanted to run on there but that fun just freaks me out, this year might be the year to do it!\n\nOne time the wind chill was -15 Fahrenheit and my wife said it was too cold to run outside. So I ran outside. It was really %- #@ing cold. Breathing in was painful. I showed her though.\n\nMy goal is to keep the same intensity during the coming winter was always - a 6 to 8 km run roughly every 5 days. It depends on the weather of course - no running in the rain and minimum temperature at 0° C.\n\nI like it now that I have the proper gear to stay warm and safe. Last year was a lot of trial and error finding the right layers and shoes, learning what worked and what didn't.\n\nNo.  Dry wind and Winter burned my skin.\n\nI'm waiting for a good hard freeze so I can take my dog running on the trail right by my house without worrying about ticks. It's also nice to be able to take him out in the afternoon, instead of trying to get up early before it gets too hot for him.\n\nStudded running shoes. A must for icy roads and trails. And maybe a thermosbottle. 🤣\n\nThat's why I bought a treadmill last year. As much as I don't mind the cold, the slush/ice/snow is just brutal so I like to have an option.\n\nI love it!\n\nI live in Canada usually when it's snow everybody is either in home cause the weather or indoor on a gym except me I  love running in 3 feet of snow my family think I'm nuts  including my neighbor 😄😄\n\nWinters where I am are often gray and wet which can be a slog for me, but I do appreciate the cooler air. The early darkness at my latitude is annoying, but hooray for headlamps!\n\nNever ran in winter before. How do you not slip and fall?\n\nLove running during the winter, especially when snow is falling. It's next level vibes for me.\n\nWinter running isn’t too bad, coming from a Canadian. You just have to plan ahead and prepare. That being said, I rarely run outside when it’s -15C or colder (unless it’s really sunny outside with little wind). But as long as you’re appropriately dressed and prepared, it can be quite nice!\n\nThe added plus with winter running is you are motivated to keep going because the moment you stop, you feel the cold like nothing else!\n\nI can't believe you guys that go out without your faces covered.  I'm out there looking like I just robbed a bank in my black ski mask.\n\nI’m all for winter running. The only problem is my nose always gets runny and I have to blow it out every other minute which is a HUGE pain long run days.\n\nI used to live in Texas and during a winter marathon cycle I just never succumbed to putting a shirt on, even as morning runs dipped below freezing.  Now I'm in Colorado and held out last year until catching Covid.  This year hoping to skip shirts at least while it's above 20\\*F.\n\nThe \"funny moments\" are the couple of dozen times a week when I get wild looks while everyone else is bundled! 😂\n\nRunning in the cold makes me feel invincible\n\nAs someone who does a lot of trail running across muddy winter fields here in the uk , I love it . It freezes up otherwise trench like conditions !\n\nMan. I hate running in the winter. My nipples chaff so bad and it makes me want to die. It’s the absolute worst. lol\n\nNW Oregonian here-- our winters generally aren't snow-filled, but they certainly are dark and rainy and foggy!  The few days of snow and ice we do get are always fraught, as our cities aren't very good at sidewalk and shoulder-clearing, and we don't use salt on the roads.\n\nI do layers, and generally don't wear gloves unless it's below freezing.  My hands always seem to get too hot and sweaty!  \n\nI love coming home from a winter run with frosty/misted eyelashes, and steaming in the cold air before I head inside.  And, I love the opportunity to wear my Noxgear vest on \"rotating rainbow\" effect, especially in the fog.  So pretty (and visible)!\n\nYes. \n\nOne time I was running, had neon green everything, and a high vis vest on, and some kid on the dirt road that I live off of pulled right up behind me so I was in the middle of his head lights (keep in mind I'm running into oncoming traffic so he was on the wrong side of the road) then when I pulled over to the side of the road he whipped up behind me, screamed something I couldn't hear over my headphones, and then drove off. \n\nOther than that I think people think I'm an odd ball. Although I didn't really run at all last winter. I need to though and so far fall has been mild. So I might be able to run proper. \n\nI also need new shoes the lugs on mine have all but evaporated so there's definitely that. \n\nI graduate with a 2nd degree next year and will be back to full time winter running. Ideally pseudo trail running.\n\nI live in a somewhat snowy/cold  climate and I am not a fan at all. I use my treadmill a lot in winter. I'd rather run in 100F then below 20.  To me, running should be uncomplicated. In spring, summer and fall I can just put on my clothes and go (maybe carry water). In winter, it's a whole process.  Plus I like wearing as little clothes as possible. \n\nThere certainly can be a beauty in a nice winter run but I dread it more than I look forward to it.  I once did a race in 0F, it was icy and snow packed and every step was dangerous. It took forever but it at least showed me my limits.\n\nI live in Texas,  so hell yeah\n\nI live in Salt Lake City, Utah and when it gets icy or snowy here I usually use [these micro spikes](https://a.co/d/aAtWivJ). Not sure what the general consensus on these are in this sub\n\nI love running in the winter. My favourite is -15c sunny day. You have the perfect balance of layers and it feels so good. \n\nWe had a big snow storm and the snow was like frozen waves….you could run on the hard pack snow in the trough of the wave and the crest would be 1m+ high. You had to zig zag down the path to stay in the trough.\n\nI’m in California and my “winter” is like 50°F so I much prefer that to the 100°+ in the summer\n\nFellow men runners, how do you deal with your man parts getting through those leggings type winter pants? I wear regular shorts on top of it but I don't like this. Are there pants where there is a little bit of padding there to hide things? Or you just don't care? I live in a school neighbourhood and usually start my runs when the kids go to school so I don't want to disturb them.\n\nAfter decades of messaging around women accepting their bodies and “teach the boys not to stare,” this might sound odd, but we need the same movement for men. If boys being distracted by women in leggings in the boys’ problem, then girls being disturbed by men in leggings is absolutely the girls’ problem.\n\nFull disclosure: I’m also uncomfortable running in just leggings and always wear shorts over them because of the same shame you feel surrounding our bodies. I get it. It’s hard to overcome such deeply ingrained cultural shame around male genitalia.\n\nWhat running shoes can one use in the winter?\nWhat dressing recommendations would you guys recommend? Thanks\nAny other useful info is appreciated\n\nJust to be clear, when you are running your water bottle you take with you freezes and you can’t drink it\n\nI live in a mediterranean city, winter here is a joke but it is fun to see runners dressing up as if it was -5° out when it's like 8-10° tops\n\nLive down south in England and winter running is just cold air so need to layer up and wear gloves for first 10 mins or so....very mild winters tbh, I went to visit my mum and ran up north in the snow and was horrible I'm a 'Southern softy' now apparently 😂\n\nTemps can get pretty low where I am from. -5 to -10 Celsius is standard winter here. I run the whole year round. The coldest run I had this year was about -25C in January; it was an interesting experience, but I only managed 6K at this temperature. My legs started to freeze (I had thin running Nike tights + thermolayer), and it was also hard to breathe, so my heart was racing faster than usual.\n\nI have to put on double socks when temps are below 10C. Also, shoes are getting really rigid, so you have to find snowy paths, as there will be almost no cushioning on the bare asphalt.\n\nNothing beats fall running (October and early November make for heavenly running), but I don't mind the cold. I wear a T-shirt and shorts down to 40F, long sleeves, running tights, and gloves 20-40F, all that plus more layers 0-20F. It's almost never below 0F here, so I have no experience below that.\n\n\nWhile I don't mind the cold, I really try to avoid running outside of the roads/trails are snow covered or icy. I'll usually run inside at the gym instead. My city gym has a 1/6 mile indoor track that I will use instead. I really hate the treadmill, so I would probably brave the ice if was a choice between that and the dreadmill for any run over 30 min or so.\n\nI live in Iowa and without a doubt running I'm 70 degree weather is pretty nice. Running in 90 is not, so I prefer running in the winter. Dress appropriately, but rule of thumb is if you are comfortable in that first mile, you are probably overdressed.  I'm 64, so I won't run in snow and of course ice, but I do like running in the cold.\n\nI’m in Australia so winter running is the ideal season to run because summer is just too hot but a funny moment in summer is whenever I go for a run everyone looks at me and my dad like we’re absolute physcopaths\n\nI go running around park that more or less turns into a big slushy/icy/wet bowl. I never plan on staying dry for long, normally coming home soaked to the bone. Theres been a few times where I slip ass over head.\n\nDon't enjoy it...\n\ni run all winter in just shorts , beanie and gloves.. at least 6 miles . coldest i’ve done is high single digits, love the snow packed trails! one time at 630 in the morning, my dog took off after something down hill, dragging me on the leash at least 19-15 feet before i slid to a stop \n\nMost people's idea of winter is pretty different from mine, and I still hate it. As an Aussie, I can't keep my hands warm if it's less than 10 Celcius. I'll just wait for a warmer part of the day to go running.\n\nLiving in a small town winter running means no prick old bastards commenting at the park whenever you pass by, or simply no people who want you to stop for a talk.\n\nI’d rather run in the heat. BUT I was able to be the first person running on a trail with a few inches of snow (in the US where it doesn’t snow much usually) and the quietness of being out there and the fresh snow crunch under my feet was so nice, I’d do that again if it snows this year lol\n\nI take the easy way out and run on a treadmill. I actually run on a treadmill nearly every run\n\nI live in the Bay Area where it rarely hits freezing and I hate it! My goal in winter is usually just to stay in good enough shape that I have a base for running in the spring. So much extra laundry and I don’t like my face being cold.\n\nI'm in socal, so our winters are nothing  compared  to yours lol but I still hate it. I like to run around 4 or 5 am, it's freaking cold for me.. I don't like it.\n\nSometimes, when I feel cold before going out, I tend to overdress. 10 minutes in, I regret my choice. Then the next time with that in mind, I go out dressed just right for the run except now I'm cold the first 10 minutes and I race the warm-up. I should really get that stationary bike for the winter warm-up!\n\nI don't like it, but I do it because of pride. Honestly it's actually kinda cool when it's all white and the wind is kicking up some of the powdery snow. Makes me feel like I'm on an ice planet.\n\nThe aftermath, steam from the body…. For me its the best time\n\nI don't enjoy running period.  But I'll take winter over 90 degrees in summer humidity.\n\nI love winter running cause I sweat a lot!! Like I could run a 1km at such an easy pace and I’m already dripping. So a cold winter run keeps me cool, so it’s the best honestly. Summer runs or hot and wet 👎\n\nI hate winter running. I cannot get my outfit right, there's always some part of my body that's freezing and some part that's sweating far too much.\n\nUnless it gets slippery or less than -5°C, I'll run outside.\nUnder said conditions I'd rather jump on my bike trainer.\n\nRunning in Bangor Maine. -30 Wind chill.  After run my eyelashes froze together and I could not open my eyes.  I also liked when ice crystals would form in my nose as I would breathe in. Good times.\n\nI was back home in the Midwest for Christmas last year and it was below zero. I remember a moment where the news was saying we just entered a winter storm watch, so I looked out the window and there was a guy running with shoes, pants, gloves, and big headphones but no shirt or hat. I was definitely bewildered, but I had to admire his resilience to the cold!\n\nno funny moments but yes I do enjoy it\n\nno funny moments but yes I do enjoy it\n\nI do! \n\nMy funny moment is the time our local running group planned a group run one winter morning. We didn’t realize how icy our route would be, but when we got started, it was very much like the “[Get On Your Feet](https://youtu.be/EmUYpgptBtY?si=3aXn7jaHaOXx1VlF)” scene from Parks and Rec 😂\n\nI’m assuming a comment about anything winter related in Europe is allowed here? \n\nTrue confession: As a certified dumb American, I didn’t quite realize until maybe 2 or 3 years ago now that snow was even a possibility in Europe. Just for some reason thought that it didn’t snow there. No reason beyond ignorance. \n\n(I just turned 50 and I’m so, so sorry for being me.)\n\nYes, I run more in the winter than the summer. I hate running in hot weather."

I was a casual jogger, where I would run  anywhere from 2-5 miles for 2 months consistently at a time and then drop off, only to repeat the process over the years. I ran my first half marathon in 2017, where I finished in 2:00:34! That time haunted me and kept me coming back to run more half-marathons! However, my consistently inconsistent pattern would continue based on when I signed up for half-marathons and I would run on average 200 miles a year.  I have done about 8 half-marathons, where my PB is 1:52:46 and have gotten super comfortable with racing halves but I never thought I would run a full marathon because I always seemed to go too intensely into training and burn out quickly. However, that changed this year when I turned 29 and I told all my closest friends that my 30th bucket list included finishing my first marathon!\n\n# Training\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, my resolution was to just build a running base that prioritized consistency over everything. However, I went back into the inconsistent running stretches until May because I got sick so often this year with flu, covid, and RSV.\n\nIn mid-June, my social calendar really cleared up after I finished being a bridesmaid in my cousin’s wedding! I started on the Hal Higdon Marathon Intermediate 2 plan, with the Intermediate 1 plan as backup. I went for this plan because it was straightforward to me - just run and put down the miles. I have never really trained with tempo runs or speed training and am a typical Zone 2 runner so this seemed like the plan for me! My goal with this plan was at the minimum to stick with hitting the long runs on Sundays as a benchmark of success I knew that this was a pretty high mileage program, especially for someone like me who lacked consistency.\n\nI pretty much stuck to the plan and hit almost every single run in the plan. The biggest game changer for me was getting a hydration pack. It was like my blankie for running, especially for the heat in the summer. I had to temper my expectations with most of my runs in the summer, especially because I knew that heat and acclimation would play a role in my training. I was really determined to stick to the plan so I printed it out and every time I ran, I crossed off each run so it helped me stay accountable. I was hitting all the mileage as the program progressed, running consistently at 10-11 min/mile pace because I was often so tired from adapting to the ramping of mileage that each week brought.\n\nThe plan was really great! I hit all three 20-mile long runs, however, towards the end of the training plan, I knew I was getting mentally fatigued. I took week 14 completely off from running and took half of week 16 off. I even skipped the last long run at the end of week 16. I knew I was starting to get mentally tired from running. I was tapering, but I felt like it was too fast based on what was written off my plan. I combat this, I went off the metrics of my Garmin FR 265 and did my shorter runs at tempo pace 9 min/mi to keep myself in the \"Productive\" status, if that meant anything at all. It was honestly the best I could muster towards the end of the training plan. I had felt like I peaked at the end of week 15 right before the taper when I did a 10 mile tempo run at 9 min/mi on Saturday and then a 22 mile run at 9:30 min/mi the next day on Sunday on tired legs. At this point I felt like it was 50/50 whether I could finish sub 4 for the marathon since I lacked the confidence in myself.\n\n# Race\n\nThe night before the race, I could hardly sleep. I had set my alarm for 4am so I can wake up and get my stomach all situated and wake up properly. However, the anticipation of the unknown made it really hard to sleep! I felt like I hardly slept and it was such a light sleep! I only got 4 hours of sleep, but it was the best I could do despite getting into bed super early at 8:30pm.\n\nRIght before the race, I dropped off my bag at 6:55am, which in hindsight left me very little time. I should have definitely dropped off my bag earlier, but it was brisk in the morning and I was being a baby about the cold. I ended up starting with the 4:40 pacer and hectically moved with the crowd. It was definitely super stressful dropping my bag off super late!\n\nGoing into the race, I told myself that I would forget about all the goals I had set and that I would just go based on vibes. I told myself I should aim for a 9:30 min/mi pace for the first 4 miles and just see where that takes me.\n\nMy first 4 miles were definitely slightly faster than I had planned since the crowd fueled my excitement. It felt comfortable though jogging and I had the realization that it had been a really long time since I ran on fresh legs. I started to hit my groove and honestly the race kind of just flew by. I felt super strong and the only thing I tired to do was not go above an 8 min/mi instant pace. I definitely did not want to hit the wall.\n\nThroughout the marathon, I was taking gels at every 3 miles. I had previously trained on taking gels at every 4 miles so it was not too bad fueling so often. I think this strategy helped break up the race into manageable 3 mile chunks and as I was taking my gels, I was mentally evaluating how I felt and adjusting my speed based on the vibes. I let myself fly a little whenever I felt like I hit a running high.\n\nI knew that the race had over 900 ft of elevation gain, but I purposely did not look at the course map to see how many hills there were. I think that made it manageable for me because I wasn’t dreading all the mini climbs that came. I knew from racing half marathons that I usually burn out on hills, so this time around, I took it easier going up the hills to conserve energy.\n\nAfter the last hill at about mile 23, I knew it was the last one because my friend had told me how that’s usually his mental block for the race last year. I felt a high knowing I had conquered most of the hard things that came from this race. The first 23 miles at this point had flown by and had felt comfortable to me. I think it helped knowing that I could tell myself that I had hit 20 miles multiple times before and that each time I had done it, it had felt slightly easier each time. My brain at this point was telling me that I just had to get through the hardest 5k of my life and that I would get to the end and finish. I think that gave me the kick that propelled me to the end.\n\nFor the last half mile of the marathon, my sister’s boyfriend was on the sideline and found me. He started running along the sideline and hyping me up, telling me how I worked so hard and that he knew I had more in me. I definitely increased my pace at the end because of his motivation. As I crossed the finish line, I felt the weight of completing the marathon hit me and I definitely welled up with happy tears. It was also really sweet that my sister just finished her first half marathon, too. It was great to share a running milestone with my sister!\n\n# Post-race\n\nI never envisioned myself writing a race report. I lurk around all the running communities on Reddit and I love reading race reports. They’re so inspirational and commemorate all the hard work that people have done. I do not think my story is particularly interesting, but it feels so sweet to be able to join the community and reflect on what I had done by finishing the marathon.\n\nWhen all my friends or family have previously called me a runner, I often would tell them that I am a jogger. I have never considered myself someone who was particularly serious about running, however, after running the marathon, I have grown to appreciate myself and what my body can accomplish. It had not dawn on me how much work I had put in the previous 4 months. I never realized how much grit I had and how much I could push through all the sucky parts of training for a marathon. I had just proven to myself that I can be consistent and that all this hard work does pay off. I just have to keep in mind the big picture and have fun with the process.\n\nThe thing that surprised me the most was how much fun I had on race day. Right as I took off, I mentally told myself \"Just do this once and you will never have to do it again since it’ll be off your bucket list.\" But that mentality has definitely changed. In fact, I feel so inspired and have created other goal race times for 5ks and half marathons for the next 6 months. I am definitely going to be running another marathon in the future - I just don’t know which one yet!\n\nIf you have made it this far, thanks for reading my reflection on this wild journey! :)\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

    "all_comment_text": "Hi from another portlander! I found this inspiring, thanks for writing it up! I’ve done three half marathons now and feel like a full is in my future; your approach makes it seem manageable. Congratulations on hitting all of your goals!!\n\nI did the exact same plan and race as you!! Hal's plan worked great for my first marathon 4 years ago, I went with intermediate 2, skipped several runs throughout training, flagged towards the last few weeks, and busted out a PB marathon time going from 5:06 on my first to 4:36 on Sunday! I even got my niece to run the 10k with me! she had planned to do the 1/2 but she over-trained for her first race so she downgraded to the 10k. My ultimate goal for being an early 40's dad-bod-dude is sub 4:00, so i'm jelly of you!! congratulations on a great run!!!\n\nWow that is such a huge jump in time!!\n\nCongrats dude!!! I ran the same race as you!\n\nCongratulations. Portland was also my first full marathon. Did it in 2012.\n\nCongrats! That’s a major achievement to have under your belt. Keep it up! I’m getting my daughter to run her first 5K during this year’s Turkey Trot.\n\nIm trying to make my family a turkey trot family and all my cousins are revolting! Best of luck and have fun with your daughter!!\n\nThank you!\n\nThis is AWESOME!! CONGRATS!\n\n[deleted]\n\nI practiced with every 4 then 3 once for my last long run! I used gu so it was fast to swallow. I found them easier than chews!!\n\nYay! Congrats!!\n\nCongratulations!!! I loved reading this. I ran my first half a couple weeks ago and can’t wait to train more and eventually run a marathon soon :)\n\nCongrats on finishing! Wow! A sub 4 hr for your 1st one! I was 38 when I ran my first marathon.\n\nYou’ve gone from being inspired by race reports to doing the inspiring!! So proud of you~ I turn 30 in January and started getting serious/more consistent about running this year &amp; I have my first race next Saturday :) reading this makes me feel excited and proud and omg hopeful that one day I can clock time like yours 😂\n\nThank you for posting and major congratulations on your hard work, consistency, and accomplishments!!!\n\nOh my gosh! Have so much fun!! You're gonna kill it!!\n\nI raced the HM and came back to cheer on the sub 4 group. I must have seen you finish! Great job.\n\nThat's so great! I love race day camaraderie!!\n\nWay to go!\n\nHello fellow Hal Hidgon-trained Portland Marathon runner! Congrats on the successful marathon and kudos on making it through a serious training plan on your first try. I have a few marathons under my belt, but I keep coming back to the Hal Higdon plans since they have served me so well even though they beat me up before the taper like you described. I did Intermediate 2 for Eugene this year and did the Advanced 1 plan for Portland this year. Eugene was a PR and Portland was 10 minutes slower as a pacer for a friend going for a BQ within the quota cutoff and they both felt great (more beer was accepted on the Portland course since I wasn't pushing myself).  \n\nIf you are looking to PR for your next marathon, I can recommend the Eugene Marathon. It's not nearly as hyped as the atmosphere of the Portland Marathon, but it's also flatter and faster. If you are good at running your own race and not reliant on crowds cheering you along the entire way then it's a good option. The only downside is that it's in April so full marathon training plans will start right around Christmas/New Year.\n\nThank you so much for the tips! Do you think I should do the Advanced 1 in terms of plans?\n\nHonestly, for your second marathon I think staying in Intermediate plans is the best way to go. I didn’t mention times in my previous comment, but the Hal Hidgon Intermediate 2 plan through last winter without missing a single run got me a 3:15 marathon in Eugene. The only reason I switched to Advanced 1 for Portland is because it has more speed work that I missed in Intermediate 2.  \n\nYou’re not going to be held back by the Intermediate plans anytime soon, but if doing the same plan again sounds boring then you can always shake up some of the planned runs every now and then. Just make sure the volume is the same.\n\nThanks again for the advice!!\n\nGreat report! Congrats on the first marathon and the negative split - nicely done! How did you like the course?\n\nWrite a book bro but not a Reddit post 😂\n\nIf reading is too hard for you I suggest /r/pics"

    "all_comment_text": "Developed myasthenia gravis in March and haven’t been able to run much since then. Spent most of the summer in the hospital. Prednisone gave me some stability and I can run a little bit but I’ve spent the last month in and out of the hospital again. \n\nMy goal is to return to running, whatever that looks like for me, when I am more stable. I miss it so much and I know it will come. First thing I did when I was diagnosed was look at medical journals if running with MG is possible. Not many people do but then again, not many people are runners.\n\nMy Dad has had MG for about 3 decades now. He doesn't run, but definitely hits the elliptical for an hour and then weights for another 30min. He does that 6 days a week. If he didn't drink as much as he does... he'd probably be in even better shape. \n\nSo yeah, I think with some time and monitoring with your doctor, you'll be able to run again.\n\nEdit: I guess it's been 30 years that he's had it. Not 20, crazy how time flies.\n\nThank you! That gives me hope!\n\nI have late stage neurological Lyme, was misdiagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis back in 2012. After 5 years of Lyme treatment, which I mostly spent on the couch and in bed with encephalitis many times, I am now back to running.\n\nOur bodies are incredibly resilient. Never give up. Give your body what it needs right now, which might be rest and healing - but know that running will always be there for you when you’re ready to come back.\n\nThank you so much! Encephalitis sounds awful; I had aseptic meningitis as a result of IVIG and that was bad enough. I can’t imagine having encephalitis multiple times - I’m so sorry you had to go through that. \n\nI am glad you are back running as well. :)\n\nI was diagnosed with MG back in 2022 and actually started more seriously running and training after I was diagnosed. It definitely sounds like mine was less severe and impacted my life less than yours has impacted you, but I just wanted to let you know it is possible to be a runner with MG!\n\nThank you so much!\n\nStay injury free\n\nYep! Failed in 2022 &amp; 2023 but this was my only goal for 2024 and it will be for next year too.\n\nThis!!\n\nthis is mine too\n\nSub-40 10k is a bit harder than the rest of your goals, I would say. Mine are:\n\nSub-20, sub-42, 1:35, and maybe 3:20 if I decide to run a marathon.\n\nWould you say if you can run sub-42 and 1.35 half/3.20 full, a sub-20 5k is within reach? I have all the above but I can’t get that sub-20 and it’s driving me mad.\n\nNot the person you asked but Jack Daniels says a 19:57 5k is equivalent to a 3:10 marathon and 1:31 half and a 41:21 10k.\n\nThis checks out then. I’ve got a 3.12 marathon, 1.33 half and 41:45 10k. Makes sense I’m a maddening amount of seconds off (20:20 for 5k currently). 2025 will be the year!\n\nOof you are so close. 2025 will be the year!\n\nIn chronological order, I ran a 42:59 10k in mid September, a 1:33 half in late October (hilly ish course), and a 19:42 5k in late November FWIW. So you probably are really, really close!\n\nDid you train for the 5k between October and November?\n\nI did 19:46 about the same time when I ran a 1:34 half and 41 min 10k\n\nI run 5km in 20.11 and i ran 10km once and got 46 min 😂 but i dont really run anything above 5km regularly\n\nI ran a 1:35 half a month or so before trying to beat my 5k pb and got it down to 19:58. I reckon a few track sessions and you’ve got this!\n\nTotally! My first time breaking 20 was actually a 5k split in my first sub-1:35 half (oops), and then I broke 20 again a week later.\n\nRun a half and then a full marathon, this is my first year running consistently. So far I had a Sub 1 10k and Sub 30 5k as my PRs.\n\nGood luck!! Here are mine:\n\nTime goals:\n- Mile - sub 5 (5:15), high priority \n- 5k - sub 18 (18:14), low priority\n- 10k - sub 37 (38:59), low priority\n- HM - sub 1:25 (1:33), low priority\n- FM - sub 3:00 (-), high priority\n\nOther goals:\n- Keep avg. weekly mileage &gt;60km\n- Join a run club\n- Incorporate speed training 1/week\n- Run 3 races (any distance)\n\nIs your thought process that if you handle the sub 3 marathon training well, all the other dominos will fall except perhaps the mile under 5?\n\nEssentially, yes.   \nI think I'm new enough to long distance (1 year of running, previously only casual soccer) that the endurance gains from marathon training still translate to better results in all other distances. But I noticed that my 5k time hasn't improved as quickly as I'd have liked in the past 4-5 months, which is why I want to incorporate some intervals in 2025.\n\nGotcha, sound logic. Keep grindin' out the miles, and that half marathon time will get obliterated.\n\nErm, the mile one should be easy enough if your 5 mile is that quick.\n\nAre you starting it too fast?\n\nMy tip for you, is, build gradually.\nStart slow, speed up so the last part you are sprinting.\n\nI'm guessing your doing this for your 5 miler at some point to get under that time?\n\nI would argue mile time is highly dependent on age (easier when younger). I am in my 40s and run 2:54 Full, 1:24 Half, 37 10k, 18 5k. I am not particularly close to sub 5. If I had to guess I would say that maybe I could do 5:25ish on a good day.\n\nWell it's a 5km time not a 5 mile time that's up there ;)  \n  \nBut I do think I can drop below 5mins quite easily, since I come from a soccer background and am \"naturally\" much better at sprinting than long distance. So when I gain endurance, I tend to do better at the short distances compared to what calculators predict based on my other times.\n\nSub 26ish on my 5k assuming my end of year run goes all well.\n\nI registered for my first half marathon after becoming a mom! I’ll be celebrating my son’s birthday/surviving a year of motherhood by showing him what his mom can do 💕 no hard time goals, just vibes. \nI’m also toying with the idea of running my second FM next fall, before we talk about growing our family again and I’m out of commission again haha\n\nInspiring! Go mama\n\nMy primary goal is to get into Boston: 40 year old male, so I need to hit about a 3:02 or lower. It definitely won't be easy. I'll be starting Pfitz 18/70 in a couple of weeks. My only previous marathon was this past May and I did a 3:13. \n\nPossible secondary goals are a sub 18 5k, PB of 18:50, sub 38 10k, PB of 39 and change during a half(only ever done a couple when I wasn't as in shape), and a sub 1:25 half, PB of 1:26:34. All of my PBs were from 2024 actually, so I think this old man has more in him.\n\nComplete my very first marathon (!!)\n\nOther:\nPB in 5km, 10km and HM distances\n\nSlow runner edition: hoping to do my second marathon sub-6. Bonus points if I can ever get a sub-30 5k. Did it once only to find out the course was 0.2 miles short haha.\n\nHey, we have the exact same goals!\n\nI finished chemo in September and am about to start radiation. I’ve maintained some fitness, but I’m not what I once was. I’ve already (re)completed the couch to 5k. My 2025 goals are just to finish - \n\nRun a 10k by March (I’m signed up for one)\n\nRun a half marathon in April (my cancer survivor friend and I are going to do it together)\n\nPass my Army fitness test\n\nMy only goal this year: Run my first full marathon. Just got accepted for the Berlin marathon, I'm so excited!!\n\nNo numbers, really. Maybe show up to some small 5k/10k events and get some minor PBs. Beyond that, just running safely and regularly all year.\n\nSub 29 5k\n\nSub 1:10 10k\n\n10k no walk\n\n400 miles total distance at least\n\nAs a slow runner….\n\nStay consistent - I usually drop off in the winter months\n\nBeat my maximum length - furthest I’ve ran is 10km\n\nPB 5k - anything quicker than 36:49 would be amazing\n\nSub 19 5k (currently 19:58 but it's an old PB on a slow course, and I have improved a lot since then)\n\nSub 1:30 HM (probably the one I'm closest to, current PB is from last week and it's 1:31:07)\n\nSub 3:10 marathon maybe? Current is 3:17:12 with some elevation gain\n\nI also want to get a PB in the 10k And 10 mile, which I never raced. I guess realistically 41 for the 10k and 1:05 for the 10 miles? But everything in one year might be a bit ambitious.\n\nIf you can break 19 you should be able able to break 40 in the 10k. 65 min 10 mile is a little tougher unless it's a super fast course like Broad Street.\n\nAt age of 41, my 2025 goals are:\n\n1) Recover from hamstring injury (overuse, not enough rest)\n\n2) Sub 21 5k (last 5k was 21:45)\n\n3) 1:40 Half (current PR is 1:44, last half was 1:49 in September)\n\n4) Sub 6 mile\n\n5) Sub 4:30 marathon (current is 4:57 - first time ever running one 2 years ago)\n\n10k: sub 40 (PR in June 2024: 44:34)\n\nI don't care about other distances at the moment, but I would say 1:35 for the half marathon if I need to add another distance\n\nMy goal is to run a 5K in 2025!\n\nRun three miles without puking\n\nTo get back to running.  I tore my meniscus in July, had surgery in Sept.  Seeing the doctor today and hoping he says it’ll be ok to at least start small.  He probably won’t come right out and say ,  “Got for it!” What I’m looking for is something other than “No. You’ll damage it beyond repair.”  ( but to be honest, who among us wouldn’t respond, “So I can run on until then.”)\n\nFinish 10K for the very first time...\n\nSub 30 minute 5k (I'm close and hoping to hit that in February)\n\nSub 1:00 10K \n\nSub 2:15 Half Marathon (aiming for this in November)\n\nIf you go sub 40, you'll be well under 90 minutes for a half.  Sub 40 is much much harder than all of the other benchmarks you've listed there.\n\nYeah, I know that. But I’m allowing a years worth of progress.\n\nI fully expect to get sub 20 5k within the next few weeks, or maybe a month at best. I’m very close to that goal right now.\n\nI don’t necessarily think that all of my goals will come within weeks of each other, this is everything I’d like to achieve during 2025\n\nI'd love to run a half marathon. Longest run so far is 10 miles which I did a few weeks ago. Ran my first ever 10k in April so I'm already so happy with my progress, it's addictive!\n\nStay injury free\n\nDon't overstrain the body\n\nFocus on volume and not pace (until body is conditioned)\n\nKeep Running fun\n\nFinish UTMB. That's probably the only goal. \n\nFor those who don't know what UTMB is, that is a 100+ mile race around Mont Blanc that goes through France, Italy, and Switzerland: https://montblanc.utmb.world/\n\nSecondary goals: improve my previous time in Canyons 100k race and finish 1-2 50k races.\n\nThe fact that you managed to get an entry to UTMB is already super-impressive! The course looks incredible (not to mention the party atmosphere and elite field at the front.) it’s on my bucket list to fastpack a Tour du Mont Blanc at some point.\n\nI haven't yet, but my odds are pretty good. The lottery is coming soon.\n\nSub 19 5k (current is 19:16)\nSub 40 10k (current is 41:55)\n1:26 half (current is 1:30)\nAnd an overly ambitious goal for my marathon debut of sub 3\n\nWe're pretty close to the same speed, with similar speed goals.  I've been running for a bit more than 2 years so newbie gains are getting slimmer but still exist.\n\n5k: &lt; 20:00\n\nHM (spring): &lt;1:38\n\nFM (fall): &lt; 3:30\n\nTo run (at least) a half marathon every week for my long run. So 52 half marathons in 2025.\n\nRun a 50km ultra.\n\n5k - sub 20 (currently 20:45)\n\nHalf - sub 1:35 (currently 1:40-ish)\n\nMarathon sub 3:15 (last one was 4:40 though my current fitness should allow for sub 3:30)\n\nThe 5k I want the most. The enjoyment I get from running this fast is not comparable to the other distances.\n\nMy primary goal is just to keep running. I'm so bad at consistency and staying motivated to reach long term goals. November 2024 was the first time I actually ran at least 3x a week, every week, and now I've made it up to 5x the last two weeks. I signed up for a half marathon in April to make sure I stay in motion 😊\n\nKeep getting on with it. I'm still new to running and have quit a few times. Have realised it's harder to keep restarting c25k than to just stay committed to running.\n\nIf I can get a 5k under my belt that would also be great.\n\nIt's difficult to not get overwhelmed and distracted by social media runners doing races all the time. I'd like to run an ultra but not until 2026. Baby steps first.\n\n5k: sub 20, ideally 19:40s (current PR 20:43)\n10k:sub 42 (current PR 43:18)\n10 mile: around 72 mins, possibly sub 70...have never done one before!\n\nMy (49m) goals this year were for a sub 22 5k, and a sub 1:50 HM. I did both over the past month (phew).\n\nNext year, looking at sub 21 5k, and a sub 4h marathon. I haven't done a marathon before. I expect I will do a sub 1;45 HM too (1:47 is my current PB).\n\nMy runnng goal is to keep on with running for the whole 2025. I've been running for almost 10 years and I'm in the moment when I'm getting bored. PBs and racing aren't so excitining as they were 5 years ago.\n\nSo I just want to run.\n\nSub 4:30 Marathon. LFG\n\nA, B and C goals: Recover from my SI joint issues!\n\nD: 23:00 5K (never raced, PR 23:50 in 2017) \n\nE: 50:00 10K (PR 52:57 in September)\n\nF: Race a HM (never raced, PR 1:58:27 in 2017)\n\nRan Philly a couple weeks ago at 3:56..I think I could have managed a little faster but kind of got locked into pace with the heavy crowd and was afraid to speed up much and hit the wall on my first marathon.\n\nMy most recent HM and 5k both this past spring were 1:44 and 22:09 respectively\nWould love a (sub) 1:40 and at least 21:30 in 2025 before possibly doing Steamtown in October\n\nrun at least once a week, run a 10K, use the above to recover from my back pain.\n\nGoing for a sub 30 5k. I’m at 40-45 now. Just started running this year!!\n\nAlso trying to lose weight so running isn’t so hard lol\n\n5K - Sub 30 (currently 32:14)\n\nMarathon - Sub 6:00 (currently 6:22:21)\n\n  \nI'm cutting back significantly on organized races for 2025 compared to what I ran in 2024, so I don't really have goals for the 10K or the half this year. Here's hoping I accomplish the two goals I do have, though!\n\nRan my first marathon yesterday @ 4:16, if I could get sub 4 this next year I’d be pumped!\n\nI think my biggest goal is to solidly BQ (\\~2:50) in an October marathon. but over specific distances:\n\n* 5k - sub 16:30 (17:25 from fall 2024)\n* 10k - 37:23 (37:23 from spring 2024)\n   * 10k is the worst race in distance running, I will not be running it lol.\n* 21.1k - sub 1:20 in the spring (1:24 from fall 2024)\n* 42.2k - sub 2:50 (3:06 from spring 2024)\n\n5k is my favourite distance and clearly best. I'm going to try to up the mileage and dial in a good marathon next fall. My 3:06 was a pretty fair race for me, I didn't bonk or anything, I'm just aerobically not there yet.\n\nMy 2025 goals will be my 2024 goals at this point 🥹\n\nSub 30  5k (PB 30:20)\nRun 10k without stopping (PB 8.5k)\n\nHonestly these are my ‘new’ 2024 goals as my original was just to run 5k without stopping sooo I’ll take that \n\nI think my new 2025 goal will be to do an official race, maybe a 10k or slightly longer\n\n* Run 2025 km for the year (about 1258 miles)\n* Half marathon sub 1:50 with a stretch goal sub 1:45 (my first was in November at 1:57)\n* 10k sub 50 minutes (this may be revised downward after next weekend)\n* 5k sub 22.5 minutes (PR'd 23:25 last weekend) -- this one might be the hardest\n* Don't get hurt -- failed this goal for 2024 but it was a broken bone due to a fall, I'm relatively injury free most of the time\n\n**Edit:** wanted to add that another goal (non-running but related) is to get my squat and deadlift above 200lbs for more than 5 reps\n\nMy primary goals are sub 1:20 HM (1:23)  and sub 1:00 10 mile (1:02) … and to steadily increase weekly mileage to and try to incorporate some strength training\n\nRun in a parkrun\n\nMy first goal is a 5K in January. Then maybe a 10K. I use Garmin Coach as a personal trainer. 🔥\n\nQualify for London marathon with a good for age time.\n\nRun 1000km staying injury free\n\nGet a run club going in my small town. \n\nIntegrate more cross training\n\nNew to running ( 8 months ish) honestly I just want to keep running and improve my time. My favourite distance is 10k with a pb of 55mn. I’d like to run sub 50mn. Who knows one day\n\nSub-30 5k. (Current PR is 31:29)  \nNew Half Marathon PR. (Current PR is 2:24:59)\n\nI'm getting faster...slowly. :)\n\nSame pr’s here. Got a little slower after not being as consistent in the summer heat, but hopefully will also get a little faster next year too.\n\n5k - sub 21 (current PB is 21:53)\n\nHM - Complete first ever at sub 2 (my race is in April) \n\nNever ran consistently so if I’m running throughout 2025 I’ll be very happy\n\ncompleting my first ever marathon! aiming for anything right below 4:00 (half PB right now is 2:01:38), but just finishing is a goal of mine :-)\n\nu/Londoner1982 Seems very ambitious. 5k seems possible, 10k, HM and M are absolutely huge improvements though. I'd rather set less ambitious goals and have some hope to actually meet them.\n\nI've done this for more than a decade and my experience is that something usually gets in the way (flu, some injury, kids, ...) so perfect preparation isn't an option. I'd rather aim for 1:40 HM, sub-4 M and see where that gets me.\n\nI mainly do HM and I'm aiming at 1:40 to 1:45 (currently 1:48).\n\nwould love to run a marathon and keep consistency. Never ran in an organised race before so keeping self-motivated is key!\n\n1:50 for a Half Marathon. My previous time was 2:30, so for me the goal is huge as I started running in septembre with a Vo2max of 36...\n\nSub 80 minute HM. I’ll have to PB at every distance except the 15k to get there. \n\nAfter that, 2:45 Berlin qualifier in 2026\n\n2025 Running Goals\n\n1. Don't get injured. \n\n2. Run 1500mi\n\n3. 1:40 half marathon, haven't raced one in in years, but I'd say I'm in 1:50 shape right now. \n\n4. Sub 50:00 10k. \n\n5. Sub 20:00 5k. \n\nI've told myself, if I can break the 1:40 this year in the half marathon, I'll shoot for a late fall marathon, but knowing me, I'm gonna try and do one either way.\n\nNothing time goal-wise, but train for the Rome Marathon, stay healthy, and enjoy the scenery. \n\nI turn 50 in March, so I plan on a 50k in the spring and a 50-miler in the fall.\n\nSub 23 min 5k (current best 25:07)\n\nSub 55 min 10k (current best 1:00:43)\n\nSub 2 hour half marathon (current best 2:10:17)\n\nSub 4 hour marathon (current best 4:22:16)\n\nAll PRs set last in 2024! First full year of running. Excited for 2025.\n\nRun 3,000 mi \n\nMarathon time close to this year’s - 3:32:51\n\n5k - complete 7 races this year.\n\n10k - complete 1 race this year.\n\nTraining: Consistency that drives higher VO2 max, endurance and speed. No major injuries.\n\nMy goal in 2025\n\n3 half marathons in 2025 at sub 9 min mile I’ve signed up for them already (Durham &amp; Raleigh).\n\nOne 10K a month if schedule permits, to keep fit.\n\n3 5K events that I’ve done in the past for fun, 1 sponsored by a craft brewery, added bonus.\n\nI don’t have aspirations for a full marathon, yet.  But am reading this Reddit for inspiration.\n\nI only started running a year and a half ago after never running before in my whole life! Including as a kid, long story. \n\nMile- 920 (current is 928, but I was in a mood, it's been unrepeatable)\n\n5k- sub 30. Currently 33:24. This is the one I'm unsure on!\n\n10k- 1 hr 5. Currently 1:12:50. Just did an 8k at :56 at my realistic max though. \n\nHalf- 2:50:00. Current is 2:56:48. \n\nFull- 9 hr. Currently at 10:52:58 though I stopped for dinner during the course, hahaha.\n\nRun a half marathon! Only started running consistently this year :)\n\nSame here. Good luck.\n\nAfter a year of persisting stress due to work and family reasons, my primary goal is being able to maintain a running routine again. Secondary, a 5K sub 25 and increasing my endurance to be able to run marathon distance.\n\nNot really a goal, more like a goal race for next year, but I'm currently eyeing the Grossglockner Ultra. Really wanna sign up, but it's so expensive 😭\n\n200+ miles a month.\n\nAfter an intensive 2023 whereby I steadily built things up and peaked at 500km a month, I've spent most of the past year recovering from the impact it had on my body. All kinds of tendon issues in my ankle and foot, the result of doing zero strength and conditioning work to balance out the amount of running I was doing.\n\nNearly recovered now I think after a few false dawns, so my goal is simply to get back running, as I've missed it badly.\n\nGood luck, you’ve got this!! Mine are:\n\n5K - sub 19 (current PR 19:02)\n\n10K - sub 40 (split a 40:34 during a 7 miler this year)\n\nHalf - beat my 1:29:36 from my first ever half (I’ve only ever raced this distance once)!\n\nMaybe run a full marathon in the fall? One day I wanna BQ, but I’m not sure if that’ll be this year or down the road!!\n\nI’m also racing indoor track meets this winter, it would be amazing to get back to my HS PR’s in the mid distance events (2:19 800m, 5:18 mile)! \n\nOverall, just stay healthy, train consistently, and keep growing my strong passion &amp; love for the sport :)\n\nBiggest goal is to adjust to collegiate XC training from high school, but here are my time/placement goals:\n\n* 1600 - sub 5:10 (5:14 current)\n* 3200 - sub 10:40 (10:56) &amp; win state\n* 5k - sub 17:00 (17:19) &amp; go to NBNI/NBNO\n* 10k - sub 37:00 (NT)\n* HM - sub 1:23 (have ran 1:27s for casual long runs at ~75% effort)\n\nGo sub 2h in the HM and run my first marathon! Secondary goal is also to get a sub 7 mile\n\nRun under a 10 min mile!\n\nSweat my ass off on the treadmill at 5.0 jog so I don’t hurt myself &amp; need a 3rd knee surgery\n\n1000 miles for the year, do a 20 mile run\n\nrun 3k under 12 minutes, any 3k folks in here?\n\nRun a \\~2h HM, then train and run my first FM.\n\n1) Stay injury free\n2) See #1\n\nHas been a challenge to stay injury-free since my early 40's.\n\nI really don't know... I started 2024 with the gola of running more consistently to gain fitness and lose weight, and running 500km during the year.\n\n\nI am likely going to end up with 1200, having run more than the HM distance multiple times, and 14kg leaner. So I don't know what to aim for realistically. I've signed on two HMs so at least:\n\n\n- Finish my first HM, and achieve a sub2 at least in one of them.\n- Run 1500Km\n- Avoid injuries \n\n\nAnd probably the most important, be better in getting up early to run my miles!\n\nHalf marathon (currently can do 10 miles). \n\nI’m so fucking fat. My only goal is to lose fat\n\nAny idea how I can bring down my 30 min 5k time to 25 PLEASE\n\nRun more.\n\nMarathon : sub 4 (currently 4:16:42)\n\nHalf marathon : sub 1:45 (currently 1:47:31)\n\n10k: sub 45 (currently 47:35)\n\nI guess\n\nConsistency year round, both with running and strength training.\n\n\nContinue working towards 1:30 HM, currently at 1:39. Lots of progress on this in 2024, coming through winter strong should help a lot. (See #1.)\n\n\n3:30 full? Or just see what kind of honest effort baseline I can set. Did a full last spring for the first time in a loooong time and the wheels fell off. Try, try again. (Also, see #1.)\n\nAt least one PR at whatever distance.\n\nI went hard in 2024.. so next year I need to focus on recovery and strength training\n\nGood goals, but the 10k is more difficult than the others, in my opinion. \n\nI've done many sub-20 5k's, sub 1:30 half, etc, but my 10k is still around 42 mins. \n\nHaven't trained for a marathon yet.\n\nI have very similar times to you for those distance of races, although I've not run a marathon yet. \n\nMy goals are as follows:\n\n30km a week\n\n125km a month\n\n2000km for the year\n\nA HM distance run every month\n\nFour marathon distance runs over the year \n\nSub 1:35 half marathon \n\nComplete a marathon race(not sure where and when)\n\n😭 dealing with an injury, so now it’s just recovery and get back to running! I’m a newer masters runner and had been hoping to work on improving my times to bet at least average for my age… alas. Maybe I will be able to work on speed in the second half of the year 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nCurrent PR on 5k is 21:09. I'm with you on sub 20, I think i can get that in the next few months. \n\nMy one major goal is injury free throughout my upcoming marathon block. \n\n  \nSub 3:30 is the goal for a marathon\n\n5k back to an 8:39 pace and to start doing half's again.\n\nI have a few A goals and some nice to have:\nA goals:\n- BQ at Boston \n- run the Boston/London double \n- sub-20 5k. This is the albatross around my neck, all my other PRs indicate that this should be well within reach tomorrow but I just can’t break it. \n\nNice to haves:\n- PR at Boston (current PR 3.12, but those damn hills make me nervous)\n- sub-90 half\n\nWife and kid had enough of me training for FM so keeping goals low for 2025.\n\nWill do 3 HM and couple of 5k and 10k\n\nso far, I have signed up one HM in April and one 5k in June. Waiting for some local races to open registrations.\n\nWant to improve my speed as I am slow runner. I run about 11.30 mil/min, trying to increase speed to 10 mile/min\n\n5k - sub 19 18:30 stretch goal, currently 20:00\n\nHalf Marathon - 1:40 , currently 1:48 \n\nMarathon - Finish one in any time, preferably under 4\n\nI’d love to run under 4:15 for 1500 (4:27 right now) and 2:03 for 800 (2:07 right now) :D\n\nSub 20 5k \nsub 1:30 Half \nRun my first full marathon\n\n- Run at least 1x a week all winter (previous years I just stopped running until Spring)\n- sub 2 hr HM (was so close at 2:04 for my first one, I need that redemption)\n- 50 min 10K (52:52 currently)\n\nThis year I signed up for a marathon, picked up the pace/volume, and deepened my relationship with running. Next year I want to run well, stay healthy, and continue to mix things up. Also, think of a way to bring running into my creative life and vice versa.\n\nI’m looking to have another fairly consistent year, rack up maybe 1200ish miles and have fun running a bunch of races. Some injuries and illness slowed me down at the start of this year but for the most part I’m pretty happy with my effort, and just need to keep it rolling into 2025.\n\nThis year I'm struggling with my speed, wanted to reach sub45 10k, officially didn't achieve it but the course was 9.95 km long and my time was 44:50, so who knows. I feel like from 4:30/km speed every second is a struggle, how will you achieve sub40 if your PB atm is around 45? Or is it an old PB and you could do much better right now? To be honest I feel like I can achieve sub44 in 2025 but I'm a little bit pessimistic.\n\nI want to take a crack at a sub 1:20 half. My current best is 1:22, and I felt like I was running out of my skin. It's all about the challenge though. A low or below 17:00 5k would be nice too. I can usually achieve under 18. As for Marathon - I'm out.. Slid under 3, went to Boston and also ran under 3 there.. I'll return to that in a few years. Anyway, good luck with your goals, and I hope we may all be at least semi successful!\n\nMaybe sub 26 min on my 5k time, Sub 55 on my 10k time - maybe.\n\nMy main one is to train and run my first full marathon and do it in whatever time and enjoy it.\n\nI picked running back up in 2024 after taking several years off and chose some goals somewhat arbitrarily not knowing how realistic they were. I missed most of them but was not too far off, so will just try to obtain those goals in 2025. They are as follows: \n\n -750 miles ( I'll finish 2024 at about 600)\n\n-75,000' elevation gain (my goal of 50,000' for 2024 was one of the goals I achieved in 2014 so I'm bumping it a bit for next year) \n\n- beat my 21:48 5k pr\n\n- beat my 45:41 10k pr \n\n- beat my longest run of 12.5 miles\n\n- beat my pr for all my local Strava segments ( I live in a rural area and there are only about 10 I would consider local.)\n\n- get below 180 lbs, currently at 185, was at 190 at the beginning of last year.\n\nPR at CIM 3:21✌🏽\n\n2025 Goals \n\n5k - sub 19 minutes (19:36 current) - Low Priority \nHalf Marathon - sub 1:30 (1:32 current) - High Priority \nMarathon - sub 3:15 (3:21 current) - High Priority \n2k Mileage (up from 1800) - High Priority\n\nReally i want a sub 3 marathon. I have the speed for it i just need to continue to stack the mileage and finally have a build where i don't get ill in the middle of it. So likely i'll see if i can do a half in around 1:24 then shoot for the full in the fall.\n\nMy goal is to continue executing my plan to set myself up for a BQ when after I turn 60 next year. That requires more strength training and mileage to improve on the 3:55 I ran a month ago and the 3:51 two years ago. If I stay healthy, I will get it.\n\n40, chasing times I set when much younger. But my biggest goal is maintain the discipline that’s for me running more consistently than I was even back then. \n\nRun 1,000 miles this year (don’t fall off because of snowy months as I have in the past, it’s a run 80-90 miles in January/February challenge) \n\n3:50 marathon (best is 4:20 NYC) \n21 min 5K. (Would be a PR for 40s) \nRun a marathon in home city, sleep in my own bed the night before (NY with the schlep to the start didn’t count)\nRun a race longer than a marathon. Maybe start at 30 mi. after spring marathon. \n\nContinue 1x week speed sessions for full year\n\nTake care of self and keep this long period of injury free running going!\n\nMy goals are the same as yours. Good luck!\n\nMarathon Sub 3:30 for me but for now, completing my first 70.3 Ironman in July 2025\n\nGoals: \n\n5k - Sub 26 (currently 31.09)\n10k - Sub 55 (currently 1.13.16)\nHM - Sub 2hr15 (currently 2.34.54)\n\nImprove long distance endurance. I’d like to make small improvements to my 5k and 10k, but mostly I’ll focus on long distances. \n* 5k - 23.xx (currently 24:04) low prio. \n* 10k - under 50 (currently 50:45) low prio.\n* Half marathon - under 1:50 (currently 1:56) medium prio. \n* Marathon - pipe dream is to go under 4hrs (currently 4:28), but I need to get out of my own head first. High prio. \n* Run an ultra (50k or 50 miles, I will see what I’m ready for when the time comes). Just finish, no time goal. High prio.\n\n5k: sub 18 (18:07 PB), 10k: sub 37 (37:53 PB), half - get faster (1:23 PB), full: sub 3 for confidence (3:14 PB on the back of multiple blowups), then push for BQ (2:55)\n\nhave been base building for an april marathon, was gonna do pfitz 12/70, now i think i need a longer structured cycle so will either start on week 3 of pfitz 18/70 or do a different 16 week program\n\nI’m gonna try to run up to three marathons this year, depending on how they go. First in February (which will be my first marathon): goal is to finish (I run just sub 2 hr half marathons, so idk maybe will shoot for 4:20 or something); second in June; shooting for sub 4 hr; third in October where I’d love to go sub 3:30. Probably too ambitious but even if I only hit some of the above it’ll be a successful year for me!\n\n50 miler completion\n\n5k - sub 24\n\nMarathon - 4:00 (current PR is 4:45, I trained hard this year such that I SHOULD have hit 4:00 but race day didn’t go as planned…)\n\n50 mile - finish strong 😂 it’ll be my first so I just want to have fun and finish!\n\nSub 20 5K, current PR is 20:09.\n\n90 minute or better Half Marathon. First and ONLY one so far was 1:37:17.\n\nComplete a Marathon. Longest run so far has only been a 20 miler.\n\nI would like to run a sub 6 minute mile again. Last time I achieved this was 2020 while training for a 5K that would eventually be cancelled due to the rona.\n\nAs a beginner casual runner\n\nHalf-Marathon - Finish\n\nMarathon - Finish\n\nSo I just hit a PR on a 5k this past weekend... But I really want to go sub 20 next year.\nBut down deep... I really really want to run longer on trails. But I'm scared out of my mind so I cannot even fathom doing it. 15 miles on trails seems like such an incredible experience...but I'm literally scared to even think about that distance!!!\n\nMarathon - 3hr20 or less\n\nHalf marathon - 1:25 or less\n\n10k - 38min or less\n\nWould love to go sub 3:45 on the marathon, 3:51 is my current PB. But my biggest goal is to increase mileage, as well as strength training, if I keep both consistent I should be able to see progress. These have been my weaknesses this last year\n\nRunning my first marathon. Maybe a second, if the first goes well enough.\n\nI'd also like to hit 1500 miles. I should get to about 1200 this year.\n\nAnd since I'm in my 50s, the obligatory ... stay healthy.\n\n29M, got back into running this past January 50lb overweight. Ran a 2:49 marathon last month. Wanting to hit sub 2:30 at Chicago next year and run a 5k PR (15:43 from 10 years ago).\n\nSub 20 5k, I'm at 30 right now and am mostly strength training right now to lead into my running training for an april/may 5k\n\nSame goal as last year.  Sub 25 minute 5k. Hit 26:16 as my PB. Fell off in training the back half of the year.\n\nI'm going to try again for all this years failed goals:\n\n5k - sub 21:30\n10k - 45min\nHalf - 1hr 45\n\nThis years been shocking with illness, I've racked up alot of miles but there's been so much going about I still got ill (wife teaches so constantly has something). \n\nBest time this year was an 80min 10 miler in training when I was doing a fitness test to see where I was. Peaked in February 😂\n\nHeat goals to have! Wish you luck!\nMine are:\n\n1mile - sub 6 min (6:30 currently)\n5k - sub 21 min (24 min currently) \n10K - sub 45 min (49 currently)\nHM - sub 2 hr (2:10 currently)\nFM - finish first ever anytime\n\nRun an ultra marathon. Thats the only goal. Currently at 30 km.\n\nSpeaking of this year, my goal was to do the San Silva which is on December 31st at a pace of less than 3:30\nAnd although that day has not yet arrived, last Saturday I went to a race near my house and I already achieved a pace of 3:28, so I am very satisfied and now it has gotten into my head that I have to go below 3: 20 on the 31st so I'm doing sets every other day and putting in quality training, resting only on easy days.\n\nHM PB (&lt;1.19.02) - should be doable even without carbon plate shoes, got one lined up in early March. If not I can almost certainly catch one November onwards. \n\n\n5k PB (&lt;16.34) - 50/50 if this is doable even with carbon plated shoes. Got a few options over summer with fast courses.\n\n\n1500m PB (&lt;4.19) - probably about a 5-10% chance of managing this. Honestly this PB has haunted me. I did it aged 21 in 2013 and I spent the next year trying to break it again. Failed every time and I've never managed quicker than 4.23 otherwise.\n\nMarathon - sub 3:20. \n\nAnd in the training block leading up to that I'm hoping to get new PB's for my HM, 10K, 10 mikes, 5K,...\n\nMarathon sub 4:00. Just ran my personal best 4:14.\n\nNo other goals but I suppose a sub 1:55 half marathon would be in order, would be a PB\n\nLet’s gooooo\n\nBQ.\n\nSub 5 minute mile\nSub 18:00 5k \nSub 36:00 10k\nSub 80:00 half marathon \nSub 2:59:59 marathon\n\nMine is 365 miles in 2025 and run a 10k race. I was going to run the turkey trot in my city but I sprained my ankle one week before. Also keep running consistently as it’s been the only thing that helps keep away anxiety attack. \nJust started running consistently back in April.\n\nMy goals for 2025 is to try to become faster without running a lot more then I do now. This year I've avaraged 55 km (93 km peak), ran my first marathon and PRed in 10K and half even though the half was hilly (220m ascent) and in the middle of marathon build phase. I don't ever run 5Ks so I don't know my PR there :)\n\n10K; 37:11 - goal to get to low 36.\nHalf: 1:23:41 - goal to see 1:20:xx (on a flat course)\nMarathon: 3:05:10 - goal to see 2:50-55  IF I decide to do one, which I don\"t really know right now.\n\nI also have a goal to include two weekly strength sessions and work on some strength goals, and to maintain my cycling FTP with a weekly interval focused session on the bike. And also aiming to keep including the family time as much as possible with training, or training when it doesn't affect them (early mornings/late evenings)\n\nStay injury free!   Had surgery to repair a tendon in my ankle last Dec.   that put me out 6 months.   Finally was starting to get back into running again and then broke my foot in September.    So this year has been rough.   And last November I finally ran my first marathon.  Hoping to really get back into it now.   My first half is scheduled for March and I have a feeling it will be a rough one.\n\nI'm signed up for a 10k this spring, followed by my first 10-Mile race in early autumn.  This all leads up to my 2026 goal of running my first half marathon.\n\nI want to break 35:00 in the 5k (current pr 38:13 from last year) and see how close to 10:00 I can get my mile (11:26 pr here from 2.5 years ago). I’m not speedy :)\n\n5km - close to 20min as possible (currently 22:53, hoping to go sub 22 by the end of the year)\n\n10km - sub 45 (currently 46:46)\n\nHalf marathon - sub 1:35 (currently 1:37:40)\n\nSaw some pretty huge gains this year by properly locking into my training, implementing speed work, so I’m hoping to keep that up but understand the gains will diminish. On track to hit 1500km for this year so I’d also like to see that increase.\n\nThe motto of my april marathon is Breaking 3:30 (now 3:59.09).\n\ni juuust got into my first 100 mile race so this is my only goal! :)  \nohh actually, also run a 50 miles with my dad!\n\nTime Goals:\n5km - Get close to around 16:XX or better\n3000m - Sub 10:00 \n1500m - 4:30 or Better\n\nTraining Goals:\nAverage 60 - 75km\nRun at a minimum of 5 meets each for Indoor Track, Outdoor Track, and 3 minimum for XC (All before Nationals)\nRun a meet in the US or a different Province at least once\n\nJust for fun...\n\n|Distance|Current PR|Goal (Attempt/Race Date)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|5K|19:12 (July '24)|18:30 (TBD)|\n|10K|42:18 (Sept '24, sick)|40:00 (Sept '25 or sooner)|\n|Half Marathon|1:38:30 (May '24, hilly)|1:32:00 (Jan '25)|\n|Marathon|N/A|Sub 3:30 (Oct. '25)|\n\nI'd also love to run a sub 5' mile. Have come close on treads recently, but haven't gone for an outdoor attempt which I'm sure would be tougher. \n\nHalf marathon ultimate goal is 1:30 but I'm not sure I'll do another half road race next year after the January race. \n\nFor marathon - everything I've seen indicates I should be able to hit that without too much trouble if I train up to that distance properly. But it seems crazy to set a more ambitious goal for my first attempt. Course is pretty flat fortunately.\n\nMy goal is to not hate myself anymore. I‘ve been trying for the last 5 years\n\nI love races of all distances, so my plan is just to do as many of them as I have time for and can afford. I have two full marathons scheduled for next year, one in April and one in November, and it would make me so happy if I could beat my current PR of 5h 25m on at least one of them.\n\nI'd also like to get involved in some kind of running group. As a slower runner and shy person I've kind of been intimidated by the idea, but my city has an active running community and I feel like I could learn a lot and have a lot of fun if I got involved.\n\nGot a few, who knows what's gonna happen! \n\n- PR in Boston (sub 2:50); ideally would like to get close to 2:45, but I've done way more trail running than road work \n\nSpeaking of..\n\n- finish a 100 miler in June\n\n- get redemption from a 100 miler I DNFd last year\n\n- end the year with either a sub 1:20 half marathon or a sub 6 hour 50k\n\nI  had a herniated disk in 2021, and another in 2023. Since there was this Covid thing going on in 2020 (remember that?), the last races of that distance I ran were in fall 2019 (both a trail marathon and a trail 50K). My back has recovered nicely, and I finished well in my division in all of my races this year.  My goal for 2025  is to run a trail marathon or 50K in the first half of the year. Depending on how that goes, I'll come up with additional goals.\n\nSimilar.\n\nMile - sub 5:45 (currently 6:10)\n\n5K - sub 20 (currently 21:16, races in May and July)\n\n10K - sub 42 (haven’t run a 10K race in forever)\n\nHalf Marathon - sub 1:35 (currently 1:39:51, race in November)\n\nMarathon - sub 3:20 (currently 3:31:20, races in March and October)\n\nAverage 30 miles/week, hit first milestone for Volt on Nike Run Club (on track to hit this year’s goal of Black level in about a week and a half)\n\nGet VO2 max to 50+ (currently 47.7, got it up to 49.6 earlier in the year)\n\nStay healthy and injury free.\n\n- sub 16 5k\n- sub 75 HM\n- staying healthy\n\nSub 2 hour half and stay injury free!\n\nHere’s mine: \n\n5k - sub 15 (currently 16:01)\n\n10k - sub 36 (currently 37:05)\n\nHalf marathon - sub 1:15 (currently 1:17:45)\n\nMarathon - sub 2:45 (currently 2:50:10)\n\nRun three times a week except for illness and injury\n\nIf we lived near each other you’d be my #1 competitor. This looks like my chart lol.\n\nComplete my first marathon before my 40th birthday.\n\n5k\n\nA) 18:59\n\nB) 19:29\n\nC) PB (19:38)\n\nMarathon\n\nA) 3:15\n\nB) PB (3:48)\n\n12.1k\n\nA) 49:59\n\nMiler\n\nA) Finish\n\nB) Start one\n\nC) Sign-up for one for 2026\n\nBackyard Ultra\n\nA) Get timed out on a lap\n\nB) 24 hours\n\nC) PB (18 hours)\n\nJust started running in the last few months, currently can run at 14 minute mile, and even that is hard sometimes. But it’s getting better all the time. I’d like to get to a 10/11 minute pace by years end. I have a half marathon next November, and I run 3x a week:)"

    "body": "I've been a casual/fitness runner since my teens, but only started serious training late in life, after smartwatches/phones were common. When I was more casually running when I was younger, I'd usually run by time with a stopwatch, estimating how many miles by about how long I knew it took me to run a mile on the track. Or use my odometer on my car to measure a run.\n\nBut I assume people who were seriously training for races needed something more accurate. So for people in my age group or older who were out there running competitive times in races (cross-country, marathons, and so forth), how did you measure your training runs and workouts?",

    "all_comment_text": "I remember my Dad had a big pad of paper on which he recorded all of his runs by hand. He'd also drive around his routes to use the odometer to get a sense of distances. He did have a Timex Ironman watch to use as a stopwatch but I am not sure if ever did things like intervals based on distances versus feel or time. He did do track workouts from time to time. He qualified for (but did not run) Boston that way after only starting to run around the time he turned 40.\n\nI remember when I was a kid / teen 2010-2014 my parents would drive the running route I was doing so that I knew how long it was, I usually just used my iPod nano as my timer and wrote everything down in my high school planner. I wasn’t training for much outside of mediocre high school cross country results, but it’s funny to compare that to the stats I care about on my Garmin now\n\nWow. Thanks for sharing. \n\nAs someone who just started running a couple years ago at the age of 35, it's really cool to hear stories like this.\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed the story. He started up initially because he joined a rugby team and realized he couldn't keep up. He started just running around our block, adding laps as he was able to. \n\nEventually he was pretty hardcore—there was pretty much no weather he wouldn't run in. We have a picture of him running with icicles hanging off of his eyebrows—it was something like -30 (Celsius, but at that point it's roughly the same in Fahrenheit!). \n\nA while back I went through old editions of our local newspaper online. I didn't realize back then how good some of his times were. He had a very respectable mile time as I recall, too. I'm still chasing times that he hit when he was ten years older than me!\n\nJust read Bill Rodgers book Marathon Man\n\nOh man, you can do it all starting \"late\" at 35!  I started running at age 38, ran my first race at 39, and my first marathon at 39.  I'm now 48 and have run eight road marathons including Boston, one trail marathon, two Olympic triathlons, and this last weekend completed my first ultra.\n\nThat’s super-inspirational-I think it was so much harder for older runners to get started in your dad’s era.\n\nI'm glad you think so. He started running after he joined a rugby team and wasn't able to keep up. His initial runs were just a lap around the block we lived on, and he added on as he was able to. After that he was pretty committed.\n\nIt’s amazing the effects small changes can have over time!\n\nNot running but my dad did the same thing for biking. There was a notebook hanging under a clock in the garage\n\nMy dad did the same with recording by hand, odometer to get the route distances, and stop watch! My dad had running journals, and he would note his distance, route, weather, and other notable things that day. It's how I learned what time of day I was born.\n\nMy dad ran Boston a few times, he qualified a few more but only went when others in his running crew also qualified. He started running in his teens, and didn't miss a single day for 20 years. He started missing days when he started having knee problems and had to have surgery. He's almost 70 now, and still runs often! He uses a Garmin now lol\n\nYou just triggered a memory of being in the car with my dad and him driving somewhere a strange route. He explained he was working out how far he had run the previous weekend.\n\nMy dad still does this. I also remember going in the car with my parents to map the distance of my runs with the car odometer. There was also a fair amount of guesswork based on having a consistent pace.\n\nThe Timex Ironman was a must back then. I was fortunate enough to trade up to the first ever Garmin watch, an absolute beast of a thing. It was such a massive leap forward, like CRT to flat screen TVs. The build quality wasn't quite as good back then - my watch got rotted by humidity and then deconstructed on a 10km. Sad. I still remember how the rubber push buttons felt and the distinctive beep when it turned on. Most pivotal product I've ever owned. \n\nDo we have the same dad? This is exactly what my dad did as well. Still has his notebooks from the 90s\n\nWe used the car odometer. We’d match each mile marker to a landmark like a light pole or a tree.\n\nThis is how I did it in high school. Before I could drive, I'd ask my parents to drive me around from our house so I could note mile markers (red house is 1 mile, green mailbox is 2, etc). Then I'd look at the clock inside before I left and when I got back. It obviously wasn't super accurate, but I knew I ran x miles in approximately y minutes. One Christmas I got a stopwatch and would carry that with to be able to know my mile splits. \n\nI realize this makes me sound ancient, but I'm only 36!\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was already lugging a discman with me. An alarm clock would've been too much!\n\nI'm struggling to imagine how much anti-skip protection was needed to make this work.\n\nI tried to run really smooth, but it definitely wasn't great. My first mp3 player was an absolute game changer!\n\nI honestly think that's why I never developed a habit of listening to music while running outdoors. I remember my brick of a yellow Sony Walkman crapping out on me yet again, throwing it in the trash while running, and never replacing it.\n\nI'm 34 and I did the same thing!\n\nI used to leave the house at bang on 2000hrs and run to check the clock in the dining room when I got back. Stop watch came a bit later. Route measured on an OS map and checked in a car.\n\nI used my bike odometer and luckily still have my “half mile” tree on my route 20 years later!\n\nMy cross country coach would use his odometer and then go and actually plot.it out with one of those wheels that measures distance. Then he would spray paint the road at every mile marker.\n\nYep.  When I was a kid, I had my mom drive me around this big road that circled the park and football/baseball fields near our house. The one mile mark was a specific curve in the road, the 2 mile mark was the last lightpost before the tennis courts.\n\nAgreed, this was the way.  In that brief period of time that I personally ran before mapping websites and my garmin training GPS I also did the car odometer and Timex method.\n\nWhen I was in high school it was probably on the cusp of watches and phones being common place to track distance. But there was a site called mapmyrun that would use something like google maps and you would have to click each portion of your run on the map to calculate the distance.\n\nStill using map my run today to plan things!\n\nIf you have a Garmin, their Course planner is pretty nice too.\n\nOh that's good to know because I still use Mapmyrun to plan my distances out, but I do use a Garmin.\n\nOmg I still use map my run because it has all my data going back decades! It’s owned by under armor now and a sister site to the calorie counting site, MyFitnessPal. I have my garmin tied to the account so I have it all in one place.\n\nI did this in high school with the google maps distance calculator lol\n\nOnthegomaps for a free alternative that doesn’t require you to sign in 👍\n\nYup. That's how I did it in college. In high school, we had coaches who had mapped out routes in each cardinal direction. They'd give us three different routes over the distance and tell us to choose which distance we were doing. You'd learn the routes by running with your teammates.\n\nOMG I remember this 😂 completely forgot I did this haha\n\nI don't have a watch; I just use mapmyrun.\n\nI used Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips for the same purpose at some point in my life. This was mostly for exploring in new places, because I just knew the distance of my main routes.\n\nWe had a wheel. On a stick.  With a clicker that marked off how many times the wheel went around.  24 inches in diameter.  And we used it to mark off how many quarter and half miles.   \n\n5280 feet in a mile.  So 2640 clicks was a mile, etc…\n\nLiterally walked down a street or a path marking off the distance. Streets still had their previous years markings.  But sometimes not. \n\nThat was high school.  And in the army? We did it, too when no track was available.  As I got older?  Really just guesstimated.  I ran a 7 minute mile in my 20’s.  That was my jogging speed running around a track.  So I figured 28 minutes of running was around 4 miles.  \n\nEvery few years I’d find myself at a track and check my speed. Stayed about the same until my late 40’s. And then the iPhone came out. \n\n\nSeriously. Did that until running apps came out.\n\nI’ve done this at my gym, there’s an outdoor loop and I don’t have a smartwatch and at the time I just had a basic phone so I borrowed the trundle wheel from work to figure out how far it was.\n\nI used to help my cross country coach setting up and verifying courses with one of these. And tape measure to double check the wheel was correct.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is so interesting-and kind of what I did, although I wasn’t as meticulous with maps! It’s a reminder of how GPS has changed how we train as well as just the social media aspect.\n\nThis was how I did it. I would look at maps and use the scale to measure distance. I knew it wasn't exact but it was close enough for my needs.\n\nRight! I was never a serious runner but when training according to a plan and aiming for specific mileage, I would cpmbine specific \"laps\" on my neighborhood instead of the spontanepus, scenic rubs I get to do today thanks to my smartphone\n\nMy dad, who’s now 64, was a 2:19:xx marathon runner in the 1980’s. He would measure routes as others have described above with his car odometer or a measuring wheel, and record his workouts in a notebook. He tells me that he ran based on his perceived effort and only ran high intensity 2-3 out of 9 runs per week. He still wears a $10 Casio watch, records his miles in a notebook, runs by “feel,” and is way faster than me!! (I’m in my mid twenties and began running in the past year)\n\nNine runs per week?! How did he split that up?\n\nGuessing 3 double days, 3 single days and a rest day.\n\nExactly this. Not sustainable forever by any means, but worked well to get him some quick marathon times.\n\nI train with a group that does 10 runs per week. Three of them hard.\n\nMonday-Thursday we do an easy 30 minutes in the AM, with intervals Monday &amp; Wednesday PM, &amp; a steady 50 minutes Tuesday &amp; Thursday.\n\nFriday is rest day. Saturday another interval session. Sunday long run.\n\nIt can total 70-80 miles.\n\nThat's absolutely crazy! I'm surprised he hasn't caved by now to a smartwatch!\n\nI think it’s almost an act of rebellion on his part, lol. But he seems to like the stats I record with mine when we run together!\n\nIf I was in my 60s, there's no way I'd introduce a tech that at best would make me radically overthink the hobby I've been successful at and use to relax, but at worst could add a bunch of frustration and consternation. If I'd had that much success with more primitive techniques, I'd just stick with them.\n\nI'm in my 70s and started running in the 80s. Did the whole car and note book like everyone has described. I was never fast but I'm still running half marathons and have a marathon this fall. I'm also on my 5th Garmin. I love them and love having all the stats that I had no idea about \"back in the day\".  Love the tech and love some of the apps. This 'ol girl has learned some new stuff over the years and I still love running.\n\nMy dad is in his 80s and loves his Apple Watch for tracking his walks and Vo2 max!\n\nSame here. Pushing 60 and use it to make sure my easy days are really easy. Has been great for eliminating regular calf issues.\n\nThat's fair and understandable. As a young guy in my 20s, I tend to already be change averse in my hobbies and not adopt new tech unless I feel like it's solving a problem I have, not a problem I haven't recognized. When I get older, I'm pretty sure that's going to get worse.\n\nI think running watches have enhanced my running experience, but I also don't feel they've dramatically solved any problems I had. It's awesome having access to all the stats and everything, but I do not feel like they have really helped make me a better runner. It keeps my motivation up seeing improvement without having to race, but if someone has been running for 20 or 30 years, motivation probably isn't an issue.\n\nOne of my best friends is head XC and Track Coach at a D2 school. He still only uses his timex for his own runs and doesn’t focus much on kids watches. \nPace and perceived effort.\n\nHa I wear that same watch! Been rocking it for decades (well, same model anyway).\n\nAnyway, I’m new to running and record using Strava on my phone.\n\nMy buddies and I bought USGS topographic maps and traced our favorite routes using  a map wheel to get the mileage.  Many of them were on trails and were impassible by vehicles. I still have the map wheel in a desk drawer for old time’s sake. And old paper journals recording all my workouts and related training notes. I think I could tell you my mileage, conditions, and how I felt going back 40 years—all to be burned when I go to that Great XC course in the Sky.\n\nMy running group was founded by old-schoolers, many of whom still participate in their 70s. One guy still paints markers every quarter mile of our route. Even the ones with smart watches glance down when they pass a marker.\n\nBetween map and smartphone time we used mapmyrun website and amateurs mostly ran for time and inputted it later. Also nike had a little shoe pod thing that had an accelerometer\n\nI remember MapMyRun! Some of my guesstimates about my regular runs, mile-wise, were way off!\n\nYes! Frequently would be a km or two off what i thought i was doing.\n\nI still use an online mapping software (mapometer now) to pre-map routes when I'm in an unfamiliar area, like when I travel, so I can get the distance I want in new places, especially because I like to explore new places on runs not near my home.\n\nI used the little Nike shoe pod when I started out.\n\nNike+ I think it was, and you had to have a shoe that had the cut out for it. \n\nI'd drive the route and measure it that way. Became easier after Google Maps etc, for sure!\n\nSet an egg on the boil. Run a kilometre. Check the egg for done-ness.\n\nLmao\n\nIn high school, our coach gave us a paper map of the area around the school, with a legend on it. I glued it to a cork board and pushed pins in at turns, and wrapped a string I had marked with miles around the push pins. Once I had routes, I just ran those routes. I made a list of the routes also.\n\nFor pace, a sport watch in the 90’s had a timer feature, so you’d get pace from distance and time. I just didn’t do splits outside of races, unless it was intervals and I timed each one separately.\n\nBy college, there were online maps, which I see the same way as the paper, by putting a “pin” at every intersection.\n\nI have been running since 1973 when I started high school. We went by estimating distances. Maybe the coach checked routes by the cars odometer, but we just went by time and perceived pace and we were pretty accurate. Before the first digital watches, timing my own runs was just by looking at the hands on the stove top clock before heading out and then checking again upon return. I never measured a course until I got my first my first GPS watch and guess what? My routes were pretty accurate.\n\nI used to measure routes using a paper map and marking the distance section by section on the edge of a piece of paper, and then converting the total to the actual distance using the scale on the map. Also sometimes I would use a piece of thread.\n\nI used to just go run and assume I was doing a 7:30 to 8 min mile. Multiply 7.5 * 20 / 2 to know how far how to go before turning around. I was training a lot of a paved trail along the Potomac that went on forever. Lovely runs, but very “out and back again”. \n\nDid the marine corps marathon in DC at a 7:12 pace, so I must not have been too far off.\n\nI lived there 88-91. Did some fantastic tempo runs on Haines Point following the Cherry Blossom course and long out and backs on C/O. \n\nLooking back I can’t believe some of those workouts. How was I running that fast and how has 35 years done this to me!\n\nFeel. I actually lost my garmin last year and haven't replaced it. Leave phone at home and just run with a casio. \n\nI've been at it a while. I'm 36m. Starting out for me if all the techy stuff was around, i didn't know about it. I know my average no effort pace is 9.25, so I just use that and time spent to ballpark distances, adjusting for effort/speed. \n\nI'm not competitive. When I do halfs-ultras it's just for me. Maybe in 5-10ks I'll try to beat my uncle or friend, but that's about it. Running for me is supposed to be about healthy stress relief/escape, and I've found tracking everything to be addictive and honestly just of negative value for my situation.\n\n[This article ](https://www.cyclinguk.org/cycle-magazine/russ-mantle-million-mile-man) is inspirational.  Writing it down on paper enabled Russ to work out he'd ridden a million miles\n\nOften used maps or signposts with distances between points on. Measuring a route on a map you can work out the distance pretty accurately &amp; then run it.\n\nI was poor growing up so before I was gifted a stopwatch I used to time it to the kitchen clock. IE my route would be 5 miles &amp; id take 30 minutes to run it. Then just try &amp; beat it &amp; improve over time.\n\nFor competition prep I’d just go run laps at the track &amp; have somebody time me. 10 laps of the track = 4000m etc so I could run a specific distance &amp; get my splits/km etc. it was a crude system but worked surprisingly well.\n\nI'm sure that gave you a very intuitive sense of pacing yourself without a watch!\n\nHa. Yeah, it really did thinking about it lol\n\nIdk why I remembered this but McDonald’s used to give out free pedometers if you bought a salad 🤣\n\nWhen I was in high school in the 90s, it was hand-me-downs from previous runners. The regular routes and distances were known and the knowledge passed down. Later, as an adult, I used the car odometer. I think I got my first Garmin around 2006-ish? Before that, I used a Timex watch with a stopwatch on it for time.\n\nI had an idea of my pace, so I'd go based on time, or drive the route beforehand. Also, I'd measure routrs by map. \n\nDistance wasn't such a big deal outside of a race or fitness test, it was more \"I'm gonna run for an hour.\"\n\nIn the early 2000s, I had a pedometer that I would clip to my shorts. I don’t think it was very accurate, but it gave me a rough approximation on long runs\n\nThis isn't super from the old days, but pre-watch I ran with a little mp3 player for music and I would look at the time when I started and finished my first \"mile\" (the signs say 3 laps around the track at the local park is a mile, but later with GPS I learned it's a little short), do the subtraction and if I could remember it by the time I got home write it in a little notebook. I measured my progress by comparing the times.  I guess the same could have been achieved with a watch, but I wasn't going to sweat on my leather band, pre-fitness watch.\n\nI grew up in eastern Colorado so I just ran from road to road which are country miles. Basically every county was in alphabetical order so was pretty easy. I once ran a full marathon running by 26 miles of fields without a turn or anything. No phone not music but didn’t know any better. Probably tons of midwesterns that had a similar experience\n\nJust ran by time. Occasionally would use car odometer to measure a route and kinda stuck to just running that route.\n\nMapquest or ran on tracks/treadmills as much as possible.\n\nI was gifted my first Garmin last September. Before that I used MapMyRun or some other app to determine distance. I recorded (and still record) all my runs on paper. For racing, I'd run the first mile at an estimated pace, check my watch to see if I was on pace at the marker and then adjust each mile to stay in pace.\n\nWe knew the rough pace we were running and could tell within a half mile how far we had gone. You could absolutely do that now if you wanted. \n\nSome runs were on trails with mile markers\n\nI used to check out my road runs in MapQuest.  I never did know how long my trail runs were.  I would time my runs with a Timex running watch, and m that would give me an idea of how long they were if I assumed my pacing was consistent.  \n\nAll the data I have now doesn’t make me feel like a better runner.  In fact, I try to ignore my watch during most runs.  RPE is a good tool.\n\nI would either build a route on Map my run and run it after, or complete a run and plot it out after.\n\nI ran on an outdoor track in a community sports centre or used Map My Run beforehand to, er, map the length of my run.\n\nI drove routes and used my car odometer to measure the distance.\n\n 1985.\nMilometer on bike for distance . Sony Walkman with c60 cassette for 30 minute timings .\nWish I could get the times I got at 15 years old.\n\nWatches have had timers on them for a long time, and there were stopwatches which only tracked durations. \n\nI had some measured courses and measured  miles, and I wore a wristwatch with stopwatch functions. I'd measure my time  on a fixed course at various levels of effort, and that helped me to develop an excellent sense of pace.\n\nI do have to say, that's one thing I love about smartwatches--I'm much more apt to vary my routes because I don't have to worry about knowing the difference in distance.\n\nI was less exact about how far my runs were but I knew that the grid roads were 1 mile apart and used that as a  guideline to approximate distance.\n\nI just ran for time and plotted courses on a hiking map with mileages listed so I’d just guess basically. Goal was more to run 2, 3, 4, 5 hours or whatever and approximate the miles. I had a day calendar that I wrote everything in.\n\nI had a bike with a digital speedometer. I’d ride the route then I’d know.\n\nThis is in the late 90s.\n\nOh and later Mapquest.\n\nMapping out the distance of the run and using a regular watch\n\nWhen I ran cross country in high school we would do trail runs on the nature trail that had the miles marked when doing long runs. Our coach also had pre-designated routes that were known mileages (for example there was one called Heinz 57 that was from the school to the first grave stone that was a Heinz that died in 1957 and then back to the tree by the track that was something like a 5k) around town that we would run depending on the mileage we were trying to put in that day. The perimeter run we often did as a warm up around all the sports field was also about 1k that they used one of those wheels to measure.\n\nI love how this dead guy had such an iconic place in your cross-country lore!\n\nPaper map, car odometer or measuring wheel, and a stop watch. Kept track of date, t.o.d., weather, distance, time, pace in a notebook for the different routes. Basically a manual version of strava.\n\nI used to use Google maps and a regular watch.  I guess before online maps I would have used a paper one and walked it out with dividers or whatever.  In terms of long term tracking I will still just plop values into a spreadsheet sometimes. Coming from a mild science background, it's actually a little frustrating to have another party decide which aspects of data are readily visible vs obscured and how it should be presented.\n\nThe treadmill shows how far you run, but also some trails with have markers up with distances, or you’ll know if you run a lap along the trail, it’ll be xyz miles / kilometers.\n\nI started running in 2005, I used an old timex and wrote down the time into word doc when I got home\n\nAlso I use Nike + from my iPod mini\n\nI remember my mom using the car odometer for everything.. lol\n\nA watch and a diary.\n\nGmaps Pedometer\n\nAnd would know mile points for first and last and average them if I didn’t wanna map it out\n\nIn high school I would set one of the trip odometers on my car and then drive a loop to measure distance and I would just run along less busy streets or sidewalks. Then I'd wear a watch to time myself.\n\nWhen I was in high school I just timed my runs. We measured it by running known routes or improvised by known distances between streets. Stopwatch/wristwatch was literally all you needed.\n\nIn college we would do laps around the track at our given training paces until we knew exactly what those paces felt like and then run distances by time at those paces\n\nYou have a couple of go to routes which had been measured by car odometer, then everything else was approximated from time.  There were pedometers that could be calibrated from your stride, and it was understood that mileage was roughly approximated.\n\nI’m 59 years old now. In the 80s I used a bike map of DC for mileage and a Casio wristwatch with a stopwatch function. I did a lot of fartleks (speed play). I could only really compute average pace for the whole run, though. I got through a sub-40 10K, a 20K, and a Marathon that way— I also was in my early 20s and would have performed well no matter what my training was.\n\nThat said, I love my smart watch and smart phone. I wouldn’t go back to that primitive way of training. No amount of nostalgia would make me give them up!\n\nI know! I'm not a very talented runner, and I have seen my training improve so much because of tech, especially since I am self-coached and never ran in high school and college. It makes it so much easier to come up with your own training plan, knowing more exact routes.\n\nFor track intervals when I ran in highschool - me or someone else in the training session would carry a big clunky stopwatch - and the rest would just try and match the pace/keep up while we ran on the track.   \nThinking back on it we just did the longer runs by feel haha.\n\nCar odometer or track workouts. If precise distance wasn’t important, I would estimate by dividing total time of the run by my usual pace. \n\nI tended to run a few routes that I knew well how far it was.\n\nRegular old stopwatch, ran enough in college I was within 10 seconds of my min/mile pace. Knew easy hour run would be ~8 miles. If I had to go harder for say a tempo run I’d run a route I knew how long it was.\n\nI used google maps pedometer and knew the distance of all my planned routes and longer interval segments (e.g., the distance from X street to Y street was apx 1mile, from y to z was another mile and so on). I used a timex ironman watch and the lap function to figure out my pace on segments where I needed to hit pace.\n\n\nI had a spreadsheet where I tracked everything.\n\n\nFor shorter intervals I went to the track near my house and used the lap function on my watch.\n\nStopwatch.  I lead all of our speed work intervals on the track so i was very good at pacing.  I could go on a road run &amp; by my effort &amp; duration, be within half a mile guesstimating the distance\n\nI used to look at the clock on my stove. Okay, 6:03am. Walk out the front door. Run, come back home, look at clock. 6:47am okay, a little bit longer than yesterday. Good to know. \n\nDidn’t write it down. Didnt do nothing with this information. Basically, it didn’t happen.\n\nPlan the route on google maps\n\nI used to have a mechanical watch with a stop/start timer, and record it in a little book.\n\nYou have to run around with one of those measuring wheels to get your distance. They even made off road ones for trail runs\n\nI had landmarks. Neighborhoods. Stores. I never liked running in things like desolate roads or tracks. So if I could run an interval with less fatigue I would count it as a win. I would also start at a very specific time and use a digital stopwatch to count rests. Even a cheap digital watch like my Casio CS watch from 1993 had laps in the stopwatch I could go back and record. Used it with cycling and swimming. Was a champ. Lost it at the college rec. sad day.\n\nTrack, set known routes or you just run by time and effort.\n\nI have my late uncle’s packet of running stuff - old race bibs, race photos, and postcards with race results. \n\nApparently he would carry a pencil during marathons and write the clock time on his bib when he passed mile markers.\n\nI am not that coordinated! That is next level!\n\nI would have my dad drive a route and go by the odometer. When I got my license, I did this. At state and metro parks, I relied on the posted mileage. Often, I’d run on my school’s XC course which I knew forward and back.\n\nWhen I started, I was on my high school track team, and I neither planned not tracked my runs. The coach would give us a route, and I would run it with the guys. If he said it was 7 miles, I took his word for it. \n\nOn the track, the coach would time our intervals with a stop watch. It was good to know how fast I was running, but I never recorded the splits or anything.\n\nIn the 70's and 80's I knew distances of all the roads from watching my odometer everywhere I drove and writing it all down on a map. Used my watch for elapsed time.\n\nThe first year I started xc, I set a small alarm clock at the end of my driveway and would note the start and stop time of my run. I plotted the distance by car beforehand. Mapmyrun and watches were available at the time; I was just broke lmao\n\nWhen I was in middle school, Nike had this thing you could put in your shoe and was supposed to track your runs. I don’t think it was very accurate lol but it was something. Then as most people are saying, my parents would drive my running route so I had an idea of how far but even then I wasn’t recording time\n\nThe Nike+ iPod pedometer! I remember these too!\n\nI’ve been running for nearly 60 years. At first we used a wrist watch with a second hand as most stop watches couldn’t measure more than 60 minutes. I purchased my first digital Ironman watch 20 years ago and still use it. Most distances were measured with the odometer of a car or bicycle for trails. A quarter mile track (close to a modern 400 meter track) was used for intervals. The methods used were  accurate enough for most of us amateurs. \n\nIf that sounds antiquated, don’t get me started on fueling and hydration or shoes. I started running long before Nikes and Gatorade were invented.\n\nLooked at the clock when I left the house and then again when I got home. I had already measured out the distance of my regular route using my car's odometer.\n\nMapQuest\n\nOnly run on track using stop watch.\n\nMy dad would drive until we hit the mileage I wanted then in 2007 I got the little Nike thing that went in your shoe and connected to your iPod 😂 My mom swore by a track and would never not run on it for the exact reason.\n\nI think that’s the downside of old skool-some people could get anchored to the track.\n\nAdmittedly got seriously into running once mapping websites and bike odometers existed (phones and smart watches also barely existed but I didn’t have one).  But I would use the bike odometer to measure routes or put it into google maps or a similar website.\n\nMaps 😂 I know people drove cars around but I used a map bc I didn't have a car yet. \nHeart monitor I didn't have so it was based off breathing effort\n\nMy grandpa mostly ran at a track and logged his distance and time in a notebook. Even in the late 2000s, he logged his distance and time on his stationary bike.\n\nMy dad taught me to keep track of longer runs, time, HR, etc on that awesome thing called paper ha. And then switched to MS Excel. I still have my old papers (using a pen even- increíble) with runs from along time ago in some box in the garage. And I would use loops to keep track of distances- measured by the good old odometer. (This makes me feel more like a boomer than I thought lol. I’m not- just a 1970’s boy. Which is like 20 years ago right?)\n\nWhen I was in college we would just run the same routes every day that had been measured with a wheel. Upperclassman told underclassman where the mileage markers were.  I would use a Timex to time and keep my log in an excel spreadsheet. \n\nOtherwise I would sometimes use a car odometer to measure a route after the fact.  Or just guess based on what pace I felt my effort was.\n\n1. Pretty much all interval; sessions were either by time (e.g. 8min hard, 5min easy) or on a very well known distance lap or the track.\n2. A lot of all other runs stuck to the same fixed routes, of known distance passed down over the years within clubs. \"Yeah, it's exactly 2 miles to go from X lampost\".\n3. Long runs where precise distance didn't matter too much = 1:25000 paper maps.\n\nTraining log - paper notebook.\n\nI can't really say I miss those days. The watches give a lot more flexibility and useful info and the online logging is far superior.\n\n2009-2013 I didn't have a smart phone.  I had a cheap digital watch.  I would find a website that would let me trace my route. I knew my route well enough after a few runs.  I'd run by a store \"okay that's my 1 mile check point, 8 minutes on my stop watch\"... so on and so forth. Sometimes I'd just go run and map out the route afterwards on the computer and having timed how long the run took I'd just do the math there.  \nIt's really not hard. Just time consuming.\n\nCar odometer. Bike or rolled wheel on race courses. Most of time, especially with lots of trail running, we did time: 45:00. That’s six. An hour that’s 8.\n\nMy HS cross country team had a book with maps of all the different routes we would do from the school  and how long they were, I think someone had made it as their senior project or something. So you wanted to do 4 miles, you’d do the Duck Run. You wanted 6, you’d do East Hill 6. 9? Glacier 9. We had something for everything from probably 2 to 12 miles. \n\nOtherwise, if I was running from home (out on country roads) I just assumed that country road grid was exactly 1x1 miles. Just count the intersections. Going back home to run with my GPS watch now has proved that that was decently accurate — at least good enough to use as a training tool.\n\nI had a few methods when I started in 2005: (1) online mapping software and then just run the route that I mapped at home, (2) old school pedometer calibrated the best that I could, (3) run at the track and count laps, (4) greenways or paths with quarter mile markers.\n\nIn many ways I miss those days. A Timex + Athleticore was all I needed.\n\nWhen I was in high school (graduated in 2007) there were only a few options for gps watches, there weren't any smart watches then. Only like one or two guys on my team used them. The rest of us just had regular stopwatches, and just went on feel. Pace was always just whatever feels good that still lets us talk and have full conversations, and we would run based on time, not distance. \n\nIt's funny because a lot of people are going back to that since the human body doesn't care how far you run, just how long. I know I definitely get away too caught up in exact mileage and all the Strava data and stuff that really doesn't matter.\n\nJust regular stop watches. You'd measure your routes with a car or bike odometer.  Unless you were on a track, you'd typically either have no split data at all, or maybe measures per mile or km.\n\nPopular routes would often have mile/km markings spray painted on the asphalt leftover from previous races.\n\nJust measured running hours and the training intensity. You can get pace estimates running a measured loop or on a track with a watch. You dont really need the data we hoard these but its so easy to collect it and nice to look at.\n\nJust did everything by minutes.\nI still prefer training that way.\nMentally easier to digest for me.\n60 min run\n30 min tempo\n90 min long run\n\nA timex on the wrist 😂\n\nWent on mapmyrun to look at distances of my route\n\nYep - map my run plus a Casio g-shock for timing!\n\nI’m just here to weep aged tears at people seriously (and validly) answering the question with “Google Earth” or some website being the Stone Age way of doing it. \n\nI’m only in my forties, but even just the idea you can do that kind of thing on a computer for free is wildly sci-fi futuristic to me sometimes. \n\nWe used measuring wheels for shorter distances, or lengths of string and a metre rule for sprints on a field. Long distances were measured by someone’s dad driving the course. Timings done with a stopwatch, which by my day were digital and could do hundredths of a second.\n\nHa, yes, I’m older and I was definitely most curious about the pre-MapMyRun era!\n\nIf you live in a city like Chicago or NYC you can just count streets. In Manhattan it’s 20 streets in a mile, and on the north side of Chicago the main streets are half a mile apart. The shorter streets are .10 if I remember correctly.\n\nAlso most bike paths have built in mile marker posts in most cities.\n\nI would just start the stop watch function on my regular timex wrist watch and then map out the run on Google earth using the ruler later. Definitely was not super accurate but was close enough. \n\nRunning the same routes you kind of get a feel for where the mile markers are and learn how to pace just by perceived effort. \n\nWould also have coaches on bikes and or cars letting us know pace / distance sometimes. \n\nSome kids in the group had the very early Garmins but they were expensive.\n\nYou ran on a track or on a county road.\n\nMapmyrun.com I think was a thing?\n\nI used this to plan the runs and get the correct distance.  I never timed it.  I would listen to an AM/FM radio on headphones.\n\nWhen I started Nike had a pod that went in the sole of your shoe. It paired with a fit bit type band to show you pace and distance.\n\nGPS watches existed for more than 20 years - well before there were smartphones and long before people started to call them smart watches.\n\nFor example, first Garmins were released in 2003. The first ever GPS watch was released in 1999 by Casio.\n\nThe only function they had outside of recording an activity was to show time and maybe have an alarm. To download activities you had to connect them to a PC via USB.\n\nBy the way, Strava also existed before smartphones as a website. The only way to get your activities on Strava was to upload them from a PC.\n\nI also started using Garmins and later Suunto GPS watches multiple years before I had a smartphone. I bought my first GPS watch in 2011. For a few months before that I used MapMyRun website on computer to figure out how long my runs were, then I used a program on Windows PC to track and organize the data, visualize maps, graphs, analytics, etc. I think it was called SportTracks.\n\nHow old are you? You don’t need to answer. Do you remember those things you would clip\nOn to your running shorts or shirt? Way before any i tech. It counted your steps and miles. \n\nI had one but I really just ran because I loved it.\n\nYou know it’s love when you carried a Walkman! Haha. I would go as far as I could stand and on the way back I would usually hit  runners high. It did get longer and longer before I reached it and stopped running for that. \n\nIt for me was peace. My dad always found it in sailing. I think we all have something that we lose ourselves in and don’t need a mile counter! Hopefully :) \n\nOdometer on car, stop watch, paper. Same way people who don’t feel like spending money do now.\n\nI used a wrist watch and map my run\n\nUsed a stopwatch and used a bike with a mechanical odometer to measure the distance, and kept track of results in a notebook.  - early 80's. I wasn't interested in cadence but that could of been calculated if I used a mechanical pedometer which I had. It worked well and didn't mind it, even in hindsight.\n\nThe nike+iPod thing\n\nWe just looked at the clock before training and again at the end.\n\nI used time.  Non-competitive runner.   60 minute run usually and tried to go further in that time.\n\nHaving GPS gadgets and data doesn't mean someone doesn't take running seriously.  \n\nI don't use any of that and am running 17-18 min 5ks at 39 yo. Nothing world beating, but pretty good on a club running level.\n\nEasy runs are just for time, usually on trails. Tempos are on measured courses, and I'll hit the track for 200m-1mile intervals.\n\nPre measured or set course and a digital watch.\n\nReally long tape measures.\n\nWe didn't. \n\nWhen we were kids we were just trying to outrun the sabertooth tigers to survive.\n\nWatch George Clooney in Burn Before Reading\n\nI'm only 28 but didn't have a smartphone/watch when I started. I used an online mapping tool called mapometer which gave the distances of my runs and then used an analogue watch to judge my pace... and my half marathon PB was paced using numbers written on my arm - I'm sure this will sound like the stone age to my children\n\nA stopwatch\n\nSimple answer is just old school heart rate monitor. A strap over the chest. It would measure steps and heart. Stride. Shit like that \n\nToday. Old school chest strap is still the best way. \n\nOther than that. My dad who’s a 50s kid would just do it for time. He would work really hard at a known distance to get a faster time. \n\nToday he doesn’t care about heart rate or true distance. But the speed of a known distance. \n\nMy dad’s old school. He’s been in the Tour de France 3 times just with effort.\n\nMy whole family were cyclist so I got them to plot\nMy runs when I was a kid or I’d jump\nOn their bike when I got bored of my route. \n\nI was fortunate that my brother worked in bike store, so one day after me saving up for sometime  he ordered a  Polar Rs200d with the foot pod. \n\nIt measured pace, distance and “swing” (step distance). I don’t miss uploading to the pc via Infared lol\n\nIn the country the roads are gridded off in one mile squares pretty consistently. \n\nThere are also mile markers on a lot of rural highways we would run on.\n\nWe weren't as worried about being exact, coach would use the odometer trick sometimes when we rode in the back of the truck to our drop off.\n\nIt's wild to think how much of that is completely foreign to a lot of modern kids. Cops are real sticklers about truck beds full of people these days, and smart phones have absolutely murdered people's ability to navigate and judge distance.\n\nTo be fair, even pre-smartphone, my ability to judge distance by feel was pretty terrible.\n\nI sometimes like to run without anything on my wrist and ill just go. I will still carry my watch but ill put it in my hydration vest.... because you know, if its not on strava... did it really happen??\n\nStarted running in 2006 and used mapmyrun.com to measure the routes I was running. Used a simple digital watch to record my time.\n\nUsing a stopwatch and a pre-planned route where you know the mile marks.\n\nTimex\n\nI have been in the military since 2001, back in the olden days we new our pace and ran for a certain amount of time. With those 2. Arianlea you can get distance.\n\nI’m not THAT old but I used to use mapmyrun before things like Apple watches were really a thing"

    "body": "Hi, I’m a 15f who just started running. I run about 7.5 minutes a mile which admittedly isn’t the best but I’m trying to improve it in hopes of running a half marathon one day. I’ve been running about 3 miles for a few days but I’ve consistently faced the same problem which is that I just don’t have the correct mindset to run. Whenever I run, I always walk intermittently because I keep telling myself that I won’t be able to make it and that I might as well walk and I can’t help but to stop running and walk for a while because I feel tired, and then feel extremely guilty about it because I know that I could’ve ran the whole while. Honestly my mindset is dragging my timing and passion down and I just don’t know how to persevere more and keep running. I just want to become a better runner but I can’t seem to get over this problem. Can some seasoned runners give some advice about how I can overcome this?",

    "all_comment_text": "7:30 pace is quite fast, not sure why you think it isn’t… slow down and run for the fun of it, don’t worry about your pace. You probably have to walk because you’re going too fast. You also shouldn’t go from 0 running to running 3 miles a day, start with maybe 3-4 times per week at the most and work your way up from there.\n\nSounds like me when i was younger.  I couldn’t imagine not running fast and getting my hr up above 160 the whole time. Id feel like a failure even if i had to stop and tie my shoe or something. \n\nGot smarter and now i enjoy running much more. I walk/jog/run frequently unless I’m specifically trying to push myself for some benchmark. \n\nEven when I’m doing a timed portion, i usually take it easy before and after.\n\nSame. I used to run a FAST 5k five days per week. \n\n I'm a much better runner in my 40s than I was in my 20s.\n\nI'm 32 years old and I still can't pace myself correctly. I went couch to 5k (like literally sitting on the couch to running a 5k the next day) and 8 minutes was at around a 8:30 mile pace. It then took me another 29 minutes to finish.\n\nI just can't quite seem to just go at an appropriate speed.\n\nJust slow down a LOT. not sure if you have a running watch, but you can use that many different ways to pace yourself. There’s, pace, heart rate, and even a “power” stat that can be really useful if your watch or footpod can do it correctly. \n\nI read somewhere that 80% or more of your runs should be “slow and easy” and then the rest you can really push it.\n\nI‘ve been there! I’m training for my first marathon now and thought I wasn’t going to be able to do it bc I couldn’t keep a 8:30 pace for long. Turns out, my easy pace is 9:45-10:00 and I have to pay attention to my HR to make sure I’m not pushing it too hard. I’m a 32yo female and my training hr should be 125-140 for endurance sessions. It’s a lot more comfortable than you realize if you’re used to exercise needing to feel intense. Def second the watch/HR monitor rec so you can get a better feel for training zones and find your natural pace. \nHonestly, good for you getting up and doing it! It’s the overall distance, not the time, that matters. Slow down so you don’t burn yourself out and enjoy the journey! \nLots of good tips here for finding your HR zones. But always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns/conditions! \nhttps://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/how-to-train-with-a-heart-rate-monitor.html\n\nWhen I started going slower I enjoyed running more. Funny because now I'm actually faster and can do more distance because I'm so motivated. Running slower ended up making me faster lol\n\nI’ve been doing some training plan on my garmin watch and it tells you to “run at xxx pace for 30-60 mins”. Been doing that for like a month and ive realized its kind of taking the fun out of my running. \n\nNeed to just create my own workouts and have fun again. Slowing down, enjoying the scenery, stopping for a minute, all make running so much better.\n\nYeah, I just run fast until I get tired, then when I am ready I bring the pace up. I find it fun. Being forced to pace a certain way sounds boring tbh\n\nExtremely boring. Heart rate basically stays the same, pace, etc. not natural imo, except for a race.\n\nAbsolutely this. Most runners are running both too fast and too slow. \n\nPlenty of slow stuff to build your base, and the occasional interval work doing shorter pieces to build your speed.\n\nBtw, OP, sounds like you can do it\n\nAgreed with this ^ 7:30 is fast and not sustainable for longer runs, at least when starting. I (28F) started running a few months ago and had to keep taking walk breaks because I also thought a 9:30 min mile avg was “too slow” lol. Wrong 😂\n\nIf you have Spotify, I found it helpful to search for playlists called “13 minute mile pace” or “11 minute mile pace” - a lot have been created and Spotify will even make some mixes for you. Trying to run on beat has helped me a ton! If you can afford a fitness watch of some sort that shows your current avg. pace on the watch face, that would help a lot too. Easy to just look down and spot check your speed.\n\nGood luck and you got it!!!!\n\nI came to say that running only started being fun and I only started feeling truly motivated everyday when I started slowing down. \n\nI run 13 minute miles with 4:1 walk intervals, and I'm fitter than I've ever been!!\n\nYou just need to slow down. 7:30 per mile is not a slow pace for someone who just started running. It's an insane pace. Looking at the Texas state championships for cross-country last year, the final finisher in the meet ran the 5k at a 7:19 pace. That's a girl who qualified for the state championship, probably the winner of her league and the best runner in her school. When I was in high school in the 90s, there were at best 2-3 girls in a given year at my school who could consistently break 22 minutes in the 3-mile.\n\nYou're having to walk because you're expending energy at a rate you can't sustain when you're running. If you're running 3 miles on an average day, you don't want to aim for the fastest pace you can possibly maintain for 3 miles. Nobody can do that day after day. You want figure out the best pace you can maintain for 3 miles every single day without ever taking a break, and then still go slower than that so you can work in occasional, but not every day, higher quality, faster pace work over shorter distances.\n\nMaybe that will be a bit of helpful motivation for her as well.  I'm over twice her age and just started running again, and I haven't yet broken the 12 minute mile.  That is what happens to you if you don't train to run.  I doubt I will ever hit 7:30 per mile in my life now (but we'll see).\n\nYou can. I'm close to 40f and my last 5k is at 7:33 per mile.  Your fastest mile drops like a fly on the way from not running at all to running a slow marathon (say, 4:30)\n\nThank you for saying that!  I'min that awkward defeatest mindset and need a boost of confidence like that. \n\nYup. It does work. But you measure improvement in months or years, not in days. Keep at it and you'll definitely be amazed. \n\nThe things I don't notice is pace, but cadence and how easy it is to run for 5, 6 miles without getting tired at all. Once you cadence go from 155 to 175, you can bet a 7:00 mile is well within grasp. So do them cadence and running form drills!\n\n4:30 is slow? 🥲\n\nWell it certainly isn't fast 😁\n\nOuch\n\nBit of a brag but I’m very proud of myself.. 32m, just hit 3.54 per km, or 6.19 per mile for 5km. 19:34 final time!\n\nha nice :) 25 Male just started running again (i walk a shit ton tho) my current PB is 22:30 for my 5k my Garmin says i could do 19:14 that would be dope as hell \\^\\^ but i need to actually run it. Resting Hearthrate is 44 VO2 Max of 60 atm\n\nExcellent stats mate if you’ve got that already you can get a lot higher by the time you’re my age!\n\ni mean i walk about 15 miles/22-25k a day so that gives me a good endurace baseline my goal atm would be a \\~3:45 Marathon middle of next year or something a 5:00/km pace puts me right around the upper limit of Z2 to low Z3 so with some more running definitly maintainable \\^\\^ anyways i gotta go to Zumba keep running mate :D EDIT oh ye for context im slim build 176cm and 64kg with long legs so that also helps my running\n\n&gt; Texas state championships for cross-country last year, the final finisher in the meet ran the 5k at a 7:19 pace. That's a girl who qualified for the state championship, probably the winner of her league and the best runner in her school.\n\nProbably the 7th best runner in her school.  If your team qualifies they take 7 runners to the race, and only their top 5 runners count for qualifying.\n\nI’d say OP has great potential and should keep at it. Crazy how 7:19 is competitive\n\nSounds like you're suffering from the same training mindset that most beginner runners fall into.  To dispel some myths/ideas that it sounds like you could use clarification on:\n\n1. Not every run should be as fast as you can go.  In fact, the majority of your runs should be slow.  Like super slow.  Like slower than you think is acceptable running pace, or a run/walk split.  Going balls to the wall every time is a surefire recipe for injury and burnout.  \n\n2. You need to rest.  Take a day or two off in between runs when you're starting out.  Again, going from little to no running to 3mi a day is going to get you hurt and be a much bigger, much longer-term problem than motivation.  Allow yourself time to recover.  \n\n3. Have some fun!  It sounds like you're really hard on yourself, at least in running, though I'd imagine in other areas of your life too.  That can be a good thing, but make sure you let yourself have some fun out there.  I never enjoyed running until I learned to enjoy the process of running, not the goal.  I don't care how fast I run because I probably will see a cute dog, or a pretty lady, or a cool bird, or enjoy the sun on my face, or whatever.  That's where the joy of running comes from.  Let that joy in and you'll find yourself naturally running longer and faster because you *enjoy* what you're doing.\n\nAgreed. I really like to 80/20 split where about 80% of my running is in upper Z2, and 20% is Z4-5. If I tried to kill myself with every run, I would have given up running a long time ago!\n\nOther comments talk about slowing down, which is excellent advice. I want to add a few things about what I find motivates me too run.\n\nI like running in nice places, as much as I can. Is there anywhere you can go and run which is scenic? A park, countryside, or anything like that? It doesn't have to be grand, I really enjoy running in the woods and parks near my home. Linked to this, I like to use running to explore, so looking at the map and spotting something you want to go and visit is a good way of doing it.\n\nI also like making silly games with my running - I'll try and race the trains near my house. Anything like that is a way of making things a bit more fun. \n\nLastly, I like to have time to think. If I'm going fast, I can't do this very well, so it's better for me to have a slower pace and just chill. It gives me space from my life to consider problems without the stress.\n\nSome of my funnest runs was with the XC team when we would do a random trail run and just screw around while running a conversational pace. No one was going all out, we were just having fun.\n\nSounds similar to my running club - start and finish at a different pub each week, follow a flour trail in between. \n\nWe don't often have much of a clue where we are or where we're going. It's an adventure\n\nOne of the funnest runs I ever did was when I was in high school XC. Absolutely no way they would be allowed to do this now 🤣. We were all blindfolded in a van and taken few miles out from the school. This was all voluntary by the way, we didn’t have to do this. So he does a bunch of circles around town so we have no idea where we’re going. A few minutes goes by and then the light through the blindfold goes almost dark and we’re backing in somewhere. He says “alright boys open the blind folds!” and we’re in some farmer’s barn. We had to figure out the way back to the school on our own as a team. We had no idea where we were, we didn’t have smart phones at that time. He offered us some general directions but we didn’t want them, we wanted to figure it out ourselves. It ended up being a 7-8 mile run back to the school but we didn’t care. We had so much fun trying to figure it out. Amazing times.\n\nthat seriously sounds like so much fun 😭 i would’ve loved this in high school\n\nSounds fun! That's a race format I've heard of called The Drop, they do a number of them across different parts of the UK, unsure if it's a format done anywhere else.\n\nOh that would be so cool. Yeah it was super fun when we did it. This would have been like 2006 or 2005.\n\nThe pub runs would also be very cool too.\n\nW\\\\In high school XC, we would run to every grocery store bakery in town that gave out free cookies to kids for our easy days sometimes. We were always polite and only did it a couple times a season, so the bakery people liked us, and would give us the freebies. We'd call it a cookie run. It got upgraded when a frozen yogurt place moved in and would let us get a free sample of frozen yogurt too.\n\nOh that’s sounds awesome! We had this trail run we’d call Jurassic park and we’d just chase each other around with sticks and screw around. Those runs were always so fun.\n\ngreat points. There's running on a main road with traffic zooming by and then there's running through a paved or unpaved pathway through nature and the experience is totally different. The sound of your shoes tapping against the calm of the natural world vs the sound of a dump truck downshifting and cars speeding past.\n\nI carried myself through the last half mile of a particularly challenging 12-miler by counting turtles in the lake next to the trail. :D\n\nExactly! One of my rules is I can always stop to look at things. If I don't appreciate a good view, why should I bother to run?\n\nSuch good advice, I did this lake run the other day and I practically forgot I was running\n\nThank you. I can't do it all the time, but I try and get a few runs a week in like this. \n\nI'm recovering from Covid, so taking it easy, but tomorrow morning will be my run in a nice place. Hopefully it'll be as a successful as your lake run.\n\nIf you're 15f and doing 7:30 miles, you should think about joining your school's cross country/track team. You'll learn how to run correctly and get the discipline/passion you're looking for\n\nOP should DEFINITELY join her high schools cross country and/or track team. With a 7:30 mile pace for a beginner, she could REALLY improve on a xc or track team. Sounds like a natural distance/mid distance runner! I didn’t really start to enjoy running until I joined track, it’s the only thing I miss from high school.\n\nIf you bring your phone during your run I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting the Nike Run Club App and starting with the \"Getting Started\" Plan and moving up to the 5k, 10k, etc... it's actually a great app and Coach Bennett does an amazing job at keeping you focused, mind off the \"running\", and enjoying it. It's what got me into it and now I love it and my girlfriend as well who hated running. \n\nAlso, nothing wrong with walking but you're definitely running too fast so slow down and enjoy the ride.\n\nThe Nike Run Club app is a godsend! It's gotten me through a lot of runs that I didn't feel motivated to do. And they say that the mistake that many new runners make is running too fast. Definitely give it a try!\n\nAgree! Also, the thing that really helped me the most was the \"Effort Scale\", when they talked about that and I learned about what \"effort\" I should be putting in the runs it put everything into perspective and allowed me to know what paces I should run at and what it should feel like for the easy runs, threshold runs, fartleks, etc... it's not only a great app for runners to get into running but to also learn about running and be more efficient.\n\nCame here to say this ⬆️\n\nLove Nike Run Club.\n\nHere to show support for the Nike run app. \n\nAlso, comparison is the thief of joy so don’t compare your wicked fast 7:30 pace with someone like me that’s been running for a few years and runs at 8:30 race pace… wait, nevermind.\n\nForget training for a half marathon.  Baby steps.  Find some 5ks.  Later some 10k's.  \n\nBetter yet, join a cross country team if you can.  School teams will often take anyone willing.  You don't have to be an 18 minute 5k girl either. Most are going to run 25+.  The training is great and you'll find friends who are right there with you.\n\nWell done on your running so far. The secret to longer running, especially thinking about half marathons is slowing down. Think about time on feet rather than speed. For your situation I would advise to look up Couch to 5k. There are lots of apps which use the programme. It mixes running with walking in a structured way to gradually build up to running for 30 mins continuously. It takes the guilt out of the run as you are supposed to walk. Also, it sounds from your post, that you are running every day. Its good to alternate running days with something else (walking, swimming, cycling, resting) to avoid injuries and overtraining.\n\nIt's OK to walk on your runs, but here are a couple of easy tips to change that.\n\n1. Slow down. You might not have to walk if you just go slower in general. Every run is not a race and most runs shouldn't be. Improvement comes by doing the distance - not by doing every run as fast as you can. You only run fast occasionally\n\n2. Shorten your initial distance and slowly build it. \n\nSo today or tomorrow - go out for a 2 mile run instead and keep the pace slow enough that you're not breathing hard at all. Just enjoy it.\n\nI've been using the Couch to 5K app and it's great! Walking is ok, but having the app tell you when to run and walk helps with the mental discipline to keep running and not stop just because your brain says you are tired (when you aren't and can actually keep going).\n\nI gotta brag on the C25K program! It worked great for me, breaking my run into little chunks helped me build my endurance and kept me at it until the 8 weeks were up and I was running the entire time!\n\nHow is 7.5 min miles slow dude\n\nSlowwwww down. That pace is way too fast, walk as fast as you can, then just turn that into a run at the same speed. Now just go out and maintain that pace and enjoy it.\n\n7.5 minutes is quite fast. I don’t know why you think otherwise.\n\nDamn, kids! I remember the days when I could run 7:30 miles! Now I'm mid 30s and an 8-something mile feels like sprinting.\n\nAre you confusing running with sprinting?\n\nTry running sssllloooowwww for a long distance. Enjoy the scenery.  Listen to an audiobook or to music. Join a running club and talk to people while jogging. \n\nOr... Run slowly to a destination then take the bus or train back home (like I run to a beach, relax and watch the waves, then take the train home).\n\nAs others stated, you're quite fast and that's fantastic but from what I experienced (similar to you) is that you begin to hate the run itself because it's just too much on the body to be enjoyable. I found that when I slowed my runs to 10+ minute per miles, I could run double the distance with gas left in the tank and nearly instantly the runs became something I looked forward to rather than dreaded. \n\nThe slower miles add up quickly and I found myself starting to look forward to a faster paced run once a week where I would run those sub 8:30 miles with the mindset of a challenge and measure of my improvement. Try it out for a week or two and see if you experience similar.\n\nAgreeing with everyone on slowing down. My running coach describes easy pace as a running pace you can do and still hold a conversation. My easy pace is significantly slower than a push pace or a sprint pace. A tempo run is a good training idea. There are different versions, but the idea is to run at an easy pace, then push, then slow back down.\n\nget some music or a podcast in your ears and let your mind wander away from the effort of the run.   slow down a little and it will become easier.  keep trying and eventually you will be running all the time.  \n\nOnce you are running a lot, occasionally, your mind will wander and you will forget that you are running.\n\nYou're running 7.5 minute miles on a full 5k? That puts you in the 'advanced' category for run times by age and sex: [5k Run Times By Age And Ability - Running Level](https://runninglevel.com/running-times/5k-times)\n\nAlso, are you sure about that measurement? I'm not saying it's impossible, but it is harder to believe that someone capable of running a 7:30 mile pace on average for a 5k is pausing to walk throughout the run--and still achieving that time,\n\nI’m wondering if they’re running 7:30min/km rather than miles\n\nYeah that's what I was thinking, not sure how you run a 7.5min mile as a 15y/o and think \"God I'm slow\" lol. \n\nI'm 27M running getting excited when I run a 7:50min mile average for a 5k.\n\nIt is not that hard for strong teenaeger. And she is pushing himself to max.\n\nEveryone else has given great info on slowing down, finding fun spaces to run etc. I just wanted to let you know that I literally just came back from a 5 mile run, i have run 11 marathons, one just a few months ago, which is just to say, I’m not ‘new’ at this (I’m also no where near as fast as you are - I couldn’t do a 7:30 pace if I tried) and I took several walking breaks during my run. Partly because it’s warm and humid, partly because I probably didn’t eat enough, partly because I was running too fast when I was running, and partly because I had to go up a hill - lol. It also took me 3 hours to get myself out the door rather than just getting up and going when I woke up. I constantly struggle to motivate myself to run. Some days are easier than others. Don’t beat yourself up. You’re doing great!\n\nMy race-pace is about 4:15/km and 80% of my practice consists of runs in the interval of 5:30to 8:30. \n\nI suggest you slow down, listen to interesting podcasts or music. You should be able to talk on the phone or just breathe through your nose while running. \nRemember, running is a form, not a speed. \nWhen i was 15 my ego got the best of me and I tried to pr almost every run. \nThe faster i ran the less time i spent running since it was a fixed distance. Which lead nowhere improvement wise. \nWhen I got older and smarter i ran for time i.e. ”Im gonna run for 90minutes today, pace is irrelevant” and the results came really fast.\n\nAwesome work so far and as others have stated, 7:30 miles are very impressive at your age and for your experience level. My main advice would be to echo others’ advice. Slow down on most runs. You should have your slow easy days and when you want to push hard, you do your “race pace” but for only a mile or two. If your race pace is 8:00 for a half, you need to be running 10 minute miles for your long runs(6+ miles). I split my pacing into three categories. \n\nYour long runs are building up your cardio foundation. Your lungs and heart and blood vessels gain so much more endurance from your slow long runs. So when you pick it up for a race, you have that cardio floor that can handle the longer higher tempo. \n\n\nYour tempo runs should be a mile warm up, then 1-3 miles of 90% race pace, then another mile cool down. \n\nThen you’re going to have just normal running days of 3-4 east miles. Think running while being able to talk to a running buddy next to you. Get a friend to go with you and just have a nice fun run through a park or somewhere scenic. \n\nAlso rest rest REST, and EAT!! If you want to get stronger, you need fuel in your body and sleep(zzzzzz) and rest(as in taking some off days and just stretching). Your muscles need fuel to grow and get stronger so you can sustain those miles and make gains. Nutrition is critical for half marathons, you will be so dead by the 10th mile and “bonk out” as they say. Your body just gives up. Your body is a high performance race car, those cars don’t run on fumes. Also you’re still growing into an adult at your age, don’t overdue it and injure yourself. Your body needs time to heal. \n\nI’ll close with this, you’re going to have good days and bad days. Enjoy the good days and push through the bad days and try your best. Success isn’t linear, just have to stick with it and not get too down on yourself if you miss a day here and there. Just pick up where you left off and think of the end goal. Life happens, just have to roll with it sometimes. Hopefully this helps and good luck on your running journey!!\n\nI completely agree with everyone saying you should slow down. I just want to add that when I feel like I want to stop running I always think about how it will feel afterwards if I do stop, and how good it will feel if I continued. I also think about how bad it will be for my goal if I make stopping a habit. Please note that I will stop directly if it feels lika an injury.\n\nYou are actually brilliant and you're trying to do what you see/think others are doing. No! \n\n\nRule #1 is to listen to your body. \n\n\nI'm 52 and at about 45 miles a week. I've raced a few half marathons (never a full yet, though training for December). I do a 14-16 mile long run ever other week. \n\n\nWhen I was your age, I thought walking was cheating. \n\n\nIt's not. Walking is good. When you walk after getting going, you know how you feel like it takes a good couple minutes before your body really fully relaxes (heart rate down, etc)? If you get going again, your body picks up where it left off. There's more details (if you go before your heart rate goes to normal, you'll be working your lung/moving capacity; if you wait longer that's different but save that for now). \n\n\nBasically, I've run long enough that I've had your thoughts and learned that there's better. And it's pretty much exactly what you're doing. \n\n\nFocus on your heart rate. Focus on what feels good about running. The smarter you are, the less you have to work real hard. If you're smart, less work equals great results. \n\n\nYou've got a great start. Keep it up and have fun!\n\nMany people say not to run to music, but it’s the only way I can dispel the voices in my head and enjoy my run. I look forward to the playlist and time to myself. They also say it takes 21 times doing something to make it a habit. Keep going.\n\nI give myself the internal drill sergeant -\n\nme: \"i should probably walk for a bit\"\nsarge: \"don't you dare\"\nme: \"but I'll start running again soon\"\nsarge: \"you have no reason to stop\"\nme: \"idk if I can make it\"\nsarge: \"if you stop you'll never know\"\nme: \"damn you, sarge\"\nsarge: \"let's fuckin gooooooo\"\n\nit definitely gets more salty than that but I put sarge away for the day already 🫡\n\nIf you think you are tired and just can't go on running, set mini goals.  As in, I just have to run to the next intersection.  Then once you get there, don't stop running but make a new mini goal.  Before you know it, you have run the whole thing.  Also, if you think a marathon is your goal, then you should change your mindset to running for distance rather than time.  Many a first time marathoner has run ten minute miles or slower.  Slow down and run further.  As for motivation, register for a 5k race.  After that register for a 10k.  Training for a race has always motivated me.  And finally, I personally have difficulty running distance without music.  It takes my mind off of the slog when I am singing along to my favorite tunes.\n\n&gt;Whenever I run, I always walk intermittently because I keep telling myself that I won’t be able to make it and that I might as well walk and I can’t help but to stop running and walk for a while because I feel tired, and then feel extremely guilty about it because I know that I could’ve ran the whole while.\n\nWhen I started running (I was about 22; good for you for starting young!), I had it in my head that it only \"counted\" when I could run without stopping. That was actually really motivating to me and carried me to my first half marathon.\n\nThat half marathon's course was an out-and-back. I'm plugging along, and well before I got to the turnaround point I saw an older dude who was already on his way back, miles ahead of me, and if memory serves he was outright stopped, eating a gel pack or something.\n\nIt was extremely funny to me. Made me realize: who cares about walking during a run?!? All that matters is the finish line, and how you want to get there.\n\nJust go out and run, no need to have outside validation, or a reason. Just run.\n\nMotivation? I struggled for years with motivation and trying to find it. It didn’t come. \n\nWhat fixed it for me was removing the need for motivation. Take the “i need to think about it” part out of it. \n\nYou just do it. You make a rule that you run, you run. There’s nothing wrong with the interval running but if you want to run the whole time, just run the whole time or until you can’t. \n\nLike everyone else, I recommend slowing down and maintaining a slower, manageable pace to help you do this. But whenever you find yourself wanting to stop… don’t.\n\nMy coach gave me a running log where I see how many miles I can get in a summer and it has motivated me a lot (130 miles so far, with two weeks off for vacation out of 7 total!) Stuff like that is great at moitvation.\n\nWhat??? 7.5 is fast. Not elite but very fast. I’ve been running for a year and my fastest mile is just under 9 minures.\n\nAs everyone has said, 7:30 is fast. I’m a youngish, in shape male who has been running for a few years (even did an ironman last fall) and my 10k race pace is about 7:15 lol. And to give you an idea, 80+% of my training is 9-10 min/mile pace. Shoot to run at a pace where you could hold a conversation with a friend.\n\nAnd speaking of that, if you have any other friends interested in running at all, running with a friend always makes runs easier for me. \n\nI also love listening to podcasts and audiobooks while I run. Or some chill music sometimes, although I tend to run faster to music 😅\n\nLastly, it’s totally okay if you need to do some walking. A lot of couch to 5k plans consist of running for a set amount of time then walking for a set amount of time. Tbh though, if you’re going at 7:30 now, I think if you slow down you’ll probably be able to do a few miles no problem.\n\nAs others have said, find your why. You'll also have to \"embrace the suck\" - the first mile or two is always \"the suck\", but once you can power through that, it gets better. I'm an old man (51) who didn't start running until I was in my late 30's but running is my time to zone out, get out of my own head and work on something that is both good for my body and my mind. I like to listen to podcasts (ironically running podcasts) while I run because I can get lost in the banter and not focus on my aching hamstring, or the fact that my lungs seem to hate me today etc. My partner even tells me when I'm cranky that I need to go run because I'm always in a better headspace afterwards. \n\nYou are LIGHTNING fast compared to most of us. You may find that slowing your pace helps too, especially if your goal is to become more of a distance runner. Build up your tolerance for the distance and focus less on your time.\n\nI've never regretted a run, but I have regretted the ones I skipped. Happy running!\n\nTons of comments already so I don't know if someone already said this, but here's my two bits: \n\nFirst, don't worry too much about whether you're doing it right, it sounds like right now you're feeling guilty about becoming tired after a couple of miles. Being tired is not some kind of moral failure, there is no reason to feel guilty about it. Besides, you just ran a couple miles further than someone who didn't even start, so why feel guilty instead of proud? You're doing great. Progress will come over time, consistency beats intensity, and rest is what makes you stronger. Exercising without resting is like working without picking up your paycheck, the rest is when you get the benefits. \n\nSecond, what really helped my training mindset is when I stopped thinking about the numbers, and focused instead on what my body could do. I went on some hikes in some very pretty places while traveling around, and it really shifted my perspective -- instead of trying to knock a couple seconds off my time or take a couple pounds off what it says on the scale, the point of it all is that someday when I'm in some far-off country, I'll be able to walk up the side of a mountain and see a spectacular view from the top. When I think about that, it's a little easier to put in the time on a boring treadmill or running the usual route.\n\nStart using the Nike Run Club app!! It’s free and the only thing that motivates me to keep running when I’m on my runs. It’s also what got me into running in the first place. I’ve tried countless plans to try to become a runner and this one has stuck. They have a half marathon training plan and it essentially maps out all the runs you need to do to get to race day. When you start your runs they have guided runs, where essentially a coach talks in your ear. You can play it with Spotify too. I think the guided runs help so much. The app has made me fall in love with running and I can run farther than ever before. Plus your pace will improve as you go.\n\nThere is no such thing.  Just get out the door and don’t stop.  The motivation comes after you’ve finished and you can be proud of yourself.\n\nEveryone is saying slow down - the best way to know what that means for a long distance run as you are getting into it, I’ve learned, is to be able to talk while you’re running. If that feels too slow, you should at least not be hearing yourself breathe very loudly. \n\nYou can absolutely ramp up to faster speeds as you gain stamina, but all my fastest 5ks started with slower mile 1.\n\nDon’t rely on motivation, for anything really. It’s nice when it happens, but it a fickle feeling. You still have to get things done in life even when you don’t feel “motivated” to do it.\n\nRely on discipline. You do things even when you don’t feel like doing them - and sometimes you will feel motivated which is a bonus. \n\nI am going to take my own advice today.’\n\nTLDR: build discipline, rely on discipline,  not motivation.\n\n7.5 minutes is a decent pace to start with, consistent is key for improving so keep it going my g!\n\nDespite running for decades, I didn't reach a point where I *wanted* to run until the pandemic.  I ran because the alternative was worse.\n\nSo what changed in the pandemic?  Chiefly that it stopped being a thing that I was doing specifically because I'd found that it helps settle my mind in a way that was more than worth the half hour of boundless rage three or four times a week.  With little to do and wanting some reason to do something - *anything* - beyond stay inside and play a video game or watch a show or whatever, I'd go and I'd run.  And because by then it was miserably hot and I was doing this at random times, I started running more slowly.  When I ran slower, I could run longer and, strangely, *further*.  What's more, I didn't accumulate nearly the aches and pains that had long been my companion when running.  So I could run longer, further, *and* more often and slowly it turned from something I did because I *had* to into something I was doing because I wanted to.  I've got a run this evening that I'm looking forward to and it's not even 9am.  A short one - only two miles.  That I can type that without irony is a radical change from who I was when I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/lr35d1/one_and_done_marathoners_how_come/gojswma/).\n\nI still do runs where I go fast, but they aren't my every day run.  Most weeks I've got 2 or 3 days where my run is, if not fun, pleasant and meditative.  Sure, I'm plodding along at a slow pace, but I'll still cover 3 or 4 miles and feel better when I'm done than when I started.\n\nWith it being such a simple solution, why did I start running in a way that I'd hate for decades?  That was literally how I was taught to run.  Every sport that had running as a part of it, the military, all of it said that running is suffering and if you aren't miserable you aren't doing it right.  Turns out a lot of people in my youth were really, *really* stupid.\n\nNot every run has to be you pushing yourself to go further and faster than last time or otherwise leave you utterly spent.\n\nDo you enjoy running? If not, why are you running? There are lots of different ways to move your body and you should do one you enjoy. Also, I would be remiss not to mention making sure you're eating enough to a teen girl who is starting a new exercise activity. Please make sure you're eating enough carbs, fat, and protein -- it won't just give you energy right now, it'll make your bones stronger for the rest of your life. \n\nWe'll both probably be downvoted for suggesting/asking this on a running subreddit. But OP, do you enjoy running? It's ok not to like it, even if you're naturally good at it.\n\n\nIf you do enjoy it, you have some great advice in this thread. Otherwise, you're young and there are 100 other sports you can choose if you just want something to stay active.\n\nI have to agree with the others…you’re running at a fast pace and you’ll burn out quickly if you continue. Take days off and run slower…actually enjoy your run and build stamina. And when you’re tired and thinking of walking just think to yourself…an object in motion stays in motion…that’s how I finish my runs when I feel like walking to finish.\n\nWell besides what everyone else has said, you don’t need to run full out each run. Try letting your mind float. What I mean is, when ever I run, if I stay focused on what I am doing, my time, my pace etc. Quite honestly I get kind of bored and it feels exhausting and I often feel like stopping. Don’t get me wrong, I have those days were I am “training” and pushing. But 90 % of my weekly runs are just for movement and enjoyment. If I just get into a more meditative state, just disconnect my brain from exactly what my body is doing, I find that I work through a lot of my “problems” in life and I find resolution to things I didn’t realize needed resolving and it’s easier to let go of things. I haven’t been able to run for over a year now due to injuries and it’s taken this long break to make me realize that I completely depended on it for my stress release my entire life.  Put on some good tunes, and just find your happy pace. Good luck ♥️\n\nStop caring if you're motivated or not.  If you want to be a runner, you just have to get out there and run.  Also, if you don't want to be a runner and want to do something else, that's fine too.  Just be disciplined about it.\n\nI went from hating running for almost my whole life to running a marathon recently. One thing that made me hate running was my misconception that anytime I ran, I had to run fast and until I felt sick. Once I started learning about basebuilding/Zone 2, etc, I got a lot more comfortable with running slowly, and yes, in the beginning I was probably walking half the time to stay in a low heart rate. I'm talking about something like 13 min/mile pace.\n\nSteal someone's phone.\n\n          Face the facts, your actual performance is great and you can be better.         Try to meditate before running, and then put some audio or music that says stuff like: \"Keep running, you piece of sh*t!!!\"              Probably you can skip the insults HAHAHAHAHA. I need to motivate myself while running, when I feel tired my mind wants me to stop as well, sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.         If you still go to run the next day, you are doing great, if you stop completely, then your mindset won, but just a battle you can always go back and run again.    \n\nRome wasn't built overnight, you know everything that is great takes time.   \n  \n7.5m is a good pace, you should be proud of yourself because you are putting yourself into the arena of life and doing something uncomfortable that will help you build an unstoppable mindset. \n\nLife is about building step by step, it took me a month of running 10k daily to notice an improvement in my speed,  the emotional reward that you get from the progress is one of the most fulfilling.  \n\nIt's good to run a quarter of a mile and walk the other quarter  etc...\n\nComparaison is a thief of joy  \n  \nYou know I started running when I was 29y. My first Marathon I ran it in the worst shape of my life with body fat of 26%, without training for it or even eating clean, Heck I haven't worked out for 3 months prior to the marathon and mentally I was at rock bottom. I finished that Marathon by walking and running I hit the wall at 20 kms and I had 22.2kms to go and not giving up was one of the best decisions I have made. \n\nGive yourself credit for the effort you're putting into the craft ( YOU). \n\nKeep going, your future self will thank you for it.\n\nSlow down! Just because you can run 7:30 pace doesn’t mean you should do that for the whole time or on every run - especially if you want to run a half. Try running at a slower pace first the first 2.5 miles, then pick up the speed for that last 0.5\n\nYour performance is amazing for a beginner and as others have pointed out you are probably pushing yourself too hard and that's why it feels like you're failing. The trick is to build up your performance slowly. Push too hard and you'll injure yourself and destroy your morale in the process.\n\nDon't worry about pace (at first), just try to get to the end of the run in reasonable comfort. \n\nIt's healthy for a beginner to mix walking and running. It gets your body used to the idea, and brisk walking is still pretty good exercise. After a few weeks you'll find you can run all the way.\n\nRest is important too - don't run every day (not as a beginner anyway). Alternate days might be about right. And try to eat reasonably well. \n\nOnce you can consistently run about 3 miles a few times a week, start looking around for half-marathon training plans. It'll be a mix of long runs, short runs and rest days. \n\nRemember you have to spend a while being bad at something to get good at it. Be kind to yourself and forgive yourself the bad days. It's part of the process.\n\nTLDR: slow down, improvement will come if you persevere.\n\nYou can also try interval/speed play/fartlek training. Once you get to doing 2-3 miles of these types of runs, then slowly increase your long runs 2 miles one day, 4 miles two days later, 1 mile interval run two days later… just keep increasing your long run each week. I went from running a mile stretch to 13 mile stretch over 6 months or so.\n\nLots of stuff here about timings and speed that’s worth focusing on, but have you thought about the route you choose? I lose interest if I’m not running through nice scenery so I’ve got a few nice quiet routes I like to rotate\n\nFollow a half marathon training plan. That's the only motivation I could find when I trained for mine. Now I'm not following a plan and I feel little to no motivation to run.\n\n7.5 min/mile is incredibly fast.  I have run probably 20 half marathons and 4 fulls.  Run slower, run more.  You have to build up your pace and your distance, it doesn’t happen over night.  \n\nAs someone who is now 54 and has been running a lot since age 40, take it easy.  Don’t burn yourself out and don’t put so much pressure on yourself.  I use the Galloway method when I run.  I run 3 min and walk 1 minute.  This has changed my running for the better.  A lot less injuries and no random stops for a run break that might last 3 min if I don’t pay attention.  And my time has not gone up, it has gone down,  That is how I PR’ed my 2nd marathon.  I still had strong legs at mile 21 and beyond.\n\nSlow down! My 10k pace is &lt;7:20, my half-marathon pace is 7:25, and my 5k pace is 6:45. You know how fast I run every day? Slower than 8:20s, and that's still on the faster end for a chill everyday pace. \n\nYou can't race every day!\n\nMusic was the trick for me.  Find songs around 180bpm if you are already at 8mph.  Keeps you running to the beat and it will feel more awkward to slow to a walk.\n\nYou’ll maybe never feel motivated. Fuck feelings. Just go do it, and it’ll come. There is no secret 🙌🏻\n\nYour time is good. Keep your pace steady and manageable. If you feel tired slow down but don’t walk. Everything’s in the rhythm, create one with your breath and focus on it. If you feel like quitting, focus on your breath.\n\nRun slower\n\nI agree with all the comments above- slow down!!! Your heart rate should not be elevated to its maximum every time you run, it way too hard on your body if you are running every day.\n\nJust like anything we do as humans, you have to find your ‘why’.\nWhy do you want to run? \nSometimes doing things just because we know they’re ‘good for us’, isn’t enough to get us out the door consistently.\nMaybe you could try running with a group, then you also are getting social connection during your runs.\nMaybe you want to test your limits.\nMaybe running helps clear your mind and makes you a happier person for yourself and those around you. \n\nIn my experience, there are usual multiple ‘whys’ I need before I can find the initial motivation and consequential discipline to do so something consistently. \n\nKeep up the good work though, your 90% there just by wanting to lace up your shoes :)\n\nI mean, if you're new to running, run/walk is actually a pretty good strategy to use. It'll help your body prepare to run more regularly. 7.5 minute miles is really fast, you might be burning yourself up.\n\nfall in love with discipline , not the motivation.\n\nYou should get the 10K app. It’s free and it helps me by telling me when to run/walk.\n\nAs with everything in life that's lots of fun: \n1)\nRun only as much and as hard so that you will want to run again tomorrow.\n\n2)\nWhen I run a really hard 5K race I will be frightened of racing for two or three weeks. (Really hard means Legs burning lungs exploding and still 500m to go to the finish line...)\n\nYou are racing every run. \n\n3)\nGet a coach. Join a running team. Running with ppl motivates.\n\nAs others have said, slow down a little bit. I race a half marathon at around 6:25min/mile pace. My run this morning? 5 miles at 9min/mile.\n\n“I’m a 15F who just started running.”\n\nWelcome to the world of running…\n\nRunning is about the slow grind and journey. Motivation is so important, and for many of us, that’s knowing there is no end destination with running - we run for the joy and feeling we get from it.\n\n7:30 is a good pace. Running a half marathon, I believe, is absolutely achievable for everyone! Slow down, don’t rush your body. It will take time to build the muscle, build up your lungs, and get accustomed to taking on more mileage.\n\nYou’re not going to trick your body into more endurance and strength by running fast for miles at a time. There are no shortcuts. \n\nIt’s the slow grind. It’s what makes running truly gratifying. You have to put in the miles, the early mornings, and late nights. You have to put in the work to see the results.\n\nSlow down.  Make a schedule like one day is an easy day then another day could be a speed day and another day could be a long run day.\n\nSlow down and you’ll be able to complete the runs no worries. Easy runs should be most of your runs. You may just be running at more of a race tempo than a training tempo. \n\nRunning with people is very motivating as well. If you join XC or a run club running with people is way more fun.\n\nRun-walk is really pleasant. Enjoy the run, you are putting way too much pressure on yourself to be perfect at something you just started; and if you don’t enjoy it, you will experience burnout. Maybe it would be helpful to stop looking at your pace while you build endurance. Also 7.5 is fast so if your goal is not to walk, slow down.\n\nDiscipline&gt;Motivation\n\n7:30 pace is fast to me\n\nI did my first half marathon distance in February of this year and have done 4 more since then around 10:15 to 10:30 mile pace.\n\nI started enjoying running a whole lot more when I mentally acknowledged that shooting for the same or better level of performance day in &amp; day out was not a realistic expectation and that going slower was perfectly fine.\n\nBut, I just run for fitness and recreation.  The only person I'm competing against is myself.  I rarely try to run for PRs because to me, it becomes more of a competitive activity which leads to disappointment &amp; frustration.\n\nSo that's my current mindset, but people have different levels of fitness and goals &amp; objectives.\n\nIf your current goal is to run a half marathon, then I'd recommend slower down your pace while increasing your target distance for some runs.  You might be surprised at how less fatigued you feel doing a longer distance + slower pace compared to your typical 3 mile runs.\n\nZombies run. You get chased by zombies. Best motivation!\n\nYou're probably running too fast. Since your mile time is already in that fast, you should do more zone 2 running to build endurance. You definitely won't be tired from that, but then it might be a bit boring. What I do is just turn on a show on my phone if I'm on the treadmill and just do a slow easy zone 2 run for 45min to an hr, or do the same outdoors but with a podcast.\n\nYou’re running too fast and maybe too far at this point in your journey.  Go slow, very slow and everything else will come.  The speed, the endurance, the mental strength.  All that will come.  \n\nGive yourself a chance to build into the runner you want to be.  Thinking you’re there from day one while watching your body fail will only hurt you and  discourage your efforts.\n\nYou young whippersnappers and your snide “7:30/mi pace is slow” comments!! Just kidding. \n\nMy guess is it’s not your mindset that is the problem, you’re just putting in max effort every run. Look up 80/20 running and start trying to run most of your training miles at 9:00-10:00/mi pace and I bet you’ll find you can run much faster.\n\nI’ll say start with 9:30 pace to start tbh … I’ve ran track/cross 7:30 at my prime in high school. Start easy training tbh with your time rather than the miles\n\nI could barely run 2 minutes 2 years ago. Now I can run 15 minutes to 1 hour.\n\nAre you running cross country and track with your schools team? Having an organized group to run with will help a lot.\n\nI’d also say at 7:30 pace just starting out, you have a TON of potential! Get some coaching if you want to become a better runner. Running that fast with no training is seriously impressive.\n\nFor me I wrote it all out on my schedule a month in advance and I treat it as an appointment.  If the weather is bad I have access to a treadmill.  I do it every time and i circle it after and it feels great.  I just lay down the mileage I have planned for myself whether I walk or run.  The speed will increase on its own because I’m not on the couch.\n\n7:30 is super fast. You’re training super hard and not recovering so you’re gonna get burned out. Take slow runs on most days like 9-11 minute range and go fast on fast days. \nIf you can run 7:30/ mi for 3 miles you should join your cross country team. You would absolutely crush it.\n\nYour speed is fine. Do it early right when you wake up and don’t think about it. Tell yourself while running that you love running and all the things you love about it. Don’t say or think negative about running. Read books about inspiring runners.\n\nSlow down to at least 8:00 or 8:30/mile and run for longer distances. More time on your feet is worth more than pace, especially when starting out.\n\nLearn to be consistent/motivated/disciplined/engaged before introducing any kind of metric or tracking. Ie. no clocks, no distances, no personal records, no counting of any sort. They are just distractions. That worked for me.\n\nKeep it up! Join your high school track/cross country team. This sport will help you succeed and build character. Might be your ticket to college!\n\nDon’t worry so much about speed. Run at a pace that feels comfortable and enjoyable. Find a place you love to run at. Bring some music with a good playlist. Running doesn’t need to kick your ass. If you don’t run as far as you planned, so what. You still gained fitness to run further and faster in the future. Find ways to make your runs more enjoyable, not faster:)\n\nI think it's important to run slow before you run fast. Figure out how to move your body correctly (good positioning, good breathing, etc.). Try to keep the mindset of going the distance and not all-out fast. Once you start being able to go farther, practice those distances with increased speed!\n\nThere are going to be days when running feels impossible. Just pat yourself on your back that you were able to put on your trainers and get out there. Pushing through the hard bits is what builds your strength physically and mentally. Running is waaaaay more a mental game than a physical one. \n\nP.S. If there are times you want to stop and look at some pretty birds or a nice view, don't worry about pausing your workout. If you need to walk for a second, do. Then keep pushing on.\n\nFirst make it fun for yourself by setting reachable goals and slowing down a bit.\n\nYou have a great potential and you are young! Keep running fun and gives yourself some small challenges on short distances (200m, 400m, 800m, 1K).\n\n7-Min was my absolute fastest when I was in basic training and in way better shape than I am now. I’d say you’re doing incredibly for a 7:30 mile. As for getting in the right mindset,is there really a right one? I’ve ran better when I had things I was thinking about or I was sad/angry,but that could just be me. I’d be absolutely proud for getting your times!!! Keep up the good work ❤️❤️❤️\n\nDepression comes back if I stop running.\n\nHi dude. I ran when I was in highschool, eventually got sick of it and didn't excercise much in college. It comes back to bite. I've been running now the last few years and I think the key is just getting out there.\nDef slow it down though for 80% of your runs. I run a sub 17 5k and most of my runs are slower pace then yours\n\nCheck out r/xxrunning too!\n\nHere are my tips:\n\nRun slowly, slower than you think you should. Like 9 or  10-minute miles, or even slower if conditions are bad. Just picture floating along on a cloud. You can run 7 minute miles if you are sprinting for short distances.\n\nDon't increase mileage more than a tenth per week. If you get too excited then you can injure yourself.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with taking walking breaks, I have been running long distance for years and I usually take at least one water break and one pee break per run. \n\nRunning should be enjoyable, not torturous, as much as possible. Have fun!\n\nI’d recommend just finding a pace that you can hold for the entire 3 miles without stopping, and then slowly upping your pace and mileage over time\n\nJust run anyways, keep the half marathon thing in your mind and once you do it try for full marathon\n\nYour lack of motivation may stem from your impatience. You want to run a half marathon in the near future. That takes time to train for so you don't risk injury. The fact that you can run a mile that fast is already a real nice head start for hitting that goal sooner. I just started training earlier this week for a half marathon race in Las Vegas that takes place towards the end of February. I've gone to the gym twice a day for an hour or less each session. My motivation to actually keep this up:  \"Everything I'm doing now is better than what I was doing before (which was nothing).\" I haven't gone to the gym at all this year or last year because I lacked motivation, yet I still wanted a beach body. I dont get it if i dont work for it. So the fact I've kept this going for almost a week, I know I can do it. I can't be cranky when I get sore or impatient wanting a more fit body when I'm still pudgy because THAT will destroy motivation. Give yourself some credit. Doing something is better than nothing at all. It just takes time. 🙂\n\nBeen running 20 years on and off, I wish I could keep a 7.5 minute pace\n\nLonger, slower runs. Practice being ok ‘wanting’ to stop, but KNOWING you can go a little longer. Running is as much mental training as anything. Be gentle on yourself. Let yourself walk, as long as it means you’ll run again. Better to do that than to burn out or beat yourself up so that running is more miserable.\n\nYou need discipline…even the best of the best don’t always feel “motivated” to run.\n\nJust going to leave this here as an aside worth to keep in mind when pushing for better results. If something starts hurting mid run, stop. Take a rest day, take a few steps back on intensity and distance and never run on an injury.\n\nAs for the mindset, try to find peace in slower and shorter distances and increase incrementally and gradually. Rome wasn't built in a day, and right now it sounds like you're building quite fast.\n\nAs someone who pushed themselves way too hard when I was 15-16 and managed to severely injure one of my knees I can say that any score you are trying to beat is not worth that. 24 now, still can't run longer than 3k without the injury creeping back.\n\nI feel like you can start slow.  Follow a program like c25k,  you don’t have to run everyday to get good at running at least as a hobby.  Do it as something u do a couple times per week,  a running session that lasts even 20 minutes is good for a beginner.  Slowly you will just run without the need for motivation.  I head to the gym to workout 6 times a week,  most days I’m not even motivated,  it’s just something I enjoy doing.  So start slow,  you don’t have to push yourself super hard each espion,  then slowly you will enjoy the runs.\n\nDistance, not speed. Your speed will increase later when you can run longer and longer.\n\nRely on discipline, not motivation. Motivation will eventually fade.\n\nWish I could run 7.5 minute miles. Slow down and enjoy it. Concentrate on good technique and not on speed and remind yourself to smile.\n\nSo, take this advice from someone who was in your shoes. I was 15 when I started running and had exactly this issue. I ended up injuring myself at 23 because of jt and it took that devastating blow to make me back up and learn how to run for fun. Strength train. Develop a program and stick to it. Not only will you get faster, you’ll actually run less, enjoy running, and you won’t get injured because you’re training properly. There is no advantage in you learning to hate the sport. That relationship can take years to heal, but you’re still at the point where you can stop it now! You have so many great free tools on the internet to use that I did not have when I was 15. Find some runners that you look up to and tap into their routines— don’t mimic them, but use it as inspiration! You would be surprised how much less is more. Best of luck.\n\nHi. 7:30 is very fast. You have a lot of negative self talk going on. Would you every say any of these things to a friend? Also, running is hard! Give yourself some grace, every run is just practice. At 15, are you in high school? Is there a cross country or track team you can join? It sounds like you could benefit from some formal coaching, as there is a technique to running that you wouldn't just inherently know. I've been running for years and it's still hard, but I love it. You'll get better, hang in there.\n\ni found that once you actually get the stamina to run a decent pace for a prolonged time it can be kinda addicting also some nice hook in ear headphones with nice punchy musik is great in my opinion :)\n\nDavid Goggins. 🫡\n\nHere's some tip: run 2min, followed by a 2 min walk. do this 8 times.\n\n\nRun 3x a week.\n\n\nThe next week run 3 min, followed by a 2 min run. do this 7 times.\n\n\nThe following week run 4 min, followed by a 2 min run. do this 6 times.\n\n\nAnd so on until you can run for 30 min straight.\n\nI cam barely do 8miles/min and I've been running 10ks for years. Like others have said, slow down and enjoy it. If you can do that pace for 3 miles you can definitely do a 5, 8, 10k a bit slower\n\nRun at a pace to get you to the 3 mile mark. That might mean a 9 -11 min pace. You’ll feel accomplished then when you’re ready you can work on speed. 7.5 is fast for most seasoned runners and way too fast for beginner runners trying to run a 5k.  But you can get there through proper training.\n\nOkay a lot of great advice, I agree maybe cut down the mileage to get confident in your ability to run, since it seems that you doubt yourself at times. Show yourself that you can run a mile nonstop, then two miles, then three. I also heard this bit of advice from Bert Kreischer so take it with a grain of salt but he said “when you feel like you have nothing left in you, you really have like 40% left” and whenever I’m gassed in a run and want to walk, I just tell myself that, that im not at the bottom of my tank yet, and I have yet to walk on a run because of that.\n\nIncorporate days in between your running for rest-recovery and strength training and stretching…\n\nAnd as a 15 year old, be sure you’re resting at night.  If you’re not getting enough rest then your body won’t fully recover and your mind set and motivation will suffer.\n\nLike many people mentioned, 7:30/mile is fast. Be proud of yourself for being able to run that fast! \nIt takes many years to be a good runner and actually enjoy it. I would recommend mixing things up by doing short/long runs and fast/slow runs. Short being 2 miles and long being 5+. Slow runs would be 9-10/mile. The key is to stay consistent and don’t worry about your time too much during training. You will always be able to run faster during an actual race. \nKeep at it and maybe sign up for a few 5k races to get used to running race days! Good luck!\n\nHey, I think what makes running the most fun for me is ditching the running watch or not starting the app if I keep it with me for safety. Checking my pace or distance makes the run drag on for me or gives me that I'm tired feeling seeing how far I've yet to go.\n\nJust pick a route and get out there. Run whatever pace feels good. Be present and enjoy the run.\n\nMake shorter goals and work your way up. Start running 1 mile without stopping. After you master that you can start to add more distance. To run faster the things that helped me were 60 sec sprint and 120 sec walk,  as well as hill sprints.\n\nStop the negative self talk. If you need to take a walk, that's totally fine, but try to change your mental background noise to \"I'm strong and awesome\", some runs are hard, some are not, but if you change your mental tune to \"I'm strong\" you'll soon do things you couldn't image (and this goes for more things in your life). Take a walk because you need it, not because you convinced yourself you need it.\n\n  \nMany others have said but I'll join too 7.5 min/mile is awesome! There's always someone faster, but there are plenty slower people than you! But above all, you're running and that's even better than everyone who isn't!\n\nYour pace is fine. Do what I did a few years ago. Just go slow 4-5 times a week. Like 10 mins per mile. Go a bit further, like 5-6 miles per time out. Doing more miles will improve your overall pace and stamina. I got way better by going slower for longer. Was able to marathon after only running 4 miles fast my whole running career prior to slowing down. Just enjoy your time out there.\n\nGet a Garmin or similar watch, look up zone 2 training and interval training etc. Join the cross country team ☺️\n\nI agree with comments saying to slow it down a bit- also would recommend the Nike Run Club app for guided runs if you’re into that. Helps add variety, motivation to stay committed to a run, guidance about pacing, entertainment and inspiration, everything.\n\nSomeone once told me that if you can do 3, you can do five. This, for me, has been true. The first three miles I hate every second, but then after that, it's easier to keep going. I always run outside and I think that helps too. I'm also a super slow runner-- I might kick it up a notch high-intensity style, but that's for maybe 30 seconds and then I'm back to a measured pace. For reference, I'm 40 and just started running 4 years ago. I hated it until I got addicted, in a way. \n\nGo little by little. Find a friend, maybe, who also wants to run. Even if you don't run together, having an app where you can see each others mileage can be nice-- you can both cheer each other on while also feeling a little bit of healthy competitiveness-- more with yourself!\n\nIt's all in the mind. The trick is you gotta do exercises, in this case, running, more fun and enjoyable. It can be something as simple as not timing yourself. Or it can be something as simple as taking it easy and running at a slower pace. Exercise to destress, not to stress out.\n\nTry slow jogging for few days. If you don't know the difference between running and jogging find out. I enjoy jogging more so I find myself doing it just to feel better\n\nI am 72 and have run 25 marathons and several lesser races since beginning to run in my late 30s. Just ran a 1/2 marathon and was ok with a pace that's slipped to 12 minute miles.  It's funny because I can still remember my first 1 mile run that seemed to go on FOREVER. Wasn't long, and I ran a sub 7 minute 5 miler. The best marathon was 3 hours 20 minutes.  By the way, I'm 6'3\" and 220 lbs.\n\nAlways set reasonable expectations.  For example, train for a 5k. Then a 10k.....  Always run within your abilities.  It's OK to walk/run, too.  Spend money on good shoes.\n\nI would it helpful to join a group of similar runners in terms of pace and goals and remember to have fun!  One problem beginning runners have is running beyond their fitness level.  You should maintain a pace that's comfortable to you and  allows you to breathe and talk.  It improves with time.\n\nGood luck!!  Running became a way of life for me and has allowed me to defeat some heart issues I had in my 30s.\n\n1) just start, that's the hardest hurdle when you're unmotivated\n2) get an interval timer app. When I'm starting back up from an injury illness, I'll use this to make sure I'm running most of the time but also pacing so I don't die. I'm currently 5 min run / 20 second walk. I increase as the weather cools/if I'm doing easier than normal course/once I've got more aerobic endurance (a few weeks)\n3) keep it up!\n4) carbs/hydration (esp in the summer). If your muscles are screamin later in your run you have depleted your gycogyn stores and need some sugars. You can use the fancy gels - I just carry cheap jelly beans etc\n\nWish I could run at that pace...\n\n7 30 is impressive I couldn’t imagine running that fast in my lifetime I’m younger then you by a couple years and I’m running 14 min miles also if you feel exhausted like your gonna die take a break it’s okay it’s better to take a break then start falling apart age 20 plus i would recommend resting for a day or\n\nSet out with the goal of doing a run/walk mix that you are capable of. Such as 10x 90 seconds run then 30 seconds walk. Then progress this so something slightly more challenging like 2 minutes run 20 seconds walk x10. \n\nRunning is about discipline. Best of luck\n\nTry a mixed pace run. Start 5 minutes easy (9 min pace). 5 min at 8:30 pace. Then 5 min at 7:30 (keep adding minutes to this section as you feel stronger so maybe it ends up 10min at 7:30 pace after a few weeks). Then 5 easy at the end (9 to 10 min pace). Also make sure you have recovery runs where you don’t worry about pace at all 2 to 3 days a week. Running can be so rewarding if you are patient!  Good Luck.\n\n7:30 fast as a mf\n\nThe early goal for new runners is keep trying to finish a distance and not worry about time and speed as much until you’ve trained to finish a distance! Eventually you will get stronger and working on speed will be much smaller task to add!\n\nLighten up a little. Walk if you want. 7.5 min/mile is too fast to run consistently if you’re just starting. Aim for 10 min/mile, see how far you feel comfortable going, then go from there. Maybe join a running club. Get some good music to listen to and good clothes/shoes. That’ll help psych you up! Running is a great habit to get into as a young person — it’ll do great things for you your whole life. 👍💪🏃🏼‍♀️\n\nFor distance running you need to slow down so you can get through the miles. Try your next run at a 9:00 pace and no walking. Your gait may feel strange if you are used to a 7:30, but it will be worth it in the long term.\n\nWell darn, I DID feel good about my 38:52 5k PR 🤣\n\nI consulted this sub for advice on this a little bit ago, and I saw everyone saying I should just run slower. I thought, \"So silly! That will never work!\" Then I tried it, and it's the best choice I have ever made for running. When my heart rate starts getting uncomfortably high, I just slow my pace down. Sometimes you have to slow your pace down *a lot,* like I have gone to 11:00 before 😳. But, it's not walking. What you'll find is that the amount of distance you can do increases a lot, and running becomes kinda fun and chill because your heart isn't about to explode. It really starts to show its benefits like 3 weeks in, as my pace has started to get a lot faster, but with the increased distance and better comfort. Trust me, you'll feel really dumb at the start, but it does work\n\nI've been obese or worse as long as I can remember. For me it's spite, against myself all those times I was certain that I couldn't do it. Certain that I'm too fat, too lazy and too poorly prepared. But I make more evidence against that old idea of myself everyday. Also telling myself I'm allowed to die after I get to the finish line lol"

    "body": "First off, I want to say that I ask this question with genuine curiosity and absolutely no hate.\n\nRecently, in the UK I’ve noticed online ads for a lot of women-only run clubs and events which got me wondering - what is the need for gender exclusive run clubs? Do women often have bad experiences at mixed clubs?\n\nI ask this question with the hopes of being educated.",

    "all_comment_text": "I’m in a running club with almost entirely men and I’m always the slowest one and get left behind pretty frequently. Everyone else gets to experience running with their friends and I have to run alone and wait til the end to socialize. \n\nI am working on getting faster but I don’t have this problem when I run with mostly women. The average speed just tends to be a bit slower and it vastly changes the experience.\n\n+1 for this.  \n  \nOne of the three weekly run clubs I go to is either 7-8min/mi guys, or walkers. The group of us 10:30min/mi runners is...well, it's just me. The one time I tried to keep up with the guys, I wore myself out and couldn't do it for longer than half a mile. I'm just not that fast, and I honestly am not trying to be. I'm just here to enjoy the run! So I do most runs alone at that run club, and say hi to the ladies walking their dogs/strollers when I lap them.\n\nBUT the other two clubs I go to are a mix of 1) couples where the women are similarly paced and run together, and 2) older folks, where I can hang a little bit more. (Although some of the oldies are BQ'ers for their age class, which is still faster than me.) Those two clubs are more pleasant and less competitive.\n\nI feel this in my soul as a dude who jogs a 10:30. I don't run, I jog.\n\nI've joined some of those gazelle groups who do run the 7 min miles and f that.\n\nr/TurtleRunners unite! We get to enjoy the scenery the longest. :)\n\nexactly!! most men in the running hobby are fine and enjoyable to be around!! men are just different runners, usually much much faster than even a very well trained woman. It's just a huge biological difference, and women have to train in a way that is best for our bodies :)\n\nFine to be around, but you can't be around them 😂.\n\nSorry you have to experience this, any decent running club should have a variety of different pace groups so no one gets left behind- in my experience this isn’t the norm!\n\nAll running clubs in my area *claim* that they have variety of paces, but in reality, the slowest pace they tolerate is a good 3+ mins/mi faster than my tempo pace. Plus they have the nerve to call it “a nice easy pace”.\n\nI signed up for an \"all paces welcome!\" speed training course. They aren't kicking me out or anything, but I certainly don't feel welcome when the \"easy\" group warm-up pace is faster than my race goal pace.\n\nThis isn’t running related but \nI joined a cardio tennis class (rec league by my city)  and was KICKED OUT until I got lessons. \nNeedless to say- I am no longer branching out of running clubs\n\nThat one makes sense though, if you don't have basic tennis skills the other person can't even play, running everyone can still run regardless of other people's skill levels\n\n[deleted]\n\nAtrocious I guess \nBut my cardio fitness was top notch!\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’ll stick to running where all I have to do is put one foot in front of the other lol!\n\nTotally fair decision, but gotta say it also isn't quite fair the the tennis group to seemingly imply they unkindly ran you out just cause you didn't know how to play the game you signed up for. \n\nAssuming that's what you meant.\n\nBut if the goal of the club was getting cardio through tennis, if you weren't good enough to even keep the match moving against opponents at a relaxed non-try hard level...it kind of defeats the purpose for the other guy. Not getting much cardio if they are constantly waiting for you to chase down the ball (assuming they are scoring way more) and setting up for serves, which maybe you were also faulting on a bunch.\n\nSucks, but doesn't sound entirely unreasonable to me.\n\nI (45F) tried a “no drop run” for all with trail runners a few years ago and could not keep up. I wasn’t a stranger to trail running, and had been running since 2020 but damn. When they would stop to wait for me I felt like they were kind of annoyed with that after a while. At the end of it they did a group photo for the FB page before I caught up which I didn’t see until I was on FB later that night - geeze Louise. Attempts with socializing with anyone fell flat anyways, save for one nice kid who ran with me for a few miles, and I’ve had no desire to subject myself to that again.\n\nYeah, every run club in my city says all paces welcome, but my club is the only one where it’s actually true. Tons of runners in the 10-14 min/mile pace range. Ironically our club also has the most ultra runners, I think because those of us who run ultras are always super tired from running so much but still want to hang out. Party pace!\n\nWhat's your pace? Mine accommodates to around 7:00/km, and I know other clubs in the city do as well or slower. Some are run or walk.\n\nMy easy pace is around 12-13 min mile, so around 7.5-8/km.\n\nThat’s just wrong.  The standard is that no one gets left behind. Faster runners simply are expected to slow down to whatever pace is necessary, whether they themselves get in a good workout or not.  Thems the rules.\n\nI don't think it's anything malicious on the part of the running club. But to have a full range of speeds you need to have enough runners. I had a great running group where I used to live that truly had ALL paces all the way from walkers to fast runners. But the group also had 50+ runners so there were enough people for each pace. The running club I joined in my new city, had 7 runners so much less variety in pace.\n\nI feel like all clubs try to have a wide variety of paces, but in the end the people who look for run clubs tend to be faster and you just need so many people to make it work for all the paces. I’m a slower runner and my club has been great and there’s several people who have slowed down to run with me, but people have goals and workouts to finish so it doesn’t happen every week. It works for me, but I am holding out for and try to look for people who are closer my pace.\n\ni agree. every running group that i’m a part of in my city has every pace from walking to running.\n\nKeep in mind we don't all live in big population areas. And the more sub-urban or rural you get, the less representation you're going to get from the slower pace groups.\n\nThis is two fold. The majority of people interested in running clubs are obviously going to me the more dedicated, trained runners. Nature of the beast, just how it is. So they are always going to be more represented. But the less people you get, the more problematic this becomes, as the extremes (pretty fast or pretty slow) get less and less represented, and then that makes the clubs less and less club like for those runners on the fringe and less attractive...so some of them will become uninterested and stop coming, making the problem worse etc.\n\nI’m in one that does have a good mix of men/women, fast as you want and slowest is walking. About 120 people, I suppose it depends so much on the city it’s in and people that join.\n\nOpposite for me in my run club. Yeah we have fast guys too, but the women smoke me every workout.\n\nYeah, this is the answer.\n\nEvery running club is different, I don’t think it has anything to do with gender. If they’re too fast then maybe try another running group. I used to go to a running club that was all men and I was always the slowest by a mile. Now I go to one that is like 70/30 men/women and places are pretty evenly mixed\n\nYes and because they may have a different format like they’ll talk about women/specific race/running experiences and education. But yes I know many women, myself included, have had negative experiences with run clubs. Not that you can ever entirely prevent that, but yeah. \n\nA running coach a while back said “women are not just tiny men” but have different needs, different experiences, and often different goals.\n\nI love the \"women are not just tiny men\" mantra, because it's so true.\n\nPhysiologically, women have very different needs throughout the month, whereas men's needs are pretty consistent day to day. Until recently, nutrition and training plans were built by men for men, so they didn't take into account menstrual cycles or their effect on hydration, iron absorption, electrolyte absorption, susceptibility to overheating, inflammation tolerance, and recovery needs. All of these things are noticeably affected by hormonal shifts.\n\nWhen I started mapping my training against my menstrual cycle, it became extremely clear why some runs felt good and others felt like trash. When I then started building my nutrition around that data, it became even more obvious that my body was needing certain things at different times of the month to be successful.\n\nWomen's only groups can and should be the place where these physiological differences are discussed, analyzed, and even celebrated!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis may be dumb but where they worse when on your period or some other part of your cycle? I’ve heard you run better when menstruating. I personally had a rough time while ovulating recently.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYep, this is because the week before your period is the luteal phase, when your estrogen and progesterone are at their highest. This means you can't access stored carbs as easily, you're more prone to low blood sugar, your body is retaining more water, and your body temp is running warmer. All of these things make luteal phrase runs feel sluggish.\n\nThe bright side is estrogen and progesterone nosedive when you start your period, so the week of your period and the week after (leading up to ovulation) are the best two weeks for training!\n\n[deleted]\n\nAhhh yep, diabetes adds a whole layer of complication to the cycle. I hope you've found what works for you and your body!\n\nI recommend FitrWoman to my female athlete patients. It’s an excellent menstrual tracker that gives great nutrition and training advice based on the time of cycle.\n\nI'm a cis man chiming in, so I don't have any experiences with menstruation or any of the like, but I want to note that these things need to be discussed in mixed gender settings, too. It's obviously going to take women because, for example, as a man I'm never going to be able to personally experience the physiological changes that happen with a menstrual cycle, but I absolutely will help and have helped woman friends get into running that will experience this. Many men also have daughters who may want to get into the sport or sports in general. Menstruation and other women-specific health concerns are part of the universal human condition and we all have to help each deal with that and learn from it. It should not be left to women to go it alone and have a knowledge base that only exists amongst women, when men can learn too and learn how to access resources that will help the women in their lives the same way that women should learn about men-specific health concerns.\n\nI understand that mixed gender running clubs may not always feel like a safe space to discuss these things, but I hope that they do get discussed in those spaces regardless because men need to understand it. I hope that the leaders of those clubs, regardless of gender, would ensure that both sides of the coin are discussed when these things come up. I also hope that these things keep becoming more acceptable to talk about openly.\n\nIt’s not just run club. I was in a hiking club and it’s not supposed to be in-person Cupid, we want to just hike and not be considered as a potential date. \n\nBeing with just women is nice. I think men need the same thing for different reasons. There’s nothing wrong with it. \n\nHa I go to hiking meetups. I’m married and not that hot so I don’t get hit on, but there are definitely guys looking for a partner. I’ve had a couple conversations where at the end they’ll be like “well if you have any single friends….”\n\nYou're married! You won the game!\n\nI recently read Good For a Girl by Lauren Fleshmen. It mostly focused on elite runners. One of the take aways is basically: if the goal of competitive running is to see who can run the fastest, women's training and competition schedule is not set up in an ideal way to accomplish that goal. Most likely, neither is Mens, but at least the training and schedule was built for men and by men, whereas womens running was sort of just tacked on. Training has come a long way, and while not perfect, is much better adapted. Too many women are ending their careers early because of injuries, which if avoided, could have resulted in new records. Wouldn't be surprised if amateur run clubs have similar issues.\n\nYes it’s probably because women’s physiology has been overlooked for a literal century + leading to a lot of elite women being under nourished and at risk for injuries like fractures that could easily be prevented if someone is well versed in their needs. \n\nUnrelated, sort of, but Win At All Costs is about Alberto Salazar and his plague on running at Nike and talks in depth about the lack of consideration for female athletes both in training and professionally. It’s also not like this was that long ago, lol.\n\nAbsolute bonkers book along with Kara Goucher's Book, The Longest Race was a huge inside look at Salazar and his training style. I think Kara said after her first child, she was back training pretty quickly which was not ideal.\n\nOh, I’ll have to read that one. Yeah, because Nike didn’t honor any of the contracts so they basically had zero money coming in.. it’s really crazy. She’s not the only one they treated that way, but the book takes a serious look into her career and it’s super disappointing. I don’t remember all the details but she like won a race not long after and still wasn’t paid, despite still doing all her contracted obligations (like events and racing). It’s disgusting really, clearly a boys club. I’ve always hated Nike.\n\nIt makes it really hard to buy anything Nike that's for sure.\n\nI honestly feel like so many of these companies still function that way. The small handful of professionals I know personally definitely had a lot of similar struggles - low compensation, lack of protected leave/ job security and constantly vying for resources over their male counterparts.\n\nAbsolutely. Feels like even as we make progress, things don't seem to change much.\n\nInterestingly i never fancied anything Nike to begin with. I probably had only one pair of sneakers from them and that was over 20 years ago. And one of my kids has a pair of Nike soccer socks coz that was the only option in the shop at that time. Now I have one more reason not to buy from them.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI have a young elite runner and many, many female coaches and moms around me that ran collegiately in the US, including 1 under Alberto Salazar. Age range of these girls/ladies from 14 to 45. They all, every single one, have had a coach/coaches tell them the smaller you are, the faster you are, putting indirect or very direct pressure on them to diet. \n\nThe collegiate runners, every single one, over-restricted calories in spite of hours of training per day. Many of the ladies from 25-45 had team weigh-ins, weights written on dry-erase boards in the locker room and intense pressure to stay small. Many had no menstrual cycle, stress fractures and other clear signs of malnutrition and overtraining, but little to no support from coaches to be healthy or eat correctly. I think this is changing as more people are aware and coaches are being fired for this type of pressure. \n\nOur running club is focusing on healthy eating, mental health and injury prevention for our young girls and I hope we are contributing to lasting change for the future of this sport.\n\nThe norm for a really long time was to push the women to be extremely thin - not just fit but skinny. Which of course led to a lot of female athlete triad which in turns leads to pathologic injuries like stress fractures.\n\n&gt; Good For a Girl by Lauren Fleshmen\n\nAdded this to my reading list. \n\nAlso [Invisible Women](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41104077-invisible-women) is about this much more broadly.\n\nNever knew that but it definitely makes sense. Thanks!\n\nMy sister was in a female only running club, the main reason was she was more comfortable running with other women and she found it easier to discuss some of the oddities of running more comfortably than if there had been men around.\n\nI'm a woman who attends a weekly running club, and I've been asked out/hit on almost every week by a different person despite having a boyfriend...so that might be why.\n\nOne of my friends is married and doesn't like to work out with her wedding/engagement rings on. She had to buy a silicone ring because she kept getting asked out at workout groups.\n\nGirl, I run a virtual group on Strava and had to kick out a guy because he was messaging some of our more conventionally attractive female members *immediately* after they posted workouts, asking about their runs, commenting on their pictures, chatting about their weekend plans, etc. Even women who were uploading runs they did WITH their male partners. It was so wildly inappropriate and the sheer audacity of it was stunning. Is nowhere safe for us?!\n\nMy wife and I used to be in a very large run group. One guy would comment on almost every activity my wife did, and would message her semi-regularly about her training. \n\nDude was married with a couple of kids. She was always polite with him, but short. We didn't want to make an issue of it as he never said anything untoward, it was just a bit off.\n\nI completely understand the need for \"Women Only\" gyms, running groups, *anything* really. You just need spaces where you can enjoy yourselves without being harassed.\n\nIt's Not All Men, but it's *always* men.\n\nEveryone's sick of dating apps so the general advice these days is to meet people at social clubs. I'm sure it's annoying though.\n\nI think the issue with this is that people are taking this so literally as to treat social clubs as a 1:1 substitute for apps. \n\nWhen people say, \"go join a club/hobby group if you want to up your chances to meet someone\", they mean that maybe, over time, you'll make a connection with a like-minded person, which may then turn romantic. It's supposed to happen over time, and organically, because the club is full of people who may live similarly to you. And certainly not a guarantee. It's a secondary possible benefit to doing something social. \n\nSome men show up to these things and just start running through the women like they're swiping through app profiles. \"Ooh, that one's hot, I'll chat her up\". Rejection? On to the next! It's annoying as hell to be treated like a role to fill in someone else's gross story when I'm just trying to exist.\n\nYES! The whole idea of joining a club to meet people is to foster a relationship in an organic way, not to just hit on everything with boobs and hope something sticks.\n\nAll true! Luckily my run club is very organized (by a woman) and your ass is out if the organizers catch wind of serial pickup attempts\n\nThat sounds so lovely! Also I hope you didn't take my reply as a personal taking-to-task towards you; I was just adding to the conversation and then got fired up by the end lol.\n\nI stopped going to my popular local running club because even wearing a ring, I still got hit on. And it wasn’t just a “trying to make friends because you’re new here” thing, like I’ve heard some guys trying to dismiss.  Asking for my IG, playfully saying “if you beat me, I’ll buy you a beer after”, or flat out saying, “nice seeing a new pretty face around here” is NOT the way to have more women join a running club.  Heaven forbid I wanted to run in my fairly dangerous area of the city with other people but not feel like a piece of meat…\n\nThis was instantly what I thought of upon reading the question. It's incredibly obvious why some women would rather opt for women-only running groups because the chances of being left alone and just getting to run would be much higher.\n\nThis is exactly why I wish there was a women-only gym for strength training and weight lifting in my area.\n\nIn addition to other comments, sometimes women just want to be left the fuck alone. If you’re mildly attractive, I’d have to guess it’s exhausting having guys try to talk to you all the time, or give you advice.\n\nAs a guy I was one of the slowest runners in a run group I used to be in, i was struggling to hit a 10 min mile at the time. One week a new woman showed up and I ended up being the second fastest that week. All the fast guys were going the same speed as the new woman. I can imagine how exhausting that would be for any woman to deal with.\n\nYES especially to being given advice. \n\nI actually came across a TikTok this morning of a guy that said he got good at running to join these groups and hit on women. The video is a montage of him flirting and getting girls numbers\n\nI think I’ve seen the same video!\n\nI saw all the (completely valid) answers here about different training needs and positive community and was like…I just don’t want guys to hit on me for existing while I’m trying to enjoy my hobby.\n\nI had no idea there were many other reasons haha.\n\nI just assume that women want somewhere to not be around dudes hitting on them or creepy dudes or mansplaining dudes.\n\nI used to be a leader of a co ed running club. One of our members was a dude who was always trying to pick up the women who attended. He was very insistent and made many women, and men  who had to listen to him, in the group uncomfortable. Obviously as leaders, we took the steps we needed to try to foster a comfortable and welcoming environment free of creeps but there is only so much we could do (i.e. we run in public places and if he showed up, not much we could do and did have a policy that the man co-leader would always run with the last people so no one ran alone) but I can see how this type of incident could cause women to seek out a women only run club\n\nAnd I have yet to see a running club with bears.\n\nYou can start one. Find a mother and her cubs and approach. You'll be running together in no time.\n\nHope you're fast!\n\n  \n(Seriously though, there might be running clubs for bears, I'd talk to a local LGBT groups. If there's not one, maybe people would want to start one.)\n\nI had a friend (female) who was fast. Very fast. Like top 300 finishers at Boston fast (top 300 women? It's been a long time, sorry). She was constantly having guys block her on runs - not just at races, but in her running group. There was an ego hit to being \"beat by a girl\" even when it's just a training run with nothing on the line. So many times they'd take up space, swerve, etc. just to keep her from passing them. It was ridiculous. She found that women groups did not hold those kind of ego issues and she could comfortably run her pace without someone from her own group barring her progress.\n\nI'm certainly not a fast runner but I was running a half alongside my husband who's a bit slower than me. He was going for sub 2 which is a very popular goal time so obviously the field was quite full. This exact thing happened to me. I was just trying to do my thing but I was getting elbowed by men getting right in my space, blocked in, cut off round corners, men going past me then slowing down right in front of me. I ended up dodging ahead of these a-hs or running a wide line and lost my husband a few times which made him pretty annoyed. When I tried to explain my experience as a woman he just didn't get it. Your post makes so much sense.\n\nOh, I so believe this! When I ran my city's low key 5k that happened before the community fair where things like dogs, kids, etc. are encouraged and there are no chip times, the dad's running with their youngish kids would start being a-hs to their kids to get them to pick up the pace and would totally spread across the path with them right in front of me, so they wouldn't get passed by a middle aged lady because God forbid. Made me so mad. Mainly for the kids that the dads should just focus on having fun with and making running fun for.\n\nThere’s even a term for being beat by a woman - “chicked”. As in, “you’ve been chicked”. Applies to both running and cycling clubs and I hate it. And I’ve heard it multiple times. Thankfully I’ve  found women-only running and cycling clubs.\n\nI was running a half marathon alongside a male friend of mine and one of the support signs posted by the race sponsors said something to the effect of “Run fast to not get chicked”. The guy I was running with along and another male running buddy on the course and I had trained together for years. I’d helped them train for their first marathons and they ran with me during my pregnancy and afterwards helping me get back in shape for this specific race.  When we saw that sign it pissed us off so bad that we jumped off the course and ripped it out of the ground. I held it up for a finishers photo flanked by my two male running partners who were more than happy to have been “chicked” by me.\n\nUgh I had this problem when I was in high school running cross country. One of the guys HATED being beat by me, he would always exhaust himself trying to beat me on every single run. It was so annoying\n\nUnrelated to running but in middle and high school there was this guy that would get sooo f’ing mad whenever I’d get a higher grade on anything than him (which was like 90%+ of the time. He literally threw tantrums and said/did all kinds of psycho shit because even though he got good grades, he couldn’t handle that a ~girl~ was better at math than him (every other subject too, but math particularly pissed him off because “math is for boys”). Those types seriously annoy me, so fragile and pathetic\n\nWhat you did, and he didn't even realize it, was you were making him a better runner.  He was having to work to keep up with you.  I'm positive he still doesn't get that, even today, and that's if he is still even running.   Some guys just don't appreciate a strong female leader.  = )\n\nI feel bad for your friend but, as a man, I can't help but to laugh at guys who have such warped egos / wannabe alpha male thinking patterns. Imagine the cartoonishly pathetic level of insecurity needed to act this way lol\n\nLiterally can imagine one of them throwing a banana peel trying to wipe out their female competition 😂.\n\nThat sucks. I join a trail running group near me on occasion and there are some very strong runners in it - men and women - that can drop me at a moments notice, often without breaking a sweat. \n\nIt may result in a small hit to my ego but my overwhelming response is to find it motivating to see what they’re capable of. The fact that some people see the same thing and respond with negativity is disheartening. I can’t imagine what it’s like to be on the receiving end of that on a regular basis.\n\nThis was me (37f) at a local 10k race this weekend. I would categorize myself as slightly above average as far as my pace and times go. I was pacing one of my male friends to a 10k PR by treating it as a progression run. By mile 4 I was feeling great and he told me to go ahead and do my thing, So for the last two miles of the race I was cranking out 7:30's or so trying to see What I could do. I was feeling good and just kept picking a person in front of me to chase down and pass, this one male in particular, who clearly started out to fast and was fading, was PISSED I was passing him with a smile on my face and enjoying my run. He had the entire road that he could run on (not many people were around us) and he kept trying so hard to keep up with me, but not just keep up with me, he was literally stepping on the heels of my shoes. Like he was trying to trip me or draft of me or something, but he was right up against me, and everytime I'd drop him for a few seconds and speed up, he'd exhaust himself to catch back up and be up my ass. Jokes on him, I had a ton left in my tank and took off waving goodbye at his small \\*cough\\* ego. ;) \n\n  \nSide note: I have a picture of me from a local race where I'm pregnant and just crushing a bunch of men in the back ground. (My shirt even made it apparent that I was pregnant) It's my favorite race photo. :)\n\nWould have been a great time to spit or blow a snot rocket.\n\nI kept turning my head back when I could feel him hitting my feet. I could not understand why he was that close to me on a race where we had both lanes of the road available to run. I wish in the moment I would have thought to blow the snot rockets. \\*Takes mental note for next time, save the snot\\*\n\nThat man is such a pity, jeez. Cant imagine what his wife/gf might go through regularly.\n\nEdit: i wonder if there were people behind both of you but close enough to witness it.\n\nIt's quite possible there were people close enough behind us to see it happening. I also feel bad for his partner if he has one. I like to believe though that men with that fragile of egos, live a very lonely life.\n\n&gt; Side note: I have a picture of me from a local race where I'm pregnant and just crushing a bunch of men in the back ground. (My shirt even made it apparent that I was pregnant) It's my favorite race photo. :)\n\nYou are doing the same thing you are complaining about, though, with how you are shaming guys for being slower than you.\n\nYes I have this same experience at every mixed-gender race I’ve ran, and I’m nowhere near that level.\n\nBack when I was fast (not that fast, but still fast), you would be *shocked* by the amount of times I'd just be out on a regular old run, I'd start coming up behind some guy also on a run (note: this was typically always like, a \"wears basketball shorts while running\" kind of guy, not a \"spends a lot of time around people of all genders who might also be fast\" kind of guy) who would look at me over his shoulder, sprint all-out for like 30 seconds before gradually burning out, then I'd catch up again because like... I'm not changing my pace, I'm just out on a run. Then they'd do it AGAIN once I got behind them, and sometimes they would even start like, swerving on the path in an attempt to physically block me.\n\nLike, don't get me wrong, it was annoying and sexist as hell. But also, I always found it so hilarious and like... pathetic, maybe? Like, can you imagine strapping on your shoes one day, going out for a run, and thinking \"surely there are no women out in the world who are faster than me, Ken, who occasionally jogs and never does any run-specific training!\" Like, how does someone even *have* that mentality????\n\nMan her running group sounds like a bunch of dicks! I just want to point out not all running clubs have that kind of insecurity - mine definitely celebrates all runners, no matter their pace. Helps there's a lot of women in the leadership.\n\nI’m not sure you could know with certainty that no one in your club engages in this type of douchery.\n\nOmg my mum gets this too. She's in her 50s and does her 10k in under an hour so definitely in the pack with a lot of other runners. Dudes always speed up when she overtakes them. \n\nMy SIL joined a mixed run club.  Her experience was that:\n\n1. It was mostly men\n\n2. As such she sometimes struggled to keep up depending on the people who showed up on any given day.\n\n3. There was almost always someone trying to hit on her.\n\nAs a lifelong runner who is male and occasionally participates in a run club I can say that men are idiots. I’ve seen women getting hit on, talked down to, gaslit, and everything in between.\n\nYea same here.   There are several run groups in my area and a couple are women only.   I don't blame them. \nEven my mixed group tends to break down into little packs of the same gender during the actual run.\n\nOne of the big reasons I don't go to mixed gender run clubs much anymore was the fact that it really felt like new woman who came in were seen as \"fresh meat\" for the guys to hit on and ask out.\n\nthis is honestly so validating. thanks for sharing your perspective..makes other women looking for women’s only community for these reasons feel a lot less insecure.\n\nAs a male cyclist ... I can say the same from a male dominated cycling club perspective, too.  &lt;hangs head in shame&gt;\n\nThis makes me feel happy I decided on signing up for the women’s training clinic for my first Gran Fondo.\n\nAs a woman I think you don’t have a reason to hang your head in shame if you have made an effort to include the women in the group, if you have asked them what you can do to make them feel more comfortable/welcome, if you have told other men off for making others uncomfortable, if you have reported other men for sexist behaviors, …\n\nIf you have never done any of that, then yes, please hang your head in shame and go run/cycle somewhere else.\n\nHey from a woman thanks for noticing that and hopefully, telling them to knock that shit out. It’s exhausting.\n\nIm behind the times on terminology - what does it mean to be gaslit in this context?\n\nSomething like \"No he's not being creepy you're just too sensitive/overreacting\" to the point where she starts to question her own very real feelings and wonders if she's crazy.\n\nWho said anything about gaslighting? Are you making things up? Why are you reading into what they said that way, you sound crazy\n\n/s  if needed….\n\nThat’s gaslighting\n\nGuy: you run kinda weird\n\nI haven't seen any of the more egregious behavior in my run club, potentially because we have a high proportion of couples and because our most advanced group is lead by a badass woman, but the men still find ways to be idiots and I find that exhausting enough at times. \n\nMy particular favorite is watching the guys run themselves ragged on what should be an easy run as they let ego drive them faster and faster. Or running reps at paces they have no business attempting and wearing themselves out to the point that they need to take the second workout of the week off. \n\nIt's gotten so bad that during my last race prep I did a lot of my workouts with the intermediate group because they're much more relaxed, stuck to their realistic paces and not drive themselves to the point of injury trying to run 5' mile repeats with me.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI ran with a coed group for many years and it can work well if the men are willing to police each other. Occasionally I'd overhear a degrading comment about another female runner, but a guy would always shut it down quickly. That said, you also learn over time who you are and aren't comfortable running with.\n\nThe story of the guy treating Strava as a dating app made me laugh out loud.\n\nA woman’s run club I know offers specific advice for running during menopause, pregnancy, periods etc and has plans and sessions designed for women’s bodies. I’m sure some will say why can’t men join but there’s plenty of mixed clubs they can go to.\n\nThere are probably many reasons and I am unqualified to give my opinion on this. However, my sister (a type A competitive person) prefers women only running clubs because she feels it is wildly demotivating how much faster men progress. She got frustrated welcoming new guys that did a couch to 5k that could outcompete her within a year with far less time and effort that she put in.  \n\n\nIn her women only clubs, that problem is evidently alleviated and she can compete without frustration.\n\nI feel this so hard. It took me 18 months postpartum to get to a 5k pace that my husband caught up to in like 3 weeks. Hormones are a bitch, testosterone is wild\n\nThis should be higher up.\n\nThanks! But I much prefer the opinions of women of this subreddit being more visible than my second hand account.\n\nsome of us just like to have spaces away from men, to meet other women and be around other women, for a variety of reasons that aren't all necessarily negative\n\nAgree. No problems with men, but for me it’s just about making female friends who are into the same thing. \n\nLove this response and exactly how I feel. Not an issue with men necessarily. I just like to run with women and feel comfortable.\n\nI think it's pretty common in larger cities. Mine also has an LGBT+ running club and a Spanish language running club. I guess the goal is to foster community and it's fun because they all compete against each other in local races.\n\nYes, it’s a problem in all these kinds of group sports — running, cycling, swimming. Men have been so conditioned that being “worse” than a woman at anything means they are less of a man that there is a toxic desire to prevent women from beating them. Plus sometimes women don’t want to be where men will view them as available to be hit on and asked out. Some women have suffered abuse and don’t feel safe in mixed groups. Women also talk differently about things without men around — especially if it’s about our bodies. Even well-intentioned and well-informed men change that dynamic simply by being there. \n\nHistorically, there are just very few spaces for women, created by women, run by women in sports that a lot of people just want to dismiss it as not necessary for a lot of very poor reasons.\n\nMy club does coed and women-only runs both and it's great. If someone wanted to start men-only they'd be happy to accommodate it too. There is a space for everything.\n\nHad a bad experience at a mixed gender running club the first time I went. One of the slower guys stayed behind to run with me, but then proceeded to tell me that if I was single (it was Mother’s Day and I’d told him about my daughter/husband), he would be tempted to ask me out? He was also like 20+ years older than me? That was weird and I don’t need that in my running life, so I have not gone back even when there have been more women there.\n\nI would wager that women have bad experiences at most mixed activities. This is obviously a generalization over all, as I know there are good mixed groups. But as a woman that has participated in many mixed company athletic pursuits, men often react poorly to women being skilled/successful in a sport, in addition to the usual perils of being harassed or bothered.\n\nYup, I had to quit a movie watching club cause there was a guy who thought it was his personal speed dating group. I'm just here for the movies bro, stop hitting on me.\n\nI'm in a few women-specific trail running clubs. It's nice because the pace is more relaxed, there are more people in my life situation (working mom), less ego, nobody gets hit on, we don't have to care about looking cute in order to get respect, and we can do things like smear body glide in awkward places without worrying about being stared at!\n\nThere was a man in a running club I went to who was so creepy I had to block him on social media. I brought it to the leaders twice (also men) and they brushed it off and even told me this was nowhere near the first complaint about him. Not until he started stalking a woman in the group was it taken seriously. Women and gender nonconforming people need their own space.\n\nI would imagine attention that ranges from unwanted to uncomfortable and worse is probably a common experience for women in mixed sports clubs. \n\nAs a middle aged married woman I don't mind running with men, but for regular training, men tend to improve faster, so then you get left behind. Having joined a women's only group, that isn't as much of an issue.\n\nif there was a women-only option for any recreational sporting activity that is where I would be\n\nMansplaining running to me, being hit on, men not understanding what it is like to feel like your bladder is falling out of your body postpartum. Three reasons I prefer women based run groups. \n\nI attend a coed running group as well and it is fine, but there is something to be said about how safe I feel in the all women’s trail running group I’m part of.\n\nYes, women often have bad experiences at mixed gender runs. There is a large proportion of the male population that simply is not aware of how to act respectfully and appropriately. Yes, I am a man.\n\nI’m part of a women only run club. It started as a group of moms running with their kids in strollers. It’s a space for women to talk about female stuff that most guys don’t want to hear or talk about.\n\nThere's a popular running club for men in the US, a religion-based club called F3 (for Fitness, Fellowship, Faith). This group doesn't exist because these guys are afraid of women or have bad experiences with them, but because they don't want to talk about men-specific issues in mixed company. That's what the \"fellowship\" thing is about. \n\nI'm personally not interested in that club but I know several people who are in it that enjoy their meetups and workouts. But it doesn't bother me or confuse me that it exists, and I see no problem with women-only clubs either - women also like to have a chance to be around other women and talk about womanly issues relating to running and fitness without having to feel embarassed by talking about it when a dude is hanging around.\n\nEdit: Article about F3 here for people who are interested in learning more about it: https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a25799601/f3-workouts-for-men/\n\nI am just much more comfortable surrounded by other women in general, but especially in the context of sports where women have historically been regarded as less capable than men. That legacy still lives on.\n\nOne more thing I want to add here that I haven't already seen other women write. \n\n\nBeing always on guard in mixed-gender spaces is also exhausting. For every 100% creep (and every mixed gender space has at least one), there are a handful of maybe creeps--the kind who mostly traffic in plausible deniability: a too-close brush, an \"accidental\" double entendre, low-level misogyny.\n\n\nIt's exhausting to constantly calculate how to handle these situations, to doubt your own instincts at every time, etc. I feel fully able to enjoy my activities when I'm freed from this relentless calculation.\n\n\nIncidentally, these experiences are what's known as micro aggressions and it's not anything that's really intelligible to a person who doesn't belong to a minoritized group.\n\nI was a member of run clubs for nearly two decades. One of them had a predatory coach who routinely slept with new members, and specifically sought out women who were vulnerable in one way or another. The other men in the group were not as bad, but in a group that probably had 50 men during my time there, I can think of one who never made me feel uncomfortable. I have been running solo for years now and wouldn’t have an issue running in a co-ed group again - but I can for sure see why some women would prefer to run with women only.\n\nI'm in a mixed gender running club currently (although in my pace group I am the only female) and ran with a female only running club in the past. The current mixed gender club I haven't had any issues with the men - I do long runs and longer workouts outside of club time with the similar paced guys and they've been great, they invite me to beers and stuff, we help each other with workouts and  I'm just like part of the group. I don't have other women close to my pace, so I definitely appreciate the company/camaraderie. \n\n  \nI have had less pleasant experiences in other groups with men, I find it really depends on the group/the dude. I've gotten stupid comments from men (oh well, you're not that fast anyway...after I beat them in a race), \"so, do you get your period\", \"I heard that if a women has veins/abs that show it means she has an eating disorder\", \"are you sure you should be eating that?\"(funnily in reference to my second lunch from the same guy implying my veins = eating disorder), not taking no for an answer and contacting/harassing/staring to the point that I feel uncomfortable at practice... That kind of stuff gets old pretty fast/would not recommend.\n\n  \nFor the all women's group: honestly I just liked it. It was fun. I don't have to worry as much about stuff female bodies do, running in a sports bra, too much giggling or being girly in general. I like running around in my \"skimpy\" little outfits because running is hot, but not have to worry about anyone being weird about it/getting comments etc.\n\nIt's like how guys in the locker room just horse around and act differently vs what they might if a bunch of women were present\n\nThere is a club local to me (UK) that is women only, and it specialises in getting women running in a 'safe' environment. A lot of the ladies would be very self-conscious learning to run in a mixed group as they're often overweight and would be worried about judgement and comments. They're also very self-conscious about their self-perceived lack of fitness and speed, and worried that they hold people up, so running in a ladies-only group reduces that pressure.\n\nWoman here.  I honestly like running with women more than running with men simply because our body shapes and paces are more aligned.  Men are great!  But I'll be struggling to maintain a tempo pace which happens to be their warmup jog. It's not good for my training and it's not good for theirs. So, if we slower ladies start a half hour early, we can all meet up at the coffeeshop together and socialize there.\n\n&gt;Do women often have bad experiences at mixed clubs?\n\nAs a male runner with a bunch of women runner friends ... YES, F YES.\n\nI'm a girls girl. I'm married. I am not interested in meeting men, being friends with men, or competing with men. 🤷🏼‍♀️ \n\nI'm just adding some thoughts to some already great comments. But I think creating clubs/crews for specific populations that may be social minorities or face potential discrimination/hardship in traditional spaces is always a great thing. That is not to say these runners will not also participate in mixed gender (or whatever other minority group ie. BIPOC, LGBTQI, Older Adults, Runners from a certain geographic area etc.) clubs as well, but having a safe space where you can be yourself and not be judged or harassed can be very important in the running community. I don't think men (and I say this as a cis male) need to worry about creating their own exclusive spaces because the reality is that they already overly dominate the current spaces lol.\n\nNot exactly a run club per se, but when we do physical training in the Army the female soldiers are always well behind the men. Their standards are lower, so they're still scoring the same number of points and performing at comparatively the same level, but women just generally run slower than men. I could definitely see how it would be beneficial for women to stick around people who will progress at a similar rate and plateau around the same pace.\n\nI (31F) almost exclusively am part of women’s only run clubs. I’ve gone to a few mixed gender run clubs, some were great and welcoming but at some the thing that made me uncomfortable were that there were multiple guys who were very clearly there to try and meet women. And there’s nothing wrong with that being your main motivator- a lot of relationships form at run clubs, workout groups, co-ed teams, etc. and I do think meeting potential partners there is a big draw for folks in their 20s and 30s. But in all of these instances I had guys who immediately latched on to me and would not leave me alone. These are the kind of guys who if you met them at a bar or something you’d spend the entire night trying to shake off. I had one guy who I saw at multiple clubs who was glued to my side at all of them and relentlessly asked me out even though I said I was not interested. I had friends who had multiple guys in one night ask for their number in case they wanted to “go for a run sometime… or grab coffee or drinks.” Most of us are there to run and don’t want to be bombarded right off the bat with propositions for dates.\n\nIts mostly women empowerment and creating an environment where everyone belongs. I myself have joined multiple run clubs with mostly men and my pace just cannot compete. I prefer to do easy runs and I find that men in the run club I joined gets so competitive. \n\nIf you are male, I would recommend you run with a woman and you will understand why.\n\nAs someone who has run as part of many different social clubs (I am a male) I think having women-only run classes is a great way to give people another option to run socially? I think, as much as it sucks, women are always at risk of having some negative experiences that are in fact directly related to genders. The paces at which men and women run also wildly differ, in the sense that two people of similar abilities and different genders will have different paces, and in that sense having both gender-exclusive and mixed gender groups is again a positive. If there were ONLY gender-exclusive run clubs I'd be asking what was up with that, but given that the more options the better I don't see an issue.\n\nPeople have recently identified running clubs as a great way to meet potential romantic partners. I’m sure some folks just want to run.\n\nA not-insignificant women I know who run have been propositioned or hit on by dudes at mixed-gender run clubs.\n\nIf it encourages more women to partake in the hobby then more power to them! Some men can be idiots and women shouldn't have to deal with that while potentially starting out a new hobby.\n\nIm a woman and I love men but I prefer to run with women. Pace is one reason but also it’s just a safe space where we can speak freely about whatever and also not fear that some new dude is gonna show up and be creepy. My girl gang of runners is welcoming to men and we’ve had a handful join but we’ve also had a couple of creepers. \n\nWe run slower than dudes and we talk about our periods and bowel movements. It’s really nothing against you guys it just is what it is.\n\nI have been in two running clubs and it was both genders, with the majority being men. I quite enjoyed it as men are usually very competitive, so they pushed me to achieve my running goals back then. Although I enjoyed it so much, I over exerted myself and lost consciousness while attempting half a marathon. I quit running in groups after that as my body couldn't handle that pace anymore. Years later, I have enjoyed solo running or with a girlfriend or two, where it's no longer hardcore and competitive.\n\nEvery time I've run with men, they make it into a fucking competition. My guy, I'm just here to have fun. Relax.\n\nWhatever makes a person comfortable. I definitely can see why certain people like certain things. Running can be very personal with how long you spend training with each other.  I have always been in mixed groups, however I understand people wanting more exclusivity.  Great question!\n\nFunny enough I came across a tik tok today of a guy that decided to “get good at running” so he could join these groups to hit on women.\n\nClearly that man would not be running well, since when I'm in my run, my focus is on my own zone for that entire duration.\n\nI help run a queer running group geared towards women, femme, trans and nonbinary. Yes it's very important to have a space for people like us. Not only does it create a space for a community but also help people who are maybe going through transitions with their bodies(and sexualities) You'd be surprised how much you mask for the patriarchy and how you carry your body. \n\nI'd say the same for cis straight women too. They need a community for runners.\n\nWhat’s the difference between women and femme?\n\nCould be someone who's a femme presenting trans person. Or a person who just prefers femme over women but not non binary. The group thought about using sapphic too\n\nThank you stranger\n\nI’m in a run club that actually implemented a no-asshole policy for this very reason.  In reality it is a gender neutral policy but let’s call a spade a spade on why it was created.\n\nSadly the narrative need to change…\n\n1. From “what women should to do”, to “men, don’t assault / catcall / oogle women”\n2. Not all men do this… but it’s always men doing it!\n3. Men, need to call out other men who perpetuate this.\n4. It’s not “cool” or “macho”; you’re just an asshole.\n\nAnd on a purely mind / body level. women athletes have different needs than men.  Women are not just smaller men.\n\nI'm in a women-specific run club and I vastly prefer it to my experiences with co-ed run clubs. Natural pacing aside, there's simply more emotional safety (less emotional suppression) in women-only run clubs. If I want to cry before, during, or after a run, it's seen as completely normal. That's not the case in a mixed-gender club.\n\nI think a lot of it is sometimes women just want to do things and have men leave us the fuck alone. There's guys that will treat run clubs as a dating app.\n\nIt’s a great chance to connect with the same sex. Lower chance of being hit on. At my in club for women we have things like guest speakers who talk about running with period pain or how to pick a sports bra. It’s also paced differently.\n\nMy daughter was president of a run club and before and after she got there the rule was that the slow runners aren’t left behind.  The faster runners were expected to take turns leading the slower groups.\n\nI’m pretty fortunate with the run club I’m a part of as they really encourage the social aspect.. so in terms of that, no one is left behind and in general, is a safe and welcoming space. \n\nWhat is unfortunate, many guys think run clubs is a great place where gals want to be hit on, remarked on, and then creepily followed … so I can totally see proponents of an exclusive run club where feeling safe is a priority.\n\nIt can be anything from not feeling safe, previous bad experiences with mixed gender groups or just wanting to run with people of the same gender\n\nI know enough people who got hit on and didn’t want to return to the group because of it, people who have been sexually assaulted and don’t feel comfortable being in a group of men or just people who don’t want the drama that comes with the mixed groups to understand why they exist and why it’s important to feel safe in a group environment, regardless of sport/activity\n\nI just want to run and not deal with the male gaze. It’s less awkward being a hot sweaty mess after a good run with women. \n\nI would join a women’s only gym too if there were one in my area. I love and enjoy men. I just don’t want to be around them when I’m exercising.\n\nI'm a run leader with a running club who used to have a women's only arm and a mixed arm. We have recently started the process of merging the two groups and dropping the segregated run sessions. The reason is that in the past some ladies wanted to run in women only groups, generally for reasons that were not particularly negative, but over time the number of people wanting this have reduced to where it doesn't make sense any more, hence us now mixing the groups.\n\nIn my club we all group up by speed and usually gender anyway.  We all hang out together before and after, but the running is quite segregated for several reasons.  I think everyone needs a place where they feel safe and are liked, and I don't need to know the reasons a group of women might want to run without men around.  It's their right, and I'm 100% behind it.  You should be too.\n\nI'm in two different run clubs, one is mixed-gender the other all-male. The men's group is great for making friends and goofing off. It's very much about having a space for socializing and then fitness. Slower runners are welcomed by making sure to circle back at regular intervals so no one is left behind for more than a few blocks at a time. The mixed group is overall much more professional. It has different pace groups that conduct the workouts separately from one another. It's about fitness first and while I like the people there a lot, I wouldn't describe that group as friends yet. \n\nOverall I value both but they are very distinct and I can easily imagine how all women's groups would likewise have very unique benefits.\n\nPhysical differences and maybe creeps.\n\nSome of it is politics and some of it is necessity. Personally I'm barely five feet one and while I am a half decent runner, my 5K personal best is 25 minutes exactly in my 40s, there is a limit to how well I will ever be able to keep up with people who aren't female hobbits. Frankly I slow down groups of other women and I am constantly grateful for people who're willing to dawdle along with me.\n\nAt the same time in any group of people numbering more than about a dozen these days you will find someone who thinks men and women need to be kept apart for the women's safety. Personally I think this is utter bullshit. I might hesitate to go for a run with one guy I didn't know but if there's more than one guy around the likelihood of them all being baddies is basically zero. The problem is if one person says it then a lot of people will agree for the sake of peace and harmony and we end up being basically segregated which does not feel like progress.\n\nIt’s probably partially for the same reason there are women’s only sections in gyms. Some women feel more comfortable running with only other women. I get it.\n\nInterestingly, I’ve read through a lot of the comments here and what’s interesting is that the issues of running in a mixed-gender that relate to behaviours. Some people dislike being talked to by the men, and others dislike not being talked to by the men, some dislike men being too fast and some dislike men hanging back, and so on. That’s not a criticism- different people are made uncomfortable by different things. In gender specific running groups- you just don’t have to worry about being made to feel uncomfortable by the opposite gender, or making the opposite gender uncomfortable. You can just run.\n\nIve only been on a couple group runs and (as a guy) didn’t notice any untoward behavior, but I’ve seen multiple tweets claiming that run clubs are the new speed dating, and if I was a woman (which again, I’m not) I probably wouldn’t want to be in a group with anyone under that impression\n\nHaving run in clubs with both men and women, the men typically leave the women behind under the same amount of effort. I imagine that women only clubs makes it nicer for women because they don’t have to worry about being left behind by the majority of the group. Just a guess though\n\nI had been considering trying to find a group here in Austin, but after reading this, I'm not so sure.  If I did, or do, it will 100% be a women only group.\n\nToo many guys take advantage of being a member of any sporting club as an opportunity to meet, stare at, be with, be next to, spend time with, be close to, smell, gaze at, touch, brush against, leer at, talk to, impress, boast to, joke with... a woman. \n\n\nA gender exclusive sports club offers a safe place for, a woman in this example, to participate in an activity that they enjoy, without having to worry about any of the above. \n\nI have run in women only run clubs and mixed gender run clubs and can say the experience between the two was different.  Women only clubs tend to be less competitive and can feel less intimidating if you aren't used to running with a group.  Mixed run clubs tend to be more about pushing yourself as much as you possibly can.  There is value to both so it depends on what you are looking for in a running group.\n\nI host a group bike ride twice a week, and like most cycling groups, it's mostly men. That's just the demographic. I work really hard to make sure the women are comfortable, but whenever a new woman joins us I hook her up with one of the women cyclists I know well who runs rides without guys. \n\nIt's hard to be the only woman on a ride even if the environment is good, and there are a lot of cases where that isn't true.\n\nThere are also gender exclusive singing clubs.\n\nI'm in a lot of women's only groups and the main reason is purely that my boyfriend is the jealous type. I like having friends qnd I don't really care what gender they are but it's easier on my relationship to do it this way lol.\n\nIt is just different running cultures I suppose, most running clubs in South Africa , there is always faster runners that loop back to the slow runners to run with them and encourage them. In the end those guys run about 12kms on a 8km route etc. . Most runners also have the same goals, and you will find packs of people running with similar goals and pace. I also think that in South Africa the element of keeping safe on early morning runs also.play a big role in looking after each other.\n\nSame thing happens in Denmark now. To be honest I guess it’s a good idea if it makes more women/people exercise. I think a lot of people want to run with ‘same-gender’ since running in groups is very social.\n\nFor me it is 100% because of pace\n\nMen can be very intimidating or just downright scary. Being around a group of men as a woman is not a relaxing experience, it’s an experience we’d like to avoid"

I signed up in September and aimed to stay static with my 5Ks for a few months til it got closer to race day, with a PB of 28 minutes. Over the winter I joined a gym and started upping my distance on a treadmill. Around late Jan I started up running outside again; unfortunately it does turn out that running on a treadmill is much easier than running outside, and while my distances had started going up I was much slower at running. \n\nI subsequently realised that I wasn't getting enough running in during the week, so whilst I carried on doing park runs I stopped worrying about the speed and instead opted to use park run day as my long run day, where I initially would run home from park run (adding around 2k to my distance) and later running to and from park run to a total of around 10k. From late Feb, I aimed to increase my distance of long runs by 1km a week.\n\nI did well with this up until late march, where I picked up a nasty bug that knocked me off my feet for 10 days. At this point my longest run was 16km. Then in April I had an unexpected minor surgery, almost exactly 4 weeks before the date of the HM. I very nearly pulled out (even posted about it in one of the running subreddits). When it came to it though, my doctor cleared me to ease back into running with 10 days to spare before the HM. In those 1 days, I did a 4k, a 5k, a 6k and a 10k (not in that order). I just thought, sod it, I've worked so hard I'm not going to give up. Even if I end up walking most of it.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nAs a pre-race treat I bought some new running clothes to wear for after I completed the HM The night before I 'carb loaded' with a large bowl of pasta. Chose my outfit for the day, found the energy gels I'd bought before christmas and got my headphones and things ready to go for the race.\n\n# Race\n\nThe start line was such a fun adrenaline boosting event, very weird feeling having so many people watching and my fight or flight fully kicked in - I started off RUNNING! I quickly realised I needed to slow down or I wouldn't be able to keep going. Also, to my utter dismay, I realised my headphones were out of battery. How's that for disorganisation... The first 5k felt like the longest with the lack of music and running around the buildings for the first part of the course. Once I had my first sip of water though, I started feeling better and just kept going. \n\nKilometers 5-10 were uneventful, but getting to around mile 8-9 I started envying the people that decided to do the 10k instead. At this point I couldn't switch though so just kept on going. At some point mid race (must've been at 11km judging by my times I ended up just walking for a while having faced a long hill; I walked for around 5 minutes then kept going. Was unsurprised that I ended up walking some of it but was disappointed that it was so early on. But, I kept going a little longer\n\nAt around 15k I had another short walking break so I could sip some water comfortably. It was exceptionally warm; I think I walked for another 3 minutes or so. I did run the rest of the way but it was sheer will power; I felt that if I stopped to walk I wouldn't ever start running again.\n\nBy the 20th KM my legs felt like lead, the pain was intense but I was so close. The '800m to go' sign was a huge relief. Except that after I'd carried on running what felt like another km the next sign said 400m! and after another painfully long distance 200m came up. That 200m was the longest 200m of my life. When I crossed the finish line my legs were so heavy that getting out of the race area was a very unattractive wide legged wobble. \n\n# Post-race\n\nI was so out of it I didn't even check the size of the finish t-shirt, I just picked one up and carried on. Once I got out of the main finish area I hobbled around trying to find a chair, and couldn't find one so I just did a sort of 'slav squat' for a while til I got some feeling back in my legs. I was incredibly chuffed to see my race time of 2:18.40! I went for a meal with my race buddies and all our companions, went home, and had a 2 hour nap as a reward for an achievement that the month before I didn't think I was going to make!",

    "all_comment_text": "Congratulations!!! This is such a big milestone! And really good time too!\n\nInspiring stuff, well done.\n\nI've got my first HM this October, exactly one year after taking up running at 53 years old.  Reading posts like this is the inspiration I need whenever I start questioning my decisions!\n\nI genuinely feel that if I can do it anyone can - all I’d say is take your time, you’re doing it for yourself not for anyone else!\n\n[deleted]\n\nNice! It was a lot of fun. I am considering doing the Worcester half in September, and have booked my spot for next years Birmingham half too! You?\n\n[deleted]\n\nSounds like you do lots of them, how frequently do you do them?\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat’s incredible. And I thought it was a big deal that I’d signed up to a 10k in 6 weeks and another half in September 😂\n\nMay I ask, have you always been a runner or did you get into it later in life like I did?\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat’s amazing, and makes me feel pretty hopeful for the future! I definitely also feel physically and mentally better, and even after the longer distances I don’t seem to ache as much. Running has changed my life!\n\nCongratulations and amazing job! \nI have a love/hate relationship with those 800m, 400m, 200m countdowns. I initially get excited when I see them, but then it feels like an eternity to the finish line lol\n\nWow almost the same setup as me - I ran a 2:18 a week or so ago in my first HM. I had nagging injuries wasn’t running February/March after getting off the couch last fall and running intermittently. I ran maybe 15 miles/25k a week for 3 weeks in April and took the last week off due to another ache I wasn’t sure about. Luckily I felt ok on race day and ran pretty even splits on a hot and hilly course and avoided walking. I was ready to pull out of the race a day or two before but glad I held on. Good job! Cheers to lopping off some time on our next HM!\n\nI’m glad I’m not alone in this sort of pre-run prep, I guess it just goes to show that the prep in the months leading up to the event counts for more than we think it does!\n\nYep. Lots of possibilities if we can sustain legit sustained training leading into a race.\n\nYou didn’t have headphones and music because the batteries ran out??? I would have been so upset.\n\nYeah it was stupid haha…! I was annoyed at first but actually the whole way there there was cheering, music and other entertainment so it wasn’t all bad - I kinda enjoyed it actually I’ll charge them next time so I have the option to listen though!\n\nSo I’m guessing 6.51 in the table is actually 6:51 and not 6:31?\n\nYep!\n\nYou are a beast! Huge congratulations on your run!!\n\nHow are these race reports produced ?\n\nI found a link to a report generator on Reddit - can’t remember which but Google found “race reportr” which is similar\n\nGreat write up. Congrats. You’re making me think about doing something similar as far as just signing up and using that as motivation. I’ve been doing longer distance here lately with 10ks becoming more regular and my min distance being 5ks but I haven’t attempted anything past 6.2 miles yet. I’m in a good place on pacing and usually at the 6 mile mark I have the thought that I could continue onwards. Part of the equation is time though as it’s hard to find time for the super long runs on a consistent basis without taking time away from some other key area of my life.\n\nTime is a challenge for me too, I think what’s helped me most is using running as a form of travelling, so rather than walk where I can I run. The big one was running to and from park run, and accepting that it would mean I wouldn’t have any PBs for a while. Plus once I started working towards it I didn’t want to stop! Go for it. Pick a half and sign up!\n\nCongratulations on completing your first half marathon! Your journey from couch to 5k to tackling the 13.1 miles is truly inspiring. Overcoming setbacks like illness and surgery to still push through and finish strong shows your determination and resilience. The post-race \"slav squat\" made me chuckle - embracing the post-run wobble with humor is a great way to celebrate your achievement. Here's to many more successful races in your future!\n\nThank you for your reply, it out a smile on my face. I did c25k in the first place because I’d had a major life setback and needed something to get me going again, so to read that someone considers this a sign of resilience and determination reminds me that I’m doing alright. I don’t think I’ll stop running, I think it keeps me “well”!\n\nCongrats to you, a huge accomplishment!\n\nWell done man.  Well written too.\n\nwell done!! this was also such a joy to read"

    "body": "26 year old mother of 3 here. I went through a bad marriage and subsequent divorce. I got a job in a male dominated field that’s physically, emotionally, and mentally taxing. I started drinking. I picked up vaping again after having quit during pregnancies/nursing. Started relapsing back into disorder behavior with food. I stopped loving myself for years…or did I ever even start? \n\n2024 I started loving me. One step at a time. \nI quit drinking in February. \nI quit vaping in May. \nI got diagnosed with BPD/ADHD/PTSD in 2022 but this year I actually started treatment. \n\nAnd today I started running again! 2024 is the year I start loving myself. I’m getting into having hobbies again. Running being one, so I’ll keep this post run-centric. \n\nI’m using the Nike Run app. Today I completed the first run in the beginner program. I ran comfortably. I’m not obsessing over speed or distance. I’m just building the habit. I’m replacing my poor habits from the past with good ones. Running today made me feel so grateful to my lungs. I feel so grateful to my body for all of her hard work despite what she’s been through. \n\nI hope it’s okay to post this here. I didn’t see a lot of post similar to this one. I won’t make a habit of it, just saying hello and stating my accomplishments.\n\nWhy did you start running? I’d love to hear your reasons for getting into running. Where ever you’re at in your journey, I’m proud of you. \n\nCheers to you all. Stay safe out there everyone. \n\nEdit: thank you all for your awesome responses! It’s been really fun and motivating to hear from everything. You guys are all so strong and powerful. You all have unique stories. Some funny, some powerful. I love the “because I had nothing better to do” comments too. Some people choose negative things, you guys chose something positive and healthy. You’re all amazing. Stay safe out there everyone 🫶🏻",

    "all_comment_text": "It's fairly common to hear stories of people replacing more harmful addictions with addiction to running, running to run away from past trauma, or both, and I think it's perfectly fine and a whole lot of insanely accomplished performers have that story (Marshall Ulrich comes to mind).\n\nFor me personally, I do have a recovery story. Debilitating chronic spine injuries in my 30s, inability to walk or even dress myself some of the time. I'm pretty far down a long, hard road to simply being functional and not in perpetual pain, but at the same time, why running as opposed to everything else involved in rehab? I run because I love running and I've always loved running. I raced the kids in my neighborhood around the block and sprinted up and down hills for fun from the earliest times I started forming memories. I lettered in four sports in high school, but running was the only one I really took seriously and did every year and the only one I continued in as an adult. For a while, I wasn't able to run, and I resigned myself to that reality and lived with it, found other ways to stay as active as was possible. But as long as I actually can run, I will. Along with climbing and throwing, it's one of the few athletic activities humans are naturally better at than most other animals. It's an expression of function and joy that our bodies are made for. I don't need any more motivation than that.\n\nThat is incredible. You are truly an inspiration with everything you went through and your determination to never lose what you always loved to do. I know you’re proud of yourself. I’m a stranger, and I’m proud! I wish you the best. Never stop doing what you love. Thank you for sharing your story.\n\nWhen the 2020 pandemic sent everyone into quarantine, I was living alone in a 1-bedroom apartment. With my job going fully remote and every other social activity in my life going to Zoom, I was looking at a long, long time being stuck by myself in the house. Working from home also meant no more access to the gym at my workplace. I'm an introvert, yes, but spending THAT much time in the house alone is a recipe for Bad Thoughts. \n\nRunning gave me a government-approved excuse to leave my house during quarantine, and thus staved off the imminent madness of sheer isolation. It also ensured I didn't also spend all day on my butt and end up horribly out of shape as a result.\n\nIronically, I'm now in the best shape of my life.\n\nI couldn’t believe that our county closed parks and trails to running and cycling during that time. There was a strong belief among the county council that athletic activity led to super spreader events because people were breathing so hard. (And the county executive was a doctor even.) Some things were just so strange in hindsight.\n\nThe pandemic was a really rough time for every one. I thought it was so interesting how so many people, despite the struggle and uncertainty, found a way to virtually unify via tiktok and other social media. We found ourselves baking what we could afford to bake; learning new recipes; learning new cultures and histories of those different from us; and taking on hobbies. Everyone who resigned themselves to toughing out the isolation with creativity and positivity really learned a lot of important things. It’s so interesting to hear your story. I’m proud that you nurtured your health and fitness and loved your body and mind. So much beauty in your story. Thank you for sharing!\n\nI was at an airport in 2009 looking for a magazine before boarding my flight. I don’t know why but I picked up a copy of Runner’s World (I hadn’t ever run so this certainly was a random choice for me!) and read it on the plane. I didn’t even watch in-flight movie, I was so engrossed in this magazine about a sport I didn’t partake in.. when I landed I headed to Sportchek and bought myself a cute running outfit and shoes. I tried my first 5km that evening. It went absolutely terribly! 😂 I realized I couldn’t run for more than 30 seconds! This shit was hard! I gave up. A few weeks later I was still thinking about running though, and researched how to start it properly, joined a Running Room learn to run clinic, and slowly built my way up to a marathon in 2017. \n\nI’ve never done any trail running or anything beyond road races. A few weeks ago I was browsing the magazine rack before heading to an outdoor spa and was drawn to Canadian Trail Running magazine. I don’t know why I picked it up as I have (had?) zero interest in ultras or trail runs. And yet… read the magazine cover-to-cover and I’m now looking at trying out a local trail this weekend. I need to stay away from magazine racks!\n\nI absolutely love how your brain works 😂 you gravitated towards the running magazine with zero prior experience with running and then decided immediately, “I’ve read the magazine. I have legs. I can run a 5km.” Then said “Oops wrong legs.” And dropped it. The QUICKNESS you cycled through that hobby is rather impressive. Then you did the work to do a marathon. Literally amazing. \n\nAnd I love that, again, you found another magazine and found a new interest. Honestly, you may need to look into magazines for making tons of money and retiring early since you seem to have success with reading things and putting them into action. Good on ya! 😊\n\n„Oops wrongs legs“ bahahah 😂😂\n\nTurned 50.  Didn’t like that I felt old and stressed all the time.\n\nYesssss 👏 love that for you. 50 isn’t old. I work with a lot of people in their late 40’s and into their 50’s+ and they all talk about how they have actually enjoyed these ages more than they expected when they thought about it as younger people. SO proud of you for taking control and getting out there. You’re amazing 🫶🏻\n\nMy wife and I adopted our first puppy - he was a beautiful lab / hound mix with all the energy in the world. \n\nI work from home so I spend a lot of time standing at my desk and my only form of exercise back then were the long walks I would take with him. \n\nHe passed away unexpectedly in December 2022, a few months shy of his first birthday. I was completely and utterly broken. \n\nI couldn't bear the thought of not getting to go on those daily walks with my little guy so I picked up running. It's now been a year and a half and I'm averaging ~50-55 miles a month. I still think of my little dude every run. \n\nTo be honest, I don't know what I would have done if I didn't pick it up. Running helped me get through all of that grief and it helps keep me level-headed today, it's my own personal therapy in a way lol. Thanks for letting me share, RIP Zeppelin &lt;3\n\nI’m so sorry for your loss 😔 I understand how that feels. I lost a puppy when I was a kid. She had an aneurism in her lung. Those sudden losses really hit hard. \n\nBut you stuck with the running and look where you are now. Incredible! Running is, from what I’ve heard, excellent for healing your mind, body, and spirit. I wish you the very best, stranger!\n\nIn 2010 I was fat, sick and constantly hungover. I just got this feeling of wanting more from life. I watched my friend complete a half marathon and thought I want to do that! \nFast forward 14 years almost to the day and I've twice done that very half marathon. Just recovering from chemotherapy and have had to start all over again but running basically is living life up the fullest to me not only during runs but also the way I have the energy and fitness to get stuck into anything. Love it. \n\nRecovering from chemo and returning back to what you love. That right there is so motivating and inspiring. I love when people share their hardships and talk about how they’ve over come them. You’re incredibly strong and driven. Genuinely so proud of you 👏\n\nThanks so much 🤗\n\n&gt; And today I started running again! 2024 is the year I start loving myself. I’m getting into having hobbies again.\n\nSame story here, oddly enough.\n\nI knew I needed to get myself into some form of exercise to capitalize on my rather miraculous depression recovery (unrelated to running), and well I already had my pair of running shoes.\n\nI always found running cool in an odd way I can't quite explain, but I struggled with enjoying it. But I always liked races. Something clicked this time around and I'm actually looking forward to my runs.\n\nAh yes I totally get that! I used to run as a teen every day, sometimes twice a day, and *hated* it. Because I was running for the wrong reasons. I just wanted to “burn calories” and “be smaller.” But, like you said, this time around something new clicked. I’m not trying to lose weight or look any different. I’m running just because I can. Because it feels like freedom. \n\nProud of you for pushing through the depression and obstacles life was throwing at you to find what worked. You’re amazing 🙌🏻\n\nGood for you rowdylilred!! Now - don’t stop, keep going, don’t forget to recuperate in between runs. Massage, foam roller, what have you. \n\nI ran in high school and still run at age 56 because nothing makes me feel better. Exhausted afterwards, yet stronger, lets me sleep like the dead, keeps your brain sharp and allows you to eat like a college kid. \nAnd when I don’t run or exercise? I feel worse, sleep worse, feel sluggish. Even a shitty run (in humidity, ugh the worst!) is better than nothing at all!! Consistency is the key for a better me physically and mentally!!\n\nWhewwww felt you with that humidity. Where I live, all of the air we breathe is just ✨wet ✨ and don’t even get me started with how my curly hair handles it 💀 \n\nI’m 26 and I want to be like you in 30 years. I want to run every day. Eat well. Sleep well. Live life to the fullest now and tomorrow. Keep at it stranger! Wishing you the best 🫶🏻\n\nWe should open the borders and flood red counties.\n\nI used to run in cross country in middle school. Fast forward like 10 something years and I’m depressed and work a job I hate. I really let myself go a bit gaining a little weight and doing nothing but anguishing away really. Then I looked at myself and kinda hated what I’ve become. I put on my old gear and went for a mile and I’m still at it for maybe 3 months now just constantly trying to run further and prepare for a marathon maybe by the end of the year. Running honestly has always been the answer for getting the body type I want and it has resolved some of my body issues. It’s just what we were designed to do\n\nI’m genuinely so happy that running again gave you your self confidence back and helped you achieve the body you want and deserve. I agree. It is what we were designed to do. Keep at it, stranger.\n\nHell yeah it’s kinda crazy how optimized people are for running\n\nQuitting vaping was the best choice I ever made.  Congratulations on your improvement.  Stick with the journey\n\nThank you! I genuinely never want to go back. I’m 20 days vape free and I feel amazing. I don’t miss it. Congrats to you as well!\n\nI started running a lot again in a similar situation: I stopped drinking in July 2020, and started finding old fun things to do. Riding my bike a LOT. I used to run, but then life, kid, career, travelling, getting great at drinking, etc happened. So when my wife announced she was going to do a 5k challenge with her gym, I figured maybe I could get up to 5k again. A few years later, a short run is twice that!\n\nOh nice! Congrats on the sobriety and on finding sweeter things in life to appreciate! Do you and your wife run together? So awesome how far you’ve come!\n\nI am really bad at running with other people, but she does beach workouts while I run on the boardwalk once or twice a week in the summer. \n\nLife is pretty awesome these days, gotta say, it's so hard to describe feeling good?\n\n[deleted]\n\nHow are you doing now with your alcohol consumption and depression? Those are so incredibly difficult obstacles to overcome. Not everyone has the strength and will power to do it. It sounds to me like you latched on to running as a life line. It was truly life changing for you. 19 years of running is such an amazing accomplishment along with everything that you over came. That’s not just interesting- it’s inspiring. I’m so happy for you! I wish you all the best in life, stranger!\n\nI just got bored during COVID.\n\nPeriod 💅\n\n27 here. I don’t have anything nearly as touching as most of these comments, but here it goes…\n\nI have career goals that require me to be as physically fit as I can and to push as many mental and physical barriers as possible. As someone who is naturally athletic I had never truly felt like I pushed myself to any limits or beyond any breaking points until I forced myself to start running, something I previously hated doing. When I say hate, I mean I would literally only do it when I had to and only the bare minimum. Running, specifically trail running, has really put me in a space to keeping breaking beyond what I think are my physical limits, which turn out to just be mental. It’s really motivating for my wife too. Seeing her motivated makes me want to do even more. It’s like a cycle of motivation.\n\nWhat a great story u/Rowdylilred ! I'm happy for you and your positive life choices. \n\nI ran in high school but was always (one of) the slowest runners on the team. A couple of years ago I started jogging again, maybe 2-3 miles at a time and with frequent walking breaks. I joined a run club more to meet people than to get in shape, but I met some great friends who were incredible runners. They inspired me to get back into it seriously and I signed up for a half marathon, giving myself 6 weeks to prepare. \n\nI did it last Sunday. I didn't get anywhere near the time I would have liked but now I'm hooked. I signed up for another half in August and the full in June of 2025. And I plan on doing a few more halfs between now and then. \n\nI run because it feels good to do good for my body. It's great to get outside and greet the other runners with a wave and a smile (and even a fist bump). It's only been a few weeks but I hope to keep it up for a long time.\n\nI ran in high school and freshman year of college, was pretty good but didn't really put much effort into getting better. Then I blew out my knee playing intramural football. I became more and more inactive and drank more and more. Over the next 20 plus years I got very heavy, over 300 pounds and tried and failed to lose weight and maintain a healthy weight.\n\nThe whole time I was dealing with bipolar disorder and depression, long undiagnosed then held somewhat in check by medication which caused me to gain even more weight. August of 2014 I attempted suicide and was able to work for about 7 months. I was in therapy a few hours a week and decided to kill time to start going for walks, the walks became walk/run and eventually runs. To give myself a goal I signed up for a half marathon. I lost 50 pounds in training for it and finished in a respectable time for a 264 pound guy who didn't know how to train. \n\nI have been running regularly since and next April I will celebrate my 10th anniversary by running that half marathon again .\n\nGot sober last May. After a pretty difficult battle with substances and then a relapse of my ED, I needed something healthy to focus on. I always thought runners were, like, PEAK performance of fitness. I never thought I could be one! But I had a strong aerobic base (3-4 times a week for 30min over 2-ish years) so one weekend in a fit of sadness and body-image issues I decided to give it a try. That was mid-April. \n\nNow I'm in love! Currently dealing with knee pain that I'm working out, but once that's settled I'll be back at it! It helps my motivation, sleep, concentration, and self-esteem. It also helps me when food gets hard (can't starve and run!) I'm very grateful for running even with the injury struggles.\n\nI know I don’t know you but I am so proud of you for all the good things you’ve been doing in your life 👏 it was very encouraging to read your story. Personally 2024 is also the year of me. I’m coming off of 10 years of dealing with depression. I normally say I spent about 5 years spiraling down and 5 more years spiraling back up. Which brought me to early 2024, finally feeling mentally healthy but with my life in complete shambles. So this is my year to finally become a certified adult and one of the things I’ve been doing is finally starting to get into shape. I’ve been doing running since the beginning of April and since I’m very out of shape and very over weight and dealing with chronic illness my progress has been slow but I’ve been loving it!\n\nI have struggled with health problems for the past couple of years due to years of poor diet choices. Type 2 diabetic, and high blood pressure. I have fixed those issues with diet, but anxiety has reared its ugly head in my life and one night in March I decided to run away from it. I have successfully run away from my anxiety every day since March 20th and I have run 154 miles in total. I got meds to help out, but I am addicted to running every day now, so I just keep it going! I feel like I am flying as I run even though my times are around 11 minutes a mile. It’s a hobby now and I love it. \n\nI wanted to be a cyclist when I was 6, didn't have a bike, so I started running and after 10years of running I'm able to run a half marathon with a decent time of 1:42:38 but sadly here in India, I can't take part in half marathon races because they have an age prerequisite of 18+, I can only race in 10k. Running has helped go through clinical depression and many other hurdles in my life up until now and I hope it keeps doing it in the upcoming future as well. Anyways, now I have a bike and am training to become a tour de france athlete one day\n\nI smoked cigarettes for 10+ years and I liked to drink beer before I started running. My son joined T &amp; F in the 8th grade and asked me to go running with him one day. That's how I got started, and that was almost 20 years ago now! ...(I still like the occasional \"good\" beer!)... I've run everything from 5k to 50k. Placed in top three by age group in multiple races and placed 1st in a 5k once.  Being active and healthy (physically, emotionally and mentally) is a part of my everyday life now. No regrets! P.S. I Love your why! 🙂\n\nit makes my anxiety chill out lol\n\nsame\n\nPretty good.. preeeeety preeeeety pretty good\n\nSet a New Year’s resolution January 2020 to run a mile three times a week.\n\nKept it up for about three months, when I suddenly had a lot more time on my hands.\n\nI was an avowed couch potato with asthma nearing middle age. A work colleague was volunteering at an obstacle for race and asked if anyone would like to run with him in the volunteers wave. No idea what possessed me, but I said okay. I’d not really ever run in my life. The event was exhausting because I was so out of shape, but I completed it! I felt so accomplished. Facebook, that traitor, promptly recommended an inflatable 5K obstacle course. I tried that and had a blast. It kept recommending races and I kept having fun and started actually training to run. I did progressively harder and longer road and obstacle course races. I will never be fast but I’ve gotten a lot faster and learned that my strength is more in endurance. I’ve since done a Toughest Mudder, Spartan Trifecta weekend, several virtual marathons, and I’ll be doing my first live marathon this year. I’m a sucker for swag so I keep trying harder and longer races. Maybe a Spartan Ultra next year!\n\nNeeded fresh air during the pandemic\n\nFormer road cyclist here. Risk was not worth it it. Running hella fun too, turns out all my base built by years of cycling made me a really fast runner!\n\nI just started running as well! I’ve actually noticed a lot of my friends also getting into some sort of fitness kick lately, something is happening and I’m excited we are a part of it.\nTwo weekends ago, I was volunt-told to work the water table at a half marathon. We were stationed at about mile 10. I was working the table with a coworker who runs sometimes and an older friend who used run a lot. At first, I felt the runners looked like they were in pain and not comfortable. But, as the event went on, I began to envy the runners. They reminded me of when I was running in the woods for cross country and then conditioning for other sports and I remembered how good it felt to run. \nThe half marathon ended around 10 am and I immediately went home and ran! It felt amazing! I’m actually hooked already, been running every other day since then. \nI went on a long, slow 4.2 mile run Sunday, and went for a fast (for me) 5k this morning. Pretty proud with my initial fitness level and excited to get better.\nGood luck!\n\nLess inspiring: one day in college I was like damn I used to have some abs where did they go, and started running. Played sports in high school but not in college so needed to add some physical activity, helped improve my grades (which lagged my first year) too\n\nI turned 30 in May and realized I was in the worst shape of my life so I started running and a month later I’m obsessed with it. I also find myself looking at running gear and trails in my spare time now\n\nGrief is a powerful feeling, after my wife leaving me and not seeing my kid for a week on week off, running is the only thing I felt like I could do. Just run.\n\nI quit smoking! Needed to replace the dopamine and remind myself of the state my lungs are in (still).\n\nM40. My motivation is that I wanna see my kids grow up. I was already thin when i started running, but i wasn't healthy. Too much work, too much stress, bad diet, smoking, etc. Started running, andrl that naturally led to a healthier lifestyle. Now, i can say that I'm very happy with the result of my last health check-up.\n\nPS: unexpected benefit, which is probably obvious in hindsight, I last longer in bed now, too.\n\nI got out of an emotionally abusive relationship and felt like I needed something different when I was rebuilding my life. Running was the spaghetti that stuck to the wall.\n\nI have severe OCD and due to this, I was hospitalized for a lot of my teenage years. 13 - 16 years old. I am now 19 almost 20 and starting to get better. I decided on January 1st of 2024, that I was going to run a marathon before 2025. I ran my first half marathon on April 28th. I run because it gives me time to think, to quiet my mind, and to show myself that I CAN do hard things. I don't run away from my mind but to recovery. Now when I feel bad, instead of doing something negative or destructive, I run. And now all I want to do is run. I can do hard things and so can you!\n\nI joined the military in 2022. Before then, the farthest I’d ever run was five miles. I wasn’t living a healthy lifestyle and wanted to improve it, using the military as a way to get me going. \n\nI finished my first half marathon a few weeks ago and consistently run ~40 miles a week\n\nI used to love running since I was young, but I also started smoking at the age of 17/18... I always felt in a state of cognitive dissonance with it somehow. It felt strange to combine these two ambivalent components. \n\nIn 2019 I started feeling pain in my whole body, I found out I had a Lyme disease. My joints, all over my body, hurt. I felt so much pain &amp; I wanted nothing more than being healthy &amp; run.  In the beginning I was just wishing I could literally run away from it. But I couldn't run anymore, I felt truly miserable. I fortunately found a way to heal from this chronic disease after 2 years. &amp; Now I'm back. For me, running got addictive &amp; I'm training for my first half marathon now. \n\nI'm so grateful I'm healthy &amp; able to run again.\n\nI run because it makes me feel alive. Even when I don’t want to, I’m glad I did it. And when I do want to, there’s nothing else I’d rather be doing. Sometimes I run for fitness/to push myself, other times I just run for me (it beats taking a cab!) The more endurance you build, the more you can explore. I can’t tell you how many amazing things I’ve discovered when traveling to a new city/area, going for a run with just a general direction in mind and simply stumbling across amazing views, restaurants (noted for later!) and people. \n\nWhile there are TONS of good books out there- I couldn’t recommend “Born to Run” by Christopher McDougall enough. It’s also a a great audio book, if you’re looking for something interesting to listen to while in stride. \n\nCongratulations on embracing new territory and leaving toxic ones behind. Thank you for sharing!\n\nRunning really is the best therapy for me, and clearly for you as well. \n\nI ran cross country in high school because i had just moved across the country and I found running was one of the best ways I could process my emotions. Besides, I wanted to make friends and I was awful at every other sport. Joining the team was genuinely one of the best decisions of my life, and I think it made me into who I am today. My coaches were some of the best men I’ve ever met. \n\nI graduated three years ago and ran very sporadically, never the amount I used to. Unfortunately I lost my father in April this year, so I started running again to process it. He wasn’t much of a runner, but he did do one half marathon when he was in his early twenties. I decided I’m going to try to beat his time this summer. So now I’m back to running like I used to.\n\nTo piss off casuals\n\nI played American football semi pro for almost 15 years. Then I had kids and just stopped playing football, going to the gym and other sports activity's. This resulted in a big weight gain and 3 years after I was at 120 kg. \nThen something just hit me, I didn't want to be that big, and be that kind of rolemodel for my kids. So I startede running in July last year, 3 days a week for 2k then gradually built it up. Not going to lie, I hated the running until 2 months ago. I'm so glad I stuck with it, now I miss it if I miss a run due to family obligations. Luckily my kids are big enough to go in a stroller, and I take them for a spin. Fast forward to now. I've lost 20 kg, ran my first HM 2 weeks ago and set a new PR for my 5K today. I'm so proud and now I really enjoy running!\n\nBad break up/couldnt stop coughing in the gym from a respiratory infection I had previous of that. Then just straight pushing myself\n\nAfter seeing how happy and fullfilling my parents are running half marathons in their 50s, so I started running around my school, started off by running 5k every other week, then I ran my first half marathon in 2021, after bonking in my 3rd half marathon in 2022, I decided to run more and pay more attention to it. A year later, now I'm running 70k a week and running with clubs and friends, getting more into the world of running.\n\nI never hated running, but now I run with joy and with as much enthusiasm as the next runner, cheers to everyone!\n\nWas an overweight teen back then (93kg at 175cm).\n\nStarted running because of video game waifu called lindsey in a western 2d avn(adult visual novel), she's the star runner of the highschool\n\nOne year later, I ran 3.5km in 25 mintues\n\nNot in highschool anymore but i hope to meet a gal like her one day. Even if it's impossible, i'd still like to try, maybe in college or a marathon event\n\nI just kept it up from my school days as a way of keeping fitness levels high for my other sports but it also helps me with my mental health and keeping of the drink and nicotine 💪 \n\nGlad that you are loving yourself again and remember you are a rockstar coach Cory and/or coach Bennett said so 😏\n\nCongratulations! I’m unfamiliar with the Nike App, but hopefully it’s along the same lines of the Coach to 5k app here in the UK which helped me start running after years of neglecting my physical health. \n\nThere might be days where you don’t feel up to running, try to maintain motivation and keep pushing through those walls. However there’s nothing wrong with taking a day off though, listen to your body and be kind to yourself 😊\n\nTime/distance doesn’t matter, but it’s great to try to push yourself (even just a little bit), it can be super rewarding when you can see the progress you’ve made in comparison to where you were a few weeks back. \n\nIt might be worth exploring potential running groups, or park runs. The community is usually super friendly and they welcome people at all levels and ages! \n\nYou’ve got this 😊\n\nI was never a big runner but I suffered a weird injury to my heel that left scar tissue that made it impossible for me to wear shoes with backs. After about a year of this, I started to crave running. I had dreams where I was running through fields and I felt incredible in these dreams. I had surgery to remove the scar tissue so that I could fulfill these dreams. I slowly built my mileage up and definitely had runs that were exactly like my dreams. Since then I’ve run 3 marathons and 1 half marathon. I just had a baby and am now starting from scratch again. My goal is to race a 10k by the end of the year.\n\nI've been an on and off again runner since my track days in high school. I just genuinely enjoy the grind of distance running. I started running consistently about 4 months ago because I was working from home and not moving around much. Wanted to get back in running shape and ended up running and lifting weights more than I ever had in the past. Now I run and lift 5-6 days a week now. So happy for your journey!\n\nI've run off and on my whole life, but spent the past 6ish years on 'off'. I'm nearing 40 and didn't like how I have been feeling so I started a coaching program on my Garmin to get my asthmatic, 40lbs heavier than last time I ran, self back into the swing of things. I'm finishing week 3 tomorrow and coupled with more fruits and veggies in my diet I'm feeling so much better. I have more energy and I just like myself more. Ive been trying to focus on just doing it - I don't have to be fast, I just need to get out and run, and that has been hugely helpful for me. I'm not the 17 year old sprinter I remember; a whole lot of life has happened in the interim and I need to learn to adapt!\n\nI've been losing a lot of weight by getting my diet under control and doing a lot of walking. After I got down to a size that felt appropriate for running, I started incorporating it into my walking routine (running instead of walking once every 3-4 days). I'm taking it very slowly because I am still a bit overweight and I don't want to injure myself. On my best days, I've been able to run a little over 2 miles without stopping, at a pace of about 12:00/mile. I'm excited to see how much I can improve over the next months and years.\n\nMy dad and his dad were marathon runners and I wanted to keep the tradition alive and to date I’ve completed 5 marathons with more hopefully in the future. It’s also brought my dad and I closer. My mom recently passed from cancer and running really helped me during my anticipatory grief phase until she passed and continued to help by giving me a reason to get out of bed and leave the house after she was gone. \n\nI had nothing better to do.\n\nPeriod 💅\n\nA close family member had a heart attack (survived) in 2018. I was obviously concerned and it sat with me for the rest of the year. I quietly and secretly took stock of my life: I had a desk job, sedentary hobbies, some unhealthy habits. I tracked my average steps for a week and I was horrified at how little I actually moved day by day. \n\nIt suddenly occurred to me that if I kept on living like this I’d most likely develop some kind of heart or lung disease and end up in a similar problem. It got me thinking about my stepdaughter and how the choices I make now could impact how much time we had left together. Melodramatic much? \n\nRunning was something I settled on as something I could just get done without commuting to soulless gyms etc. I didn’t expect to enjoy it, I just wanted to do something that kept me ticking over. It was a choice that my partner found quite surprising. \n\nI got some advice from a friend and started C25K. It was hard at first. My lungs hated it (see: aforementioned unhealthy habits). But then something unexpected happened. One day I did really well on my run and came back home absolutely BUZZING. My other half was amazed at how chilled I was after. I don’t even think it was a full 5K, maybe just a mile or two. \n\nI don’t think I even finished the course, but I stuck with it. Not because of the physical aspects, but the mental ones. It does so much for me mentally that I find it hard to put it into words. It makes me feel strong, in control, good about myself, and I feel doing it demonstrates a positive habit to my stepdaughter. \n\nFast forward 5 years and I’m doing 10Ks before work and I’m booked on my first marathon in the autumn. As long as my body lets me run, I’m gonna run.\n\nlate view. but wow. thx OP. just starting out running again. inspirational"

Entering my 30s with a toddler, I wanted to prove I wasn’t over the hill and foolishly asked for an entry for Christmas. (I should have gone with chocolates.) I chose Boston - Lincolnshire in the UK, not Massachusetts - and committed to 'training properly' and getting my mojo back. From January to mid-March, it went swimmingly. I was running more than I had since my son was born, and the long runs up to 18 miles were feeling easy. Then, six weeks before race day, he entered a phase of terrible sleeping which left us exhausted and me in no mood to start running when he went to bed at 10pm. I downgraded my expectations and prayed that conditions were good on the day.\r  \n\r  \n\\### Pre-race\r  \nConditions were not good. They could be described as abysmal, with pelting rain and wind. I joined the other runners in huddling under shop windows for shelter in Boston marketplace. With the weather showing no sign of stopping, I opted for a long sleeved top plus a slightly waterproof one with a hood which I could ditch if things improved (they didn't). There were only 700 or so doing the marathon - a far cry from tens of thousands at my previous marathons in Manchester. Like condemned prisoners, we shuffled to the start line at 7am.\r  \n\r  \n\\### Race\r  \nBoston prides itself as the flattest marathon in the UK, with most of it along pothole-ridden country lanes through the nearby villages. However, the flat farmland gives no protection at all from the elements. Locals came out to cheer us as we got battered sideways by the wind and rain. Despite this, I was happy with the pace at each of the first 13 miles (between 8:30 and 9 minutes) and began entertaining dreams of a sub 4 hour run.\r  \nBut the wheels fell off quite quickly in the second half. My legs felt like lead and I took the first walk around 15 miles. Suddenly I felt awful, and was struggling to keep my eyes open with the pelting rain and fatigue. As I dragged myself through the next water station, it hit me - how much had I actually drunk? With the water raining down, I only been taking sips and was probably pretty dehydrated. I took on a full bottle and began to feel better. The next few miles were more walk than run, but unfortunately my weak spell had come during a particularly heavy downpour and I now impossibly cold. I was shivering and worn out, physically and mentally. At the next water station, I found a marshall and told him: “I need to drop. I can’t get back to the start.” He looked baffled and said: “Well I don’t know how you do that. Best keep walking to the next point and ask them.”\r  \nThe next four miles are a bit of a mystery. Somehow I walk-shuffled to mile 24, looking like an old man with a bad back and purposefully ignoring my Garmin. Swearing got me through the next mile, which was almost entirely running into the wind. At 24, I saw my time wasn’t as bad as I feared and pledged to not stop running again, no matter how slowly I was going. I managed a mini-rally coming back into Boston, and dragged myself across the finish line looking like a drowned rat, but with a time I was very happy with.\r  \n\r  \n\\### Post-race\r  \nChanging out of my wet clothes was agonising but such a relief. I made the necessary detour to McDonalds for a huge burger and put on my marathon playlist for the drive home. I told everyone I would never do another marathon. But… maybe just one?\r  \n\r  \nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

    "all_comment_text": "I have Raynaud’s, and I live in Wisconsin and run outside all winter as long as the temp is higher than -5F. I have a giant box of Hot Hands and I wear mittens instead of gloves, so I can stuff a Hot Hands packet into the finger portion. When I get too warm, I take the Hot Hands out and put them in my pockets. On really cold days I also wear a pair of liner gloves under the mittens, with the Hot Hands between the gloves and mittens.\n\nOn rare occasions I also put Hot Hands in my shoes, but it’s not comfy and my toes aren’t as painful as my fingers, so I usually don’t bother.\n\nI need someone to tell me, right now, and forever, that it isn’t “wasteful” to use this many Hot Hands even for short runs or walks… I’m begging you to give me permission.\n\nIf you need them to be comfortable, you need them! But if you are worried about wastefulness, there are some reusable options. Some are rechargeable mini-heat packs, and there are also “snap-and-heat” options that reset with boiling water! May even save you some money in the long run (haha) depending on how many you use.\n\nBonus points for the pun lol \n\nI do have battery powered ones, they don’t work awesome and are super bulky but they do get me through walks! So that’s something. I need to look into the reusable though!\n\nI have a set of the “snap-and-heat” warmers. They aren’t bulky at all—I actually think they are thinner than the Hot Hands. They are a bit of a pain in the ass to reset though. You gotta go out of your way to boil water just to reset them. They do work well though.\n\nI’m surprised I’m not seeing more comments for heated gloves. I make sure that I get heated gloves that warm **every single part of the finger** if I can. I wear them when the temperature gets anywhere under 30 even just for walking.\n\nThe ones that I got are currently about 80 USD. When you need to charge the batteries, it’s easy. There’s a little Velcro pouch, you pull them out, plug them in, and I’ll just charge them overnight. The finger of them allows you to do things with your phone if you need to. \n\nThe only thing is they run kind of big - I wanted to get them so that I could wear mittens underneath, but they were still too big. I’m not associated with this company anyway, but the brand is savior. \n\nThe product I use is: SAVIOR HEAT Heated Ski Mittens Gloves Electric Rechargeable Battery Mitts for Men Women Kids Winter Snowboard Motorcycle Skating Camping Hunting.\n\nI just ordered some of the rechargeable ones bc of this-haven’t tried them yet though.\n\nFor walks try electronic heat warmers! I have them, they get really warm, AND they are rechargeable! Like $30 on amazon\n\nBut are they bulky? My battery powered ones would never work for running.\n\nSome of them are more bulky than others, and granted i'm not sure I would take the ones I currently have on a run because of that, but certainly for walks and just being outside! I also know people that put them inside mittens so they don't fall out. I don't necessarily think it's \"wasteful\" to use hot hands if you do genuinely need them though. But if it makes you feel guilty, then you might not know until you try with the electronic ones\n\nYou can get [reusable hand warmers](https://www.amazon.com/Hot-Go-Reusable-Heat-Packs/dp/B016OA5YK0/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.epQIL4E2HUUhIeM_rnbt-YxDfe7upx7vqHM1nJeu1lAmsG_rbRbMZxZb0iB3rHU-nhGLvNTuGp7-3rV7-AQSknNFrI_WfsKdIA1ADfZqwcuGDJt9V6kHuVxxIgBcdwHOYp2O5qvfaFIgAGT2M9gA5DiG00ygggF8C_nPhbnmrd3tTY4TZ3YpxSmmWNMXp5ddLHgTy64xHI_eNinTCskw3w.8DycIH7Bkz52rkydNUT-WPs1fbrVWkMxer9BPiSSBIM&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=hand+warmers+reusable&amp;qid=1733040726&amp;sr=8-4)\n\nClick the little metal circle inside the packet, and it triggers a chemical reaction that generates heat. You \"recharge\" the hand warmer by putting it in a pot of boiling water.\n\nAlso raynaud’s here, and highly recommend reusable warmers like Hot to Go (zero affiliation, there are many other brands but these are what I have). I have ~a dozen so always have a couple available, but they reset just by boiling in water for 10 minutes. I’ve had some of them for ~5 years and still going strong.\n\nSo THIS is what that Chappell Roan song is actually about 😂\n\n🤣 Had the same thought when I realized what they’re called!\n\nDid you know you can put hot hands in an airtight baggie, and store them for later use? They work when exposed to oxygen, so if you cut off the air to them they will go inactive, and can be reused later, thus being less wasteful.\n\nI came here to recommend this. I can usually get 4-6 hours of running out of a pair of Hot Hands.\n\nI consider myself an environmentalist, I use public transit and avoid plastic and keep my carbon footprint low by not flying, etc.... but I'm pretty sure I have Reynaud's (undiagnosed but my appendages turn white and my grandmother was diagnosed with it), and as a runner and outdoor field worker, it's okay to go through as many as you need. Most people conserve nothing ever, you have a real physical issue with the cold, it's okay to use these to do what you need to do to live your life and be health. It's not wasteful. It's okay.\n\nThere are also some rechargeable hand warmers. Got some in last years stocking and used them so often\n\nAfter a short run put them in a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible and they will last for several uses. The chemical reaction relies on oxygen and will shut down if you cut off the supply.\n\nIt’s not wasteful for me because I remain cold for a long time after my run.  So I just put them in my clothes pockets/bra for a little warmth.  That’s less wasteful than cranking up the oil burning furnace.\n\nYou can get reusable hand warmers. \n\n[hand warmers](https://www.amazon.com/Hot-Go-Reusable-Heat-Packs/dp/B016OA5YK0)\n\nOnce I got past 30, it just seemed silly to be in so much pain when there was an easy solution. I also typically use my hand warmers later in the day, for walks, shoveling show or whatever else I need to be outside for. When I get back from running, I stash them inside some well-insulated mittens, and they stay warm for many hours.\n\nYou’re an adult do whatever you want\n\nThat’s the problem! I’m an adult with a budget lol (and they seem like a thing I shouldn’t be throwing away every day)\n\nAre you me? This is exactly what I do.\n\nI am also you. I do the same thing. 😁\n\nThey make hot hands that stick inside your shoes/boots! They’re much flatter than regular hot hands and are a lifesaver.\n\nThanks I’ll try it!\n\nAs a winter runner in Montana this is what I do.\n\nThis is the answer! For toes there are toe warmers. I just ordered a new box of both hand warmers and toe warmers for the winter :)\n\nThank you so much for posting. I'm also in Wisconsin and finally this year been able to run regularly (back injuries). What kind of shoes do you wear for winter running? Mine are wind-permeable which isn't going to work with the cold.\n\nI wear my usual shoes (usually Asics Cumulus or Mizuno Wave Rider, but occasionally Altra Escalante) bc I've found I navigate slippery terrain best with shoes I'm very used to. I've tried winter shoes, but I find them stiff and hard, and more likely to cause an injury or fall for me. Honestly, I'm kinda used to not feeling my toes, so I don't notice that part as much. I wear Kahtoola Nanospikes when it's super icy, which work the best of all the ice spikes I've tried.\n\nFor me, a couple of things are key:\n\nMaking sure the rest of me stays warm - which means investing in some key gear.  Trailheads hat that covers ears, smartwool socks, fleece tights and fleece shirt and a jacket or vest.  A buff.  \n\nWarming up in the house before I go out - lateral and monster band walks.  \n\nI have 2 pairs of gloves with mitten covers - one lighter (Trailheads, amazon) and one heavier (under armour).  Mitten covers make a huge difference.  I also always bring handwarmers, in case I need them.  I try to never ever take my gloves off, but find that taking the mitten cover off gives me heat relief if i need it.\n\nI second the mitten covers especially if its a layer that deals with the wind. Total game changer.\n\nThis is the way. \n\nHead, neck and core warmth helps my fingers from triggering. \n\nAlso mittens over gloves to keep any warmth in when the blood gets squeezed out of your digits.\n\nMy rheumatologist at UPenn is a runner and she told me to run all winter long. She suggested cutting a shock blanket into smaller pieces and putting them over socks to trap in heat. It works, weird but works.\n\nSo same idea - u/pmags blog has a really nice section from his wife about how she manages her Reynaud's all winter on backpacking trips.\n\nShe uses wool gloves and then covers them with elbow length dishwashing gloves.\n\nBoth of these strategies are adding a vapor proof barrier to your hands. These will stop the heat energy from leaving much better than almost any other type of glove.\n\nUsing mylar, the shock blanket, has the added advantage of reflecting back some of your lost heat back to your skin. \n\nI would be interested to know if it works better over socks or actually directly next to your skin. Might get clammy directly next to your skin, though?\n\nThank you for the shout.\n\nJoan wrote the article at https://pmags.com/dealing-with-reynauds-syndrome-gear-and-techniques\n\nThe High Desert can get down to mid to high teens and the techniques certainly.help! She also used it in the cold and wet southern Appalachian winters (\"cold and wet\" .harder than \"cold and dry\" imo)\n\nThanks for the direct link.\n\nTell her that my hairdresser almost cried when I saw her last because I sent her to your blog &amp; Joan's advice. It has given her back winter trail running and winter hiking.\n\nThat's awesome. I just showed it to Joan and she's so glad to help!\n\nEdge of the Appalachians here and yeah, it's way worse than colder but dry temps (lived near St George, UT for a while). I grew up near San Francisco and the coastal fog was brutal even if the temps were in the 40s to 50s. Nothing sucks away body heat like water.\n\nFor sure. I grew up in Rhode Island and I don't miss those winters at all!\n\nI'm out running for 1.5-2.5 hours daily with pretty bad Raynauds. I'm up in new england so average days in the winter are 20 and below.  I've gotten down to -10 before I threw and in the towel and jumped on the dreadmill. So let's say I have lots of experience haha\n\nMy feet are always fine.  Just regular socks and shoes.  The constant pounding doesn't let them get cold.\n\nHands immediately freeze at anything below 50.  I do  thin gloves from 50 down to 40.  Under 40 I switch to mittens.  Usually around 35 and under I'll throw rechargeable electric hand warmers in the mittens.  Any time I wear mittens, I wear a throwaway pair of nitrile gloves under them.  It keeps all the moisture/sweat on my hands. That way the inside of the mitten doesn't get damp because damp mittens make for colder hands. It also makes the mittens get mildewy.\n\nThe combo of the nitrile gloves and electric hand warmers made last winter incredibly bearable compared to previous years where it would feel like my hands were constantly being stabbed during runs.\n\nI'm in the same boat and run in the upper midwest. I tried almost everything and found hot hands with mittens and an inner glove layer to work initially.\n\nThe best that I've found is Hestra gloves with a wool liner (https://www.hestragloves.us/) after talking to a x-country skier. No hot hands needed and they are downright toasty. Hestra's are not cheap but they will treat you well.\n\nI second this. I used to suffer horribly while skiing from frozen/num toes and fingers. The only thing that improved my fingers was hestra mittens. I have zero problems with my fingers even on blizzard days. Now, if they could just start making shoes or socks for my toes.\n\nI legitimately wear snowboarding gloves. I look like a lobster and give zero fucks, my hands are warm.\n\nLOL I have a pair of Hot Hands gloves that are gloves on the inside, and front and back “flap” where the warmer goes, and a giant folding mitten over top. All told there’s 2 layers of thick fleece plus the glove liner. I look like an insane person wearing oven mitts, and I need to use my nose to operate my phone, but if I use them with warmers, I give zero fucks because I’m too toasty to bother.\n\nElectric hand warmers at 100% output while wearing cycling gloves. Will add more specifics if interested. It's been a gamechanger for winter running with Raynaud's.\n\nI'm interested! Do you have a link?\n\nI’m interested too. My hands hurt as well even after warming up.\n\nYou need to find something that's thin enough to allow your hands to breathe if they sweat, but warm enough. I used the Smartwool mitten. Mittens, no gloves. The mittens allow your fingers to stay warmer than if they're separated in gloves. On particularly cold days, I used two pairs of these gloves and was always comfortable. \n\nSmartwool Knit Mitt for Men and Women https://a.co/d/h653EgO\n\nTo add a few ideas that have been helpful for me:\n\nI pre-warm my hands with therapy gloves designed to be put in the microwave. I’ll leave them on while I warmup my legs and 3-5 mins seems to be enough.\n\nhttps://a.co/d/5A6mS63\n\nI’ve found that surgical gloves that you can buy in bulk seem to trap in the heat. Never realized how much I sweat through my hands until wearing these. I wear these under my regular gloves.\n\nAwesome idea!\n\nI have reynauds and have run through the winter every year.  I also ski and hike.  Keep your core warm- I love my vests for layering.  I wear smartwool running mittens and if my hands get hot I just take them off and stick them in a pocket.  I will also bring hand warmers with me if it’s really cold.  I’m usually fine when I’m running but as soon as I stop and my body starts to cool down my hands turn white quickly and I’ve had some pretty painful experiences.  Even when I’m inside if I don’t take a hot shower or sit 2” from my wood stove after my run I can run into trouble.\n\nDude.  I literally just made a post about this!  It’s uncanny!  Please, for the love of god let there be a solution\n\nI put above: I wear heated gloves, battery rechargeable. Just make sure that you look at exactly where the picture shows you the heat is going to be. You can get heated gloves and only heat the palm or something stupid like that. Make sure it actually heats the fingers.\n\nI've had these for years and I adore them.  The mitten cover is wind resistant, so you'll warm up quite quick.\n\nhttps://www.craftsports.us/products/unisex-hybrid-weather-glove\n\nI can also vouch for their split finger mittens as well.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’m not sure if this is helpful to you, but I saw something about how L-arginine *can* be helpful to people who’ve had necrotic damage in Raynauds. \n\nI really haven’t tried it myself and I’ve only just started looking into it. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12701823/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12701823/)\n\nSo I have it too.  Yes, Hot Hands as mentioned.  In MITTENS, not gloves.  I can run shirtless in sub-20\\* with that setup.  Sometimes I get fired up enough that I can put them in my pocket, but often don't.\n\nAnother thing I do is pre-warm my fingers in HOT water (\\~130\\*) - almost painful but tolerable for two minutes or so.  One of the things that happens is even inside your fingers can be cold enough that it doesn't take much to have them give up, while if they start HOT and with the veins wide open it gives much more time for your metabolism to help out.  But I always have mittens with heaters.\n\nAnd mind, the heaters can be \"paused\" by putting them in a Ziploc with a rubber band, so I can get a week out of a pair.\n\nHold up, tell me more about this “pause”\n\nThe reaction requires oxygen, which is why they turn on when you open the (sealed) package.  Once they're on though, you can put them in a Ziploc, squeeze the air out, rubber band it (because they won't stay sealed enough) and the reaction will stop.  Then you just take them out again 10-15 minutes before your next run or other use for them.  You don't just have to start them and let them blaze away all day after just a run.\n\nanyone else get it in their nipples?? my fingers and toes i can deal with but I have no idea how to stop the nipple pain other than puffy vests\n\nWorst part of winter running, I feel like I can control it everywhere else!\n\nI don’t quite get it there, I don’t think, but I have noticed that it’s gotten to the point where if I don’t wear a heating pad on both my feet and my chest, I can’t get to sleep at night. \n\nI talked to my rheumatologist, and he said that it’s extremely important to keep your chest warm in order to prevent Raynauds from happening in the first place. In the past, I would just keep a heating pad on my feet throughout the day, or if I had to go into the office, I would have a foot heater under my desk (actually a foot massager with a heat function, it really does get toes back in action). \n\nI’ve experimented with warming my chest since then, and I’ve definitely found that if I focus on warming it during the day (or even just putting more layers on my upper body), it really helps to prevent the Raynauds *as much.*\n\nI do not but my family members do. Couple things they swear by are: rechargeable hand warmers, always wearing glove liners, lots of mittens with the above, and water proof shoes since they then become defacto windproof. Lots of goretex on their feet even in what i would consider mild weather.\n\nI layer on my hands when I run in the cold midwestern winters. I like being able to use my fingers to operate my watch and phone so it’s liner gloves underneath and convertible mittens. I use Unigear Lightweight Running Gloves and Manzella Fleece Convertible Cascade Glove (mitten). Both are available on Amazon. This combo is the only way that I’ve found to keep my hands warm. The mittens are fingerless so my touch screen-gloved fingers can operate my tech and then go right back under the mitten sleeve.\n\nNot helpful, but I live in the tropics. It makes things much easier.\n\nAs a trail runner, throughout winter (-5C to 5C) I use mittens as many already pointed out. Mine are Inov8 mittens which are very light but also very warm. \n\nWhat I learned through time to be important is NOT to touch cold stuff or operate bare hands in the cold before running. \nAlso using hand lotion and feet lotion helped a bit reducing the effect. \n\nFor the feet I use merino wool socks. And warm up feet properly before going into the cold. \n\nAFAIK The syndrome has to do with sudden closure of capillary vessels as a reaction to a sudden cold. Just do not make it sudden eases a lot the effect in my case. \n\nThat’s a really good point. I hate getting things out of the freezer! Even first thing in the morning when the water comes out of the faucet cold - that can be several minutes of me having to warm my hands back up again.\n\nDitto all the hot hands. \n\nMy toes are the bigger issue for me and I swear by Injinji socks. I wear Injinjis alone at temps 25+, or with another pair of Balega or similar socks over them for colder temps. Toe gloves (injinji) &gt; toe mittens (socks) which is  the complete opposite for my hands!\n\nI buy a big box of hot hands and put those in my gloves. I use gloves with the stowable windshield and keep the packs in that part of the glove. \n\nUSB hand warmers inside whatever glove/mitten you use.\n\nhttps://a.co/d/5vFleFK\n\nThere are probably better implementations but these saved my fingers last winter.\n\nAlso treadmill. Yes, I'm a sicko.\n\nHand warmers in my shoes bc I have Raynaud’s in my feet (not in my fingers but MAN do they get cold)\n\nThey make toe warmers, if you haven’t seen those. Like hand warmers but with an adhesive side. I buy both in bulk from Amazon because I use them for skiing. I also find that the toe warmers work best *on top* of the toes, not under, like the instructions say.\n\nOooh good to know! Thank you!\n\nFor sure! Can’t get through the winter without them!\n\nI saw somebody higher up this chain talk about pre-warming the hands. I’m thinking maybe I might do this for the feet, too.\n\nI found that woolen socks as gloves are the best.  Sometimes with hot hands.  Even mittens fail.  My thumb turns deathly white.  Socks allow me to open and close my hand and bunch my fingers for warmth\n\nI feel like wool socks are this secret that people don’t realize exists! Not just for Raynauds, but for everybody. I would never go back to soggy cotton again, even for everyday wear.\n\nI’m not in a real winter climate. It only gets into the 30s (Fahrenheit) here, but my hands think it’s winter. I wear arthritis gloves + thick winter gloves. I am going to look into Hot hands!\n\nI have heated gloves. They’re great except a little heavy. I wear them more on dog walks versus runs.\n\nRunMitts are the way.  I have really bad Raynaud’s and they keep my hands toasty warm.  As others have suggested you could also toss in some hand-warming packets for extra help.\n\nTried hand warmers and they did nothing for me. What worked was stacking base layers and keeping my core warm instead. Found that if I can keep my core at a decent temperature it sorted the rest out. Took a few years of being a stubborn mule to work it all out.\n\nHave you felt like your raynauds has gotten better since running? I have it (or had it) super bad for the last 4 years. Just walking in the freezer aisle at the grocery store my fingers would turn white. Since I started running 3 months ago, it has almost disappeared! I know you said you’re new to running, as am I, but hoping the more you run, the less prevalent the raynauds will be! I’m also located in a cold weather climate (MN). Hope you find relief soon!\n\nFunny, this is the first I’m learning that what I have is a specific disease and not something that happens to everyone?\n\nI’ve always found that when the temperature gets below 40F, fingered gloves aren’t gonna cut it, and mittens are a must, though I’m not bad enough that hand warmers are necessary. I’m a big fan of WhitePaws RunMitts. Keeps my hands warm well into sub-freezing temps, and easy to just fold back if my hands start to heat up.\n\nI remember that moment of realization too, after years of assuming everyone had the same issue.\n\nMittens.\n\nIm Interested in the the response.  I was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia cause by sjogrens disease.\nIve started to love running but I'm always sore and injured.  Its very taxing.\n\nLayers - you do it for you upper body, so do it for your hands. I like merino liner gloves and then some kind of mitten or second pair on top. Hands too hot? Take off outer layer stuff em into your waistband. And Hot Hands when necessary.\n\nI got rechargable hand warmers! They’re awesome\n\nMilwaukee heated gloves. Big and bulky yes, but it's a sacrifice I make to keep my hands healthy\n\nRechargable hand warmers, waterproof socks.\n\nMerino wool socks.  Goretex shoes in bitter cold weather.  Goretex mittens, with liners when necessary.  \n\nKeeping your core warm will go a long way toward combating Raynaud’s.  Overdress (especially a hat) at the beginning and shed outerwear as necessary.  Do not grab anything cold with your bare hand!\n\nNobody has mentioned it yet but I take medication for my raynauds. I work outdoors and was getting chillblains and skin damage regularly and this mitigates that well.\n\nWhat medication helps with Raynard’s? Also what’s the cause of it?\n\nThe cause of raynauds? It can be caused by many things but it is basically your blood not circulating well enough. Medication for it improves your circulation - the doctor who diagnosed you should be able to help.\n\nNot a doctor...but had terrible case a few years back...would get it if I ran in 52 degree F temps...i started taking supplement Bromelain....so far so good...i eat a lot of fish but not sure if it impacted it or not since i always ate  fish....l luv the post here about Swedish gloves...never knew about them but am not a skier...i think it is due to blood circulation...\n\nThere are these little muscles (like sphincters) that control how much blood flows into the capillary beds of particular areas of their body a given time. Often they just relax and then squeeze, a kind of rhythmic motion that keeps blood flowing in and out. \n\nFor regular people, in emergency situations where the body is at risk of hypothermia or something similar, the body intentionally shuts blood flow off to the extremities to keep the core as warm as possible. Meaning that all your vital organs are preserved, but perhaps you get frostbite. \n\nIn Raynauds, the sphincters that we’re talking about freak out and spasm in situations are not appropriate. It might be mild cold exposure, ADHD medication, stress, all kinds of things. The point is, blood is not getting to the skin, and over time, this can cause issues like nerve damage (in addition to being very uncomfortable).\n\nBecause the body’s concern is the core, prevention needs to start with keeping your torso as warm as you can. However, it is likely going to keep happening anyway. It’s important not to just let the numbness linger as it can again cause damage, which means that sometimes people just have to run their fingers under warm water until circulation is restored.\n\nThe medication that is used to deal with this is often one of the same medications that is used to lower blood pressure. It helps to relax the muscles around blood vessels, which in a person with high blood pressure means that their blood has more places to go, and the overall pressure goes down. However, in people with low blood pressure, they may not be able to take the medication at all because it can cause fainting &amp; other issues.\n\nI use latex/silicon/cleaning gloves as base layer. They help a lot\n\nIt sucks\n\nWool convertible mittens. Breathable and allow you to modulate temp much better. \nEvery 10 minutes or so, I open em up for 30secs if they get too hot. \n\nBut the honest truth is treadmill for me. I minimize the outdoor running to the days with temps I can manage, and otherwise use winter to catch up on movies on the treadmill. But the wool convertible mittens have been my most successful option for when I do go out.\n\nI have it in my feet, and these things are super helpful: https://a.co/d/d3hLD99\n\nAlso what others have said- make sure your extremities are warm before you leave the house. I have a boot warmer that I’ll sometimes put my running shoes on for 15-20 minutes before I leave and that helps too\n\nHave you tried squeezing your fists repeatedly? That tends to get blood back into your hands.\n\nHeated gloves work for me. They have 3 levels of heat to choose from based on how cold is. I tried so many combinations of mittens, gloves before finding this solution.\n\nWhen I run, I get really hot. I only have issues with losing feeling in my extremities before I run. That said, I wear Darn Tough and Smart Wool socks. I also have found that mittens work better than gloves to keep my fingers warm.\n\nGore Tex mittens and shoes. Wool socks.\n\nSwitching to mittens from gloves made a HUGE difference to me. I still get moments post run when the nerves in my hand feel submerged in boiling water, but definitely less often since switching to mittens.\n\nI have battery powered gloves and socks. Rechargeable. They are seriously game changers!\n\nMany different pairs of gloves, and merino wool running socks. Even with Raynaud's, I'd still rather run in 20° than 80° weather.\n\nMerino glove liner with windproof mittens on top\n\nI got some heated gloves this year and so far they’ve really helped! And toe warmers on the socks (especially running in the snow).\n\nI’ve had good luck with the neoprene toe covers for winter running. And I’ll put in another vote for hot hands! Just stuff em in a vest/belt/pocket when your hands are warm enough.\n\nI use this microwaveable marathon mitten on runs up to an hour when it’s under 30 degrees.  Bulky, but it helps!  I also don’t want to keep throwing out hand warmers.  \n\n[microwave mittens](https://heatxchangetech.com/collections/all)\n\n\nI’m going to look into those hot to go things that reactivate with boiling water.\n\nI find that it makes it worse when my skin is dry, so I use a thick cream on already warm hands and feet before running. I also buy running shoes a little big to allow for good circulation even with thicker socks in the cold.\n\nI wear big-ass snowmobile mitts. Sweaty hands and gross mitt insides beat frozen fingers. Bonus is they provide a bit of padding if you fall on ice.\n\nHaving the same problem. I had to have my husband come pick me up yesterday bc I couldn't feel my feet any longer and the rest of me was sweating! 34 degrees. My feet were WHITE and toes almost blue.\n\nI take blood pressure medication (Amlodipine) for mine. This was the only thing that worked for me. Blood pressure meds open your blood vessels to prevent them from constricting when exposed to cold weather.\n\nDo you only take it when it starts acting up? I imagine it would be bad to take if you had no need to?\n\nYea I just take it when I know I’m gonna have be out in the cold. Not everyday. If I take it before a run my feet and hands don’t go numb.\n\nPersonally I can’t tell a difference in hot or cold weather. Any time I run it triggers it whether it’s 80f or 30f lol.\n\nAnd it triggers at the start of EVERY run. Which is interesting to me. I could bet my life savings on it lol…\n\nMittens\n\nI live in Canada so it gets pretty cold in here too. I have Raynaud and the only thing that makes me enjoy winter are hot pads for my hands and heating socks for my feet. I like the « Hot Poc » hot pads because they are reusable, and the heating socks are battery powered from Amazon, nothing fancy.\n\nDoes warming up before going out help?\n\nHeated gloves are the only thing that’s worked for me. I have [these](https://toastytouch.com/products/toasty-touch-heated-gloves?variant=40866442739909&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAmMC6BhA6EiwAdN5iLcyzX61MLussrUqSqZb19a36ROky1WjU3xiiRjUzEzeZ_I3ZiY2InhoCo5gQAvD_BwE) ones. They’re pricey, but they have three different heat settings and they last for several hours. Also thin enough to layer under mittens if the weather is truly bitter.\n\nThese mittens!\nÖjbro Swedish made 100% Merino... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LPQ0YOY?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\n\nDaily ice-baths def help improve blood flow to my extremities …they also help with muscle recovery from running, along with a bunch of other scientifically proven benefits\n\nAgree with a lot of the comments here. Also one recommendation with Raynauds that is likely unpopular in the running community is to omit caffeine. Doesn’t help everyone but does some. Not smoking is also a must.\n\n\"embrace the suck\"\n\nI have Raynaud's but I also sweat a LOT, I routinely run shirtless when the temperature is in the 40s, so gloves that I don't sweat in while wearing I've yet to find, so if it's sunny I go without. It's not as bad if it's cloudy or windy, but I just accept that my fingers are gonna hurt.\n\nI would be careful, as people have lost fingers and toes from reynauds before"

Full credit goes to my wife who bought me a smart watch for Christmas.  It was a game changer for me being able see my pace and times from the activity I just did.\n\nJan/Feb I was just mainly walking during my lunch break for about an hour and was feeling good for it. Did my 1st 5km without having to stop in March which was a big milestone for me and decided start running 4 days a week to try and eventually do a 10km run.\n\nOnce I was able to do that and was averaging about 20km a week, I decided to try out one of the Garmin coaches (Coach Amy) Half Marathon Plan to see if I could aim to be ready for a September race,.  I had left it too late for the Melbourne Half Marathon in October, as the ballots were exhausted.  I started her plan in May and after 8 weeks was averaging &gt;40km a week and was really loving the long runs on a Saturday morning.  Once I started running with a purpose, I was hooked.\n\nUnfortunately I pulled up sore after a long run during week 8 where I would have pain in my ankle when I put pressure on it, so stopped training for a week on advice from the physio. I didn't want to just pick up where I left off with the Garmin plan and re-aggrevate the injury, so only did 3 easy runs that week to test out the ankle and halved my weekly mileage.\n\nIn the meantime another ballot opened up for the Melbourne Half Marathon but I missed out.  I figured I would just try to build back up to &gt;40km a week again and still aim for the September race. I was able to get back up to &gt;40km by mid August and also successfully got in to the final ballot for the Melbourne Half Marathon around the same time so was absolutely pumped.  That gave me 8 weeks to start some more structured training again.\n\nI found a sub-2 half marathon training plan I liked from Runners World.  It was a 10 week plan so I just started it from week 3 to suit race date.  It had me running 4-5 times a week: a long run and a goal-pace (or faster) workout and 2-3 shorter, easy runs.  The variety of the workouts were enjoyable and I did feel my fitness improving as the plan progressed.  I did miss a whole week and a half worth of sessions the 2nd week into the training plan due to a really bad flu, but at least it was still 6 weeks out from the race which thankfully didn't have too much impact on the end result.\n\nThe plan had me run the race distance (21.1km) on my long run 2 weeks out from the race which I wasn't 100% sure about at the time.  The first 14km of that run was done at +30sec race pace (6:00 - 6:10/km) and finished the rest of the run at race pace (5:30 - 5:40/km) with a total time of around 2:05. It didnt stop raining that whole session but I'll never forget the feeling of accomplishment/pride with about 1km to go.  I was finally about to do it and all the training/persistance was worth it.\n\nThe benefit I got from running the race distance prior to the actual race was pretty big.  I now knew that I could do the distance which was a huge confidence booster. I was only 5 mins off sub 2 without going at 100%, so with fresh legs I should be able to hold my target pace.  I did a one week taper with my last run being on the Thursday which gave me 2 days to rest up before the big day...\n\n\n### Pre-race\nWe live about 150km away from Melbourne so drove down on the Saturday and stayed in a hotel in the city the night before the race. Had been carb loading since Friday and had a nice bowl of pasta for dinner Saturday night. My legs were feeling tired as we walked back to the hotal as we had done a bit of walking that day with the family around the city and was debating if I should do a quick shake out run to get the legs turning.  Decided it was probably just pre-race nerves and to just try and get some sleep instead and see how I felt in the morning. Got my race gear, fueling etc ready to go for the next day and set the alarm for 6am for an 8am race start.\n\nHad the same breakfast I normally do before long runs; Bowl of yoghurt with berries/granola, GU Strawberry Lemonade Hydration drink tab with water.  I normally have a coffee as well but didn't have any in the hotel room so had to go without.\n\nOur hotel was a decent distance from the start line, so decided that catching a tram to the event was my best bet. It ended up being so full of other participants after the first 3 stops, I was being pushed off the edge of a step as more and more people tried to squeeze in.  I ended up having to use energy to hold myself up from falling that I didn't really want to be using before the race.  Getting to the venue was stressful.\n\nAfter arriving at the venue, I didn't feel any pre-race nerves which was great.  I think that last long run really helped take the pressure off as I knew I could already do the distance.  It was then about another 15 min walk from the bag drop area to the start line, so I found a sunny spot near the start line with about 40mins to go before the race began and was able to just relax and do some warmups.\n\nAbout 10mins later I went to grab my phone out my pocket to take some photos and then realised I had left my GU gels in the bag I dropped off...  Too late to go back through the crowds to try and get it before the race start so decided I didn't want to deal with the stress of potentially being late for the start so would just attempt it without even though I had always used them during my long run training sessions (one before the run, one at 7km, one at 14km).\n\n### Race\nNot long after the 10km race started at 7.30am, I made my way to the start line in hopes of getting up to where the 2 hour pacers were.  Unfortunately they don't have any corals at this event and there were already so many people crowded in the starting area I couldn't really get anywhere near the 2 hour pacers, so just shuffled up as close as I could and just hoped for the best.\n\nThe plan was to do a negative split but that went out the window pretty early on.  I think it was a combination of the excitement/atmosphere (which was incredible) and trying to weave through traffic at the start.\n\nEnded up settling into a 5:30/km pace for the first 7km and was feeling comfortable and the heart rate was steady around 160.  As I didn't have my GU gels with me, I was trying to just take water/electrolytes at all the aid stations I passed along the way.  Trying to drink out of those cups while running was a nightmare to do for the first time.\n\nYou hit Albert Park Lake around the 7km mark and you started to feel the wind a lot more from this point on.  I also decided to try and break the race into thirds at this point where I told myself the first 7km would feel easy and to focus for the next 7km and hold the 5:30/km pace.  I remember keeping my eye on a guy just ahead of me in a fluro yellow top and just told myself to keep up with him as he seemed to be keeping the same pace. I found it helpful to just focus on following someone else and before I knew it, we had caught up to the 2 hour pacers at around the 12km mark.\n\nIt was a pretty narrow part of the track and the 2 hour pacers had a lot of people running with them which made it hard to get past. It took until about the 14km mark before I could pass the front 2 hour pacer but it also meant I was in the last third of the race once I did.\n\nAt this point I still felt comfortable holding the 5:30km pace, HR was 165 and didnt feel like I was breathing heavy.  I thought if I still feel this way with 4-5km to go, I might be able to push the pace a bit more and finish strong. There was a nice downhill section where I did 5:12/km around the 18km mark but there was a hill climb not long after that where I made the mistake of trying to maintain that pace as there was only 3km to go. My legs were feeling so heavy after that hill.\n\nIt was a huge battle trying to keep my goal pace going for those last 3km after that.  It felt like I was putting in a big effort at the time but was slowing down to 5:45/km.  I was instantly regretting going so hard up that hill.  Regretting leaving the GU gels in my bag.  Regretting that I may have blown being able to finish sub 2...\n\nI dug deep that last 1.4km (I must have spent 300m weaving through traffic earlier) and just wanted to leave it all out there. Coming up the ramp into the stadium was an absoulte buzz. I sprinted as hard as I could muster around the last 500m of the stadium and was so relieved when I could see the clock on the finish line at 1:59:20 with 50m to go, knowing I would have started about 1 min late with my timing chip.\n\nI was spent when I crossed the line but it was worth it.\n\n### Post-race\nBeing in a large race like that was such a cool experience so I'm glad I was lucky enough to get into it in the final ballot.  I've learnt a lot from the experience.  Not everything will go to plan, whether its training, injuries or the race itself and you just need to roll with the punches.  \n\nMaybe I could have gone faster if I did a few more things right but there's always next time.\n\nI've enjoyed the journey so far and can't wait to see where it takes me.  Here's hoping to more PB's.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

    "all_comment_text": "Congrats mate! A pretty impressive progression from walking at lunch to sub-2 half-marathon. This stuff is addictive isn't it?\n\nCheers. It's so addictive! I never would have thought I'd get this into it at the beginning but so happy I did.\n\nThis was so fun to read. Thanks for sharing! And congrats on hitting your goal!\n\nThank you. It was fun reliving it all. You forget how much the race is such a small part of the whole journey until you reflect back on it.\n\nGreat work man! I’ve been considering entering my first half soon so it’s always interesting to read retros like this.\n\nGo for it. You won't regret it.\n\nGood job, mate. I’m doing my second half tomorrow and looking forward to it.\n\nGood luck. I hope you smashed it!\n\nAwesme! Congrats on the pace and the consistency!\n\nThanks! The consistency is so important during the training i feel. Baring injury or sickness, just keep showing up and getting out there. It's worth it to get to the goal you've set at the end. Arguably, the process leading up to the end result is more enjoyable when I look back at it all now.\n\nI’m going to do my first half in april!!\n\nNice! Hope it goes well. Enjoy the whole process leading up to it. I'm sure you'll do great.\n\nWell done!\n\nThanks!\n\nCongrats! The day I run a 5:30 I'll be so proud of myself. I've been stuck at 5:50-6:00 for so long.\n\nKeep grinding. I'm sure you'll get there!\n\nGreat to read this. I also started running this year at 4 and am currently down from my first injury. Hoping for a sub 2 in London landmarks half marathon in April.\n\nHopefully the injury doesn't keep you out of action for too long. It's definitely a challenge keeping the body healthy at our age. I found once I started doing strength training once a week, it helped with the higher mileage is was putting the body through.\n\nGood thing about London is it pretty flat ! Good luck hope you smash it\n\nThis was such a great read, thanks for sharing. And congrats! Congrats on finishing and maybe NOT congrats on being bitten by the running/racing bug!😆 Kidding of course...if there's anything in the world you could pick to get addicted to, physical activity is probably the one to choose. Like you, I'm a late bloomer, running my first real half at 43 in 2017 (Brooklyn Half). Welcome to the club, and again, thanks for sharing your inspiring story.\n\nMy pleasure. Glad you enjoyed it.\n\nCongrats mate! I was at the same event and also traveled ~2 hours to Melb 😅\nGot great conditions. \nEnjoy the journey.\n\nYeah the first hour was nice and cool that morning. It did start to heat up later on and I remember seeing someone passed out as you turn right at Federation Square which was a bit confronting. Hope you had a good race!\n\nGreat work!!! You killed it mate. I wouldn’t worry so much about speed for this first one. You can go back and make adjustments after. The hardest part is digging deep toward the end and finishing, so good stuff! It looks like your HR was in the mid 160s which isn’t bad at all. So you definitely still had more in your tank that you can tap into next time. Congrats again mate!\n\nThanks! I definitely feel like I had more in the tank for sure and learnt about a few things I would have done differently retrospectively.\n\nI think incorporating some more speed work/intervals/hill repeats in the next training block will help as well. I probably only did 3 or 4 of those types of sessions over the 20 odd weeks I was doing proper training.\n\nOh yeah! 100%, I think if you add at least 1 of those training sessions per week, you will see crazy results. Keep us posted with your next race\n\nI loved reading this! Thank you!\nFell in love with running a few years ago myself, and ran my first half in Sydney the year after and haven’t looked back. Got no doubt that there’s plenty more PBs coming your way OP!\n\nThanks for the encouragement. Can't wait to sign up for another half and use some of the learnings I've taken from this one.\n\nCongratulations!!! This was an amazing first half!! Welcome to the club!! My plan was only one half, and I’ve done 23 so far and 10 full marathons! 😂 Very addictive\n\nCongrats! Impressive."

The Japanese novelist meditates on the meaning of his running practice.\n\nThe Incomplete Book of Running. Peter Sagal (of NPR's Wait Wait Don't Tell Me!) reflects on how running helped him deal with divorce and depression, and includes his story of being at the Boston Marathon Bombing. In spite of what I just wrote, this is a very funny book. [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/books/review-incomplete-book-running-peter-sagal.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/books/review-incomplete-book-running-peter-sagal.html)\n\nAnything by Chris McDougall. [https://www.chrismcdougall.com/born-to-run/](https://www.chrismcdougall.com/born-to-run/) .\n\nWelcome to your journey!\n\nlove that Murakami one, really helped me get into the right headspace and relax in the buildup to my first marathon.\n\nIt’s fantastic. I listened to the audiobook while running and it was awesome. Same with Peter Sagal’s book\n\nthe mantra \"pain is inevitable, suffering is optional\", even though it's probably not by him originally (think it's a buddhist mantra?) helped me A LOT with my first marathon.\nso much so I've had it tattooed above my kneecaps and is one of my favourite tatoos because it translates very well into life\n\nlove that tattoo idea. i’ve got the Dublin Marathon route tattooed above my right knee, so when I feel like giving up I can look down and remember that I’ve done this before.\n\nI agree. It’s a great book.\n\nUpvote for the Murakami book, it was a joy to read.\n\nAs much as I love born to run.. it really leans into a \"magical natives\" thing that's kinda bullshit.\n\nMurakami book is so good. Actually all of his books are incredible\n\nSecond the Born to Run book!\n\n\nOnce a Runner: A Novel https://a.co/d/6ZD6S5X\n\nSuch an incredible book, im jealous of anyone getting to read it for the first time\n\nAnd the sequel, Again to Carthage (although I find it to be not nearly as ... good).\n\nRereading them later in life, I appreciated and enjoyed Again to Carthage much more. Give it another go sometime.\n\nChi Running, by Danny Dreyer. Yes, it’s kinda old. But his tips still work!! After reading it in full, I think it was chapter 4 that went into specific running mechanics to prevent injury &amp; run as you age. Lean slightly forward, small steps, feet land under your body not in front of it - that kind of stuff. Sounds so obvious, but think about it: how don’t of us know the proper running posture? This book solves that.  That’s the chapter that I have memorized in my psyche when I feel like my posture is going bad on a run. \n\nHope it helps!!\n\nThis book is the one that stopped me injuring myself all the time, got me to slow down and actually enjoy running. I never would've broken through my personal 5k 'ceiling' without it\n\n**Adharanand Finn: Running with the Kenyans / The Way of the Runner / The Rise of the Ultrarunners**  \nHe also has a great podcast and is currently in the midst of writing another on running around Ireland, I think.\n\n**Michael Crawley: Out of Thin Air: Running Wisdom and Magic from Above the Clouds in Ethiopia**  \nCrawley is an anthropologist and spent time in Ethiopia studying the culture of running there. \n\n**Sarah Gearhart: 'We Share the Sun: The Incredible Journey of Kenya's Legendary Running Coach Patrick Sang and the Fastest Runners on Earth'**  \nSimilar to the above works but more of an insight into the role of Sang as a coach.\n\nCame here to say Running with the Kenyans! Brilliant book.\n\nFinn's writing style is just about perfect for me. He tells a good story in a lovely way. I just found his podcast, The Way of the Runner, and I'm enjoying that as well. I'm hopeful we'll get a new book from him before too long.\n\nThank you for these recommendations! These sound right up my alley.  :) Do any of them relate to trail?\n\nCrawley's book has a lot of discussion about running offroad in Ethiopia. The Rise of the Ultra Runners also includes a lot of trail running\n\nAnother vote for Born To Run by Christopher McDougall. Also Eat &amp; Run by Scott Jurek, which is more autobiographical, but I like because it includes some recipes he enjoys interspersed through the chapters.\n\nTake care, go too hard: injury, can’t run. Slight niggle in the calf or thigh: don’t run through it.\n\nRunning is a cheap, abundant, thrilling drug but like all drugs, use in moderation and above all care for yourself.\n\nSo simple yet so difficult\n\nGeorge Sheehan\n\nAgain, 'Born to Run' by Christopher McDougall \n\n\nIt made me run with a smile on my face\n\nDon't forget about Running with Sherman (How a Rescue Donkey Inspired a Rag-tag Gang of Runners to Enter the Craziest Race in America). This gave me some smiles, too!\n\nYes! Brilliant book!\n\nBorn to run by Christopher McDougall is an excellent book. Really well written and some genuinely good tips about running technique and form.\n\nThis is the answer right here, just finished it yesterday on a run. An absolute adventure of a story that was perfectly strung together with a ton of science and theory.\n\nJust stick with it. His writing style isn't for everyone but I've talked with others about it who gave up before finishing it. Stick with it if this is you\n\nlet your mind run by deena kastor\n\nPoverty Creek Journal is very different. It’s Thomas Gardner’s running journal for 2012 - a year in which his brother died unexpectedly. Some excellent meditations on running, grief and philosophy in there.\n\nMurakami’s is my favourite though.\n\nI love Out of Thin Air by Michael Crawley.\n\n“Running &amp; Being” by George Sheehan is philosophical and magical and a bible for anyone looking for the joy in suffering. \n\n“The distance runner is mysteriously reconciling the separations of body and mind, of pain and pleasure, of the conscious and the unconscious. He is repairing the rent, and healing the wound in his divided self. He has found a way to make the ordinary extraordinary; the commonplace unique; the everyday eternal.”\n\nGeorge Sheehan is the Socrates of running philosophy.  This book was out of print for a long time but has now been reissued.  Get it while you can.  \n\nAnother oldie but goodie is “The Complete Book of Running” by James F. Fixx.  It is arguably the book that kicked off the whole running movement back in 1977.  It has also been reissued and is available in paperback on Amazon.  This is running at its purest, when high-tech meant a stopwatch.\n\nThe Incomplete Book of Running is a fantastic book. The author, Peter Segal, talks about what it's like to become a Sub 3 hour marathon runner when starting out as a middle-aged runner. Segal is also a popular NPR host and does a fantastic job balancing humor with great running information.\n\nThe Happy Runner by the Roches\n\nAlso, I'm a big fan of theirs podcast, Some Work All Play (SWAP). It doesn't do it for some people, but I like the enthusiasm and pursuit of joy they have. They're quite talented athletes (David Roche just set the Leadville course record) but they understand the vast majority of us are doing this for fun and that is reinforced while also maintaining a focus on the science of training theory.\n\nNight Running is short and inspiring, even if you don't run at night.\n\nAlso recommend How to Make Yourself Poop just to read it in a public setting.\n\na short piece but a great one, and freely available online - [Runners](http://www.atrailrunnersblog.com/2006/07/runners-great-story-by-acclaimed.html?m=1) by Roger Hart\n\nEcho the plug on What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, and unsure if this is \"philosophy\" but Endure by Alex Hutchinson was the most impactful running book iv read that has changed my entire mental and physical approach to running competitively and for my own wellness.\n\nyes yes yes for “endure”! i had the same experience as you did with it. really changed my life. such a great read.\n\nTotally agree, it’s a life changing read (and I don’t say that lightly)\n\nJim Fixx The Complete Book of Running. It’s a fantastic if not dated all around examination of running from a guy that caught the running bug. Irony is that the author died of a heart attack on a run, but don’t let that disparage you or anyone from enjoying this book (he had lots of risk factors and declined a heart check shortly before it happened so he must have known something was up).\n\nI second this. Jim Fixx was one of the early movers in what is now the huge running movement. He wrote about things like putting on his shoes and heading out through the trees, which was an unusual perspective at the time. Back then, most running was done as part of training for team sports, and it was generally dreaded because people didn't understand it.  \n\n\nFixx was an editor working at home, and his take on running  was revolutionary at the time. He advocated going for a run because it was great in itself. He also explored the different ways of going for a run.\n\nThis was the first book on running I ever read. It was funny when Fixx brought out the follow-up book, \"James Fixx's Second Book of Running\", because it meant that The Complete Book of Running was not \"complete\" after all.\n\nBorn to Run is great!\n\nI love Eat &amp; Run by Scott Jurek. \n\nIt’s great how he intertwines his personal story and journey as a runner with his personal life and how running shaped his personal life and how his personal life shaped the type of runner he is! Personally I’m not vegan but a lot of the vegan recipes he shares at the end of each chapter are great and always very nutritious.\n\nIt may be hard to get a copy, but I recommend \"On Running &amp; Being\" by Dr. George Sheehan\n\nThinking body, dancing mind or Running Within by Jerry Lynch.\n\nAnother one is 'North' by Scott Jurek\n\n\nIt's his account of running the entire Appalachian Trail in one go, trying to beat the world record. So basically running an ultramarathon every day for 50 days straight\n\nSabrina Little: The Examined Run. She is professor of philosophy and ultrarunner.\n\n_I Hate Running and You Can Too_ by Brendan Leonard\n\nThe Lost Art of Running: A Journey to Rediscover the Forgotten Essence of Human Movement\nBook by Shane Benzie and Tim Major\n\nThis book actually changed the way I run. I think about it all the time during runs. Can’t wait to read some more of these suggestions🙂\n\nYour Pace or Mine? by Lisa Jackson\n\nBernd Heinrich racing beasts, a racing philosophy alone and Murakami of course\n\nI really enjoyed Running with the Pack (Thoughts from the Road on Meaning and Mortality) by Mark Rowlands. The guy is a philosopher and a runner and the book is exactly what the cover says. I may be biased because he's writing a lot about midlife, but it was an extremely satisfying read.\n\nI like the book Ronald Reng - [Why we run](https://a.co/d/47YKX5o), but I haven't seen it in English.\n\nShoe Dog!\n\nHansons Marathon Method\n\nNatural Running: The Simple Path to Stronger Healthier Running, by Danny Abshire\n\nRun Gently Out There by John Morelock.\n\nNot running specific but I do recommend. Ross edgley the art of resilience. Swimming based but the philosophy on the whole book is amazing!\n\nNot running specific but I do recommend. Ross edgley the art of resilience. Swimming based but the philosophy on the whole book is amazing!\n\nI enjoyed Jurek's \"North.\"  \n\nCaveat, though:  The chances are pretty slim that you're actually Scott Jurek, which means it's o.k., maybe even preferable, to not run through crippling pain.  Sometimes.\n\nWhy We Run, Berndt Heinrich\n\nCheck out Eat &amp; Run by Scott Jurek. I know it's a famous book, but I feel that you would enjoy his story/mindset.\n\nThere’s a seminar by Alberto Salazar, Andy Powell, Dobert Pascal, and the physio of a bunch of bike athletes. They talk about their programs, trade secrets that people over look, and other running stuff. It was super insightful\n\nSorry about nitpicking, but it’s Pascal Dobert. A great steeplechaser and coach.\n\nThe loneliness of a long distance runner. A must read.\n\nI really like \"Zen and the Art of Running\" by Larry Shapiro. It's about how to apply Zen principles to running and find a deeper connection between mind, body, and spirit through the activity\n\n\"Running With The Buffaloes\" is another book that isn't exactly \"philosophy book\", but it did drastically influence my running philosophy. It gives good insight into what high level college cross country athletes endure during their racing season, their training programs, etc. But it's also a great true story that will resonate with anyone who has run for a team, or aspires to.\n\nNot exactly on running but on walking routines/walking long distances: A Philosophy of Walking by Frederic Gros. Yes, it is a philosophy text and investigates how walking changes us and why many philosophers/inventors etc have opted into \"taking walks\" or communities have established \"religious acts\" simply based on walking from a place to another.\n\nIncredible read.\n\n[removed]\n\nTotally agree, it’s a life changing read (and I don’t say that lightly)\n\n\"Marathon Man,\" by William Goldman, the Nazi hunting book that was used as a basis for the movie, as well as being a great book, contains quite a lot of the heroes musings on running, which is his hobby, and that which allows him to escape from the bad guys. I found it very gripping 40 years ago.\n\nMy dad, who was a runner (now he can only hobble) recommended \"The Loneliness of a Long Distance Runner\" (1962) a film which is well received on YouTube, which is based upon a book."

You're not going to make a better plan than a professional.\"\n\nSo off I went in search of a nice, free 10 K training plan that fit my needs: 4-5 days of running per week, suited to a novice runner, and increasing less than 10% per week. \n\nBut then I realized that no such plan exists, and upon closer look at the plans that exist... They're not that great. Almost all of them ignore the \"don't make your long run more than 30% of weekly mileage\" rule, most of them only have 3 days of running a week, and most of them increase mileage by at least 10% (which I know is standard, but I prefer to be more conservative due to being injury prone). Another consideration is that I prefer my plans to be written in minutes rather than miles because it just makes it easier to plan my life.\n\nSo I have made my own plan, and we are very happy together.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you follow a stock plan to the letter, do you try to edit existing plans to work for you, or do you make your own plan?",

    "all_comment_text": "I've done a bit of all three. I think one benefit of following existing plans, at least at first, is it may force you to try something different and getting out of your comfort zone may help you either get better or at least figure out what types of training work well / do not work well for you.\n\nTotally and you learn new exercises. I just learned about “strides” last week and I’ve been running like 20 years lol\n\nI typically start with a premade plan and then edit it to suit me. Then next year I work from my edited plan and edit it more etc.\n\nHaha all the running terminology tends up blur together for me: intervals/fartleks/strides, tempo/threshold, etc. Generally I stick to a description of what I've done - wordy, but more useful to me.\n\nMe too. I just write down a pace on my chart. I also keep it simple. I’m not an Olympian so “today we are doing 4, 800m intervals at fast-ish” works for me.\n\nSame. I use Jack Daniel's running formula and edit as I feel\n\nI find your username and my vice of choice ironic 😂\n\nSeconded. I used to balk at the idea of negative splits, until a training plan called for them once a week. Now I subconsciously try making every run a negative split because it feels fun.\n\nNovice runners generally don't run 4-5 days a week. If you search for \"[10k training plans suitable for beginners](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=10k+training+plans+suitable+for+beginners&amp;ia=web)\", most search results will give you 3 days of running + 1 day of cross-training. The 10% rule works better for longer long runs. 0.5mi is probably the smallest extra distance you can put while still rounding to a nice number, so if week 1 of an [8 week training plan](https://www.verywellfit.com/beginner-runners-10k-training-schedule-2911611) starts with a 2mi run, the next run is not going to be 2.2mi.\n\nI personally start with standard training plans and work from there. I have my own schedule preferences, and as long as my average training load matches with the training plan, I think I'll be fine.\n\nI’ve started with the well known training plans and merged them into the reality of the runner. Things like life stresses, injury history, climate, or personal commitments all need to be considered. The output plan is usually tracked on something like Google Sheets, BTWB, MyPlan26, etc. just to visualize how these combine. The weakness with plans isn’t that they’re tried and true, it’s that the nuance of the athlete’s reality needs to be baked in and the runner needs to accept that. The more I see people testifying to specific plans, the more I’m likely to recommend hiring a coach.\n\nWhy is there a need to round to a nice number though? A marathon is 42.195km so needing to be a nice number is definitely not a requirement in running. \n\n\nAnd in other sports like weight lifting they have plates of different weights so they can get as close as possible to whatever percentage increase they're aiming for. Some people even bring their own \"micro\" plates to the gym to get smaller increments. \n\nMicroloading gets kind of silly when you consider the % accuracy/error that most plates have, and the variance between different bars and plates you happen to load up that day is +/- more than the microplates weigh \n\nIt makes a *little* more sense at a very serious club where the plates are numbers and you can use the same bar and plates every day, or you home gym and use the same exact plates each time. \n\nBut even then, novices don't microload, generally, because by the time microloading makes sense, you are, or should be, way past novice programming \n\nAnd if you're going to add like .17 kilometers to your run, are you also tracking how far you walked to get to the start and how far you walked from the finish to your car? \n\nMarathon is a special unique thing that is 26 miles 385 yards for...reasons. It's just...weird.\n\nSure, I agree on your points on effectiveness of micro loading (didn't know the term, thanks). My point was that there's no need to use round numbers. \n\n\nAs for the walking to the car, that's not a good comparison because I wouldn't \"walk\" to my car at goal pace or target heart rate.\n\nCan you define goal pace? Do you have a different goal pace for every run, and any distance run below that pace you don't count?\n\nMy point there is that if you're going to get realllly off into the weeds on minutia of like 0.625 lbs added to the bar or some tiny fraction of a distance...the things you aren't counting start to be more impactful than the little micro amount\n\nSo picking 'round' numbers and only dividing down to a certain minimum distance that you add is a very practical thing\n\nAnd speaking of % variance don't get me started on the accuracy of nutrition labels lol\n\nI'll answer your question first,  \n\n\n &gt; Can you define goal pace? Do you have a different goal pace for every run, and any distance run below that pace you don't count? \n\n\n Yes, I have goal pace(s) for every run. For example this week I'm doing four runs:  \n\n\n 1) 1.5k @ 7:20-8:00 ; 3.2k @ 5:50-6:10 ; 1.5k @ 7:20-8:00 \n2) 11k @ 6:45-7:10 \n3) 1.5k @ 7:20-8:00 ; 12 x [200m @ 5:00 with 200m @ &gt; 7:30] \n4) 21.1k @ 6:10-6:30 \n\n\n So every run has a goal pace or a goal pace for that segment. I don't count walking from my car to the track or from my doorstep to the roadside as part of my runs. I also don't count running 30 meters to catch a bus or anything like that. I guess I also don't run when I'm not training... Maybe you have a different lifestyle/job that requires some running outside of training (like playing ball with the kids or walking the dog?), I didn't think of that because it doesn't apply to me. \n\n\n Secondly, I think you are making my point for me. Since there's variation and we are not very exact (eg GPS error on the watch), we are already running \"random\" amounts of distances.  What's the difference between these two scenarios:  \n\n\n A) planning to run 5k but in reality running 5.12k ;  \n\n\n B) planning to run 5.2k but in reality running 5.28k? \n\n\n I think we both agree that there's no difference. So why not just let the spread sheet \"auto-fill\" with 10% weekly increment (or 15% or 8%, whatever is your preference) when you're designing your DIY plan? Isn't it more troublesome to go in and manually round up or down to a \"nice\" number? Even if you use a formula in the spreadsheet to do the rounding automatically, that's still an additional step that I find unnecessary.\n\nBecause % is bad way to program increases \n\nThe more new and more novice that have smaller numbers can handle bigger % increases. You don’t want compounding interest so to speak because as you progress, it becomes slower and more difficult to progress, you actually add a smaller % as you go \n\nSo you probably really shouldn’t be doing auto filled sheets with % building up anyway \n\nOtherwise there is no harm other than majoring in the minors\n\nWhat you said is all correct, but doesn't argue a case for why running \"nice\" numbers of distance is any better than running \"weird\" numbers. \n\n\nAs you said, it doesn't really matter since there's variation and errors. So I'm not sure why you felt the need to correct me when I said that \n\n\n&gt; needing to be a nice number is definitely not a requirement in running.\n\nFair enough\n\nIt doesn't have to, but simplicity attracts more views from new runners who are looking for training plans than precision does. I think there's also a psychological aspect to running an extra half/whole km/mi as opposed to strange numbers like 453.7m or 306.6yd. \n\nYou can thank the Brits for the [nonstandard marathon distance](https://worldathletics.org/disciplines/road-running/marathon):\n\n&gt; The organisers of the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896 devised the marathon race over 40km to celebrate the achievements of Ancient Greece.\n\n&gt; The distance was later extended to the imperial measurement of 26 miles at the 1908 Olympic Games in London, and increased another 385 yards when the starting line was pulled back so it could be seen by the children in the Royal Nursery at Windsor and still finish in front of Queen Alexandra at the White City Stadium in west London.\n\nI myself have done intervals with nonstandard rep times like 8m43s LTs, but I'm a numbers guy, and I am aware that it's not for everyone.\n\nYeah I get that there's no need to be precise down to a tenth of a yard or meter like you pointed out. But I guess I don't see for example 3.4km as being \"intimidating\" for a beginner. \n\n\nMaybe because I'm used to switching between Imperial and metric so it's always a multiple of 1.6 (yes I just drop the last 0.01), so I'm just used to my runs being decimals if needed. I can see how someone who grows up using exclusively one system or the other might be uncomfortable. \n\n\nFrom a practical stand point I also think it's no big deal nowadays since we all have smart watches. Just set the distance you want and it'll beep when you reach it. You can even set it up as a count down so you don't have to remember the final number in order to calculate how far more you have to go. \n\nWhat I did was look at a bunch of running plans first to get the general idea and see what they had in common. Then I synthesized my own, picking and choosing stuff I liked from each one to come up with something that better suited my preferences. If I found something didn't work for me once I tried it out, I could continue to adjust on the fly as I went along.\n\nThat's the same way I developed my chili recipe, by the way.\n\nSame! And lol with the chili\n\nLol, that exactly how I cook and now that I e started exercising it’s how I train :)\n\nI've run a 2:35 marathon, 1:13 half, 32min 10k and 15:30 5k without ever following a formalised training plan. \n\nBasic principles of 1 speed workout, 1 tempo/target race pace session, and 1 long run per week and just do much easy miles as you can on all the other days; and for marathon tapers keep the pattern the same but drop the volume by 25% then 50% in the 2 weeks.\n\nDoesn't need to be any more regimented than that for me. Only cross / strength training is rock climbing roughly once a fortnight\n\nEdit: If work, social life, illness, etc gets in the way, then the tempo session is the first to be scarified, followed by curtailing the long run into just a 60-90min easy run, followed by reducing or skipping a weekday easy run\n\nI'm genuinely surprised when I read or hear about people following one of these plans to the letter. Makes sense for a professional but do other people not have to account for work, school, family, weather, illness, etc? Your method of prioritizing is the only thing that could ever work for me.\n\nI personally like having a plan that I can stick to, to the letter, barring injury or illness. It’s motivating to have that exact plan to stick to, get me out the door after a long day of work. \n\nSomething about molding my life around my running has made me feel so much healthier in terms of my lifestyle - I’ve cut down my drinking knowing I had a long run the next day, get 8 hours sleep consistently, and eat way better knowing I don’t want the heavy stomach of fatty food to impact me. Of course I change the days I do each session on a weekly basis, but prioritising my running plan has been one of the best decisions I made\n\nIt's great that prioritizing your running has been so fruitful for you! I find running has the same compounding effect on my health, motivating better diet and sleep. \n\nI'd say changing what days you do each run isn't sticking to the letter, though. You're rearranging things to fit your life! What I can't understand is when people can do a long training plan without any modifications at all.\n\nOther people can make it work around those things. Usually and generally \n\nExcept illness, but even those plans “to the letter” account for illness by saying if you are sick don’t run lol\n\nI am new but I have perfect adherence over 3 months so far and I have all the things you listed above to work around\n\nBack in my weight training days I also had months on end of perfect adherence\n\nIn fairness, what you described as basic principles is a type of formal training program.\n\nI think that’s the whole point of this post\n\nWhat is the difference between a speed workout and a tempo race pace? Thanks\n\nSpeed workout is an umbrella term. Tempo runs fall into that umbrella so it’s a type of speed workout. Tempo runs are continuous runs at a specific pace. Another types of speed workouts are intervals, where you alternate fast running with either very very slow running, walking or stopping. A third type of speed workout are fartleks where you alternate fast running with moderate/easy running.\n\nIn my parlance, speed means intervals at equal to or faster than 10k race pace, usually 10-20 reps either 400, 500 or 800m with 100m walk recovery. Tempo means a continuous run for a set distance at a specific pace somewhere in the vicinity of target marathon pace\n\nI think speed workout in this case is talking about intervals.\n\nFor my current training the interval looks like 400m(one loop around the running track) at 5k pace, and do that for 5-9 amount of times. You get to jog, walk, or rest in between those fast interval runs. There is warm up run and cool down runs, before and after the intervals. There are other variations of intervals like doing 800m for 10k pace and etc. as well.\n\nMost describe a tempo run as starting slower, building to the faster pace often at or near target race pace, doing that for a certain periods, then tapering speed down for the rest of the run. As a type of speed work.\n\nMaybe in some circumstances but in most cases, tempo run is basically another word for threshold running - extended periods at a pace you could race for an hour (somewhere between 10K and 10 mile pace for most of us)\n\nAs someone who's also injury prone, I've always made my own plans. They tend to be more number of times a week of running rather than distance or time. The distance/time/speed on each run will depend on how I feel about 5-8 mins in. I do try to mix up in some way slow, fast, and long runs in amongst everything.\n\nThe only time I've followed a training plan was when I had a last-minute race entry that I was unprepared for from my base running, and followed a short ramp up plan to get me up to where I was hoping to be. The plan was useful but I really hated how restrictive it was, so after the race I returned to my plan-by-feel. Over the last 2 years I've gradually ramped up from 2-3-4-5 days a week, and it seems to have been going well.\n\nI don’t run to a plan because I’m not planning on *doing* anything except puttering around for fun. I’ve smashed out three half-marathon distances in the past 4 weeks on my long runs because I wanted to and I felt like it. And that’s pretty much good enough for my purposes.\n\nIf I wanted to take some PRs or race in any kind of serious way, then yeah, I’d look up a plan because that’s when the professionals would know better than me.\n\nI’ll die on the DIY hill. I’ve tried following canned plans to the letter with the inevitable result of overdoing it. After 7 years of running ultras, I have realized my body just needs more rest and is happier with lower volume training than is usually the norm. You’re being smart and listening to your own needs. I applaud you.\n\nSame. The one time I followed a pre made plan for a month I got an injury lmao. Now, club training aside (I do some amateur track and field) I only listen to how I feel, structure my training around my needs and get the eventual feedback from competition.\n\nVirtually all of these rules of thumb you're talking about are \"rules\" that work reasonably well within a moderate range of experience and volume. They don't make any sense at all at the extremes of beginning and advanced training. You clearly can't do fixed percentage increases of mileage as a general rule. First, any change from 0 to not 0 is infinity percent, so you'd never get started at all. Second, you don't want smaller increases when you're just starting and larger increases later. That's the opposite of what you want. Look at a typical trajectory of youth sports development and you'll see largely unstructured activity until maybe middle school, then quickly ramping up to 30-50 miles a week, then adding maybe 10 a year to that and getting into the 100s by college. It's logarithmic growth, not exponential.\n\nThink about it, man. If you start out at 10 miles a week, and then increase 10% every week, you'll be at 1,420 miles within a year. Does anyone do that? Of course not, because you don't increase volumes by fixed percentages. That makes no sense.\n\nWith the \"don't make a long run more than 30% of weekly mileage,\" what exactly are you supposed to do with 3 runs per week? If you run 3 times a week, your longest run is at least 33% of your weekly mileage. You can't possibly make it less than that.\n\nPro plans don't follow these rules because they're not real rules.\n\nGood call I was like lolwut at the idea that the long run can’t be over 30% therefore can’t do an existing plan but also only want to run 3x per week\n\n\nIs slo haven’t heard that healing run shouldn’t be that %, I think Hal higdon acknowledges that often the long run will be near 50% if weekly\n\nThe 30% rule isn't a hard line, but chance of injury does increase when you have a large deviation from this. Think, if you're mostly running 3 mile jaunts but on the weekend you run 12 miles, this is a huge change that your body isn't adapted to as well as if you spread the mileage out more evenly. I've felt much better when I keep my long run slower to 30%, although it's typically 30-40%.\n\nHow long have you been running? How much have you improved your PRs?\n\n\nThere are at least two major dangers besides injury that come with creating your own plan. \n1) you don't know what you don't know. \n\n\nIf you make it up as you go, a complete novice might try running every run hard. You might not do intervals or strides. There's many examples of things that are non intuitive or not immediately obvious.\n\n\n2) we tend to neglect things we don't like.\n\n\n If you don't like tempo runs and you make your own plan, you might decide that they're not worth doing. But they could be what helps you to a massive PR.\n\n\nIt's fine to make your own plan, but at least you should understand other plans and training methodologies out there before deciding that you're going to redo all that planning from scratch.\n\nTo be fair, at this meta level a beginner also doesn’t really know how to compare the hundreds of available plans out there. The same understanding of training fundamentals that lets you separate the wheat from the chaff probably would let you draft and pretty decent first-pass plan around your own schedule. \n\nYou’d hope that they’d start with something reputable and sound. But the internet is a big place. And there is a lot of junk out there.\n\nYeah, fully agreed. I was incorrectly assuming where they were in their running journey. \n\n\nIt really depends so much on where they're at\n\nI've been running about 4 months and I've dropped my pace a lot. Part of this is because I started out unable to run for 20 minutes without stopping (complete beginner). The other part is that I've lost about 25 pounds in that time. So my pace is definitely dropping consistently. I haven't plateaued yet, so I haven't really needed to seek out a more intense plan.\n\nOoh, gotcha. Yeah, I'd say that in your position it really doesn't make sense to overcomplicate the training plan yet. \n\n\nWhen you feel like you're plateauing again, then revisit a complicated plan\n\nBe aware that if you do plateau you may not need a more intense plan, you may need a less intense one. Or a step back week. Depending\n\nI find a lot of premade plans start with super low mileage and then ramp up very quickly. I like to look at a bunch of different plans and make my own based off of them and my own base levels of mileage. This helps 1) make it more personalized and more importantly 2) gives me something to mess around with at work when I’m procrastinating my actual to do list\n\nI love the Run with Hal plans. I've always used those and been happy with them.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo far I've had four months of no running+associated injuries! I mainly get connective tissue problems like shin splints, so I do some strength but mostly focus on slow mileage buildup.\n\nStop heel striking. Midfoot. Your calves will protest for a few weeks but your shins will thank you.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah, it's definitely more of a factor once your long run is over 8 miles or so, but I personally feel better when I spread my running out more evenly.\n\nI have followed a plan but went by it too strictly instead of listening to my body,  which ended in injury. Now I do a long slow run,  a speed workout,  and two medium distance/pace runs every week.  The Long run trends in the direction of getting longer over time,  but I'll pick a distance I feel like I can handle each week.  I might stay at the same distance for a few weeks,  or make it shorter one week if I need to.  I've injured myself too many times.  I'm trying to be smarter.\n\nLately I *start* with a plan, and then modify it if I find things I don't like. I'm currently running a Stryd marathon training plan, but once the marathon is over (Nov 3rd), I'm going to back to my true love: Short and Fast Races like a 5K or 10K.\n\nI've been letting friends talk me into longer and longer races this past year. Just did a 25K trail race on Saturday, actually. And I'm doing a backyard Ultra Marathon 2 weeks after my marathon.\n\nBut I want to get back to what I love after all that. And I'll be making my own training plans based on all my experience and what I know works for me. The Stryd plan I'm on, for example, had only *one* hill-based workout in the entire 24 weeks I've been following it. I *loved* that workout and I want to do more of that. I have the perfect hill near my house, too.\n\nI'm going to burn that hill up once the marathon is over.\n\nAs a xc coach, an existing plan and logic is a great starting point, but you dont fall in love with the plan. You adapt based on your needs.\n\n\nYea you arent going to make a better plan than a professional if the professional is coaching you… but they arent. They arent seeing the individual issues that need to be focused, the things you need, the ains that you need to adapt to…\n\n&gt;you arent going to make a better plan than a professional if the professional is coaching you…\n\nWell said! This is the crux of it, I think.\n\nI used an adaptive plan based on time (Garmin coach Greg) which worked for me. It let me pick how many days per week.\n\nI just like running. I would run everyday if I could but my body no likee. I run for enjoyment and have no desire to race or run a set distance.\n\nWhen I read your requirements I can't help but think you haven't been introduced to Jack Daniel's plans/books. Have a look for the 'Daniel's Running Formula' book if you haven't already.\n\nI'm interested! Will do. What made you think I haven't read his book?\n\nJust because he also prefers time based plans and suggests the sort of conservative builds I think you're looking for. I dunno, I feel like his plans/idea would be a good base or at least supplement for what you're doing.\n\nI studied a ton of training plans and tried to deconstruct all of them into formulas as best I could. I then found the average of those formulas, and this created my base formula for my training plans.\n\nSome people need to be directed to a plan because they make poor choices on their own.\n\nOther people can follow some basic principles and train on their own just fine.\n\nSome people obsess about plans when they should just go get some miles in.\n\nI find plans to be very hard to follow in the summer/winter due to weather variability, and I don’t even live in a crazy climate (northeast US) But I’ll be damned if I’m going to do a hard workout in high humidity or on an icy surface “because that’s what the plan says”. No thanks I am altering the plan\n\n\"...Pray I don't alter the plan further!\" (LOL)\n\nBut yeah, I'm also in the northeast US, and there's a reason I only schedule four days of running for myself (besides needing rest). If something comes up, or it's absolutely pouring all day, or a snowstorm comes, or surfaces are too icy for me to feel comfortable to run in but they'll be melted by tomorrow... it's usually enough slack to move things around a bit, and not have me chomping at the bit because I can't get in what I'm used to.\n\nHah relevant username.\n\n Exactly, gotta be flexible.\n\nXD Ah, you noticed!\n\nYeah, I like the double meaning, and I'm a nerdy gal. :D\n\nI’m with you. For beginners,just run. Increase your mileage slowly. Make notes on how you feel and how you are improving. Read a few articles here or there if they seem interesting. \n\nIf that feels overwhelming for you, then sure, pick a plan and follow it. I’ve always been frustrated by following stock plans though. I would work with a coach if I really wanted to get faster more quickly. \n\nRunning can honestly be really simple. Keep it that way if it gives you what you want from it.\n\nI made up my own plan, because I realized after my first training plan that many plans assume you are a 30-year old man who ran cross country in high school. I'm a 50 year old woman with no prior running experience and I need my training plan to be a lot longer, with more gradual increases. \n\nJeff Galloway plans were a big help though. Jeff gets me.\n\nI did Hal's novice HM plan and I bought a plan from training peaks for a 80/20 Marathon Level 1 Plan. I enjoyed the paid plan because it got more specific and added in speed work which has helped tremendously.\n\nI spend 8 hours planning at work, I spend evenings planning my life and future. I need to enjoy my run more than I need to plan it.\n\nAs with other disciplines I've been in, when I see \"Novice\" and \"self guided/plan\" I have to ask...does the *novice* know how to program? \n\nIn strength training novice didn't mean newb, you could be a novice after having made a lot of progress in the past or distant past, so a \"back into it\" novice may have a lot of experience and knowledge...but generally the Novice does not. Such person doesn't know what they don't know and probably is going to make some significant, avoidable, errors if they make up their own stuff.\n\n30% “rule” is nonsense lmao. Literally not possible if you only run 3 times per week…\n\nWhat worked best for me for my first half-marathon 2.5 yrs ago was to hire a local online running coach via CoachUp who gave me a 6 month plan (5x a week, 3 days easy, 1 day speed, 1 day long run with detailed goals) that he would email to me month per month. After that I’ve just modified his plan to fit my needs based on what race I was running. So far I’ve done 2 more half-marathons, a 10-miler, a 10k, and a 5k by DIYing his plan and I’ve been pretty happy with the results.\n\nFinished my first marathon last year on a DIY plan.    Met my goal (sub 5-hr, yes I’m slow) and didn’t get injured.   Had a really fun time.  41M, former heavy smoker, super short guy, for reference.  I was already very comfortable running multiple 13.1’s per month when I started training for the 26.2, and I started training months ahead of when my wife started training for the same race using a pre-made plan. \n\nMy body, my mind, and my work schedule really weren’t dealing well with some of the established plans out there.  My #1 rule is that running has to be fun and not feel like a second job… my real job is already intense enough.   I run to feel good and stay healthy, so incremental performance gains are OK instead of chasing maximum performance. \n\nIf you really listen to your body and you use common sense, and track your basic stats, you can find something DIY that works for you.   But it has to be an actual plan, not just every day do what you want.\n\n&gt;most of them increase mileage by at least 10% (which I know is standard, but I prefer to be more conservative due to being injury prone)\n\nDepending on your mileage, 10% isn't all that much at the lower end of the spectrum. \n\nIf you're running 30 miles/week, an extra 3 miles/week isn't really all that different. It's maybe 4-5 minutes longer every run. \n\nEven at 70 miles/week, assuming running 6 days/week, that's still only 8-10 min more per run.\n\nYou’ve hit the nail on the head. For me, most plans progress way too fast. I’m not in a hurry. I don’t need to run a 10k in 8 weeks. I have zero interest in that. \n\nAt the same time, I also strength train. Yes, there are plans that have strength training and running. But all of them are using strength training for running. I am primarily a strength athlete that likes to run. I’m not strength training for running. \n\nFinding a plan has been ridiculously frustrating. So, I created my own. It does not follow any “rules”. But, it undulates between recovery, short, and long runs. And, it adds a little to the long runs each week, and also slowly brings up the recovery and short runs. I don’t to do sprints or intervals. I understand, fully, their value. I’m not trying to be a “runner”. Running is a kind of calm meditative thing for me. I like where I’m at, I like my program, and I like what I’m doing.\n\nI don’t mean this rudely, but if you just run because you like running and don’t have any particular goal why do you need a plan? \n\nI follow a very loose schedule when I’m training for something, but when I get back into running after the summer doing other stuff, I just go for a run a few times a week: how far l or fast depends on nothing other than how I feel and how long I’ve got. I often think it’s nicer than knowing that there’s a 45-min tempo to do between now and Wednesday.\n\nBecause I want to run from my house, around a near-by lake, and back. In order to do that I need a slow progressive plan. I was not able to find a program that was at the right pace, and that considered strength training as a main activity, and running as more of a side piece. \n\nI guess I don’t need a plan per se, but I don’t do well with just running in the wind. I need to know when it’s time to turn around. Having a slow progression for distance just gives me guidelines. I’m not a “just run a little further each day” kind of person. I need a specific turn-around point.\n\nMany blessings to your marriage to your own training plan. You made me laugh. The basic marathon plan that I follow is a combination of plans I have found online and it has worked for me for various marathons. \n\nI find that many free online plans tend to ignore the importance of strength training/core/cross training. Which I think is irresponsible. Most plans are lacking guidance and variety of runs.\n\nI will admit this training cycle I actually purchased a $30 plan from a podcast I listen to. But I did it to see if I can make further improvements and just to try something different. I like that it encourages strength training and CORE and those workouts are in the calendar. The schedule is very well rounded with all types of running workouts. We'll see how it goes.\n\nGood luck to you! Nothing wrong with doing your own thing! Whatever works to keep us running and performing is all that matters!\n\nI've jumped around on training plans, to mix things up. I purchased one training aid, a pulse oximeter ($6-ish on Amazon). It made setting paces and perceptions of difficulty, child play to calculate. Most (80%) of my running is at a forever pace, and 20% is with stretch goals such as strides, intervals, climbs or a long run.\n\nMy goal is warm up, run, and cool down at 1 hour. (except the long run). By going at a forever pace, I still have energy to lift weights, stretch, or whatever, and live a life. \n\nIf I am not able to enjoy a full life, the exercise program becomes a drudge that eventually will be dropped.\n\nI have a coach now but my first time I went sub 3 in a marathon I DIY’d and peaked at 45 mpw. Now I was far from a novice, been running for 15+ years and this was my third marathon. But life got in the way with original plan and was averaging less then 20 mpw, dropped from Full to half…PR’d half somehow and had 8 wks until another marathon. There’s no 8 wk Marathon plan starting at 20 MPW so I took pieces and knowledge from past builds and made it work. \n\nIMO…If you are and experienced runner that has worked with coaches and/or done plans in the past you should 100% be able to successfully DIY a plan and see some success.\n\nI run twice a week.  A 10k loop each time.  All DYI and never used a plan to get there.\n\nI derived my own plan from an intense pre-made 10k to fit my schedule. 3 runs a week, long run up to 11km. Pretty sure the increase in milage was too sharp despite reducing the volume drastically. Have problems with shin and calfs now...\n\nBut I'm a special case of no sport for at least 3 years, overweight and overpronation. Wish I were  more careful.\n\nI honestly started with a DIY plan that was from reddit and it worked. But i had to mix it up with running hard for 2-3 days and then complete rest one day and then cross training after. IMO, the DIY regimen isn't the hard thing. I found that keeping with a regimen to see the results was harder in my prep. I used a [running coach](http://www.sweatsparks.com) to help me stay on track and it worked. So the TL;DR is that there are tons of DIY regimens out there, but I think it's about staying on track to even see your experiment through. DM me if you have any questions on my running journey.\n\nLet me try and find the plan that someone posted on reddit for you\n\nI let my Garmin Forerunner 255 do the training planning - worked out well for yesterday's Berlin Marathon 🤷\n\nThough I am not training for a race, my current running plan is of my own creation. I build it off of my old experience as a high school runner, just catered toward my out of shape slower body. I plan approximately 1 month at a time and have drastically increased my performance condition and running capacity. I enjoy doing my own plan, especially because I feel like I can more easily tweak and adjust the plan as I need and based on how I am feeling.\n\nThe knowledge you need to have to make your own plan that is better **for you** than an off the shelf one isn’t that high. Even if the off the shelf plan is made by someone who knows better than you, it’s not tailored for your particular physiology and previous training level\n\nI think that if you made your own plan, it is working for you and you are happy, go for it! And congrats on being able to put up a plan by yourself! I personally would have no idea how to do it!\n\nI think that no matter the plan you follow, the best one is the one that makes you improve with no injuries and that you like to follow so you can stick to it in the long run. Consistence is the key. \n\nGood runs!\n\nHonestly it depends on what your goal is, and what constraints you have. If your goal is to improve as quickly as possible, and you're prepared to make it your singular focus in life, then going with an existing training plan or even getting a coach is the best way to go. If you want to maintain and improve general fitness, training around a full time job, family, and other commitments and hobbies then a diy plan or modifying an existing plan to work for you is totally fine, and going to work for your goal.\n\nPersonally I modify existing plans to work for me.\n\nI wear a Garmin watch and have a Garmin coach plan in place. It’s been exceptional for me. Adjusts my plan constantly depending on how well I ran, how much rest I got, etc. \n\nI’ve been doing a lot of “base runs”, which I understand is fundamental and boring but it’s easing me into running. I did have a tempo run and sprint session lined up twice but it reverted back since I probably wasn’t ready for it yet. \n\nI trust the process and am excited to see how I progress with the Garmin coach plan.\n\nThe thing is, when I made my own plan to run a marathon, I didn’t want to make one that is better than the hundreds already available online, I was trying to make one that suits ME, MY body, MY experience, MY running ability and MY lifestyle… all of which I know better than anybody else. I made my own plan… run two marathons in 3 years with it!\n\nI have never ever followed any type of plan. I run as long as I want as fast as I want. Generally that’s about 4 times per week each between 4-11 miles. I’ve been able to satisfactorily finish half marathons this way although not the fastest in the world of course. \n\nIf I wanted to set a PR or increase my speed I’d follow a plan laid out by someone who knows more than me (a low bar), but I seriously just run for the fun of it and don’t really have a competitive nature. Works for me!\n\nI've done 25 marathons,  24 halfs (no. 25 is in 2 weeks), and countless 5k and 10ks. I used a pre-made training plan for the first two marathons,  modified the plan for the next couple, and then pretty much every one after that I have written from scratch based on whatever is going on in my life and the time I have before the race to train/how long it will be since my last. I've even done a couple without any plan at all and just going by how I'm feeling and what I did the week before ( one of my best marathon times came after doing that for the second time). \n\n\nAfter awhile a custom made plan based on you and your experience will be better than any pre-made training plan. \n\nI have a coach so I don't have to think about it\n\nIf you are a new runner, you really need to stick to a plan.  If you've run 5k races, and 10ks, etc .... you probably have built up your abilities to the point where you know your body.  I still remember couch25k and it's insane how out of shape I was.  That program is why I can train for long races today.   Because without that novice program I would have never run a 5k in my life.\n\nIn general, the training plans are good because you can make your own (if you are an experienced runner) that just takes in the key concepts.  Like, one day of week is hell.  By hell I mean intervals or hills.  Or toss in a long run once a week.  Or cross training on the bike.\n\nFrankly after 10+ years of running, I need variation to fight boredom.\n\nYou're a newbie. This is premature optimization. Pick a beginner plan, run it to completion then see where you stand.\n\nChat GPT does a very, very good job of building you a custom training plan based on your current status, allowing for particular events, fitting with your schedule, and prioritising certain workouts if you want. I just did a 2 month training plan to prepare for a 10k, 5k and half marathon after feeding it various health stats (it can read screenshots from Strava) and got it to include a regular running group I'm in and Parkrun as some of my runs, and it gave me periodised blocks with different focuses geared towards each of my events including tapering and recovery.\n\nAnd it made me a downloadable spreadsheet calendar with all the sessions too.\n\nAt the moment, I follow a plan discussed with ChatGPT. There is a ton of running content on the web such that ChatGPT advice should be relevant.\n\nI just specified my initial capabilities (mpw, pace, max long run), where I wanted to go, and my agenda constraints.\n\nEverything just went smoothly.\n\nOh great idea! It can customize using a larger data aggregate.\n\nI actually just did this too! I am currently following Higdon’s base building plan, which goes from 9pm to 15mpw over 12 weeks. I want to get to 25mpw so I had it make a plan for me. It’s decent but needs a little tweaking. I have knee issues and plenty of time to get to where I want to be so I am okay with taking a long, slow build.\n\nI used chatGPT to write my half marathon training plan. It worked surprisingly well with a few modifications.\n\nThere are no rules. If it works, and you're making progress, and not overdoing it then who cares where the plan came from.\n\nBest is to hire a coach. If I’m spending 8-12h a week running, and I can afford 1,000$/year, there is no way I’m not getting a coach.\n\nPeople who pay for training plans made by a “professional” make me laugh. They just end up doing basically the same thing you’d do if you followed general training principles.\n\nNot if you don't know these \"general training principles.\" A beginner is going to have no idea how to ramp up mileage, what intensity, how important it is to vary your workouts, etc etc. I sure didn't, and ended up pulling a hamstring a month before my first big race. Might have still happened with a plan, but you don't know what you don't know at first.\n\nNobody said “do whatever you want with zero research or knowledge at all”\n\nTry googling \"training plans\" and you'll get a million wildly differing options. Snickering at people wanting a professional to help narrow it down and feel confident in their plan, makes you look like a jerk. My point still stands, if you're just starting out you don't know what's good advice or what your best options are. Sure plenty of people can figure it out, but no one's an idiot for trying to make a good decision.\n\n&gt; Try googling “training plans” and you’ll get a million wildly differing options\n\nAnd they’re all probably adequate. Do you sell training plans by any chance?\n\nAgree with OP. The extent to which our own body responds to training is so variable. \n\nI ran many 10s and ultra half marathons without a formal training plan, running 3 days a week (long run up to 20km) and managed fine.  Did a 50km run as part of a charity event without much more significant training than ‘usual’.  They felt amazing for about the first 30km, hurt in the last 10km. Recovery wasn’t dramatic - back out running within the week. \n\nFinally signed up to do a marathon and figured I ought to follow a training plan, which after a bit of research, was Hal Higdon.  It’s an understatement that I overtrained following the plan.  My marathon was sluggish. Painful from about the  30km mark, near unbearable in the last 7km, and I’m almost certain that was due to the accumulated strain and fatigue. Recovery was at least a couple of weeks just to squeeze out slow shuffle.  \n\nI’m back to 3 runs per week and am letting Garmin suggest my two shorter weekday runs, which takes care of building fitness and speed for another half, without overtraining."

    "all_comment_text": "It’s not about speed, it’s about consistency. I tried running too fast always and didn’t appreciate slowly progressing over the course of the run, but made a HUGE difference. And as the weeks/months progressed, I started increasing my pace subconsciously \n\n\nEveryone is doing their own run, speed run, long run, whatever. I’m doing my own thing so when someone passes me, or I pass them, I keep saying that\n\nLastly, when I’m on my runs, I try to think of a certain distance I can “always” do.\nFor me, even for long runs, I keep saying “i can always run 1 mile” and have the mile i’m running (ie from mile 6 to 7) be the goal. Then from mile 7-8, THAT mile is the goal. It helps when you are feeling tired but need a way to motivate yourself.  Since it’s as much a mental sport as it is a physical one\n\nTo tack onto the “I can always run one mile” mentality—if I’m struggling, I tell myself, I just have to get to x mile, then I can stop. Usually, it’s the first few and I haven’t been feeling like going for a run, so just telling myself to just run one or two, then I can stop gets me out the door. When I was doing long distances, that would usually end with me doing a much longer run because I’d be over the hump of getting started.\n\nThis!!! I am a running newbie as well and I tell myself this all the time.\n\nSince the week I was able to do 3x 5K runs in a week, that 5K was set as a default: even if I'm including strides or some fast intervals, 5K is the minimum I have to run, because I know that I can do it. Now I'm running by my own plan/schedule I made two weeks ago, today there was a very taxing 6K run in the morning, tomorrow should be a rest day, so I cheated and this evening I also did a zone 2 10K, to help me cope with the upcoming rest day.\n\nFor me looking at individual kilometers is just a distraction at this point, I'm doing it when I'm already pushing for a new distance record, but until then I know that I can do it, I just have to run at a steady pace. So this consistency helps me to remove this \"just one more km\" mindset when I'm doing stuff I already did many times.\n\nIt's incredible how mentally comfortable I can be while I'm pushing myself, early summer I've struggled with the first weeks of 0to5K, now I know myself and my body better, can trust my capabilities more, have more confidence.\n\nLast week's long zone 2 runs helped me break all my records this week, while consciously keeping every parameter in a \"safe zone\". Now that I've seen the progress, I can trust zone 2 too. There's plenty to learn still, but consistency will move some conscious struggles into \"it's like breathing\" category. At the beginnings I was like \"I hated running with a passion my whole life, couldn't even run properly, my lungs are shit, I was a heavy smoker for the past 2 decades, I can't do it\". 0to5K program proved me wrong. My first zone 2 runs were super slow, almost my walking pace, I was thinking I'm so out of shape, this will take ages. Next week it proved me wrong.\n\nMost hindrances in running are just negative preconceptions about your abilities. It's time to let them go.\n\nImpatience is my issue with this. Yes, I know intuitively that by not going as fast I won't get as worn out by the run and can even go longer distances, but taking so much time to get through each lap or gain distance or whatever is just so hard on my brain. I feel that I need to think I'm progressing at the best rate I can. And it's just a psychological issue. I know that if I try going fast I can barely make it through 1 mile, let alone any more than that but taking so long for each mile in a 5k or something just wears on me for some reason\n\nSomething is better than nothing.  \n\nYou don't have to go out and smash your 5k PR or do a half marathon.\n\nJust get out and have a crack.  If you can go for an hour, great.  If 15 min in you're like \"fuck me, today's not the day\" that's fine as well.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is be kind to yourself and give yourself permission to suck.\n\nThis - 3k runs \\*count\\*. I feel like some people think anything less than 5k isn't really worth it. But it's way better to just be outside of the house with your running shoes on, than not. I got into running by letting myself do something like a 3k run 3 times a week to begin with. Starting with really mini weeks with low mileage made it feel manageable and fun.\n\nAbsolutely.  Even 1k is good.\n\nMaybe it doesn't do much to make you faster but it's feeding a habit and establishing a pattern of activity.\n\nAs of 2016, Usain Bolt is quoted as having had NEVER run a mile (and may still not have). You don’t have to run long distances to be in shape.\n\nI started with 7 times 10min runs to months ago. Now I'm at 30-60min runs 6 times a week. Consistency really is key\n\nEvery runner experiences their “day” every once and awhile where everything just goes RIGHT. Pace and cadence feel good, heart legs and lungs are great, the stars align if you will. MOST days arnt like that though and this is where consistency is key, stay in whatever zone feels comfortable and log some miles. The long slow progression will happen. Not everyone, including myself, can go out and run sub 6 minute miles without training. But I’ll get there one day\n\nOne thing people should know is that for me and many others, seeing other people running is a joy. I keep to myself on the trails, but internally I'm cheering for everyone I see running-- get it! You got this! We are really out here in 90degreee heat... Killing it. Lol\n\nIt's easy to let the judgments creep in, but just know there's a fan base out there of runners who, if they see you, have nothing but support to offer-- I just don't want to interrupt your focus or scare you by loudly screaming supportive messages.\n\nWhere I live, there's a whole bunch of 40+ runners (like myself, 50f) out on the street at 7 or 8 in the morning, all at different paces, and we all just do the gentle head nod or hand up/wave gesture, maybe even a \"Morning!\" as we pass each other, and I don't know anyone's names nor would recognize them outside of running, but seeing this community of runners out there is such a wonderful, quietly supportive feeling. \n\nI love the feeling of community! I recently spent a few months living in Manhattan and it was so nice to feel a part of that running tribe. I ran every day I was there (so fun to run in cities like NYC with bridges and rivers and people and different routes every day), and there was always some faster person passing me somewhere on my run (usually along the Hudson), but I was also passing slower runners too. I am pretty sure zero fucks were given about me, and I also assumed that the young, fast males were just like me when I was a young, fast male; they were out there blasting out a few fast miles, because that's what's fun when you're young. I was out there grinding on my long, slow miles because that's how you get faster endurance miles.\n\nRight?! I can barely contain myself to not give high fives when seeing other people running. Unfortunately, where I run everyone tends to mind their own business while exercising, and even nods or hand waves are extremely rare. But even with that, and my own preference of running solo, seeing other people out and about exercising in whichever way they choose is a great motivator.\n\nUnless that's what motivates you, keep the competitive attitude for the races, and just enjoy yourself and others around you no matter how fast or slow you are going.\n\nLol I assume every \"slow\" (subjective and relative) runner is doing their long or recovery run, and every \"fast\" runner is doing tempo or speed work. \n\nI assume everyone faster than me is doing speedwork 🤣🤣\n\nI'm going to say the same thing I told all the newbies I online coached in weight training when I was huge into basically powerlifting: \n\nDO NOT CARE about what people think and here is WHY...there are basically two groups of people:\n\n1. People who have been where you are and gone through that stage. They might be repping 4 plate squats now, or benching 315, or running a sub 20 min 5k and 90 min half, but they know from experience being a beginner and they WANT MORE people in their group...they WANT the newbies who are squatting 65 lbs shaky or walk jogging a 45 minute 5k because those are people that are on the way to joining them and you are WELCOME\n\n  \n2. People who can't do, won't do, aren't doing, they are sitting on their ass so you're accomplishing more than them and they know that so even if they were to pretend to judge...they actually know they aren't allowed to \n\n  \nSo just don't worry about it. Especially from the ones doing 'better' than you because at least 99% of them want you to succeed and support you\n\nI started running when I quit drinking. (Also a little after my 40th birthday). I'll be sober for 5 years on October 12th. If I could go back in time to tell myself anything it would be:\n\n \"Go easy on yourself, there isn't any need to make this any harder than it already is. There's a reason why a lot of people don't run, it's HARD.\" \n\n5 years later, I'm the fastest 45 year old I know, have already completed my first marathon (A spectacular blow up in Miami) and am trying to find the will to get in a spot to qualify for Boston. \n\nIt never gets easier, you just get better. You're doing great just by being out there. As has been said already in this thread: Consistency is key. Results will come. Stay with it.\n\nCongrats on both your running and your sobriety!\n\nHey! Thanks! It's been a very difficult journey, but nothing worth doing is ever easy.\n\nConsistency is key. Over time you'll start to feel (and even look) more like a runner as your body adapts and changes to the stimulus. Keep it enjoyable enough that you stick with it, even if it means going at what feels like a snails pace. \n\nI got very easily passed by a guy probably 20-30 years my senior a few months ago.  We ended up next to each other at a stop light and chatted.  He was on mile 3 of 4, I was on mile 12 of 14.\n\nJust to reinforce the point you were making.  Let people think I'm struggling, that's fine, they don't know I've been out here for two hours already.\n\nMy advice to the newbies: Run.  Just get outside and run.  Run fast, run slow, run however you feel like running.  Explore new routes. Pay attention to what you’re seeing and hearing and enjoy the sensations.  If you don’t enjoy it you won’t stick with it.  \n\nTrust your intuition. If it’s a slow day then let yourself be slow.  If it’s a fast day then air it out.  \n\nAnd keep track of what you’re doing.  Record your runs, whether in a notebook or in a spreadsheet.\n\nThis is good advice\n\nNo tips but yes I feel this running and cycling.  \n\nAlso have had that thought of “nobody knows how long I’ve been running”. \n\nLast run there was a pair of runners passed me. I get up to them a bit only to see that they were doing intervals \n\nNothing better than keep going after runnning side by side with someone doing intervals lol. Its a nice boost to self confidence\n\nEspecially when their intervals are NOT planned…\n\ni love this, when maintaining a steady pace on a long run and catch up with someone who has finished an interval i feel like the terminator 'i just don't stop'\n\nYou should compare yourself only with past yourself.  There always be someone faster than you (besides you are Usain Bolt)\n\nI would tell people to focus on injury prevention. The engine/cardio part will improve very quickly but you gotta take care of the chassis (joints, muscles, tendons) as it may be a little rusty and prone to injuries especially if you increase your load too quickly.\n\nIt’s okay to take walking breaks\n\nMix up your runs. Keep them interesting and fun. I sometimes run along a canal path and I bring my Cocker spaniel along. She runs off the lead and runs along with me. Watching her run brings me joy. I’m going to be going out after a while to do some interval training and speed work. Don’t compare yourself to anyone else. I was overweight before and worked hard to lose weight and I am now at a healthy BMI. Being 30 lbs lighter has made running so much easier and more enjoyable. Consistent training and running is the key. I’m not fast. But I’ve gone from running 5K in 39 minutes to running 5K in 25 minutes. I can comfortably run 10K in under 1 hour. Running can be hard and a lot of runs will be difficult at the time. But you never regret going out and completing a run. 1 in 15 to 20 runs will be amazing and you will get a real high feeling during it and afterwards. They are the runs when all the hard work pays off.\n\nThis sounds cliched and corny - but have fun! If you aren't enjoying it, slow down a bit. If it's terrible and humid, don't go as far. \n\nI'm a mid 40s dad who picked up running again a few years ago, after 20 years break. My nightly run is one of my favorite parts of the day. The other day I was cruising home, big grin on my face, about 7 miles in, a great jam going, so happy amongst other things that as a mid 40s guy I can run for an hour a day!\n\nJust about every runner I've met so far seems to agree that anyone running at any speed is awesome 😎\n\nDude, when I think about the fact that the current marathon record holder ran a 4 min and 37 second mile for 26 miles my head wants to explode. I can't run a 4.5 minute mile or 26 miles, let alone together. So if I'm going to judge my running by someone else I'm always going to fall short. So the only person I'm really competing with is old me, and most days I do better than her, but occasionally I don't, and I just run again the next day. There is always going to be someone faster than me, I'm never going to be an elite runner, but I have always hated running and been \"bad\" at it. Now I genuinely enjoy it and watching myself get better at something I've always been bad at is really cool.\n\nMy one advice is to NOT listen to music when learning to run, as it distracts, and makes it harder to focus on correct form.\n\nFor me I just don't give a flying fig what any one thinks as I run. If I'm on a canal path or what have you I often acknowledge them. \n\nJust thinking about my runs now and i know it doesn't even cross my mind what anyone is thinking. The truth is they probably are thinking about what they are gonna eat for dinner or what's on their shopping list. \n\nIf you do think about others, think of it this way, it's like a half glass half full scenario. \n\nYou can be positive or negative. They might also be thinking, gosh look how inspirational this runner is, I wish I was as awesome as him/her.\n\nDont compare yourself to others. compare to yesterdays you. compare to last weeks you. compare to last years you.\n\nYour main goal, especially at the beginning, is just consistency. Your speed you can work on over time but getting your body used to running and recovering well is the priority from the start\n\nYou’re so right. \n\nI worry constantly about what I look like when I run and I’ve been doing it since 1994! When I start getting in my head I try to think about if I remember what the last runner I saw was wearing, or their size, anything. Most of the time I cannot even remember that last time I saw a runner, period, let alone the details. It’s comforting to me to just wear and run comfortably no matter what I might look like to the world.\n\n1. Don’t skip your warmups if you want to run long term. It will catch up with you one day if you constantly neglect warm up and recovery. \n2. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who others are today \n3. Don’t forget to stop and look back at the mountain you’ve climbed check out the view and remind yourself where you started and how far you’ve come\n\nDo you have a good warmup that you recommend?\n\nThis is the only one I can do consistently -- it's fast and fun.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cacwri2wio4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cacwri2wio4)\n\nI guess thats why running is such an amazing sport - it welcomes everyone to run at their own level and pace. Some people will try to hit their sub 3 hour marathon, while some run because it helps with their mental health, and some to simply to loose a couple of pounds. Either way its a sport you can make both extremely hard and competetive, but also very peaceful and therapeutic. Its beautiful. Go at your own pace, and remember you do it for yourself :-)\n\nDidn't start running till I was 46. A little concerned about pace and then I realized it doesn't matter. If you pick up your feet you are a runner. It saddens me how much I see elitist crap on social media. I don't want anyone to be discouraged from running. In my view we are all welcomed.\n\nAnother piece of advice from a newbie:\n\n\n\n\nscrew what anyone else thinks. I'm 6'2\", overweight and old. I must look like a panicked elderly pregnant heron when I run.\n\n\n\n\nI couldn't give a wet slap what anyone else thinks. I go out, and I run. Screw em. Laugh it up. I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it for me.\n\nMy advice is to instead loudly shout “who gonna carry the boats” to give the impression you are in fact David Goggins and are just rounding out your 200th mile.\n\nBut more seriously, no one is spending much time hating on you for being slower or tired - most will give it no thought at all, focusing on their own workout. The few that do will most likely think it’s good you’re pushing yourself and not hate on you.\n\nAdvice to newbies is concentrate primarily on form and gradually building volume to 3-4 runs a week, and then gradually adding distance to one of these as your long run of the week. From there you can keep adding distance to all the runs - shoot for about 10% a week, with every fourth week cutting back 30% temporarily to give your body a break.\n\nGreat advice and Great Google Goggins voice in my head made me laugh. \n\nLess so now, but I have struggled with motivation to run at times, particularly in the midst of a cold and wet UK winter. The best advice I ever got was to put your kit on, lace up your shoes, open the door and *then* decide if you're going for a run. That way, if you decide not to, it's a conscious choice and that's ok. Mentally, it breaks the negative cycle of just putting it off.\n\nlove that advice :-)\n\n\"Forward\" is a speed. \"Fast\" is a highly objective term. \n\nForget what anyone else is doing. If you are running for the approval of other people, it's not worth it.\n\nFor me as I'm now 45, I've found that I'm happy to stick to 5-10km distances.\n\nI'm only competing against myself and my waistline.\nOther runners will be doing the same... It's not the Olympics so don't stress\n\nWhat's the advice you're giving?\n\nJust run your own race.\n\nI don't really have much to add to what others have already said but as a beginner runner this has been such a useful post. Thank you so much.\n\nProud of you OP - what an accomplishment. I think the rule of thumb is very closely aligned with other areas of our interaction with the public - no one cares about us as much as they care about themselves! \n\nI feel as though I run with poor form too and when I stop to take a breather and just walk, people WALKING are going faster than me. \n\nThat voice of self doubt gets smaller and smaller each time we run, and it gets replaced with something much more useful. Lately I have been trying to focus on increasing my pace when I get to the tree, or the house, or the car, or the light post; the struggle to breathe honestly drowns out the voice and it becomes a literal game of survival 😭😂 like just breathing deep or desperately wanting a drink of water cause I’ve pushed myself. \n\nI am 29F and have only just got into running in 2022.. I stopped but have picked it up again and now having the same thoughts. Again, proud of you. We got this!\n\nRight there with you!! I'm turning 40 in a few months and I want to feel stronger and more fit again. I feel like I am dying and I am just doing the 5K with a 12 minute mile. But it feels good to have things slowly getting easier. There's a 10K in October I'd like to do just because it's in a fun place and they don't have a 5K, but I think I won't be ready and I'm actually just happy knowing I'm getting out there a few times a week.   \nIt doesn't help I turn beet red so people always ask if I'm ok lol.\n\n&gt;I have been telling myself on repeat that when I jog past the local gym and everyone is incredibly fast and toned and zooming past me that they actually they have no idea how far I have been or I am going. I might just be struggling through a 5k but the casual passer by doesn't know thats not my 20th kilometre of the run. \n\nI can say for myself that I absolutely don't even think about that when I see another runner. I usually just think \"oh cool, another runner\" and wave.\n\nI genuinely notice what sort of running vest, hat or shoes people are wearing far more often than I do how fast they're going.\n\nedit: there have been a few exceptions: I was running along the Charles the day after the Boston Marathon (which I did not run) and I absolutely noticed how fast the guy in the \"TEAM KENYA\" heavy winter coat and wool hat was running. He was obviously doing an easy recovery run...and passed me like I was standing still. That kind of thing I notice...\n\nIdk if it's only me, but when running in a treadmill i can run faster and for longer periods of time; and when running outside near the river, i feel like i run slower and get exausted faster.\n\nLet yourself celebrate your victories, with NO \"but\"s or caveats. When you run your first mile without stopping, brag about it! The first time you hit a pace in an interval workout. The first time you get up and run before sunrise. The longest run you've ever run. No \"I know it's slow but...\" or \"I know it's not that far but...\" Talk about it, write it down, take a picture. Mark the moment because someday you'll beat that PR or distance and it is so sweet to look back at how you've developed.\n\nDays when I am lacking motivation I just tell myself \"let's go out there and just run really slow and take it easy\".  Most of the time my first mile may only be 30 seconds off my normal pace but the subsequent miles are right on track.\n\n“everyday it gets easier, but you have to do it every day, that’s the hard part”\n\nI have 2: there's always going to be someone faster. The sooner you can accept that fact, the better things will be going forward. The last one is to go easy on yourself. Take a break if you have to, drink that water, and eat when you're hungry. The speed is a byproduct and it'll come.\n\nMy mindset is I’m focusing on getting my body used to distance first then speed later. I want to be able to run 2-3 hours straight vs the 1 hr 30 min I am capable of these days. Also if you’re running in the hottest time of the year for your state/province/country give yourself grace. You will be slower or not go as far or have a higher heart rate. But know that it’s still working and when you get that temp drop your results will unfold and bring you great pride.\n\nI’ve been running consistently for like 2 years and the best advice i have is to treat showing up like winning a race at first because is the hardest part and the biggest accomplishment. It sounds like a cliche but it’s true!\n\nWhen I started, I didn’t have good shoes, I put a ton of pressure on myself to get faster and go farther, ate way too little and hadn’t discovered the actual joy of running. Acclimating to running enough so that you actually like doing it can take a really long time, so for a while it’s just this socially awkward, super hard and frequently uncomfortable thing you do. So my advice is to show yourself genuine appreciation for showing up because you’ll look back and realize what a mountain you’ve climbed by doing it.\n\nTry to find something about running you enjoy outside of looks, speed, distance and everything else people get hung up on. Sometimes I don’t track how far or how fast I’m running. I find a cool spot and roughly map out the distance and just flow. Now when you are training that can be hard, but try to get back to the joy of running. I run first for my mental health, the rest comes after, is what I remind myself.\n\nThat people are not as harsh or as interested in you as you think. I see plenty of runners while driving or walking and usually my first thought is, “Cool, another runner. Good for them for getting out there.” The thought crosses my mind in one second and I don’t think about that person again.\n\nConsistency. Progress is non-linear: things can go from feeling easy to hard randomly but keep showing up and stay consistent with your weekly volume and you’ll see your easy pace fall lower and lower.\n\nthis is so cliche but the advice is “i promise no ones looking &amp; if they are, they dont know”. personally speaking, i look at other ppl bc im nosy but i just look, idk what rep theyre on or mile theyre on. i used to be so self conscious that ppl will look &amp; judge me but oh well!!! we’re all so caught up in our own lives that we dont really notice other ppls\n\nOne of the things that I think is really important in the beginning of distance running is to find that spot where your breathing starts to sync with your pace. \n\nAfter that, it kind of becomes like muscle memory and everything feels less difficult. My natural pace, where my breathing feels effortless is a little fast, which means I probably won't be able to sustain it for as long of a distance as some folks, but my runs feel really good physically and mentally. I would rather have a good 3-5 mile run than push my body too hard for more distance. That's just me though, some people love that push and challenge!\n\nI like to give myself a mini round of applause when I have completed a decent chunk of my run (maybe about 40-60%), its so stupid but it makes me feel proud of the fact that no matter how the run has gone, I have gone out and started it in the first place, and ran some distance. \n\nAlso I like to use music as a powerup like in a video game, no music til after halfway, and then I will push as far as I can until I feel like I need a proper boost, then I will put my headphones in, this then makes the last part of my run feel like im super fresh and helps me split up the run in my head. Music really effects me when Im running and definitely can help me a lot, so I like to use it to my advantage.\n\nThe opportunity to run, regardless of age, pace, cadence and whatnot, is already a joy by itself. That person you see going at 4min/km might be doing interval training, while the other one who's cruising at 7min/km might already be on his or her 20th km. I am a slow runner myself, and one thing I've learnt is never to judge other runners. There are days where you overtake someone, and there are days where they blitz right through you. Bottom line? No one cares, and it doesn't matter. The key is to enjoy the workout, and don't let any personal insecurities take that joy away from you. Happy running!\n\nI just started running and even though I absolutely know I look a mess (older and a former smoker for over 30 years ) I also know it's pretty badass so it balances out. It doesn't matter what it looks like on the outside.  Onward.\n\nRun slow to run fast. It works. Consistency. Don't go over zone 2-3. Brisk walk if you need to but not for long. Push.\n\n80-90% of your running should be easy running. If that means you have to walk up the inclines, do it. This will help in building consistency and endurance without getting injured. Think \"time running\" instead of setting distance goals for your runs. Your interval workouts should end when you still have the energy to do \"one more lap\". More time on interval-pace with slightly slower pace, is better than all out running for a shorter period of time.\n\nI give a rats ass what people think of me. You should try that some time.\n\nRun without headphones. It's safer. It won't mess with your heart rate. We're already on our phones enough. It's really rewarding to disconnect even just for 30-45 minutes."

    "title": "Race report: My second 10k - From 49:23 to 41:08",
    "body": "### Race Information\n* **Name:** My Second 10k\n* **Date:** October 20, 2024\n* **Distance:** 10k\n* **Location:** Jersey City, NJ\n* **Time:** 41:08\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Sub 7:00/mi (4:20/km) | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 6:34\n| 2 | 6:44\n| 3 | 6:35\n| 4 | 6:43\n| 5 | 6:52\n| 6 | 6:38\n| 0.2 | 6:57\n\n### Training\nRan my first race, also a 10k, two months ago on Aug 18, 2024 with a 49:23 finish time https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1ffaqpc/race_report_first_10k_4923/.\n\nFor some additional context, I picked up running as a result of my friends and I signing up together for the Boston half-marathon on November 10th. We are all new runners and going from beginner to 10k to half marathon. All the training I've done and am doing is leading up to the Boston half.\n\nFrom the last 10k race, I ran a total of about 300 miles, ramping up from 30mpw to 43.5mpw in the week before this race. Compared to the training before my first 10k which was all base building, this training block had 1 speed workout and 1 long run per week which got me more comfortable with running closer to race pace. My \"easy\" training pace improved from about 10:00/mile from before my previous 10k to about 8:45/mile. These 40+ mile weeks had my legs feeling quite dead. I'd been building up mileage for quite some time, which combined with my strength training made me really stack up fatigue. Thankfully I got some good recovery in on race week where my coach had me pull back to 25 miles total with only one workout being a 10k tuneup. \n\nDuring the 10k tuneup I honestly wasn't feeling too good and holding a 6:50 pace for just a few minutes had me feeling sore and winded. I was thinking I might have to play it safer than I thought - my original goal was to run 6:40 based on runalyze's 10k prognosis. I had some signs of either illness or overreaching or both (poor sleep, general lethargy, sneezing/congestion, brain fog) so I allowed myself to be as much of a vegetable as possible in the days leading up the race and just hope my body would activate when the time came. \n\n### Pre-race\nRace time was 9:00am. I woke up feeling great. I had a miraculously good night's sleep compared to the last few nights which were pretty terrible. Learning from my lesson from last race, I stayed away from caffeine in the morning. Ate a bagel with pb2 as well as a clif bar around 6:30am. After a nice bathroom session I laced up my newish Adios Pro 3's (did not have a supershoe for last race), whispered to them that they better make me the fastest man alive, and walked over to the race location. Conditions were absolutely amazing. Around 50 degrees, sunny, low wind, and no humidity. An amazing change from my previous 10k race which was suffocatingly muggy at 75F. I was planning to warm up a bit more but I arrived quite late so I spent 10 mins at a light jog and threw in one stride before lining up at the start line.\n\n### Race\nAnother lesson I learned from last race was that I should line up closer to the front. This time I did just that and it definitely helped a lot, although I could have still moved even further up. Either way, I was only stuck at 7:30 pace for about 0.15 miles after which I had passed most of the people I needed to pass and the course opened up.\n\nMile 1: I don't know why, but running at 6:40 pace felt good relative to how it felt during the tuneup. My form felt great, temperature felt great, and the course was flat and scenic. It was during this first mile that I had feeling that I have a real shot at keeping this pace up for the rest.\n\nMile 2: Mostly was in my head running the numbers, checking in on my fatigue and pace, figuring out if I had it in me to keep this going for another 4+ miles. The first twinges of fatigue were starting to set into my legs. My muscles definitely feel it at this pace.\n\nMile 3: At this point, I knew that I could complete this race at 6:45 pace. But I knew it was going to suck. Fatigue had fully set in and my breath and heart rate were going as fast as they do during my speed workouts. Since the course was a loop, I got a little energy boost running through the gently cheering crowd near the start/finish.\n\nMile 4: Here come the \"wtf am I doing?\" thoughts. In the earlier miles I recognized that it was going to be a mental battle, and the battle had come. Time to deploy the strategies that worked last time: think about why you train for hours and hours each week, recognize that after the race you will regret anything left in the tank, and envision my parents cheering me on at the finish (they came to support!).\n\nMile 5: Pain with a faint glimmer of hope.\n\nMile 6: My legs are dying, but I know the end is near. I'm just in the pain cage until I near the end where I see my parents and I hear them cheer. I point and wave. As my arm falls, before I even know what's happening I'm sprinting. Lungs and heart are ablaze as I finish with a smile formed from a combination of accomplishment, relief, and masochism.\n\nThe last 0.2 mile stretch was definitely faster than the time in the splits table above, but I forgot to end my workout so I tried my best to crop the activity properly in accordance with the official chip time. Didn't really work out so well but I would guess it was a 6:15 pace or so.\n\n### Post-race\nAfter crossing the finish line, I was ready to puke. My body gave me a chance, but I chose not to and the urge went away after a bit. Once I was out of that danger zone, the good feelings started hitting. I knew I had improved a lot since last race, and it felt great knowing that I have this PB to prove it. A lot of things came together for this race: flat course, optimal weather, parents cheering me on, supershoes, and good sleep. After showering I had a yuge lunch with my friends and parents and then plopped on the couch at home to make this writeup.\n\nWhat really took me by surprise is the power of having people you care about supporting you. Upon seeing my parents my body literally moved on its own to crush the final stretch. In that moment, everything was worth it. It taught me a life lesson to cherish those moments. Onward to the half marathon!",

    "body": "[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/inside-the-murky-world-of-the-strava-cheats/BWUUVJP5YJFZLHLAB5TF27NJXQ/](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/inside-the-murky-world-of-the-strava-cheats/BWUUVJP5YJFZLHLAB5TF27NJXQ/) Paywalled article. Contents here:\n\n&gt;**Inside the murky world of the Strava cheats**  \n  \n**Amateur athletes are fiddling their data — from deleting bad times to catching a bus. What happens when they get caught out, asks Duncan Craig.**  \n  \n“If it’s not on Strava, it didn’t happen” is the motto of the hardcore Stravites. Photo / Getty Images\n\n&gt;When Laura Green headed off on her honeymoon she had only one vigorous activity in mind.\n\n&gt;Green and her husband, Connor, were celebrating in Mammoth Lakes, California — where, as Green knew, a friend held the record on the tracker app Strava for running a particular downhill stretch of a mountain trail the quickest. So, with Connor in tow, she spent the best part of a day seeking out this friend’s route, attempting to beat their time — and then wrestling with wi-fi and data-transfer issues in her hotel room to upload the successful run from her watch to the app.\n\n&gt;“It’s still so embarrassing to admit,” the 38-year-old says. “That was my honeymoon!”\n\n&gt;The actions of Green — a Boston-based running influencer with more than 200,000 Instagram followers, who gently sends up herself and her sport — is a vivid example of how the world’s best-known activity-tracking platform can feed obsessive tendencies. But while Green won’t let her obsession twist into outright deception, plenty of other users are crossing the line, and in ever more elaborate ways.\n\n&gt;“If it’s not on Strava, it didn’t happen” is the motto of the hardcore Stravites. Seemingly, if it’s on Strava it also potentially didn’t happen. Or, as Gary House, a Wrexham-based running coach puts it: **“There are two types of runners. Ones that cheat on Strava, and liars.”**\n\n&gt;Subterfuge ranges from the brazen — cycled runs, doctored GPS data, device swapping with a quicker partner to pass their activities off as your own — to the “lower-end stuff, which I see as a bit of fun”, House says. This might include waiting for a freakishly strong tailwind to attempt a prized segment, cropping a slower start or end of a run to make it look more impressive, or corralling friends into “drafting” you — a technique used in running or cycling in which you conserve energy by sitting in someone else’s slipstream — to smash your personal best and stockpile “kudos” (Strava’s currency — similar to likes on Instagram).\n\n&gt;Strava is a juggernaut. It was launched in 2009, initially as a running and cycling tracker, although you can now log more than 30 activities on the platform, including swimming, skiing and in-line skating. In 2023 it was estimated to have as many as 120 million users.\n\n&gt;Cycling, the second most popular activity on the platform behind running, offers even more scope for duplicity. Recording your ride in a car. Using an ebike. Accidentally on purpose failing to turn your GPS watch off before the post-ride drive home. Strava, helpfully, provides a few more ideas via its guidelines. “Keep rides with a mixed-gender tandem bike off leaderboards,” it urges. “Hide motor-paced rides (cycling behind a vehicle) from leaderboards.”\n\n&gt;Topping these online lists is Strava’s ultimate prize: winners get a (virtual) crown and a “CR” (course record) next to their name — also known as KOM or QOM (king/queen of the mountain). Make a top ten and there are further virtual trophies.\n\n&gt;Why else do they do it? In rare examples, cheating can lead to financial gain. Over lockdown, House caught out a Strava user who was posting super-quick treadmill marathon times as the basis to pull in backers for an attempt on a coast-to-coast running record. “The numbers just didn’t add up,” he says. “The make and model of treadmill on which he was doing these times didn’t actually go that fast. From there we figured out that there was an app that lets you input your own data and upload it.”\n\n&gt;The runner was challenged, pulled out of the attempt and “disappeared”.\n\n&gt;  \nManipulation of Strava data was also at the heart of a case involving Kate Carter, an editor at Runner’s World, this year. She missed a mid-race timing mat and posted another runner’s GPS-tracked route map for the London Landmarks Half Marathon last year (noting that it wasn’t hers), and was found to have manually created another Strava entry, for the 2023 London Marathon, based on a course map from a previous year.\n\n&gt;Carter, 47, denied cheating but admitted making some “stupid mistakes in how I recorded my times”, saying her actions were partly ego driven. “Even in the amateur running world there is pressure to maintain form and times,” she said. An investigation by England Athletics found “there was no intention to deceive and no attempt to benefit from the results”.\n\n&gt;Carter’s case was reported by the self-styled “marathon investigator” Derek Murphy. The 53-year-old data analyst has outed scores of cheats since setting up his blog in 2015 from his home in Ohio. He pores over race and self-tracked data looking for inconsistencies, such as missed split times in races or heart rates out of sync with pace. Strava, with its 10 billion logged activities, is a near-infinite treasure trove.\n\n&gt;Murphy is as calmly forensic as the running community is animatedly incensed about cheating. “I simply present the facts,” he’s fond of saying.\n\n&gt;Targeting wrongdoing in big races is one thing. But how much does common or garden cheating matter?\n\n&gt;Green is more than happy to poke fun at the Stravasphere — in a recent Instagram post, she showed herself “dethroning” Olympians on there by targeting tiny segments of their long training runs and flat-out sprinting them, “so they get a notification saying Laura Green is faster than them!” But she reviles genuine cheating. “It’s heinous,” she says. “For me, the whole point of Strava is to see how I match up to others. So if you’re cheating, then it takes all the fun away.”\n\n&gt;House believes the degree to which you care depends on your proximity to any shenanigans. “As I tell the runners I coach, you shouldn’t be bothered what others are up to,” he says. “But at the same time, if someone comes up my road on an ebike and steals my running crown, I’m flagging it to Strava in minutes.”\n\n&gt;Flagging is the bedrock of the self-regulation system that Strava has no option but to rely on, given the volume of activities. Does it work? Not always, according to various threads on online forums such as [LetsRun.com](http://LetsRun.com) and Reddit, and a cursory look at the leaderboards for some of London’s most famous stretches supports these misgivings.\n\n&gt;Take the Strava record — at the time of going to press — for the Westminster Bridge cycling segment: 350m on one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares, in 5 seconds? That’s a tad over 250km/h. It was set by a “Derek Lawrie” in 2020. Let’s hope he warmed up.\n\n&gt;It’s not the blatantly fraudulent, sometimes inadvertent cases we need to worry about, says RunnerBoi, a 26-year-old running YouTuber with almost 22,000 subscribers. It’s the stealthier attempts — and the evolution of these. “Most cheating methods are pretty catchable these days but, as with everything, the next big thing is usually something we don’t know yet,” he says.\n\n&gt;The need for speed can be dangerous. This week, Strava has urged cyclists to delete the Regent’s Park segment from the app after the death of a pedestrian in a collision in 2022.\n\n&gt;One of the most eye-catching forms of cheating on Strava has nothing to do with performance, at least in a conventional sense. A Reddit thread from 2021 pondering whether anyone had caught their partner being unfaithful via the platform drew this reply: “I know someone that got busted: the \\[activity\\] time was much shorter than the time he was gone and so she found him having a lot of idle time with another rider on Strava at interesting locations.”\n\n&gt;One only hopes they remembered to turn their heart-rate monitors off.\n\n&gt;Written by: Duncan Craig\n\n&gt;**© The Times of London**\n\n",

    "all_comment_text": "&gt;Or, as Gary House, a Wrexham-based running coach puts it: “There are two types of runners. Ones that cheat on Strava, and liars.”\n\nWhat? That's just nonsense from this guy. Vast vast majority are not cheating in any way\n\nOne of the perks of being a super slow (but stubborn) runner - I don't care about records, and FKT, and whatnot. I just run for and against myself, and use Strava and Garmin for tracking my own progress. I just don't see the point of cheating.\n\nyeah. I had some GPS hiccups the other day: pausing on the apple watch and unpausing showed a 400m Time of 59 second and more hilariously anther time it was 400m in 33s (Paris here I come) \n\nThere's no reason to keep anything like that in. It's not like I want to be faster than my friends, I want to be able to always see my new PBs.\n\nBang on. The running community is awesome and everyone around me is super nice but at the end of the day it’s an “individual” sport and it’s you against you. \nLying about times only hurts yourself in the end so I see absolutely no need to do so!\n\nI run a lot in my neighborhood and have 3x different segments where I've briefly been at the top of the leaderboard and have often snagged the local legend spot due to how often I run. Two years ago I noticed another guy in my neighborhood that suddenly came in and blew everyone's records; I'm talking like Olympian level 1000m in 2:40 and running the segments *every* single day. Last summer I saw a guy on his bike slowly coming in at exactly the start of a segment while looking at his Garmin and then quickly pedaling until just after the end of the segment. Not too long after, guess what? A new running PR on the segment. I've seen him since then and only ever on his bike... Dude is pretending to run and obsessed with holding top spots all throughout my part of town. It's insane.\n\nSome people have no lives.\n\nThat’s unreal! I can’t imagine having the time or mental capacity to fit that in lol. \nI gota drag my ass out of bed early to get my runs in before the kids get up. The amount of time to set that up would be hilarious and all for a thumbs up on a data platform where no one really knows or cares about you. Poor guy. Has some serious issues he’s gota deal with.\n\nSame, I just try to run more every year and that’s that.\n\nWhen you consider things like having a tailwind cheating, as Gary does according to the article, then it's easy to claim everyone cheats. May as well have also included such unfair advantages like dieting, taking rest days to recharge, running in the evening when it's cooler, etc.\n\nI assume everyone who finishes a race ahead of me is cheating, usually by them having longer legs, being fitter, training more, and being faster than me. Cheating swines.\n\nTraining? Cheating. Slow down!\n\nBorn at altitude in Kenya or Ethiopia?  Cheating\n\nNot to mention the $350 Nike Vaporflys I cannot afford!\n\nYeah that's definitely not cheating, just good planning if your aim that run/ride is to catch segments. It's just a bit of extra fun to add to a workout, if that's your vibe.\n\nI recently nabbed a run CR because a few roads were closed. Normally you’d get stuck at at least one light, but take the lights out and the time was pretty reasonable. I’m not calling that cheating because the stretch of road is closed like 5 times a year \n\nExactly and I also throw down the gauntlet come and get it to my naysayers. Funny how most don't try to steal my crowns.\n\nIs it cheating to use running shoes? Or should I be recording all my times in 5” stilettos?\n\nDarling. You're fabulous either way\n\nThat one annoyed me, too. 😠 Most people don't cheat. He's probably projecting.\n\nCheats justify their cheating by assuming/declaring that everyone else is also cheating\n\nI guess it's a way of clearing their conscience\n\nWe have a saying in Dutch, \"Zoals de waard is, vertrouwt hij zijn gasten\", meaning \"Like the innkeeper is himself, he will trust his guests.\"\n\nLike whoever it was that said the average American commits three felonies a day\n\n\"average American commits 3 felonies a day\" factoid actualy just statistical error. average person commits 0 felonies a day. Felonies Georg, who lives in resort in Florida &amp; commits over 34 each day, is an outlier adn should not have been counted\n\nI know the guy who said that and wrote that book.  Its more a comment on how arcane the US federal law is and how easy it is to commit minor offences all day.  \n\n[https://x.com/CrimeADay/status/1775335212882276817](https://x.com/CrimeADay/status/1775335212882276817)\n\nHe classifies \"running with a strong tailwind\" or \"having a faster friend pace you\" as cheating - he should just stop caring as much\n\nYeah I recently set all my best times on a ride because of a massive tailwind. I wouldn’t call that cheating, that’s just having good weather. \n\nIf your not familiar with his content it is all pretty sarcastic at times, so I would take this literally.\n\nGary House does a lot of satire. That quote is taken way out of context and is [on par for him.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClWO23zgSy6/?hl=en)\n\nYeah, i use Strava myself and have zero interest in kidding anyone into thinking I’m faster than I am. Most people are in the same boat. You get fanatics on the fringes, just like with gaming or any other activity.\n\nIts just pure projection.  When you're guilty of something, you assume everyone else is doing it too.\n\nThere's at least one other type of runner: those who don't use strava.\n\nI don't want anyone to see my workouts. I am uninterested in fake competitions. When I want to compare myself to other runners, I race against them, and then I see how I placed overall and in my age group. I have never, and will never, use strava.\n\nStrava also tracks your progress and your PRs, keeps track of how much wear is on your shoes, creates maps for you that you can download to your watch, etc. You get to see where other runners are going, which is a great way to learn about local trails you wouldn’t have found on your own. And I love seeing pictures of my friends’ adventures! \n\nAs a non-competitive person who doesn’t care about any of the things you mentioned, there are still plenty of reasons to love Strava. Obviously you don’t have to use it if you don’t want to, but I don’t think your perspective on it is accurate.\n\nIt's also helpful for things like, going on a hike in a conservation area with multiple intersecting trails, to figure out which one leads back to your car. Or remembering where I locked my bike after going for a walk downtown. Or \"have I reached x distance yet?\" type of questions.\n\n&gt; You get to see where other runners are going\n\nThis is pretty much the only thing that Strava has going for it IMO, and even that's a tenuous endorsement, since I'd rather use AllTrails for that anyway.  Everything else you mentioned is done better by a different app.\n\nIs there one app that does all of this, though? I like having one place to go for everything running related. But to each their own!\n\nYeah, I get that.  I prefer getting the data in a more ideal form, even if it means 2 apps (which sync with each other anyway, so it kind of a non-issue).  Mentally, I treat them just like as if they were just different tabs in the same app.  I used to also use Strava along side these other 2 apps (HealthFit and SmashRun), I even paid for premium.  Ultimately, I found that I just never looked at it because it was the same data, presented in an inferior format.  Having no interest in the social aspects of it, I just stopped paying for and using Strava; but I do still sync to it just in case I ever change my mind.\n\nRight! What about me? The runner that doesn’t have Strava.\n\nlol. As a slow runner why the hell am I cheating on Strava? Like….  What do I get for my trouble?   “Look!  U/ymi17 ran a 2:05 half marathon instead of a 2:30!”\n\nYeah.  I agree that the quote is just stupid.\n\nYeah, I also reacted to the same absurd statement!\n\nMost people don't care that much about how their fitness regime is being perceived. But I suspect anyone narcissistic enough to worry about it has 'airbrushed' some workouts to make themselves look better. \n\nThe original quote is total bullshit though, I definitely agree.\n\nGuessing he's \"that guy\" \n\nBeg to disagree.  In my locality many are cheating.  There's a local fool that purposely tries to steal every KOM from an 18 year old. The junior is racing on a collegiate cycling team.  The old fool drives his car to steal the segments. \n\n\nGuess what.  I live by Boston.  Absolutely tired of these folks. \n\n&gt;When Laura Green headed off on her honeymoon she had only one vigorous activity in mind.\n\n\n\nLol\n\nOutstanding lede. 10/10, no notes\n\nNice\n\nScreaming 😂😂\n\nWhat a ridiculous thing to cheat at.\n\nCompletely people are idiots\n\nAhhh. Spending your vacation in Mammoth attempting to top Strava charts. A tale as old as [Strava]\n\nNot just your vacation but your *honeymoon*.\n\n&gt; Take the Strava record — at the time of going to press — for the Westminster Bridge cycling segment: 350m on one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares, in 5 seconds? That’s a tad over 250km/h. It was set by a “Derek Lawrie” in 2020. Let’s hope he warmed up. \n\nWell, a lot of CR's are due to faulty GPS data. A lot of segments around my house are claimed by someone running at 5:50 m/km for 10 km but getting the CR by running 2:00/km in that same run. I don't expect them to jump on a bike for 200 meters. \n\nAnd I mean, look at this activity: https://www.strava.com/activities/3615591665#2850056700175783870  The gps is all over the place near the bridge.  \n\nFrom an article called 'Inside the murky world of the Strava cheats' I would expect a little more investigation before throwing accusations around by a snarky comment.\n\nOr people forgetting to turn off their watch and driving off at the end of the run. Happened to me. I simply forgot about my watch after a long hike.\nI noticed after a mile because my watch beeped at me when I drove off. And the crop feature wasn't available at that time. I think I cropped that run years later when the feature became available.\n\nI’d also add that 2020 was lockdown in London and parts of central London like westminster bridge were often empty, which the article doesn’t mention.\n\nI’ve ended up with a couple CRs and had to flag my own activities due to short segments and wonky in-city GPS\n\nyou don't have to worry about cleaning up your own activities from wonky GPS; zealous strava crown chasers will do that for you\n\nI just don’t bother with leaderboards aside from moving my own position up. The top slot is almost always someone who is clearly in a car or on a cycle.\n\nI just figured it’s a tragedy of a public app, so no point in getting worked up about it.\n\nI do like those tongue in cheek “cheats” though, like waiting for a tailwind, I think they’re funny.\n\nI like Strava and I like segment competition (have very few CRs, but a number of top 10's) so I do try to keep local segment leaderboards \"clean\" so to speak. You can report efforts that are clearly in cars or run segments done on bike or by car. Outliers are usually easy to spot and Strava does remove rankings based on the reports. There are so many people who leave their watches on for the drive home so most of it is clearly a mistake and not a bad faith effort to win a particular segment.\n\nYeah, I’m sure for every cheat on the leaderboards there are a thousand innocent mistakes or even just glitches (like the way I apparently broke the 400m world record a few weeks ago in a five mile race!).\n\nI don't use Strava (although I'm starting to consider it, but Garmin's built-in stuff has been plenty for me.) but I regularly forget to turn my watch off when I run on a new route. I have the muscle memory at home to swap it off as soon as I finish, but sometimes I don't notice until I hear that little \"one mile\" beep while I am driving home. I could easily see myself being one of the people who accidentally posts \"cheating\" runs on Strava, hah.\n\nThe point of Strava is the social aspect but Garmin connect has better metrics.\n\nHow do you report them? Is it only available via online? I don't see a report in the app.\n\nI'm not super fast but am in an area with relatively few runners (and even fewer very fast runners) so can definitely take some leaderboard spots. I'm currently #3 in one of them and the top spot is clearly a fake. Probably an unintentional cheat because the person tagged the activity as run, bike, swim training, and the run segment time is clearly bike speed - or they're actually the fastest runner in the world.\n\nIt can only be done via the Web, not the app.\n\nRandom but if you report the activity, does Strava let them know who reported it? Haha. There's a 2.5 mile CR I'd like to grab but the person set it at 48 seconds per mile pace...\n\nI don't think it does. At least it didn't a year or so ago when I got a notification that someone had flagged an activity of mine from 9 years earlier.\n\n48s is clearly not right, just flag it. It's not like they can come knock on your door claiming to run 70mph.\n\nIn one of the challenges, like \"do 400 minutes of exercise this month\", the top person has been doing workouts non-stop, 24/7. Like they already have &gt;48 hours of workouts for June and it's only the 3rd. And all of their activities are on Zwift, biking and running, continuously.\n\nI remember seeing the same person last month and they had *thousands* of hours of workouts for the month. Like more hours than there are in a month. It's clearly fake.\n\nOne of the nice things about being in the Boston area is that there are tons of people that take it too seriously and report activities that aren't actually runs. The downside is that most of the segment records near me are held by pro runners\n\nDitto, but it does bother me when the leader (KOM holder) is so obviously either cheating or has incorrect data and nothing is done about it.  I, and about 8 other guys, are :01 off the KOM on a short gravel (biking) segment that only lasts :15 total.  All of us are at about 22.1mph over the segment, which for me is about 1100w.  Frankly, it would be hard to put down more than that due to the fact that it's chunky gravel and, well, an uphill turn.  The KOM holder did it in :09 averaging 36mph.  Absolutely impossible on a bike.\n\nI don't have Strava because I know I would either turn into honeymoon girl or feel bad about myself by looking at what others do.  Nah.\n\nThat being said I know people who need Strava so they can stop posting every stupid run they do to Instagram. Dude no one cares about every single run you do.\n\nThe bike ride to the corner store for beers really gets me or a walk with the dog!\n\nYou shouldn't feel that way. You can set the app to private and just monitor your own progress if you like. The free version is quite impressive for bio feedback.\n\nI use my Garmin to track all that stuff!! I do like that.\n\nThe thing which most annoys me about Strava segments is when it is so obvious that someone is on a bike/in a car/GPS drift but it's the record. If someone just ran a 30 second KM surely Strava could figure out this was dodgy? Even roll out it out as an \"AI\" feature to be in with the cool kids.\n\nYou can flag these activities where its obvious, which removes them from leaderboards.\n\nSadly on from the desktop site i believe which honestly most of us don't use.\n\nThe fact that so much of Strava can only be done on desktop when it's a NATIVELY MOBILE APP is fucking infuriating. Wanna add or remove gear? Better fire up the ol' laptop.\n\nYou can add or remove gear from the app now\n\nThis. I don’t care about who places where, except for the one time that I made the leaderboard on a particularly gruesome uphill segment in my local park, and then got knocked off by someone who would have been running ~35mph if their time was legit.\n\nI flag anything under or close to 2min./km speed on a 400 meter segment as an example. I kindly explain to them their aveage speed being 7:30/km pace on that run makes things um suspicious! Hello!\n\nI have only ever got 1 crown on Strava. And it was unintentional. Local Legends now - that's where the action is!\n\nHmmm Local Legend status may make you over train or be guilty of garbage miles! Ohhh nooo!\n\nSimple solution: do not pay attention to what other people are doing on Strava. Use it for personal record keeping, cheer on your friends, remember that comparison is the thief of joy. Care about things that actually matter instead.\n\nPeople need to get a life. If Strava is that important to them then they lead a sad life and are obviously missing something to make them feel worthy.\n\nIt's all relative. Strava on it's own can be set to Private and used as a training diary if you want to be all about your own health. As a competitive app it can be addictive and cause problems like \"flag\" feuds and over doing efforts causing injury\n\nThis entire article reminds me of the time I signed up for a bike challenge at work about 10 yrs ago.  You got points on a leaderboard based on how many miles you biked.  Turns out I have some *super* fit co-workers who biked 250-300 miles every Saturday and sometimes 40-50 miles a day 2-3x a week.  Had not just one but several of them.  I tried to make an argument that even if these people were biking 20 mph there was no way they were biking for 10+ hrs every single weekend.  No one cared what I thought and I gave up.\n\nInteresting read. Some people are so weird with Strava. One guy I follow, who I don’t really know but is local, goes around trying to get all the crowns. I don’t understand it. He isn’t a slow runner but he certainly isn’t anything special. Being first in a segment does nothing for my ego and I don’t know they exist unless Strava tells me. So many of the running segment times appear to be people on bikes anyway.\n\nHunting for crowns can be a nice motivating challenge when you don’t have any races coming up. Some do it for the internet fame (even though they’re the only ones that care..), some just to put some variety in their runs. \n\nStrava is supposedly going to fix the wrongly categorized runs. You can always report them btw. \n\nI had some fun with segments, where one other random guy was trying to take back the crown. It felt like a digital/AR game (similar to Pokemon Go) and it motivated me to push harder in real life, which improved my times overall. So it has potential to bring some fun. :)\n\nI love it and in my 60's stealing a crown from a 25 year old infuriates them. They come back and keep trying. Point is I'm a sprinter and he's a 5 k expert. 2:30 pace over 500 meters is my thing. 3:00 pace at 5k is his thing.\n\nI don’t see any issue with that tbh. I wouldn’t do it, but could see why someone might find it a fun challenge.\n\nMaking up times or using a bike on running segments is absolutely ridiculous though.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI use the segments as part of my weekly interval training.\n\nYou seem to have seen all these \"bike\" runs then making this statement?\n\nI admit I pause my watch at traffic lights. Guess I’m going to hell.\n\nThere's a Strava Hell you know....\n\nFWIW\n\n[https://archive.ph/26Agw](https://archive.ph/26Agw)\n\nTIL people use the app to compare themselves to random people in their area\n\nlol right? The way I could not care any less about the random people in my neighborhood who I’ll never know….\n\nI followed a random guy in my neighborhood about 8 years ago. We ran a lot of the same routes and segments. We'd comment about different trails, conditions, etc. I moved away but we still cross paths at bigger trail events and make encouraging comments on runs.\n\n&gt; There are two types of runners. Ones that cheat on Strava, and liars.\n\nEh, not me. I actually think it's annoying that Strava calculates your time/pace based on when you're moving and not while stopped. The behavior of Strava is that it helps you \"cheat\" by excluding time while you're not moving. \n\nIt didn't used to do that, and people would always pause their tracking when stopped at a stop light, while in the bathroom, etc. I never did that because I always wanted to know my actual time.\n\nIt just seems stupid that Strava says my pace power-hiking up a steep hill is 16 minutes/mile when the actual pace was twice that because I had to stop a few times to take a break.\n\nYou'er wrong! Elapsed time is included in the final analysis of your run. Thats tee tell all on one's effort and should be mandatory to show.\n\nElapsed time does show, but it’s annoying that you have to click into the activity to see it. Definitely creates a different impression to only see the moving time when scrolling through the feed.\n\nWell that’s something I have asked myself. On 2 particular segments I realized over time I might get the KOM and started working towards it. They are on my commute which is about 20km. BUT the current leader did get the crown on a 100km+ ride. So no matter what, it will anyway not be comparable in terms of effort/capability.\n\nI got my Strava account temporarily suspended for 'suspicious activity' because one of my favourite things to do when i'm not running is go round segments and peoples PR's and report clearly cheated times. Think I did too many reports in one day.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI saw an announcement from Strava recently that they have AI flagging in the works for that kind of pace error. No idea when/if it will roll out though. Or whether it will only be applied to fresh efforts, or will clean up the old data too.\n\nThe Runners World editor incident was just completely unnecessary\n\nI really can't even conceptualize the point of cheating at something like this. Like why?\n\nThis is garbage. I worked my ass off to drop my marathon PR from 4:53 to 2:06 and if people don’t believe my Strava proof, then what’s the point? \n\nUnrelated but I’m really enjoying my new ebike.\n\nDepends how you define cheating. \n\nI mean, I couldn’t give a fuck what other people see or think of my “achievements” but I do use Strava (and Garmin) to keep track of my miles \n\nSo on the rare occasions I’ve had charging mishaps and failed to track a run, I’ll find another run on the same route in my history that was roughly the same total time and muck about with the file to get the right date and time. \n\nThat would doubtless look like “cheating” but what does it matter to anyone? It’s not like jumping on a bus in a race to get a faster time!\n\nI'd stay clear of mucking around with files lol!!!  Just do a manual post and say what you ran. No big deal.\n\nAm  usually so tired from my runs that i only have the energy to update my gear and name  of the long run. This cheating issue is mostly with influencer s and other people with more followers.\n\nI think it is unhealthy mental gymnastics that causes people to cheat on Strava. Same kind of gymnastics that causes people to cheat in online gaming.\n\nBut compared to online game cheating, cheating on Strava has no negative effect on other people. I find preoccupation with other people's strava accounts completely unhealthy except for when you want to learn something about training of accomplished athletes.\n\nIs this the 2024 equivalent of shaking a pedometer?\n\nI have never used strava and don't think I will.... I'm just raw dog running these streets\n\nLots of folks out there running for the wrong reasons.\n\nI just use Strava to track trends of how I can run now compared to how I could run the same time a year ago. What would be the point of doctoring my times?\n\nDishonesty is common, but cheating in everyday training is not where this shows up. Most people aren't mucking about with their Strava data -- at least not the people I follow. At worst, I might see someone pausing their watch between hard track repeats or claiming a faster Strava PR than their offical race PR from races where their GPS measured long. This sort of thing is cringeworthy but nowhere near the level of deception this article implies is rampant.\n\nAs someone that never posts anything online, I can’t believe this is a real thing. But then again I guess everyone is an attention seeker this day, and I guess it’s only natural that would extend to runners?\n\nLO fucking L\n\nBizarre behaviour. \n\nI'm quite obsessive with my Strava , I immediately check it after a run but not to beat other people , it's a tool to push myself to improve. I do take pride when I noticed my 10k time was now better to a guy who once seemed impossibly far beyond my level but that's it. \n\nI actually deleted a recent run as a glitch had me smashing my P.B when I knew I had only ran a modest pace. The thought that others might've thought I had manufactured that glitch was too embarrassing to let it stand.\n\nHuh? Never even considered cheating on Strava, guess I’m not a runner 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nI am in my 60's and training for Masters sprint distances 100- 400 meters. I use the segments on the roads to measure distance and pace and time and compare my efforts BUT! I always make mention that my effort was a standalone effort ie: standing start and slowdown at the end of the segment and acknowledge the leaderboard as runners who kept running on at a great pace something I could not do. But here's the thing. Yeah there are those who say this is not cool and you should include segments as part of an overall \"long run\". Alas I do check out the leaderboard metrics map and sure enough even the long distance runners are slowing down before the start of that segment and and at the end after belting a 100% max effort on it.\n\nHaving Strava has allowed me to meet new people and ride routes I didn't know about.\n\nBut one thing I can't stand is people's posturing. It seems as if someone sees that sporting activity as an excuse to upload photos of themselves on the Internet.\n\nAnother detail that I have seen is that there are people who, not that they manipulate their data, but they record it in a way that makes them look different.\n\nI see the profile of someone who runs the 5k over 20 minutes in races and, his Strava marks as best time 16 or 17 minutes. How does he do that. Well, by simply recording a 5x1k interval session, for example, and pausing the breaks. That way they only record 5k at a very good pace, faster than they are capable of in a normal 5k race.\n\nDetails like that there are many.\n\nI'm currently very burned out on Strava and have it on private. I hardly upload anything.\n\n&gt; I see the profile of someone who runs the 5k over 20 minutes in races and, his Strava marks as best time 16 or 17 minutes. How does he do that. Well, by simply recording a 5x1k interval session, for example, and pausing the breaks. That way they only record 5k at a very good pace, faster than they are capable of in a normal 5k race.\n\nBest times don't work like that on strava. It includes the paused time.\n\nThe only difference is that the avg pace will look higher if you pause your watch when recovering, because for avg pace it doesn't take into account breaks.\n\nI don't know how things work on Strava, I'm just saying what I see: people who have a 5x1k interval session as their best time in a 5k.\n\nThey may say \"New PB\" on the event but it's not logged as the PB. Their stats page will only show their best elapsed time.\n\nIt won't be their official best time as Strava does take into account the paused time as the other poster stated. You're right though in that you see activities regularly where the post snapshot thing shows their time as their moving time which can be much less than the full activity time so it will appear as though they've ran much quicker than they have. I don't see the point in that really. I'm a bit of a data nerd and I much prefer everything to be included, walking and resting etc.\n\nHuge controversy this year at Quicksilver - one of the female placers missed a turn and was DNF'd a day after the run. It was discovered because her Strava map looked different.\n\nI am not harmed by people falsifying their Strava data.\n\nFascinating 🤨 \n\nLike lying about your golf scores lol \n\nIn my year of using Strava, I never once considered cheating so my slow ass would look better lol.\n\nAbsolute loser behavior of the highest caliber\n\nI have low self esteem and even I wouldn't ever think to do something as pathetic as cheating on Strava.\n\nIt would be no different than stuffing my face and gaining 50 lbs or becoming a chain smoker. The whole point of running is to *improve* my health, not ruin it further. Physical or mental, it's all the same.\n\nPlus, once you go down that dark road of narcassistic insecurity, it will inevitably bleed into other areas of your life. Never ends well.\n\nI know a few people that will show something like 4.58 miles on the splits, but the distance of their run will be sometimes as high as 5 miles. Sometimes it's closer to an extra quarter mile on their runs. What the hell is that?\n\nI briefly dated a guy who was in his 40s and would lie about his race times and blame it on the mats being off. Every single time. He claimed he had run Boston in 2022 at a roughly 6 min/mile place but his finishing time was much later in the day, than my older brother, who ran a 4 hour race and also started in a later corral than he did. His Strava post didn't match the Boston website. He would edit everything to make himself look faster. What was more strange is that he would show up at the college he went to and try to show up the current athletes during their practices and would enter whatever meet he could as an unattached runner. He of course wouldn't win, but he was that delusional. Reminded me of Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite, chasing a delusional dream and lying to people in the process. \n\nThis is a public social media platform and I find it pretty unsettling how obsessed people are over the idea that others are cheating. It's no different than any online game you would play, or the cesspool that is Facebook\n\nI honestly can’t stand Strava. I truly believe it nudges people into training stupidly. I’ve been at this running thing since 1994 and could care less for Strava. I think it’s far too easy for people to start worrying about these dumb awards or what their followers will think about their run time or pace and then they’re running easy runs too fast or whatever. Training in a way that is actually detrimental and not helping them. \n\nDo I post my routes sometimes on my own instagram or whatever? Sure. But no one needs to know how I’m training, and probably no one cares about it either. My running is my running. No one else’s business.\n\nThis is why I got rid of Strava. At best, it's meaningless and a waste of time. At worst, it can be harmful. Way I see it, if people don't actually care about your runs, it's hollow, meaningless bullshit. If they do care about your runs and they're paying attention, what are you getting out of sharing them? Is that actually good for you? For me, it made the good days better, but the bad days much worse knowing that stuff was out there. I'm not a believer in selectively sharing highlights to make myself look better, so I just got rid of it entirely and took workouts back as a thing that's just mine.\n\nIt can be motivating to see how people who are faster but not elite (a better but potentially attainable level) train.  It's also a social network where things like politics and other points of contention are largely absent.  It can get to some people though, stupidly aggressive long runs get the most attention, you have to consciously avoid the pull of that and do the boring consistent stuff at the unglamorous paces.\n\n[deleted]\n\nCould and couldn't care less both mean the same thing. It's a phrase, you don't have to take it literally. Language changes based on how it is used. If enough people say \"I could care less\" to indicate that they do not care then that is what it means.\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/could%20care%20less\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/could-couldnt-care-less"

    "all_comment_text": "I did not notice a difference in injury, recovery, or performance when I was doing yoga 3-4 times a week, as compared to not doing yoga.\n\nI have noticed fewer injuries after starting strength training targeted toward my problem areas.\n\nYoga was sometimes nice for my mental health, but anecdotally, I don’t think it helped my running.\n\nLines up with the scientific evidence. Mobility is good for mobility and little else.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo mobility isnt useful, unless you are looking for mobility, im glad you agree. Also as to grass deep squats really don't offer that much to runners. This coming from a guy whose original sport was alpine skiing which is all about leg conditioning and where some mobility is actually required.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou are absolutely right.  Mobility is *essential*. If you are not exercising a muscle through it's full range of motion, you are leaving yourself prone to injury by not activating synergist muscles.\n\n\n For example, somewhere else on this thread someone was talking about how hips and glutes are not worked as much as calves and lower legs in runners. That is precisely because most runners aren't going through the full range of motion, and thus not activating those muscles. This is the reasoning behind getting your knees up when running, it activates those upper leg and hip muscles.\n\n\nYou'll really notice that muscle engagement with sprinting. You can't sprint without going through the full range of motion to include your upper legs and core, activating your glutes, hips, and core; making them stronger and strengthening the whole muscle chain.\n\nThis\n\nMobility may not directly affect running but those end ranges require strength in some cases. I’d think that someone less flexible who becomes more flexible through stretch and strength work would benefit in running.  On the other hand if you already can do things like the Asian/Slav/deep squat, or sit in some end ranges pain free I imagine that you might benefit less. \n\nYMMV but my ankles and knees have been less prone to injury since actively practicing deep squatting and heel sitting.  I’ve upped my mileage over the last year with barely any disruption.\n\nsquatting super deep is not necessary for good form nor is it that useful to runners so you're back to square one. But hey, whatever floats your boat, it's all the rage these days with the influencers even though there is no research indicating mobility has any usefulness if you don't lack mobility for your sport. Which unless you're doing hurdles chances are you don't.\n\nYou're getting downvoted but you're right.\n\nYoga can be more than just mobility, depending on the type of practice.\n\nWhatever the case may be its a poor use of time and effort  if you wanna improve at running. If you just like yoga cuz you like yoga go nuts.\n\nI agreed with you (mostly!). It can be a decent substitute for strength training on occasion if you vastly prefer it to weight lifting. But targeted strength training is going to be better than yoga for getting stronger.\n\nRunning is still the king of making you better at running.\n\nYoga alone won’t solve you being injury prone, I always have done tons of yoga, but I am super injury prone (working on that). Yoga plus regular strength training, along with addressing any issues *early* with a PT before they become full blown injuries is the way to go.\n\nTo be specific you need to strengthen the hips and glutes. That is the most common weakness in running. Calves and feet strength typically improves over time with more running.\n\nHere is a good one I do recently: [https://youtu.be/ukqmDWK4pIY?si=L4vJiFG8WOV7p6ZK](https://youtu.be/ukqmDWK4pIY?si=L4vJiFG8WOV7p6ZK)\n\nYeah, that's what I have been working on. According to my running coach, many new runners suffering from knee or calf injuries is because of weak glutes, hips &amp; hamstrings. Training those muscles will benefit you on the way to running longer, injury free and a more efficient running technique. \n\nThe main reason people have weak glutes, hips &amp; hamstrings is because most of these people have the typical office work lifestyle where you spend most of your day sit in the office.\n\nThere really isn't anything in that video that you couldn't get out of yoga. Like Bridge *is* a yoga pose, but there's also the progression to [Wheel](https://yogapose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-6-2.jpg), or poses like [Extended Hand-to-Big-Toe Pose](https://www.yoganatomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/uttitha-hasta-yoga-anatomy.jpg), [Warrior III](https://cdn.yogajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Warrior-3-Pose_Andrew-Clark_2400x1350-1024x576.jpeg?width=1200), [Locust](https://liforme.com/cdn/shop/articles/Locust_Pose_-_Shalabhasana_01.webp?v=1712604657), and [Goddess](https://www.yogaclassplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/goddess.jpg) to name just a few. Hips and glutes are *everywhere* in yoga\n\n If that's the level of strength training required, then any reasonably well rounded yoga practice should be hitting it, and it'll be more varied and have natural progressions built in. You can also easily find classes specifically for leg strength to incorporate in\n\nWhich for me is a lot more fun and rewarding than doing sets and sets of the same thing over and over again.\n\nIsometric exercises will not build comparable strength progress compared to isotonic exercises (flexion). Yoga is typically using static holds, not concentric/eccentric movements. Range of motion is absolutely vital for building muscle.\n\nOP would make infinitely more effective progress by obliging training specificity rather than general adherence. After a given point, personal preference doesn't matter when it comes to objective outcomes (e.g. liking yoga more will not confer the same injury reduction benefits as strength training).\n\n&gt; Yoga is typically using static holds\n\nThat is just not true. It's entirely dependent on the type of yoga you're doing, and even focus of the class. Yin, restorative yoga, Hatha, tend to be slower and more static, sure. \n\nGet into your more dynamic, flowy yoga (vinyasa, power yoga) and you're getting plenty of isotonic movement; speed, reps, weighted drills, the works. Classes focusing on building strength will use strength building exercises. Specificity, also entirely possible with yoga.\n\nThe more effective training is the training you do; which is where personal preference really does matter. \n\nDoing the above video for a couple of weeks before getting bored to tears and dropping it will accomplish very little. Finding a sustainable practice, with progressive difficulty, that you enjoy and are engaged with will be better in the long run\n\nThe absolute best strength methodology for yoga simply does not compare to even middling methodology for strength training. That's not even a debate.\n\nIt's absolutely no contest, especially in terms of mechanistic response, progressive overload, etc. The only reason you'd select yoga is personal preference (subjective value), and prioritizing personal preference will do nothing to progress goals such as injury reduction (objective value).\n\nDoing yoga will make you better at yoga. Doing strength training will make you better at being strong. The outcome here is not to get better at yoga, so yoga is not directly useful. Specificity is everything.\n\nThe goal here, in this thread, is to have enough strength to prevent injury during running. As far as anyone has been able to be specific about what and how much strength that is (e.g. the linked video above), it would seem that it is easily within the levels of strength training possible with yoga. \n\nWe don't need to be too concerned with maximising strength or the speed of building strength for this use case; just that you can get enough strength in a reasonable amount of time. Which we can do with yoga\n\nThe important bit you are missing then, is the principle of reversibility: that if you don't maintain an exercise routine, you will lose your progress in it. So it is not enough to just get strong, to just build some strength and leave it.  You have to at least maintain your routine, forever, for it to be effective. \n\nThat is where personal preference is key. It is useless to give someone a highly efficient way to gain some strength if they can't or won't sustain the practice. Not being arsed to do your strength training because it's boring, is going to be a much bigger factor for a lot of people than the efficiency of something they don't do. Finding an enjoyable practice solves that problem.\n\n&gt; As far as anyone has been able to be specific about what and how much strength that is (e.g. the linked video above), it would seem that it is easily within the levels of strength training possible with yoga.\n\nThis is an incorrect assumption. The level of investment for strength training towards a practical outcome requires only a minuscule amount of effort and time (i.e. minimum effective volume) compared to what it would take someone achieving the same practical outcome using yoga (if possible at all in some muscle groups, since it would be very interesting to see how yoga would offer sufficient resistance for pulling exercises when all you have is a mat).\n\n&gt; We don't need to be too concerned with maximising strength or the speed of building strength for this use case\n\nBoth of these points are wrong.\n\nObviously, individualistically maximizing strength is the outcome. It's just not the goal in itself, and once the practical outcome is reached then it's simple enough to coast on maintenance volume.\n\nWhen it comes to adherence, easier effort is more manageable than harder effort. That means, given equal input, faster results are better (except the inputs are not equal since strength training is far more effective).\n\nSince you try to bring up unexplainably poor adherence as a reason strength training is somehow inferior, it's hard to understand how you're being genuine if you think these two points aren't important to adherence.\n\n&gt; The important bit you are missing then, is the principle of reversibility: that if you don't maintain an exercise routine, you will lose your progress in it. So it is not enough to just get strong, to just build some strength and leave it. You have to at least maintain your routine, forever, for it to be effective. \n\nThis has nothing to do with the points. No rational person is going to keep doing yoga when it doesn't provide what they need.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you understand what you're talking about, because as mentioned above, reducing to maintenance volume is exactly why you don't have to put in as much effort once you've achieved the strength outcome.\n\n&gt; That is where personal preference is key.\n\nAgain: personal preference doesn't matter if you can't manage the stimulus necessary for the requisite level of growth to accomplish your goal.\n\n&gt; It useless to give someone a highly efficient way to gain some strength if they can't or won't sustain the practice.\n\nNowhere has OP stated this is a concern. You are bringing your own personal struggles to a public discussion.\n\nBut even to address the point, why would you suggest a methodology that A) requires more time, B) requires more effort, C) provides drastically worse results is somehow superior to a methodology that A) requires less time, B) requires less effort, C) provides better results?\n\n&gt; Not being arsed to do your strength training because it's boring\n\nNot properly taking full care of your body because it's \"\"\"boring\"\"\" is infinitely more detrimental, and frankly puerile.\n\nIt's fine if you personally enjoy yoga and hate strength training, but that doesn't change the reality that strength training is better for, you know, training strength.\n\n&gt; Finding an enjoyable practice solves that problem.\n\nOne last time: the outcome is not to satisfy personal predilections. The outcome is injury reduction, which is obliged by building muscle. Strength training is the best course to building muscle for that outcome, yoga doesn't even come close.\n\nMuscle groups in question were stated, they're easily targetable with yoga. You will get the results needed, perhaps just not as quickly. \n\n\nAgain, we really don't need to maximise strength here, individualistically or otherwise. We aren't trying to build as much strength as is possible, we are trying to *enough* to prevent injury. Yes, yoga will work\n\nAnd yoga also ultimately becomes less effort as you progress, so it's no different. \n\n---\n\nYour personal preference may be for a boring thing that gets it done as quickly and efficiently as possible; that's fine, that's one solution, if it works for you go for it. That is your personal preference though. Maybe you don't even find it boring, who knows. It's all subjective\n\nMy preference, and I know I'm not alone here, is that I'm willing to trade some of that ease and efficiency for it being less boring, which means I do it more. I actively want to do the practice, because I enjoy it and find other values in it, so I don't mind it being inefficient. It's just another solution to the problem.\n\n\nSimply telling people they shouldn't be unmotivated isn't a solution. Finding ways to keep them motivated is. People are subjective, what keeps individuals motivated is subjective. It's all a matter of personal preference. Finding a practice that you personally will keep at *is* a way of taking care of your body\n\nOffering different ways of achieving the goal, of which yoga is a perfectly valid one, will help more people than just offering one solution that doesn't work for everyone and calling them names when they point it out.\n\n&gt; Muscle groups in question were stated, they're easily targetable with yoga. You will get the results needed, perhaps just not as quickly. \n\nSo then what are the answers? How are you targeting muscle groups that are only primarily engaged with pulling exercises, at a sufficient intensity and volume for appreciable growth?\n\n&gt; Again, we really don't need to maximise strength here, individualistically or otherwise. We aren't trying to build as much strength as is possible, we are trying to enough to prevent injury.\n\nAs mentioned above, maximizing effect of effort is highly important for objective results and also highly relevant to subjective adherence.\n\n&gt; Yes, yoga will work\n\nBe specific. How, exactly, are you training strength in a muscle group like hamstrings in a comparable time frame with comparable results?\n\n&gt; And yoga also ultimately becomes less effort as you progress, so it's no different.\n\nYou're so close.\n\nIf it's no different...then the points you tried to make were not relevant to strength training at all, because it has nothing specific about strength training...\n\n&gt; Your personal preference may be for a boring thing that gets it done as quickly and efficiently as possible; that's fine, that's one solution, if it works for you go for it. That is your personal preference though. Maybe you don't even find it boring, who knows. It's all subjective\n\nSo you're saying that because strength training is easier, faster, and better than yoga...it's worse than yoga?\n\nAnyway, this is all irrelevant. OP did not state or imply that they struggled with adherence. You are inserting that. One might just as easily say yoga is bad because it's boring (which would be a baseless, facile thing to say).\n\nWhat OP has demonstrated is the ability to apply discipline in order to achieve objective results (such as injury reduction). In that context, the appropriate answer to their question is strength training, not yoga, because there is no reason to infer that they're incapable of basic strength training (which, again, requires less effort and time than yoga for better results).\n\n&gt; Simply telling people they shouldn't be unmotivated isn't a solution. Finding ways to keep them motivated is. People are subjective, what keeps individuals motivated is subjective. It's all a matter of personal preference. Finding a practice that you personally will keep at is a way of taking care of your body\n\n&gt; Offering different ways of achieving the goal, of which yoga is a perfectly valid one, will help more people than just offering one solution that doesn't work for everyone and calling them names when they point it out.\n\nNone of this is addressing anything here, you are involved in a conversation composed of one person.\n\nThis is not less embarrassing than just admitting you don't understand what you're talking about. Do you really not understand how transparent this all is from an external perspective?\n\nThanks for this!\n\nExactly what I’ve been looking for thanks!\n\nA good yoga routine incorporates strength training within the exercises, many of the poses have that built. Bikram should be avoided.\n\nIt is easy to dump into your joints instead of doing active poses (especially lunges, warrior poses, etc) so you definitely have to make sure you're activating all muscles while doing yoga. That's the one thing an instructor can't really see from the outside so it's up to you to make it happen.\n\nUnfortunately I learned that one the hard way\n\nI teach yoga and correct that mistake often, it is important to know what muscles are involved and not to dump weight into joints.\n\nGood to know it can be corrected! I wish my instructors in the past caught it!\n\nHi there. I use to do bikram yoga before the pandemic and then started running when I couldn't get to classes...so running again for roughly 4 years. Recently I went bank to a bikram class and then my very next run I got injured. I'm interested to know why you say bikram should be avoided? Part of thought that my injury was a result of doing a bikram class.\n\nA good yoga practice strengthens the range of your mobility. Bikram melts your muscles to help you contort and I would not recommend it.\n\nFrom what I've heard you can overstretch your muscles\n\nIs that what it does? Overstretch?\n\nStrength training and foam rolling help keep me (knock on wood) injury free. I’m starting my marathon block and hopefully those two keep me going. Also running really slow helps. Zone 2 for life baybee\n\nThe Peloton app has an on-demand “yoga for runners” series that I love (and that I supplement with their “strength for runners” classes). \n\nI was going to comment this! I always do a Peloton yoga for runners video after my runs and it really helps speed up my recovery time.\n\nHad no idea this existed! Looking into it!\n\nOh who teaches the strength for running series? I’m intrigued\n\nStrength is Matt and Becs, yoga is mostly Kirra, Kristen, and Mariana (though tbh I do “focus flow: hips” classes as much as the running-specific options, in part because there are more of them). Andy also has some strength classes that were inspired by his track and field days.  \n\nAwesome thanks, Matt and Andy are two of my favorites.\n\nI’ve found that yoga is better as a recovery tool for my running. I like Pilates for developing body awareness in the kinetic chain and strengthening the muscles involved in movement. It has improved my form and helped me to avoid injuries I’ve experienced previously.\n\nNothing like hitting the poses/foam roller after a workout/runner.\n\nThis is my experience as well. It’s great for warm-up and recovery.\n\nI'm 45, and I did yoga and running for years. At my age now I'm getting vastly more benefits by cross-training with Pilates and then lifting weights. Many of the Pilates movements are much closer to things I've done over the years in PT. If you're getting injured, muscle tightness can be part of that but tightness has a lot to do with weakness.\n\nI have also added Pilates in the last 6 months and think the core strengthening is helping a lot with running longer distances over terrain. I also do yoga and strength training. Yoga helps keep the stiffness and tightness at bay and I recover faster (due to less tightness and soreness).\n\nStrength training is WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY more important, no exaggeration. Yoga is good, mobility is important, sort of, but strength is king.\n\nOk what is your definition of strength?  I do leg day 1-2x a week, mostly squat, leg press, lunges, some machines.  Is there specific strength stuff I should be targeting for running?   I definitely don’t feel like I anything to strengthen my hips abductors/rotators at all.\n\nGlutes and hips strengthening specifically 2-3 times a week.\n\n  \nHere is a good one I do recently: [https://youtu.be/ukqmDWK4pIY?si=L4vJiFG8WOV7p6ZK](https://youtu.be/ukqmDWK4pIY?si=L4vJiFG8WOV7p6ZK)\n\nMan's so nice he posted it twice!\n\nCan attest, was injured for 6 months and Physio made me work these boring yet painful things.  Helped a lot. I think. I'm still slow.\n\n3 days is a little excessive imo, at least for someone in their 40’s. Especially if you’re trying to run 2-3 days a week on top of that. Also, some of us are on our feet all day at work, walking an average of 5 miles already\n\nGlutes and hamstrings are the biggest for me. If I am hitting Bulgarian split squat, single leg deadlift, and hip thrusts even just once a week that's pretty much all it takes to keep my legs in check. I do filler exercises here and there for calves/soleus and some regular front/back squats throughout the week. The only mobility I do is varying amounts before and/or after a run as needed and maybe on an off day. \n\nSome would do a lot more than I do, some would do less, but this has worked for me for about 2 years now. \n\nFor context, I run about 50 miles per week or 6-7 hours.\n\nAnother thing I'll add, I try to do at least 1 trail run per week, or something with varied elevation. If I run flat all week my legs start asking for more strength training.\n\nYes! Trail running is great for ankle strength and mobility plus its great to run in the woods!\n\n&gt; I do leg day 1-2x a week, mostly squat, leg press, lunges, some machines\n\nThis is all anterior chain work, and not really engaging the posterior chain. You want to be prioritizing glutes, erector spinae, hip flexors, hamstrings, calves, etc.\n\nAdd deadlifts, hip thrusts, nordic curls, hyperextensions, weighted calf raises, etc.\n\nAdditionally, exercise selection is only one piece of the puzzle. If your methodology isn't encompassing progressive overload on sufficient volume, or your nutrition isn't encompassing sufficient protein, or your recovery isn't encompassing sufficient sleep then you won't grow.\n\nOr buy a kettlebell and use that for swings, squats and other moves that you learn along the way\n\nNot really, kettlebell-specific exercises are not great, the creator has even admitted as such. They're really only useful as fancy dumbbells, you want slow, controlled movements.\n\nLol @ \"the creator\". You don't know what your taking about.\n\n\nI do agree that kettlebells are a \"Jack of al traits, but a master of none\". They take up little space in your home, they're fun and they combine well with running.\n\n&gt; It wasn’t until 1985 that the sport was modernized and formalized across the entire Soviet Union.\n\n&gt; “That was when the sport was shortened to ten minutes per exercise for as many reps as possible,” says **Steve Cotter, founder of the International Kettlebell and Fitness Federation**. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; At this point, kettlebells were a fully-fledged sport in the old USSR, but implementing them for fitness – not for performance, but for wellness, rehabilitation, a healthier heart, and so on – has an entirely different motivation and practice.\n\n&gt; “When we say kettlebells for fitness, we mean people are using them to get in shape but not necessarily competing in a kettlebell sport,” says Cotter. “In the sport you’re doing many, many reps, one to two hundred without stopping. Fitness has a different energy system and a different mindset.”\n\n&gt; Cotter and others credit the spread of kettlebells as a sport to Valery Fedorenko, a world champion from Kyrgyzstan who migrated to America, taught the sport, and founded the World Kettlebell Club in 2006.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; Usually, the credit goes to the Belarusian Pavel Tsatsouline, a former trainer of Soviet Special Forces soldiers. Pavel is now the chairman of StrongFirst, Inc. and a subject matter expert to the US Marine Corps, the US Secret Service, and the US Navy SEALs.\n\n&gt; “The origin of kettlebells for fitness was about the year 2001, that was when Pavel started (the certification course) the Russian Kettlebell Challenge,” says Cotter. “The marketing used with that is what first started this kettlebell fitness phenomenon that we’re still experiencing today.”\n\nhttps://barbend.com/kettlebell-history/\n\n&gt; What are your thoughts on “hardstyle” versus “sport” style kettlebell lifting; should there be a line between them, do they complement or work opposite to each other?\n\n&gt; Hardstyle is a brand. Kettlebell Sport is a modern way to use kettlebells. Personally I don’t care too much for names. I like what is good and **to me kettlebell is mainly an endurance or power endurance tool.**\n\n-----\n\n&gt; If it is to breathe hard and sweat there are so many ways. If it is to get maximal reps, well there is a sport and it is based upon modern science. Why reinvent the rules.\n\n&gt; To be clear, there are many talented athletes who subscribe to all different types of loading and rep schemes. Yet it should be obvious that to be well-educated in kettlebells, one must be familiar on some level with all different applications.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; What is the best kind of training program for holistic health?\n\n&gt; The BEST can and will change; however whatever it looks like, **it has to include knowledge of basic exercise science principles such as law of adaptation, law of overload, law of individual difference; also how to structure a training to include warm up (prep) main part and cool-down**; it also has to include knowledge of flexibility and how to care for your own body\n\n-----\n\n&gt; They say hindsight is 20/20… looking back now is there anything you wish you had known before you started lifting kettlebells?\n\n&gt; So the way I see it is, what would I do different or better yet, how would I teach my own child. That is easy to answer, **I would have gone directly to the best sources for information and not learn bad habits in the beginning that may take a long time to unlearn! Learn the breathing, static strength, how to relax and alignment from day one**.\n\nhttps://www.kbfitbritt.com/blog/all/steve-cotter-interview\n\nJust use conventional lifts with dumbbells, they're easier, safer, and more effective.\n\nThe interviews you quoted don't support your argument. I wouldn't want dumbbells in my home: they're less (or not) suitable for ballistic exercises and (partly) because if that, they're less fun.\n\nMake sure you are practicing progressive overload with your strength (consistently trying to increase weights)\n\nThose are all great, try to incorporate calf work and tibia raises/band pulls as well. Those have helped me with shin splints and Achilles tendonitis from running.\n\nThis right here could very well be contributing to your injuries. 2x a week leg day with running is rough.\n\nMake sure you’re incorporating calf workouts.\n\nYes. Also 42 and have gotten a few injuries and niggles as I started running. Strength training has helped tremendously. I focus on the legs, obviously, but give lots of play to the posterior chain. Hamstrings, glutes, and all the way up to the traps. I feel like these are often undertrained in many people, but are vital in supporting the activities we do.\n\nI rely on yoga and some additional body weight exercises, and have been injury free for my many years of running, which includes a lot of competition and 70+ mile weeks. For me, yoga is a great companion to running\n\nPilates, not yoga. My lower leg injuries were happening because my core was weak and I was unbalanced. My right leg would compensate for my left when running. Happened so much, that tendinitis developed in the ankle. \n\nMy physical therapy was centered around core strength with some legs here and there. Since leaving in early June, I'm noticeably stronger and can go longer distances now. \n\nFound that the exercises we were doing were Pilates based.\n\nMakes sense because Pilates was originally created to help injured vets and athletes recover!\n\nCheck out Yoga with Adriene on YouTube. She has videos specifically for before/after runs that I like\n\nI like Adriene but I just started getting into Run Better with Ash also.  I've been doing good post run stretches for a few weeks now. \n\nOh thanks! That’s super helpful!\n\nI’m your age and I definitely feel better when I do yoga although not necessarily just with running but general mobility - getting out of bed or off the couch or up from the ground, etc. I try to do 10 minutes of stretching after every run and then maybe 20-30 minutes of yoga a couple of times per week. \n\nI agree that strength training is much more helpful for injury prevention especially glute and core strength. For glutes, doing unilateral moves (one side at a time) is great for correcting muscle imbalances than can lead to aches and pains and things like runners knee. I like to go to Pilates/barre style classes or lift weights.\n\nNearly 60 y.o. been running since junior high.\nGame changing things to add.\n1) strength training with weights.  At the University,  the football weight coach took pity on my scrawny body. He gave me about 8 exercises for my lower half,  it paid huge dividends. \n2) yoga. It improves core, balance, flexibility. \n3) Martial arts.  I did Tae Kwon do as a kid. The tumbling exercises is what I credit to minimizing falls on the trails.\nEither I stumble and don't fall, or my falls are rolling with me popping up at the end. \nProblem is finding time and $$ for all the above.\n\nThe combination of building my running routine around Chi-Running and my yoga practice definitely improved my performance and kept my injury free. During the period that I included yoga in my workouts I went from running 20 miles a week to 32 miles a week while increasing my average pace.\n\nMy experience (40m) is that it helps to a point. I do 10- or 15-minute yoga videos on YouTube when I have the time, about 0-3 times per week. When I don't get to do that, I feel a lot worse.\n\nIn the past, I had a membership to a yoga studio for about a year, going to hour-long classes several times per week. I didn't notice any improvement beyond what I'm getting now with short YouTube videos. At least for me, the point of diminishing returns is pretty low.\n\nI also tend toward \"power yoga,\" that has a lot of planks, chaturangas (hippie pushups,) etc., so it involves some strength training which is important as others have noted. I don't think an hour of cat-cows and oms is going to help with your running.\n\nStrength train to get stronger and prevent injuries, do yoga to improve mobility and get some stretching in\n\nI try to do 10-15 minutes of yoga 3 to 4 times a week (5x in a good week). For me, I do find it helps with stiffness and recovery. When I long run on Sunday morning, sometime in the afternoon I will hit my yoga mat. It's not going to make you bulletproof but like strength training, it's a good complement to running.\n\nIt depends on the type of yoga you choose, in my experience.  A gentle, restorative, Hatha yoga is going to be better for recovery but a higher intensity Vinyasa-type yoga will get you doing some bodyweight exercises and light cardio while stretching as well.  Pre-Covid I was running 3-5 days per week with one hour long Vinyasa yoga class every Wednesday and my only real, sidelining injury was a stress fracture - something yoga wouldn't have helped with anyway.\n\nStretchy yin yoga for relief/feeling better when muscles are tight, strength training for prevention.\n\nLove yoga. Started yoga sculpt several years ago. Decreased running amount and running faster than ever.\n\nLift weights with full range of motion.\n\nYoga is great but it can also lead to more injury. My favorite solution for any aches and pains is to go to physiotherapy. A good physiotherapist will assign you a personalized strength and flexibility routine that will address the exact weaknesses that are causing the aches and pains. And I'm pretty sure an appointment with a physiotherapist is cheaper than a one month membership at a yoga studio these days.\n\nYup yoga and strength training will help.\n\nThis is the way.\n\nI’m hyper flexible and my ass is injured all the time. Yoga and mobility are good but strength is important too!\n\nI do 20-30 minutes of yoga immediately after my run.  \n\nI treat it as separate exercise component, and equal to my running and not just an add on. So I take it seriously, and not as a stretching exercise.\n\nYoga is a great help. It has helped eliminate almost all the usual aches and pains from running.  \n\nIt helps stretch and twist my sinews, muscles and joints - which I have found great for recovery. Heel, calf or thigh muscle pain no longer are an issue. \n\nThe caveat is that yoga can’t just let me go crazy on my running all of a sudden (ie suddenly and hugely increase my speed or distance).   As in all things, moderation helps.\n\nStretch and warm up before a run. Coodown and stretch after. I've not had a single injury with running.\n\nI do some yoga exercises on the night before a race. I just use it as a way to relax my mind and body and feel active.\n\nI do one yoga day/week, 3 strength days and 3 run days. I think they all work together.\n\nyoga is good, pilates is better (more core work, mild stretching - you actually don't want to stretch out too much).\n\nAlso, for older folks like me, boosting protein intake (whey protein powder) helps preserve muscle, along with adding use of a Theragun, foam roller and sometimes even the old inversion table. Whatever works, folks!\n\nAnother vote for strength training. Also found myself a good PT to identify weak spots and address any problem areas before they become nagging injuries.  I think yoga has its place in a well rounded fitness program though.\n\nEcho everyone here. 48M had run at least 5k every day for exactly one year as of today! ~1567 miles in 365 days averaging 4.3 mile per day. I do about an hour and a half of yoga every week in 15 minutes increments. I use the Down Dog app. It’s great!  I also strength train three days a week concentrating on known weak areas in my running chain &amp; balance work. I’ve learned what I need to do after many years of trial and error for my own body and it works.\n\nGet in to see a PT, strength training and really activating your core muscles, cross training, stretching for 60 mins total in a day (doesn’t have to be in one sitting but ideally 30-60 seconds long stretches), epsom salt baths, dynamic icing, and adequate rest time is what helps me.\n\nI (57f) love yoga esp the day after a long run. The extensive stretching helps me with soreness/aches and pains. Agree that it won’t necessarily help with injury tho. I don’t get injured much which I ascribe to running every other day. The injuries I’ve had I’ve taken care of with PT/rest appropriate for the injury— yoga alone won’t do it.\n\nYou should 1000% take up yoga to support your running habit. But there's more to it. \n\nThere are so many different styles of yoga, and most  styles aren't even consistent studio to studio. I would not consider \"Should I do yoga?\" to be a yes or no question. That's sort of like asking, \"Is music any good?\" The answer is, \"Yeah... if it's for you.\"\n\nSome styles definitely won't work for you, but I'd be shocked if you could not find a style that improves your running immensely and helps to prevent injuries.\n\nAs a runner myself, my top recommendation is Bikram yoga (sometimes called Hot26). It's one of the rare styles of yoga that IS consistent across studios: the same series of 26 poses done over 90 minutes, bookended by breathing exercises, &amp; performed in a room that's essentially a mild sauna. I found it exceptionally helpful for improving mobility &amp; mindfulness while training for ultramarathons, especially. Two sessions per week make a big difference for me; more is always better. \n\nThe 26 poses address the whole musculoskeletal system from top to bottom, with an emphasis on core work. \n\nThis is key: I found that repeating the same sequence of poses in the same order to be deeply meditative AND an invaluable tool for self-diagnosis after big runs (e.g. noticing new aches &amp; pains; recognizing asymmetry from past injuries, etc). \n\nYou might also try Yin (originally developed for ancient Chinese warriors to recover from battle, it didn't originate in India like most popular styles). It's not done in a heated room, and the poses will change class to class. The holds are longer and intended to get deep into muscles &amp; connective tissues. It can be tense at times, but very therapeutic. \n\nTL;DR - Yoga isn't one thing; you have to shop around. As a runner, start with Bikram or Yin. Once you find the style that works best for you, you'll wish you'd found it sooner.\n\nYoga ruins me. My body hates it. I just do strength work outs! That seems to help me a lot :)\n\nAs a yoga instructor, I think the best answer is having balance with whatever activity you’re invested in most. If you’re running alot you need to balance with strength AND flexibility AND balance training. Whatever modalities you use to do this is up to you. You can use yoga to target some or all of this or you can take another route. Don’t listen to do X 5x a week and Y 2x a week you need to find what works for you.\n\nLift weights. Yoga isn’t going to help with running\n\nI do yoga every day (at least 10, and up to 40 minutes), using Sarabeth Yoga videos on YouTube. I don't know how I'd recover as well as I do without it. It is a major release for my hips and hamstrings.  It enables me to get up in the morning feeling eager to run, every day.\n\nStrength training is best. I'm a woman and I feel like yoga and stretching is pushed a lot, but my approach has shifted. If I have an ache, I just figure out how to work the muscle. Anterior shin muscles are the most difficult, I hate exercise bands. I am thinking of buying one of those specific gadgets for it\n\nExercised and ran cross country in high school, doing just weights and running. Now 57, I’m now doing 2 days/weights/week, 2 days running/week, and 2 days yoga/week, with one day off for recovery. \n\nI do feel the weights keep me strong, running works the lungs and cardiovascular system, while yoga acts as a ‘reset’ button, keeping me limber and yes less injury due to weight training and/or running. Maybe I’m imagining it, but swear yoga works. Good luck in finding your sweet spot!\n\nI do yoga and it helps with flexibility and some strength but I find that circuit strength training keeps the injuries away. I'd recommend running, strength and yoga.\n\nHOT yoga Good bc it helps with my posture, core, mental health, and irons out any kinks. Helps my running form too.\n\nFocusing on stuff that improves your hips, core, hamstrings and lower legs wont necessarily make you a better runner but it will help prevent injury\n\nI’m getting back into running, and I want to start yoga again for the benefits to core strength and proprioception.\n\nYoga has helped me with mindfulness of breath, especially on my runs.\n\nWhat about Vinyassa Hot Yoga?\n\nI do hot yoga which helps with various injuries. Especially in the winter, I have noticed I'm in less pain. I'm just a beginner runner, but there's lots of guys who come to my class who enjoy it and do it to augment their regular training program.\n\nWeightlifting is probably the most useful thing tbh. It just makes you overall more resistant to injuries and stronger. I felt my overall best and was most resistant to injury when I did some sort of lifting 3x a week, as well as running on a treadmill at least 2x a week to get in miles on an easier surface. I live in a city so it’s hard to run on not concrete.\n\ni suggest yogalates or a split of yoga and pilates every week. really helps with core strength and balance while also maintaining flexibility. the few older runners i know swear by it and say it’s the best way to condition everything for running\n\nYes, every monday a “yoga day” :)\n\nI often do [this routine](https://youtu.be/MKuZOwYukho) before running and it makes things easier on my calves.\n\nI find https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=of2spyCtUkw this a  really good warm up.  My hips are less tight afterwards.\n\nI do vinyasa in a warm room for an hour (ok 45 minutes subtracting the touchy feely start and end) and my heart rate gets up there as much as it does on a recovery run and the body weight stuff like plank dolphin etc plus the hip opening and wrist strengthening plus balance and ankle strengthening I find are excellent complements to running which has such a narrow range of repetitive motion.\n\nYeah ok adding strength would help a lot if I want to run faster. But it isn’t either or. I can do yoga on a running day - at either end of the day too - but I cant do strength especially lower body, on a day I run.\n\nStrength training is key\n\nStrengthen, analyze why this is occurring. Stop heel striking, shorter strides, proper shoes.\n\nI did add yoga in, to help with cycling and running, when I was about 48.  But….   I now find that Pilates is much much better at helping avoid injury, than yoga was.\n\nStrength training is great for this! Yoga will help your sore body/muscles\n\nAdd Pilates instead of yoga. It'll help to strengthen your core, hips and glutes, which will help more than flexibility training with yoga. Also strength training is great to add to everything\n\nI've had clients that were so tight and locked up that a couple of mobility sessions had significant and immediate effects on their running times.\n\nYoga certainly helped me with injury prevention. I've heard many similar stories.\n\nThere are multiple schools of yoga, so it all kind of depends the studio and style. Ashtanga is pretty rigid, while flow/vinyasa has been applied to a variety of practices. Iyengar is all about getting the pose right and definitely has more rigorous training for certification that takes years compared to the more common, general 200-hour program.\n\nIn terms of addressing mobility while mitigating risk of injury, have you tried Pilates? A number of studios have at least one instructor that is also a physical therapist. Compared to yoga, there is a greater emphasis on anatomy and keeping up with exercise science and kinesiology. Yes there are exceptions to what I said, so mind that I am speaking in generalizations. \n\nI practiced yoga off and on for about two decades before trying Pilates. It’s been a total game changer for overall health and functionality. 10/10 recommend if there’s a studio near you.\n\nI do aqua jogging. As well as running . Talking about yoga when we can . You also have to do few strengthening exercises too for calf .lower leg and hips .\n\nI started PT this week for an Achilles injury that won’t heal. He told me to not bother with yoga/stretching (for now) and to spend whatever time I do have on strengthening the lower body.\n\nInteresting because part of my PT on an achilles injury was to spend time stretching my tightened up calf that was angry and triggered the achilles. It doesn’t prevent it, but helps get you out of the immediate reason it occurred. Strength is how you do get back though.\n\nI use elements of Yin yoga as my stretching routine.\n\nI would like to offer up a different option: tai chi. Bigger focus on proprioception and balance, which will help more with injury prevention.  Also a lot more work on support and stability muscles. And at 42 you have a good chance of not being the youngest person in the room. Or the oldest, as you might on yoga.\n\nMy wife just started tai chi and loves it!\nShe always hated yoga, and feels tai chi is more like a dance, with constant movement.\nIf that’s more your speed, I’d recommend it as well\n\nYes. Yoga, strength, and specifically core strength have been helpful.\n\nStrength training works better than yoga. I used to have joint pain after long runs, but it’s all gone after 2-3 times a week strength training. \n\nI also recommend hot yoga than regular yoga, especially flow yoga. It’s almost like stretching your body in sauna. Flexibility will prevent you from getting injured.\n\nThere is also huge benefits to include strength training in your running routine. I would recommend Pilates! I've been doing the reformer at least once a week and I also supplement with weights at my home gym.\n\nEchoing a lot of other comments. For me, yoga has helped a lot with stretching and breathing. I was training in Ashtanga style and the daily practice really formed who I am. Now with the studio closed, I feel like a bum.\n\nAnother YouTube recommendation for you: Sean Vigue - he does yoga, Pilates, and power yoga - all of which are geared toward men and for improving your strength and mobility.\n\nAt one point in my training, I would do 2 full body strength sessions with weights a week, and 1 yoga session a week (usually this Adidas Yoga for runners video on yt - 30min). At that time, definitely felt stronger in my running. If you don't have the 30min by any chance, I would shoot for a quick daily mobility routine, if mobility is what you're aiming at. \n\nI think yoga can also be a solid, lower impact strength exercise, specifically focused on stability and core. So it can work well, if you wanna work on your strength but your schedule only allows you to do so around harder runs.\n\nBig time! Also physical therapy moves can be incorporated into your yoga routine. I’ve been battling a hip problem for years and finally kicked it with a combination of yoga and PT exercises.\n\nF**rom personal experience, I'm a 33M**: \n\n**TLDR my opinion about yoga**: As others have said, it's a very vast practice and it all depends on what you are doing inside of your practice. If you really love it, it's not sth you should avoid. But if you are not very flexible etc, I would suggest avoiding overstretching, as this will hold you back in your recovery. Yoga also boosts strength so that's a good plus, but there are other practices that just target running more effectively. \n\n**Long opinion below**:\n\nI spent years figuring out what the best Strength/mobility routine would be for me to enable my running. I started with simple bodyweight exercises, I went to things like HIIT, then tried yoga, then pilates, now I'm actually back to running-specific bodyweight workouts and that's the best combination for my own body.\n\nFirst of all, one should realize that static stretching/positioning (which is *usually* a yoga standard) is not a great friend to running. It may help you recover a bit faster after your run, but a) you need to be very careful on how much and how long you stretch your achy muscles and b) ultimately, I believe your time is best spent elsewhere: (more) BW strength and mobility workouts. For running, I have come to realize that the vast majority of times when you feel achiness, your muscles are just weak or lack mobility, not flexibility. Especially weak glutes and non-mobile/weak hip flexors cause a ton of issues due to prolonged sitting. \n\nRegarding a), I always thought that stretching more and harder would be the best for me, but that never gave me more mobility, it only made things worse as an inflexible male who couldn't do most poses *or* their alternatives. My PT later told me that it was a huge mistake to press myself in those poses, and that one should only stretch a muscle to about 70% of range and for 5x20-sec reps/3 times a week max, otherwise the tension is too big. You need to keep it short and sweet in your stretching as a recovery method, and that will slowly improve flexibility and a bit of mobility. \n\nI had the same experience with pilates, though that was also my instructor's fault who pressed me to keep some isometric poses that didn't do with me.\n\nIn the end, strength exercises on one leg were the ultimate thing for me and I think are a must for runners: single leg bridges, single leg squats, monster walk and many more. Not like a ton of it, 20 mins max after your every run is enough to become stronger really fast. Be sure to include some core routines. [Strengthrunning.com](http://Strengthrunning.com) is a good resource: I have bought some training plans (they're the best I've found) and I also listen to Jason's podcasts as they're very informative.\n\nMobility also comes to a large extent from strength training itself, as the root cause of non-mobile muscles is usually weakness. You prolly don't need a *ton* of mobility anyway (we're not gymnasts), but you could also do some supplementary exercises to open hips and hamstrings (the usual suspects) if they can't be unlocked with strength training alone. \n\nThe #1 and #2 most basic things for recovery is good sleep and a good diet, respectively. Miss these and recovery *will* take longer, injuries *will* happen.\n\n#3 is training management: Maybe you are doing too many miles..? Build it up slowly.\n\nAnd a great supplement: 10 mins of foam rolling before bed, as often as you can. This helps quite a lot with recovery.\n\nPS: Do see a good (running) PT! They will save you!\n\nHope that helps!\n\nI love yoga and have been doing it over twenty years however sadly in my 40s especially I find that it exacerbates my aches! What aids me for running is reducing the mileage the right shows trails versus asphalt and of course no more than 2-3 a week now. What others have said about hips and glutes are key and running with very good posture and form is important too. Good luck !👍\n\nYes, and I found it definitely helped. But I was in my late 40s and about the least flexible person you ever met.\n\nI highly reccomend \"Run Better with Ash\" on YouTube, his routines are easy to follow and really make me feel better \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@RunBetterwithAsh](https://www.youtube.com/@RunBetterwithAsh)\n\nI always notice during the periods where I do daily yoga that running feels so much easier, I can go further, and I ache less during and after. Wholeheartedly recommend it, and good for the mind too!\n\nI'm not sure about how yoga influences running but over all it's a good way to maintain flexibility and balance as you age and that is important later in life. I can't see any downsides to it and improving balance would be an upside in running. Strength training is also a good thing to add for healthier aging and the healthier you stay later into life you can keep running and doing other activities.\n\nWhen I was in the military I went to a training event.  We had to wake up at like 430 to work out together.  The training center had us do yoga followed by a long run.  We were all laughing and confused as to why we were doing yoga (was not normal or part of the culture), but holy cow was that the best run of my life.  Everything was warmed up and loose--the run was almost like meditating because my muscles and joints felt so good.  I've never done yoga since but imagine it would be great for running--especially for tighter bodies.\n\nI find that I have better form and fluidity when I do yoga between runs, especially right before a run, so I think in that way it helps with injury prevention. But I still have to do strength training a few times a week if I want to build mileage without burning out.\n\nYes but:\n\nYoga alone isn’t enough depending on mileage per week. Incorporate Pilates, strength training, and Mobility Training, this will dramatically help. I thought I had done enough mobility work for my works working up to my first marathon last fall….took me about 5 months to fully recover. I genuinely believe additional Pilates and mobility work would have helped me out immensely.\n\nStrength training is key how ever, strengthening your muscles through range is THE key. I am a physio and if you can only contract muscles in a small range, that’s when they are super prone to injury. Pilates is great for this.\nMobility however is so so important! So do yoga! If you don’t have full joint mobility, other areas of your body take over. That’s when injuries/pain happens too\n\nStrength training or pilates for runners would be better options if you’re worried about injuries\n\nThere's no magic bullet that will avoid injury.\n\nYoga will improve mobility and strength (particularly core strength), both of which should reduce injury risk.\n\nIt would be less effective than a strength &amp; mobility routine put together by a physio with your specific injury risks in mind.\n\nIn other words, you'll get a 'better than nothing' positive impact from doing yoga, but you could do much better in terms of injury prevention.\n\nI’ve only started running, but I do have some alignment issues and yoga plus strength (and proper shoes) has helped me a lot. Yoga allowed me to help mentally focus on properly holding my hips under me which allowed my hips to swing smoother and less tension. It is probably more mental placebo than anything, but the cool down with yoga I think also really aids in my recovery.\n\nYoga will help you gain flexibility.\n\nYoga and you need to do strength work, weights or similar. Once you get over 40, you lose muscle mass rapidly.\n\nI use the Runna app which incorporates whole body fitness into running.  I’m mid 40s still overweight and have a repetitive turf toe injury that has turned arthritic.  \n\nRunna allows me to have a 7 day plan…3 days of running, one upper body strength day, one lower body strength day…my two “rest” days is used up with a yoga for runners workout and Pilates for runners workout.  \n\nI have been injury free for the last 6 months.  I have seen  increased mobility in my toe joint.  I can now do a plank pain free.  \n\nI think it helps\n\nSun Salutation A + child's pose. Figure four stretch. Seated forward folds.\n\n\nDownward dog for calves and plantar fasciitis.\n\n\nYoga will not fix all your broken shit. But it does help.\n\nI did hot yoga while training for my first half. I found it really helpful with strength and flexibility\n\nYoga is great for you (flexibility is so important) but make sure to do a little weight training and consider taking magnesium supplements. \n\nI am currently dealing with Achilles tendonopathy, though I do hard runs your calves lose strength over time as do all your muscles as you age. Endurance exercise is fantastic but we need to maintain strength with higher weight exercise. Full body weight exercise once or twice a week may be enough.\n\nI’ve been doing yoga a couple times a week on my rest days to help with keeping my leg muscles stretched\n\nI’ve run for decades and stretched for decades, too. Though I’ve gotten a little more lax about the latter over the past several years. What I noticed, hands-down, is that when I stretch for approximately 20 minutes after I run, I feel a heck of a lot better and more fluid. No stiffness. purely anecdotal, but I’m a believer.\n\nI usually walk for about 24 seconds or so, then start running. Minimal stretching prior! People over-do it sometimes. At the end of the run, I adjust my wind-down walk's length according to the intensity. I really do love yoga (got a free sesh after a flood once), even though you don't need it to run.\n\nI can’t really speak to the injury part, because I’m lucky that way, but yoga has been one the biggest things to improve my performance. I am not sure what kind of yoga others in this sub are doing, but yoga is a form of strength training. It increase core, hip and glute strength as well as increased flexibility. I think the main reason it helped improve my performance is because it improved my form.\n\nYoga might help with recovery, but strength training will help prevent injury. \n\nI wouldn't say yoga has improved my running, but it definitely helps my body feel better generally. Especially when the mileage gets high, my muscles get super tight but yoga helps calms things down and bring me back to baseline so I'm just more comfortable in day-to-day life.\n\nWhen you do yoga you should focus on the strength of your tendon and you should eat protein and you should be mindful that you are making your tendon and when you do your exercises you should be mindful and know that you have the power\n\nIt does help with the overall performance of the body. \n\nNot sure if helps in running.\n\nI will just add that cold therapy/cold plunging may be something to consider. Daily cold plunging has relieved a lot of the achiness I used to feel in my feet and ankles, not only from running and strength training, but just general life. 44M btw\n\nAgree: I try a minute of very cold water in the shower, followed by a minute of hot water. Repeat 2 or 3 times. Supposedly will flush toxins out of sore muscles. Constant contracting and expanding muscles with just water temperature. All I know is it feels good and doesn’t cost a dime!\n\nThe older you get, the more important it is. It helps with odd stuff you wouldn't otherwise get to. It's helping me with functional strength and range of motion in my lower back. \n\n\nI like this video: https://youtu.be/zzcIbLtOV4g?feature=shared\n\nI'm 52, and going for my first marathon in December. (Done lots of halfs, saved the fulls for when I got oldish.) So, oldish and higher miles. That's my context for finding yoga useful.\n\nGo to a physical therapist for an evaluation. If you don’t want to do a full plan of care with 10 visits, tell them. Get someone to specifically look at your mobility/strength. Anyone on the internet can say “you should stretch” or “you should strengthen”. Which muscles? What intensity? What running distances do you do and how do you progressively train/load your muscles? \n\nYoga and strengthening are both great but if you want specifics, spend an hour with someone who can guide you through that. Anyone camping on one side or the other without seeing you is just talking from their own personal experience and it’s not really relevant.\n\nfor me it helps with the achiness but im much younger than you lol\n\nHonestly yoga is probably the worst use of your time (unless you enjoy it and it gives you significant mental benefits). \n\n1) Flexibility is not particularly important in running. \n\n2) If youre injury prone, you need to strengthen. Strength training does this far more effectively than yoga. \n\n3) If you have areas of tightness, myofascial massage/foam rolling are far more effective and take a fifth of the time. \n\nDon't waste your time, unless you have plenty to waste\n\nMy college track coach forbid us to do yoga, claiming that not only does prolonged static stretching--which, let's be honest, yoga is--not only doesn't prevent running injuries but actually can often increase your chances of incurring an injury.\n\n\nThis was 30 years ago, and it seems he was ahead of his time. As a trainer and distance runner, I've learned a lot more about stretching over the years; as has the general fitness world.\n\n\nWe now know that it's inadvisable to engage in static stretching before running. What you want to do is dynamic stretching, which is just a fancy way of saying you warm up by moving around. Anything like slow jogging, walking, light calisthenics. \n\n\nIf you must do static stretching, save it for after your run. Still, there's been NO evidence ever in ANY documented study where stretching decreases let alone prevents running injuries. There HAS however been some testimony from runners and coaches that too much static stretching has lead to run-related injury.\n\n\nSo, tldr: if you're feeling fine and running pain free without doing yoga then I'd follow the old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" maxim. If you do have a specific area of muscle tightness, say in your quads or hip abductors or IT hand, then just engage in some LIGHT stretching that targets those areas. \n\n\nIn My opinion it's difficult to name a more overrated exercise or alleged fitness routine than yoga. And don't even get me started on the dangerous bastard cousin called Hot Yoga. LOL \n\n&gt; prolonged static stretching--which, let's be honest, yoga is\n\n this isn't true. While some yoga (e.g. Yin or Restorative) is long passive holds, other forms are typically active and dynamic. With quicker flows being single breath cycles; breathing in for a pose, moving to a counter pose for the out breath. The speed of that can also vary. There is emphasis on control and fluidity moving between poses, and activation within them; requiring balance, range of motion, body awareness, control and strength.   \n\ni.e. a typical, light yoga flow would easily fit the description of moving around with some light calisthenics. You can make it more vigorous, you can make it less so. \n\nResearch can and does inform when, how and what yoga is practiced, it's an extremely broad and continually evolving set of practices. The advice on what type of stretching is best is valuable, but it would better to leave applying it to yoga to those that know about yoga if you aren't interested. \n\n\nAlso, Yin (significant prolonged static stretching) is not really recommended immediately post-workout either. Your body being warmed up and already damaged makes it less effective, and you more prone to overstretching and injury. They can be really intense stretches, which can be useful, but easily underestimated and misused.\n\nPilates is much better in my experience. It's not a cure all but it seems better for runners. Also, Yoga is a religion where as Pilates isn't."

Initially I went through C25K, then did some 10k races and at the end of last year I started racing half marathons. I had two under my belt (Como, which I also posted on this sub, and Madrid) before starting my training for the Athens Marathon.\n\nWhy Athens? Well, that's honestly very simple. It's where the term \"marathon\" originated, so I thought there was no better way to have my first one right there. The race actually starting from Marathon and arriving to Athens was a very focal point in my decision. Yes, I knew about the strong climbs (for a marathon) on the course and I tried to train accordingly to those, but as you can imagine from the title, it didn't go as planned.\n\n# Training\n\nMy training plan was pretty simple: 18 weeks, with 4 days of running, 2 of strength training and 3 rest days. I'd basically have my strength training the days I had my easy runs (running in the morning and going to the gym in the evening), plus one tempo/interval session and a long run. In addition, to prepare for the uphills, I planned some uphills sprints at the end of one of my weekly easy runs.\n\nThe first weeks were going pretty well, I managed to hit every single run and the fitness level was definitely increasing. Then the summer holidays.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it was a fantastic 3 weeks trip which still involved a lot of trekking, but of course I basically didn't run. I accounted for that in my plan since I knew it was going to happen, and when I returned I came back to my usual training. Still, some good unexpected weeks since my fitness level didn't decrease much. Of course I adjusted and reduced a bit the mileage on my first week back, but evertyhing was still going smoothly. Unfortunately I wasn't as constant as I was before, I missed some days, and I definitely had one day where I pushed too much on the track (I was doing 400s sprints). Next day, a sharp pain on my left foot totally stopped me, I managed just to barely came back home.\n\nTurns out, it was a mild tendinitis, but I didn't know at the time, so I basically stayed at total rest for a week, before going to a physio. He told me to do some exercises and to stop with running to make it heal... wrong advice. I wasn't so sure of his advice, so I went to another one and he made me realize I shouldn't have totally halted running. I re-started with some super easy run-walks, and I also noticed my shoes were giving me issues: another problem I didn't notice before, but anti-pronation shoes were actually making it worse. So I stopped using them in favor of a neutral shoe, and it was like night and day. That compared to my new training plan for recovery mitigated the tendinitis issue, which was then totally gone.\n\nThe only problem was... it was basically marathon time, and the max amount of KPW I ran in the last month and a half was 28k. I knew it was too little, considering I didn't even touch 30k KPW for a while. My physio gave me the same advice to not run it. But I was feeling too good, even with my low mileage. You know how it goes.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI arrived in Athens two days prior to the race, just to have a full day to visit some parts of the city, having a nice walk and go to the Expo. Pretty cool stuff.\n\nThe day of the race, I had a very good breakfast with some boiled eggs, coffee, a protein bar, a croissant, an orange juice, some biscuits and a banana. Then went to take of the many buses directed to Marathon.\n\nA pretty windy morning, but didn't faze me too much. Had a lot of water before starting from the Marathon stadium, which was packed of runners but still handled great. Had my start from the 7th block around 9.20.\n\n# Race\n\nThe first 10k are basically flat, so they were a good test for my race form. I honestly expected much worse, still I kept a slower pace since I knew the tough parts were gonna rock me and my low mileage. I really enjoyed this first part, even if there weren't so many people around, but the energy was still great!\n\nThe plan was to take a gel every 5k or so, and I sticked to that, while grabbing also a water bottle every 5k. \n\nAfter that, there were some others 1-2k with flat roads, before the first uphill started. I dropped my pace a bit, which was planned, but I was still feeling very good. No tendinitis, no problems in any of my legs, no cramps, it was honestly so much better than what I expected. I sticked to my pace, until the first big uphills started around the 15k mark. That was definitely tougher, I walked for some seconds on one of them cause my BPM were going nuts, but I kept going without any particular issue.\n\nAnd then I felt some discomfort in my rectus femoris. Oh no. I knew it was exactly that muscle cause I strained it during the Madrid Half Marathon months prior, and it seemed like the same exact feeling. It got worse the more I went on, and I honestly knew at that point that I'd retire.\n\nI mentally checked out there, not because of the pain which I think was still manageable, but because of fear of what was gonna happen after. Yes I ran through it for the last 6k in Madrid, but here there were 24k left! More than a half marathon of total discomfort and pain, plus a distance which I never ran.\n\nI tried run-walking, stopped at some of the many aid station to put on some kind of gel, but of course it didn't do much. Honestly at that point it was miserable, and I stopped just after the 20k mark, saying I was gonna retire.\n\n# Post-race\n\nOn the pick-up bus to go the finish line, I was of course sad that I didn't finish, especially because I still had a lot of energy left and the leg wasn't hurting so much. But I knew that I made the right decision for myself. I honestly prefer to better train for it another time and finish how I really want, instead of crawling to Athens. \n\nIt was still a great experience, but for the moment I'll go and focus on trail running, which was my designated objective for 2025.\n\nI learned a lot from all of this. Don't underestimate your training. Don't be too cocky just because you finished an half marathon in under 2 hours. There's nothing wrong wih retiring, I think it's actually a harder decision to take when you're in a race of this magnitude. \n\nLesson learnt, looking after my next adventure!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

    "all_comment_text": "Don't sweat it.  I heard a guy died in the first one around there.  You did good by just surviving to fight another day.\n\nRIP Pheidippides\n\nUnfortunate, but I feel like you made the right decision too. Good for you. Heal up and come back stronger!\n\nWelcome to the first marathon blow up club!\n\nThere are a lot of us here.\n\nHeads up mate ! You will nail it next time fo sure.\nI participated also this year, started from block 5 :)\n\nBlock 11 here, was running with the cool old people!\n\nI’ve completed that race. Don’t do yourself a disservice calling any early sections flat. Basically (at least in 2018) the first 34 kms are uphill going from Marathon to Athens. And since it’s an A to B course you don’t get any reprieve of equivalent downhill sections. I was in the best running shape of my life when I did the race (7 min/mile pace) and it nearly beat me. It’s a very tough course.\n\nWell done for calling it\n\nYou made the hardest but correct choice. You’ll get em next time. This was my 2nd marathon of many… I think this was the hardest, that steady incline will kill you. I trained with double runs and up mountains. Granted I was running on a stress fracture but still really hard.\n\nWonderful to read. Thank you for your report!\n\nI am reading one mistake in the pre-race phase\n\nWandering around before the race --&gt; totally wrong, no need to do it afterwards\n\nI am sorry that you did not finish, it takes a lot to call it off, but it was for the best.\n\nYou'll make it next time!\n\nI did Athens in 2023 and found it difficult; I train in Florida and have to use bridge overpasses to simulate hills.  I decided to trot rather than full out run.  I’m sorry you didn’t make your goal of finishing but with an injury that reared its head, you may have made a wise decision.  Best for your future endeavors!\n\nHi! I started running a few months ago, and I've the same pace as you, though my max is 7km. Any tips?\n\nIt's great that you started running too! What kind of tips are you searching for? Do you want to try and ran a marathon or a half marathon too?\n\nYeah that was my goal. When I started I struggled to finish a mile. Now I can do two miles easily, though more than that I've to struggle. I can push through 7 km, but it takes all my energy. I don't know if I'm going too slow, but I figured week over week improvement is best, though I've no progress in the past month.\n\nIt depends how much you've been training. When I started I also didn't even try to run 1 mile straight, I did a lot of run-walk. 2 months in, with 3 runs per day and slowly going longer, I managed to run 5k. My first 10k was after 5-6 months I think.\n\nI think that if a 7k is really a stretch, maybe you need to run slower. Especially when you start training, your speed doesn't matter at all, the important thing is to try and finish your target distance. Try to implement some run-walks to manage to go further if you're struggling, don't be afraid to walk. Distance is distance no matter what. If you want speed, that will come later, with more volume, more experience and different types of runs.\n\nWhen I was doing C25k, I discovered afterwards that I was going way too fast, even if I always told myself to go slower. I had a 5'20\"-ish/km pace, while right now I'm running at a 6'20\"/km on my easy runs. Even 6'30\" on the days my condition is not at the top.\n\nHeyy, thanks for the reply. I think I went a little overboard and did 8.5 km on Sunday and 9.5 km yesterday. Cramped AF now 🤣 but I'm trying to improve slowly. My goal RN is to increase 1km a week and then hopefully I'll be able to make a half marathon in the next 6 months.\n\nYou can definitely prepare a HM in 6 months if you already managed almost 10km! Be sure to do one week when you decrease the load at least of 10%, after three-four weeks of increasing the mileage 1km per week, so that your legs can get used to that (and hopefully not cramp often :D)\n\n\n Try also to do a light routine warmup pre-run each time, so that your legs won't feel as tired afterwards! Like, a little walking, simple leg swings, maybe some butt kicks.\n\nYou did it well! I ran a marathon with pain in an abductor which drastically worsened during the race and led to month of intensive physiotherapy without running… Not a good experience! Was the finish (in a bad time anyway) worth it? Probably not. Would I do the same again? The brain says no, but I don’t really know for sure :)\n\nHey, the important thing is that you tried And you also maintained your pace pretty well.  Here's something I noticed. You said u ate a lot before the race but just said u only had gels and water during the race. You don't need my advice but that seems weird to me. And it may have played a role here.  What worked for me may not work for you and vice versa, but I'd try and eat more solid/light carb food in small amounts periodically throughout the race. \nAnd I know some people live and die by the gels but I think the gels are bullshit not a real substitute for real food. You got it next time though good luck. \n\nI am reading one mistake in the pre-race phase\n\nWandering around before the race --&gt; totally wrong, no need to do it afterwards\n\nI am sorry that you did not finish, it takes a lot to call it off, but it was for the best.\n\nYou'll make it next time!"

I ran the Eugene Marathon in the spring in 3:58:49, so I started with a decent base.  My goal for a fall marathon was to really push myself... I say this because most marathons I've run, I've ended the race feeling 'good'.  I would basically just run at a pace that felt 'comfortable' and try to push through the fatigue that would ultimately hit later in the race.  Through this forum and friends, I've since learned that the marathon is still a race :) and that your pace should reflect that.... races are not 'comfortable' or easy.  I went into this training block and this race with that mindset.  I never really had a true time goal in mind... I just wanted to push myself to the edge of my fitness and see what would happen.\n\nI hired a coach, upped my mileage, ran mostly 'easy' runs, and had a dedicated track/speed session each week.  I peaked at 50 miles (up from 40ish in my last block) and had 8 weeks that surpassed the 40-mile threshold.  My typical week was as follows:\n\nMonday: Medium Long Run (ranging from 6-12 miles depending where I was in the training block) around a 9:45-10:15min/mile pace + lower body strength\n\nTuesday: 4-6 mile recovery run (10:30-11:00 min/mile pace)\n\nWednesday: full body strength\n\nThursday: 8-mile quality workout (typically at the track) - this would consist of a 1-2 mile warm up/cool down and about 5 miles of speed work\n\nFriday: 3-4 mile recovery run (10:30-11:00 min/mile pace)\n\nSaturday: Long run - I ultimately ran 3 20-milers and 1 22-miler.  2 of the 3 20-milers had pace work.  All other long runs were run between a 9:55-10:30 min/mile\n\n# Pre-Race\n\nI had a call with my coach on Tuesday before the race and he hit me with a race plan that had me finishing at 3:44:40.  Sub-3:45 never really crossed my mind until a few weeks before taper.  I had a very strong 20-mile workout.  My coach felt confident in 3:45. I, on the other hand, didn't think that would be possible and wanted to shoot for a 3:50.  That said, my A goal was to really push myself... I decided to trust my coach and my training and committed to the 3:45 game plan.  WILD!  At this point, I still couldn't comprehend how running a majority of my training miles at a 10:00min/mile or slower would somehow translate into 26.2 miles at an 8:33 pace.\n\n# Race\n\nThe plan was to run the first three miles 20-30 seconds slower than goal pace (8:33ish).  By mile 4 I was to settle into goal pace.  This went relatively according to plan, although miles 2 and 3 were a little quicker than expected.  I used miles 4-10 to really settle into a rhythm.  My coach told me that these miles would dictate the rest of the race... if goal pace felt too hard and my body felt more comfortable running an 8:45, then that was okay and this would be the point in the race where I'd make that decision.  I'll be honest, the pace didn't feel super comfortable and around mile 7 I gave myself permission to slow down... that said, the miles kept ticking by and I kept hitting goal pace.  By the time I hit mile 11 I had mentally committed to running 8:33's and just seeing what happened.  \n\nAt mile 12 I hit a water stop that was fairly understaffed.  I ultimately had to STOP and pick up water at a table.  You know how your legs feel when you end a long run and they start to seize up?  This happened to me at the water stop.... at mile 12.  My legs just felt heavy and tired.  At this point, I thought I was in for a rude awakening for the rest of the race.  Oddly enough, my legs never really got more tired as the race went on?  The level of fatigue I felt at mile 12 stayed with me throughout, but didn't get much worse.  The next few miles were a bit of a blur.  When I hit mile 16, I told myself that I just needed to 'do my job' and get to mile 20.\n\nWhen I hit mile 20, that's when mantra's really helped.  There was carnage all around with people walking and cramping up.  I kept my head down and told myself \"when it hurts, push  harder\" - I had started to pick up the pace a tinnnnny bit.  Strangely, 8:35's were hurting, but 8:25's-8:30's felt a bit easier... almost like it was the natural rhythm my body wanted to run.  While my legs didn't \"hurt\" I was definitely starting to feel the overall fatigue.\n\nI saw my husband and friend at mile 23.5 and this gave me SUCH a mental boost.  Seeing them gave me newfound energy and really helped me pick up the pace.  I saw them again at mile 25 and the same thing happened.  It wasn't until mile 25 when I realized that I could possibly break 3:45.  At this point, I had just shy of 10 minutes to run 1.2 miles.  Anything can happen that late in the game, so I cautiously picked up the pace even more.  I caught up with the 3:45 pacer at mile 25.5 (who I started behind) and asked if he was on pace.  He said he was so I kept at it.  I rounded the final corners and gave it a bit of a sprint (although looking at the video my \"sprint\" was definitely more of a \"plod\")... I stopped my watch and honestly didn't look at it.  I immediately found my husband and he told me my finish time... 3:44:09.  I couldn't believe it!  I still can't believe it.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading.  I wanted to write this recap for those who doubt that 'running easy' a majority of the time can lead to faster race times.  I'm proof of it :)\n\n",

    "all_comment_text": "A first name would’ve been reeeeeeeally helpful in the headline\n\nRhonex\n\nThey have his photo in there\n\n[deleted]\n\nHe’s probably doped up too, just not caught yet\n\nNo world records though\n\n[deleted]\n\nI think you might've misread PR as WR\n\nOut of curiosity, what do runners dope with? I’m a lifter more than a runner, so, unaware of what doping could help a runner.\n\nErythropoietin is a big one\n\nThanks. I’m going to look into it.\n\nAre you going to sell me some afterwards?\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou have to tell if you are.\n\nyes\n\nThis casual answer makes me think you are about to walk into a Walmart, buy a pack of 10 needles and inject 5 right away before even reading the text on the packaging. :)\n\nUnfortunately Walmart will not sell you needles.\n\nDude…I’m, let’s say…a fan of PEDs lol. EPO-Alpha was always one that legitimately worried me because I could never get a handle on dosing. No life threatening blood clots if it’s all the same, thanks lol. But I had wanted to try it just to see if everything I read were true or what.\n\nFollow. Wow. Okay. Now I see why a runner would use it.\n\nNobody's natty\n\nIf you ever read Game of Shadows you will never trust a track and field record ever again.\n\nGood movie. Not for everyone but with an acquired taste.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more, check out Icarus on Netflix if you have it. It's a really interesting look into doping and particularly Russia's use of it over the years.\n\n[deleted]\n\nCarnitin is just an amigo acid isnt it? Whats wrong with that\n\namigo acids sound like the building blocks of a solid friendship\n\nPut me down for some acid with a couple amigos. I’ll clear the whole day for it.\n\nYou'll need to.\n\nHola\n\nIdk but I just ran a half marathon while on prednisone and felt AMAZING lol\n\nThe worst part of prednisone is what happens after you stop taking prednisone.\n\nWhat happens after?\n\nIt goes straight to your thighs.... And then you blow up \n\nYou crash. Hard.\n\n&gt;If you abruptly stop taking prednisone or taper off too quickly, you may experience withdrawal symptoms, including:\n\n&gt;Severe fatigue\n\n&gt;Weakness\n\n&gt;Body aches\n\n&gt;Joint pain\n\n&gt;Nausea\n\n&gt;Loss of appetite\n\n&gt;Lightheadedness\n\n&gt;Irritability or mood swings\n\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/prednisone-withdrawal/expert-answers/faq-20057923\n\nSo, you mean like every Monday morning?\n\nDepends, not always. I had to take 1g (I kid you not, 1000mlgram) of Prednisone for 5 days. They didn‘t taper me off of it. Only had the worst cramps in my left calves imaginable for like 3 days after being 3-4 days off of it. That was it.\n\nIn addition to the other tools listed - various steroids are common for PED busts (nandrolone being the most prominent recently) for the same obvious reason as test. It's extremely hard to recover when running 120+ mpw. \n\nMore exotic recovery compounds have recently seen an uptick in usage as well - peptides, SARMs (i.e. cardarine, ostarine, ligandrol and the like). You can find more by perusing the [list of doping cases in athletics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_doping_cases_in_athletics).  \n\nAdditionally there's a lot of \"grey area\" doping in the sport with the use of TUEs (therapeutic use exemptions). Use of albuterol, prednisone, and until recently tramadol, among many others, is absolutely rampant in the sport.\n\nWell damn. I thought body builders abused roids, it seems running is worse.\n\nAt this point, I think it's safe to assume that no world-class strength or endurance athlete is \"clean.\" Because to believe that, we'd have to believe that our favorite pretty blonde athlete is clean AND is somehow beating all the other dopers. \n\nAs a runner, it makes me sad, so I don't ask lots of questions - but I also don't get emotionally involved in following the sport.\n\nI put \"clean\" in quotes because some athletes, notably in the US, have managed to \"legally dope\" via prescriptions.\n\nVery true. Not only in the US though. I vaguely remember that there are quite some top level Olympic swimmers that have “heart defects” that need prescriptions.\n\nIn the same vein, all the top US runners have terrible thyroid issues requiring medication. Poor things, overcoming such health obstacles to bravely fly the flag!\n\nLol i know right? How inspiring to us the healthy people.\n\n&gt;I put \"clean\" in quotes because some athletes, notably in the US, have managed to \"legally dope\" via prescriptions.\n\nHeaps of them do this right now, the current meta is to get an official Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) for [amphetamines for your ADHD diagnosis so you can legally take concerta/ridalin/dexamphetamine](https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/tue_physician_guidelines_adhd_final_november_2021.pdf) right before a race like you would caffeine pills, then a fake kidney disorder from a quack doctor in the mountains of Kenya so you can get a script for your EPO, then some other bullshit madeup skin condition like ezcema so you can get coriticosteroids on tap, maybe shop around a few endocrinologists and you can get even get testosterone injections, oh and crazily enough maybe you also have a thyroid disorder which would allow you to get that sweet levothyroxine (T4) or liothyronine (T3).\n\nThe next step is just having transexual athletes compete like [Iran does in their women's soccer team](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03459/iranian-womens-foo_3459298b.jpg?imwidth=680)\n\n&gt; The next step is just having transexual athletes who are of the other sex compete like Iran does in their women's soccer team\n\nThis one is news to me! Not surprising - and I'm sure it's not (or soon won't be) limited to Iran.\n\nWho knows if the stories are true: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/11903290/Eight-of-Irans-womens-football-team-are-men.html\n\nThere are just some people who look like the other sex, [Barbara Bush back in the 80s looked very Mrs Doubtfire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_938-wC_mGo)\n\nOh, yeah. I learned not to trust most fitness influencers as they are usually on gear/test etc because it’s easier than natty. \nI’m not disheartened by it. Those drugs will take them one day.\n\nI don't know that I would say that necessarily lol. We're talking about pro athletes here, the majority of runners don't use any PEDs at all. The examples above are more akin to IFBB pros, who of course use everything noted and then some (i.e. insulin injections and the like).\n\nIt's a dirty sport for sure, but not nearly as bad as the untested ones, and more likely right in line with other tested sports.\n\nLet me clarify my comment. I didn’t think doping would happen in running. However, I guess there is a lot on the line for pro runners and therefore if there is a lot on the line cheating will happen.\n\nThe winner of the 1904 Olympic marathon was using PEDs during the race.\n\nIn addition to what others have said, blood doping is definitely a thing. Autologous blood transfusions can be done in order to have a higher volume of oxygen-carrying red blood cells in the body around the time of a race.  Other substances can be added at the same time. \n\nTestosterone or some derivative of it.  It helps athletes recover so they can train 120 mile weeks.  \n\n  \nEdited to add: this is in general.  Kipruto was busted for EPO.  He was likely taking lots of other stuff too, including test.\n\nCardarine, ostarine, EPO, blood doping amongst others.\n\nMostly burritos if you believe Shelby Houlihan...for the record, I don't.\n\nJellybeans\n\nI'm shocked! Shocked!\n\nWell, not that shocked.\n\nShocker....\n\nAdi will drop him like a stone, Nike will probably sign him as he fits with their morals.\n\nWtf is an Athlete Biological Passport?\n\nHere’s what I find most interesting. Whether he continues to run. What would you do? Imagine if he decided to go out destroying KOM’s for adventure. Would those be reported?\n\nDo you think strava drug tests everyone who gets a KOM?\n\nIf you made a tremendous number of videos around the world chasing famous segments and created a YouTube channel you’d potentially have a large amount of followers.\n\nI don't see how that relates to what I said but okay.\n\nIt’s a parallel comment. Of course not. Strava has no testing. Tell me how the top 10 Strava KOM holders are 100% clean\n\nphil gaimon lol\n\nI don't think his times would count officially, especially since he isn't allowed to participate in official events so he has no witnesses.\n\nBut the main problem is, professional athletes compete for money. Eastern African runners sometimes even support their entire family with their sport. Since he has no chances of winning price money for the next six years and will likely lose most/all of his sponsors, I'm afraid he won't have a choice but to find a different source of income.\n\nI accept the downvote because I mentioned Strava. But honestly It’s actually pretty sad but a reality at top tier athletics that whatever it takes to win may involve doping. Is it right? No but if that’s the margin between sponsorships and meaningful income than I understand\n\nShelby Houlihan has been doing smaller local races in the last couple years. As long as it's not USATF certified, she's technically allowed to race, but I feel like it's a bad look.\n\nWas she banned!? I remember her doing quite well a while ago but I didn’t even know she was banned. Damn!\n\nYeah 4 year ban a few years ago. Her saga was quite interesting - she still claims to this day that she ate a tainted burrito from a food truck which doped her blood enough to get popped.\n\nClassic, same energy as footballers testing positive for cocaine then claiming it's from a poppy seed bagel\n\nAnyone can flag a KOM and they seem to be immediately removed without review or notification to the KOM-holder"

    "body": "I had to tap out of the BSIM 21 miler at 19.5 miles. Truly devastating. 100% my own fault, undertraining is the only reason. I had walked (limped) 3 miles already, and doing the math, it would have taken me an hour to finish the last 2 miles. I Had already been out there for 5 hours, so I flagged down a course marshall. I'm so mad at myself and really am stuck in the mentality of \"running is not for me/ I am not a runner and never will be\". \n\nI came to running much later in life, in my 30s. Was never \"out of shape\", but never athletic by any means either.  I have finished this exact race twice before, including last year with the 60mph+ winds. This year I feel like I just gave up. \n\nI want to keep running..I think. But I don't know how to shift that mindset. \n\nI guess I just needed to vent/rant. . Thanks for listening.",

    "all_comment_text": "Bruh all I gotta say is 19.5 miles is 7.5 miles longer than I have ever ran.  I also came to running in my 30’s (35) and us oldies should be proud of every mile we do.   Shit I have the flying pig half marathon tomorrow and I’m scared shitless I won’t finish.  As long as you’re enjoying it what does any of it matter?   If I don’t finish I will just try again.  Rest up and train for the next one.  BTW if you ran 19.5 you ARE a runner.   Good job.\n\nLet us know how it goes! You got this.\n\nWent well!  Thanks for the encouragement.  I was overwhelmed with the city’s support throughout the race and will definitely do it again next year. So much fun!\n\nI’ve been very interested in flying pig, looks like a really fun race. I bet the crowd support is great and you’ll have a lovely time!\n\nYea!  I was born and raised in Cincy but this is my first one!   I’ll let you know how it goes!\n\nPlease do! I’ve done a couple Ohio races (Dayton and Toledo) but none in Cincinnati. I might have to change that next year!\n\nI finished the marathon a few hours ago. The support is phenomenal, the view is amazing (at several locations you have an overview of either downtown Cincinnati or the Ohio River).\n\nHOWEVER, do not expect to PB. the weather is brutal. I think from hr 2.5 it's in 70s, and before that it was 65 and humid. If you could finish within 3hrs you might be fine. My shirt has been completely drenched since m1. By m17 I was insanely dehydrated and couldn't keep my regular pace at all. The last 6m I could hardly keep a jogging pace. I couldn't pee for 3hrs straight even though I was drinking water, Gatorade, gels, salt tablets and a lot of post race salty food.\n\nI'd highly recommend the half unless you want to torture yourself (or the weather turns out perfect next year. Last year it was pouring rain).\n\nlol! Ok I’m from St Louis so I know exactly the weather you’re talking about 🤢 I did the STL marathon last weekend it was also brutal, I wanted salt so bad but the only opportunity was pretzels and it was far too late by then! \n\nBut more importantly, I’m glad you got some sweet views and crowd support! Hopefully you’re resting and recovering!\n\nI did finish the half in 2:30 exactly as I expected.  The crowd support is so awesome.  Race report: you should run it next year I had so much fun!\n\n2:30 is such a nice number! Congrats!\n\nI come from Milwaukee for the Flying Pig. By FAR my favorite race ever.  20,000+ runners and the whole city comes out to cheer you on.\n\nDang! That’s nice to hear! I love good crowd support. I’ve done AF Marathon a few times and while Dayton is one of my least favorite places to run, the crowds show up and it’s very nice. I also really liked Glass City in Toledo, one of my best races for whatever reason. But, I’m going to add flying pig to my to do for next year for sure. There’s a few more in that area and Kentucky that have been on my list for a while that I haven’t done. Speaking of Milwaukee though (or Wisconsin anyway,) I specifically signed up for my first and only Ironman in Madison this September because I heard the crowd there is great and the support is unmatched. I can’t wait!\n\nCincinnati is the best! Voted number one marathon in the USA for a reason!!\n\nHell yea you got this!! As another fellow oldie represent. There's also no shame in slowing down just to make sure you finish.\n\nGood luck tomorrow!!! Please update how it went!\n\nToo right! Great work on running 19.5 miles. Good luck with the half marathon. \n\nI stick to 10k and then I'm never disappointed and sometimes surprised that I ran it a little quicker than last time. Still get the fun of taking part in the race.\n\nBut seriously, good job. I'm sure you'll crack it next time.\n\nBro you literally ran 19.5 miles. I never ran more than 10. You're a runner lol, sometimes the body cant keep up, it happens to everyone, even marathon runners\n\nYou are a runner:\n\nRunning isn't performance. It's feeling free. It's feeling your body move and feeling yourself move though the air. It's having time for your mind to settle and open. \n\n\nTake racing for what it is, a fun excuse to run hard:\n\nUnless you're an olympian, you're only ever competing against yourself. And, if you didn't care, it wouldn't matter and it wouldn't feel great when you succeed. \n\n\nIt's ok to feel down and frustrated. But don't bother telling yourself that you're not a runner because you are.\n\n&gt;Running isn't performance. It's feeling free. It's feeling your body move and feeling yourself move though the air. It's having time for your mind to settle and open. \n\nThanks. This is the hard part for me, TBH. Giving it the time to settle during a run. I am not, and have never been, fast by any definition. It's frustrating for me to feel like my body physically won't do the things I'm asking it to do, and knowing that it only gets better with practice. I just need to do it.\n\nThis\n\nZoom out.  Look at your progress over years, not weeks.  If you're even attempting that distance, you've put in work and have improved dramatically since you first laced up a pair of running shoes.\n\nOne mental exercise I do when I'm feeling frustrated by my progress is to imagine the entire population of my little town (10,000) running with me. How many are still with me at a mile?  At 5 miles?  How about 10?   That number dwindles pretty fast unless you're living in Boulder or Kenya.... You're in an elite group already. \n\nRest up.  Heal.  Be proud of yourself and kind to yourself.\n\nFwiw, I'm a 49yo who has been running for just a couple of years.  Ran my first half marathons this year.  Nothing in my life has come close to the thrills, pride, and frustration that running provides.\n\nYes! I just started running at 48 🙌\n\nStarted @64 with 60lb over weight.\n\nCongrats!  It's a good feeling to find aspects of yourself that you didn't know were there!  Or at least that's been my experience.\n\n46 year old runner.  When I get down on myself for my pace, I remind myself that the other runners passing me by are typically 15-20 years younger than me.  Not all but many are.  Maybe I'll be able to run 20 more years. #goals\n\nIt feels good to be on a different trajectory than most people in middle age!  It's definitely a smallish portion of the population, at least in the US.  That being said, it's somehow humbling and encouraging to be passed by so many different ages and types of runners in a big race!  In Eugene I was passed by a woman in her 70s that was rail thin, by an older man bent nearly double and with an uneven gait, and by a girl that must have been 9 or 10.  And so many others. I tend to notice those passing me more than those I'm passing.  Maybe it's a numbers issue!  But once I'm locked into my pace, I tend to draw more inspiration than frustration from it. Cool stuff!\n\nPassed by a 9/10 year old.  Crazy!  That made me laugh. Sometimes I get passed, then later notice I pass them.  I have done one full marathon and was very happy with my 5:20 finish time.  I was 4th in my age group (out of 5 lol), but that still felt like an accomplishment. I even sprinted at the end and was smiling. It's hard, but many people don't run at all!\n\nYeah, the kid was running the 5k on Saturday. I was breaking my PR by a few minutes and feeling pretty good about it when she went blazing by! The rest were in the half marathon on Sunday.\n\nThis is a really healthy way of looking at it. Thank you, I needed this today.\n\n&gt;One mental exercise I do when I'm feeling frustrated by my progress is to imagine the entire population of my little town (10,000) running with me. How many are still with me at a mile? At 5 miles? How about 10? That number dwindles pretty fast unless you're living in Boulder or Kenya.... You're in an elite group already.\n\nThis is an awesome mental exercise. I try to tell myself \"I'm lapping everyone on the couch\", but so often it's me on the couch, so it feels like a cop out.\n\nHey. You’re not alone. I DNF my first marathon attempt and it was NYC in 2022! Mile 3 I seeing spots and stumbling a bit. I had Covid three weeks prior and my lungs couldn’t keep up. I thought “I didn’t train for a marathon to run 3 miles…”. I made it to mile 8 and went into the med tent. I stayed an hour and ended up having to call it. It broke my heart. I cried. A lot. I spiralled into a depression. I felt awful and like it was something I should give up on. \n\nBut when I used to do martial arts, my coaches always said “you either win or you learn”. And I thought about what I learned and how I felt. So I signed up with charity for 2023 and (although I had to walk from mile 10 because of an injury) I finished! \n\nSo I’d ask you - what did you learn from this experience and how can you apply it moving forward so when you come to this 21 miler again (if you so choose) you can cross the finish line? How is this experience going to help you grow as a runner? I think it’s already shown you that you’re strong af by finishing 19.5 miles in what seems like a lot of pain. How many people would have stopped earlier? How many people wouldn’t even try? \n\nI think you did fantastic and you gave it what you could. Now, what can you take away for the next one?\n\nSo my first DNF ended in an ambulance after passing out on a marathon course. I don’t remember miles 18-22, at all. I had a difficult time figuring out why my body failed me. Turns out a side effect of a medication I was on is low blood potassium levels. I went into my next marathon thinking I had it figured out. I did not, and I walked myself off the course at mile 17, because I recognized the symptoms. That was rough. It took me a few months to be okay with it. 14-ish years later, and it still bothers me. But it doesn’t mean I’m not a runner. I’m still running. I’ll probably always run. It’s just who I am. You are also still a runner. Sometimes a race just isn’t meant to be. Hugs from another runner.\n\nOutstanding comment, great work out there! Thank you for the inspiration to keep moving forward with things 👟\n\nHow to recover emotionally:\n\nSeek community and counsel (via Reddit) ✔️ \nAdmit that you wanted to do better but listened to your body ✔️ \nGive yourself grace for even trying! ✔️ \nLearn from the experience ✔️ \n\nTry again with your improved awareness and planning/training ✔️ ✔️ \n\nGood job regardless of what the mile markers were. ❤️\n\nYou run a mile, you're a runner. You walk/run that mile, you're a runner.\n\n19.5 is impressive and you should be proud you've gotten to the point where you signed up for that race and gave it your best shot.\n\nDon’t you just love the people here?  Such support!\n\nOP, don’t beat yourself up.  Think of all your accomplishments that the majority of people in general do not reach and think about how much you’ve improved since starting this whole journey.  Dust yourself off, think of the collective hugs from the people here 💕, and continue your journey.  You have definitely got this!!!!\n\nI came here to say the same.  The support from this group for a fellow runner is awesome!\n\nI just ran Boston for the first time a few weeks ago. It was way harder than I expected and at mile 5 I was so exhausted from the heat I was expecting to DNF, ended up walking the last 4 miles finished at 6 hours 10 minutes (an hour slower than my last marathon) and ended up running behind the sweeper car. I know you were asking about advice for DNF but I can talk more along the lines of the death of the ego. What I did after was look at my wins and analyzed why it didn’t go right so I could learn for next time. \n\nWhat went right: I finished even though I wanted to quit, I fueled right, no major stomach upsets \n\nWhat went wrong: I’ve been training in winter all season and suddenly the temperature jumped to almost 70 for the race so I overheated early, I started to feel dizzy by mile 5, no matter how many electrolytes I took I couldn’t be hydrated enough, I’ve been having hip issues since October and i didn’t get a diagnosis til a few months before the race, went out a little too fast, the aches and pains varied throughout the race, balls of my feet were hurting most of the race (which I didn’t know how to fix while running because you can’t stretch them). \n\nNow I’m going back to PT, taking Pilates classes to fix the core issue (which is likely causing the hip pain) and focusing on healing before my next big race. But the ego was the biggest thing I had to heal because I felt so crappy for having a negative attitude throughout and for finishing so slow.\n\nI think you can work on your internal mental story.\n\nYou are an athlete. Take a look around at the average people your age, look at what they do, and I'm pretty sure that you are more athletic than 90% of them. Being an athlete is what you are, not how fast or how long your are. I run because I am an athlete and that is what athletes do. \n\nLet me tell you a story...\n\nI'm more of a cyclist than a runner, and I like climbing hills. I host a ride each September which is the hilliest ride that I could fit into 58 miles - it has about 8500' of climbing, some of it very steep. The motto is \"a special kind of stupid\"\n\nI have ridden it every year I've held it, I think 7 times now. I have finished the whole course \\*once\\*, though I count the year when it was over 100 degrees and I got heatstroke and almost rode the whole route as a \"finish in spirit\". \n\nMost years I make it though 5 out of 8 hills and find a good excuse to call it quits. Last year I got covid mid summer and could only manage 3 hills.\n\nI don't consider any of the times that I didn't finish the whole course as failures. \n\nIt's about the journey, not about the destination. We all have days when we have bad legs or events where we aren't as prepared as we like. \n\nFocus on the journey\n\nPeople run for a variety of reasons, one of which is to find your limits. I dnf my first 50 miler for the same reasons you did. I wasn't ready. But in order to find your limits you have to aim for something beyond them! Take stock of your mistakes, and pride in the ability to say I found my current upper limit for running. Be proud of the fact that you found it. Most people spend their entire life wondering if they can do something without ever finding out or even trying.\n\n\"Journey before Destination\"\n\nWhat's the most important step a man can take? \n\nThe next one.\n\nMy fellow Knight Radiants!\n\nRunning is all a process. I coach high school track and cross country, and the advice our staff has decided to give to athletes who are disappointed in a race or workout is this: you get 24 hours to be upset. You've earned that, because you've worked hard and wanted more. But when the 24 hours is up, shake it off and get back to business. This doesn't define you as a person, and it doesn't define your racing future! Character development unlocked.\n\nBad races happen. I think anyone who has run more than a couple has had one.\n\nYou lost...and its ok. Learn from it, pick yourself up and prepare yourself not to be beaten again.\n\nDo something different as your next run. If you run solo, find a group. Join a park run. Find a newbie and train them. Do a mud run or trail run. Try a 5k dressed as a dinosaur. Maybe all those things at once? \n\nFun defeats deflation. You know you are a runner, (and this is coming from a fat 50 year old who calls themselves a weekend runner) there are plenty of miles left in your legs. Just go mix it up a little and rediscover some fun in running.\n\nI love these ideas! Mix it up with what running looks like. My husband is the one who got me into this (and keeps me from totally giving up fitness) and his running journey is soooo different. He has been A Runner since middle school, at the collegiate level, has done more than a dozen marathons, etc etc. He doesn't have to deal with the same kind of motivational struggle, because he's done it before so many times. \n\nMy point is, my journey doesn't have to look like his! Thanks for the reminder.\n\nIt’s crazy to be almost 50 and see people in their 30s calling themselves old. \nI’m a runner. I’ve run three marathons but they were all more than a decade ago. \nWhenever I run now it feels like a glorified run walk but it’s better than sleeping in.\n\nOh my gosh, you are absolutely a runner!  You have already finished this race - twice and in 60 mph winds?! Wow. It is so understandable you would feel like you gave up, even though what you did is the opposite. It's incredible you persevered so far into the miles and were smart enough to stop no matter how close to the \"finish\" you were in distance.\n\nThis race is just a part of the story of your running journey, which will help you in your future races or runs. Knowing when to stop is pretty important for avoiding injury.\n\nThere are good days &amp; bad days. Awesome days when we don't even feel the ground and are in our forever pace! &amp; days when our leaden legs try to run through air as thick as mud, plus all the in-between runs.\n\nYou'll be out there again! \n\nI agree with everyone who's said any distance, any pace of running means you're a runner. \n\nEnjoy your next run and good luck in your next race!\n\nThank you so much. And the 60mph winds, yeah! They were no joke. Even the top elite finishers had like 12-20 minutes added to their times. It was ridiculous. All we could do was laugh at a certain point. Swear to god I could have jumped and the wind would have carried me off the cliff.\n\nYou're welcome!  &amp; haha I guess if the 60 mph wind is in the right direction the race would be really easy!\n\nYou are a runner.\n\nYou ran the race you could run which isn't the same as the race you wanted to run.  You did 19.5 miles which is more miles than a lot of people - and for sure more miles than *I've* ever been able to do.  Hell, you did over twice as much as I was able to do even today.\n\nIt takes more courage to listen to your body then to push yourself to possible injury.    Take some time off, think about all the wonderful milestones you've already achieved as a runner.  How they have made you stronger as an athlete and as a person.  Take what you've learned from the culmination of these experiences to the next starting line.   You will be more ready, confident, and prepared.\n\nAfter a while, for me a couple of months, the DNF becomes motivation for your next training plan and race.\n\nI was overtraining (doing half marathons every weekend) before a half marathon and didn’t taper (literally trained 7 days a week for months before) and then I was like 5km in and running fine (like 5min/km) and something in me was like nope. You cannot do this. You’re done. I cried all the way home but sometimes you just have to listen to your body. Give yourself a day to wallow in self pity then just move on. Maybe do a run on different course for fun to get some enthusiasm back.\n\nIf you've literally done the race today and had the dnf. Rest recover and once the initial emotional stuff has passed think about what you achieved not what you didn't. It sounds like you know the reason for the dnf. But don't forget sometimes shit just happens and you have a bad day.\n\nOnce you're physically recovered get out there and set yourself short term very achievable goals. Get some positive back in the run and enjoy!\n\nI get it! I walked nearly half of the recent Chicago Marathon because my hips couldn’t handle more (issues since having a baby and I did PT during training). It was my slowest time ever and I had so many friends watching me on the app, it was embarrassing, but I did my best. Also, my daughter and her dad referenced how slow I was so many times not out of being rude, but more surprise - that didn’t help. \n\nYou did your best too!! I recommend finding a new challenge to take your mind off of it. I focused on incorporating more strength training into my workout routine and it helped.\n\nYou know what, I was probably 8 ish when I watched my mom barely DNF a marathon, getting picked up by a sweeper around mile 25. And I distinctly remember my mom being upset but I was just an absolute awe at what she accomplished. My mom and I talk about it often and now and she’s pushing 65 and I’m pushing… more than 35 😅 we’re still out there running races better than ever. My mom is a badass that set an example for me at a very young age. You’re a badass too, don’t be embarrassed! As you said, you did your best and that’s all that matters ♥️\n\nThank you!! My daughter is actually the same age. ❤️\n\nYou are being a great role model for your daughter.\n\nI had a similar run a few years ago. I respect the positivity here but my reality was that it set me back years. It shattered my confidence in my ability to run the full marathon distance and that took a while to recover. My advice would be to reflect on your training and what went well &amp; what could be improved. Get back on the horse by signing up for another event and add the lessons learned to your training. Depending on how you feel you may want to run a little conservatively next time just to build your confidence back. 3 years later I just PB’d in my latest marathon (51m) so it’s possible, even if you don’t feel it right now. Good luck.\n\nJust last week I finished the same race I DNF’d last year. With a year’s perspective, I know that I was really injured that day a year ago (I was limping too), and I avoided injuring myself worse by DNFing.\n\n That only motivated me to train smart and injury free this time and it made me feel like a much more experienced runner in the process.\n\nDon’t second guess your decision.\n\nFood for thought: \nA lot of people including Olympic runners have DNFed. And lol , lots of us have DFLed .\n\nElite and seasoned runners have dropped out for various reasons if something’s not right.   1) they don’t generally run slow and it’s different 2) they don’t want a recorded bad time, 3) they don’t want to risk injury, 4) their head wasn’t in the race 5) weather changed / wasn’t ideal 6 a myriad of other reasons. \n\nHopefully a DNF is not the end of your running career . Seriously learn from it. Trace your race.  Walk through what led up to and why you ultimately DNFed. \nYou accomplished a lot of miles. You shouldn’t compare yourself to others - ever - as there will always be someone better than you. You should be proud of what you’ve done. You will be better prepared next time should the same circumstances present themselves.  \n\nCould you have finished the race - probably - though not running. Would you then be mad at yourself for a slow time?  \n\nDon’t go down this rabbit hole. \n \nDid you make a decision at the time given your circumstances? Yes. Own that. But don’t look back.  \n\nHaving DNFed in my past, and DFLed, I’ve often become the Angel to other marathoners - especially first timers to help them push to finish - including offering to stay with them till they do. I’m always pleased when I help a first timer who thought they wanted to quit and then they finished. The stories I could tell. \n\nI recently ran a marathon in Europe - perfect conditions, well trained, and pulled a muscle at mile 8 … I power walked the race and finished at 6:10.  There’s an embarrassment of coming down the chute  of a big race with stadium crowds after the  time limit. There’s also a luxury of owning that chute - alone. 40 runners behind me so race results posted and medal received.\n\nMan I say this with the best intentions, you need to get over yourself, I came completely last, full marathon distance in more than 6 hours in my first marathon nearly passing out. Its shit, it is, but be kinda proud you even did it, like I was so slow at the end they were taking down signs and the aid stations were all gone,  at some point its not even about the time or the achievement its just about proving to yourself you're going to live up to your commitment. Let the anger or disappointment full you on for the next one. I'm nit saying this as a dick head, gatekeeper or elitist, I'm fairly sure mine reeeeally should have counted as a DNF cause I went a bit over the time limit and they were just being nice. &lt;edit, I'm not saying keep pushing if you're actually injured, I'm just saying FUCK THE PACE, FUCK THE TIME, go the distance and do what you're capable of, don't lose heart and you will improve&gt;\n\nso by my calculations you did a (carry the 3).... HALF MARATHON PLUS A 10K BACK TO FUCKING BACK!!!! you know how many people can't even do one of those??? you're literally more fit and more of a \"runner\" than 99% of the population. you said it yourself that you just gotta do more. tbh, if i were to guess it was prob more about burning a bit too hard at the beginning bc of excitement which gassed you for the later miles. anyways, you have no underlying issues and i'm sure you have times where you really enjoy it. \n\nall good to vent and replay it. but i think you even know yourself that this is more about just embarrassment /disappointment/something else ego-related (which, there isnt any reason for those, but hey we're human) as opposed to not wanting to keep running. just keep it all light ad fun. remember, we're not pros. we're just all masochists that need to be out there moving our legs back and forth repetitively - but what could be better, right???\n\nI had my first DNF yesterday in a half marathon \n\nRunning in a niggle, my calf felt tight at 4km in at 10km I couldn’t put weight on it, tried to stretch it ran another 20m and knew I was done.\n\nI was flying and on pace for a PR I had been aiming at for the last year.\n\nThat’s the sport, I’m faster than I’ve ever been and I know with anything in life I always learn from these things…. I’ve taken enough knocks to know nothing worthwhile is easy.\n\nI’m out of the physio and glad to hear it’s a strain and not a tear.\n\nHow to recover emotionally? Just remind myself how sweet the next success will feel after the pain of quitting and seeing all my mates with their finishers medals\n\nI think it’s important to focus on what you did accomplish as opposed to what you didn’t. You hit 19.5 miles! I started running in my 30s as well, I never ran a day in my life before then. I never played sports or even would have considered myself athletic before running. The fact that you ARE a runner, that you attempted a 21 mile race and did 19.5 miles is incredible. You also knew when to stop. Many younger people don’t have that skill learned yet. You can do an analysis on what kind of training you need next time or what you could have done different, but don’t forget that a DNF is a valuable learning tool. You know what not to do, from firsthand knowledge. Use it.\n\nYou just have to take it in stride and move on to the next. Your training wasn't lost and you can build upon it. Last year I DNFd houston marathon, pulled out at mile 18.5 due to exercise induced asthma triggered by the heat and exertion. This year I finished without bonking at all in 4:01.\n\nI just had my first DNF ever a month ago. Race got postponed for 2 weeks due to weather and I made an emergency plan to travel for another one at the same weekend. DNF at mile 20 due to physical and mental exhaustion. I just didn’t have that in me even tho I knew I could finish. It was a mentally draining week after. Couple things I did\n1. Posted in the community I trained with online and here on Reddit. You have a good supporting system even though you never met them in person trust me.  Just taking to people works \n2. Find distractions and don’t run until you don’t physically feel any pain. I took 6 days off. Couldn’t find any distractions cuz my work was too much to handle. It would’ve been better if I could.\n3. When back in running, try to run in your most comfortable way instead of crunching on time. The thing got me most frustrated was I couldn’t have a pleasant race. Doesn’t mean I want to feel comfortable during my race. Feeling hard is fine but running at wrong effort that eventually gets myself out is not. \n4. Find an another race. Some people don’t think it’s smart to do this I agree. But it works for me. But you have to do it wisely without damaging your body. I decided to run the postponed race 2 weeks after my DNF. Had a mindset of I had nothing to lose and adjusted my goal to just enjoy it. Finished with a PR tho way slower than my original goal. Used it as a trial to test things I’ve never done before so not hitting my original goal will not be end of the world. This really could be any distance. Just enjoy the feeling of getting something done could be helpful.\n\nAll of these are really personal to me might not apply to you. Hope you can find your own way with stories from all the good runners here!\n\nYou finished the exact same race twice before, that's a huge accomplishment! Train more next time and you've totally got this.\n\nI DNFed a high school cross country 5k once cuz i was running the course so much slower than the year before and it felt hard and i was embarrassed. there was one section that was too hard for spectators to get to so i just hopped off the course and hid until everyone racing had come thru then walked it in. I had maybe .8 miles left! Moral of the story ; mental and physical DNFs are part of the sport. DNFing for an injury is the actual correct thing to do. Neither of them make you a worse runner. Youre doing great!\n\nIf you ran 19 miles you are definitely a runner. I'm halfway through my couch-2-5k training and I am already proud I can run 15 min non-stop. I'm over 50 and I plan to be a runner for the rest of my life. Doesn't matter how far or how long as long as it's healthy.\nDon't run for your ego, run for your health.\nAnd congrats on your 19 miles. I can only dream of that.\n\nFailure will make your next success so much sweeter. Was watching a youtube on Jim Walmsley, possibly America's greatest male trail runner...he considers his DNFs really important, as from them he learns how to problem solve his way to the next level. You could have opted for an easy 10k race, but you looked to push the boundary instead...well done you :-)\n\nPros runners tap out all the time. If it’s not going well, they stop and shift focus to another race. You were injured and continuing to push on with the injury would only make the injury worse, which could potentially severely impact your ability to run. You need to take time to heal and see a doctor to make sure you’re recovering ok.\n\nIt’s only your last race if you want it to be\n\ndnf'ed half marathon today. second time on the bounce at this distance. I feel you're pain, although sounds like you really gutted it out before calling it a day. if you're limping then I think pulling the plug was the sensible thing to do.\n\nmy plan is wallow in self pity today. then tomorrow have a serious think about what I can do better next time. don't think underwriting was issue today, as I'm in alright shape. think I need some more mental toughness when race gets hard and not start telling myself I'm finished at that point.\n\nI might take a dnf at Jovia tomorrow. I'll let you know how j deal\n\nHey you still ran 19.5 miles more than your past self 🤙 It’s still an achievement worth celebrating.\n\nI have ran this twice before, but I am not a runner. A true runners paradox\n\nI always give myself a set period of time to mourn a bad race and then I turn my focus to the next one. If you want to keep running, then keep running. Go find your love of running again. Do some unstructured running for a week or a couple of weeks and see where it gets you. You are more than just three letters on a race result sheet.\n\nYou can hardly blame yorself for an injury during the event.\n\nYo dude failure is a part of it for sure!\n\nAlso I don’t do races and my max distance ever is like 8.5 miles so… I’m not sure I understand the question of whether running is “for you” or not.  It’s for everyone, you either do it or you don’t, and both are fine\n\nNo way you made it that far and you are not a runner!\n\n\nJust sayin.\n\nYou’ll get it! Celebrate what you accomplished and get back to it. Trying to recuperate emotionally after tapping out halfway of my first full marathon attempt. Thought I did everything right training and week leading up to wise, and boy was it not my day… we just gotta get back to it!\n\nYou started! Well done. I’m hemming and hawing about a DNS for Broad Street Run in 9 hours….too cool too wet…I need to get too start corral which quite frankly is the biggest issue. Early rise, drive, . Should have hoteled in Philly. Enough of me. (I admire your resolve. SOME OLYMPIC ATHLETES DNF). They comeback the next race and in 4 plus years. Lyndsey Joacobelis et al.\n\nI've been running marathons since 2010. I run above average pace so running too slow is fortunately not a worry for me.\n\n\n There is a particular Ultra 50k which I have attempted 7 times and continue struggling at. This year everything was going fine until  34k when I felt totally spent and had to bail out of the race. I think the combination of hills and the heat got to me. I was fit, but not fit enough for the effort I put in.\n\n\nSome people find this strange and would have walked to the end but I prefer not wasting my time and health just to finish. \n\n\nAnyway, the best way to get over your disappointment is to sign up for another race. It sounds like you need to do some training but it will be worth it finishing well at your next race. \n\nIt happens man. Don't be too hard on yourself. And as far as you not being runner, I'd imagine most of us thought that. Just focus, regroup and put this in the past. You got this.\n\nIt just wasn’t your day, doesn’t mean that it’s not a sport for you. Once I did a half and stopped after 5-6 miles because I wasn’t feeling it, just extremely tired I didn’t think I could do another 7. Got the golf cart aid people to take me back to start. \n\nI’ve done races after that, just did a 50k yesterday. Don’t give up!\n\nLook back at how many miles you’ve ran in x amount of time. Then think about how much more you still can do.\n\nGreat posts here, but I also want to add: I don't think a person can understand the full running experience *without* a DNF.\n\nGetting a DNF and growing past it is what makes me a runner. Without that DNF, I'd just be someone who runs. When I had my DNF at 14.5k at a half-marathon, that's when I decided that I wanted to keep trying for my next run. And no matter what time I get or whatever place I get, I'm a runner because of that decision.\n\nI think those people who had never got a DNF ever in their lives: they don't really understand what it means to run. They are great runners, but the DNF experience (and moving past it) is greater than just running.\n\nIn fact, I think extremely few of the running champs, endurance runners, Olympians can claim they've never had a DNF. I want to find a counterexample, but I can't think of one. \n\nFor the OP: the DNF is not something to be sad about - it's what everyone experiences. Don't think it's out of the ordinary because it's a part of running.\n\nEvery run has a purpose. You admitted that you undertrained. Lesson learned and time to set your next running goal. You are a runner.\n\nYou know why it happened. Move on and don't do that again. Simple.\n\nSuck it up move past it and don’t do it again\n\nIf you're walking/limping for multiple miles, you're likely causing yourself more harm than good. Have you considered running for the joy of it instead of for the competition? It's okay to stop when it hurts. And it's okay to run just for fun, and not participate in races.\n\nYes, this is why I DNFd instead of continuing to limp to the finish. I wanted to avoid injury (and was able to with the help of acupuncture 24 hrs after the race).\n\nHow do you emotionally recover? Jesus Christ guys. Just sac the f up and get back to training."

There're tons of plans out there that can help you build miles\n\n[deleted]\n\nI don’t know how people enjoy running a half marathon. I’d rather keep running a fast 10k. Just seems so tedious.\n\nThat's part of the challenge for performance runners.  You want to make sure your pace does not slow down too much doubling the distance.  At the same time, you want to make sure you run faster at shorter distances without bonking or leaving time of the course.  Alot of recreational runners have fallen into the half marathon pace for everything and just start their kick as the finish line approaches.   \n\nThe hardest to maintain a competitive pace is going from half to full marathons because glycogen storage.\n\nSorry you're being put on blast, but I kind of love your take. If you like a distance you should do that distance and not worry about what other people think.\n\nThat said you will get faster in the 1/2 if you train for a full marathon, and the goal is always to run fast. From your post it sounds like you thought you physically couldn't do a full marathon, and I just wanted to assure you that you can.\n\nAt the end of the day the marathon is the MARATHON, it's the premier running event out there. I would encourage you to give a marathon a try, just because if you spend your life doing half of a thing... That's just sort of missing out in my opinion.\n\nWhy don’t you settle for a 10km then? Even faster and done way quicker. Long runs are basically not a requirement anymore. If you do a 5min/km marathon I doubt anyone will think you were just shuffling along.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThen do it faster. I ran my first marathon at 4:48min/km but I'm aiming to take that down a bunch on my second.  \n\nIt may seem like a slog to you, but it is a huge feat of fitness and training.\n\nI think Ironman blows marathons out of the water. Swimming uses legs as much as running but also your arms and shoulders which most runners I see have puny ass arms with zero muscle tone just skinny.\n\nOk cool? This is a running subreddit.\n\nLmao swimming does not use legs as much as running.\n\nthe extra mileage you put in marathon training will make you faster in the half.\n\nin fact, all my half PRs have been made during my marathons (haha, it's actually not something to brag about... it's a sign of poor pacing in the full, and not pushing myself hard enough during an actual half.)\n\n[deleted]\n\nit's not a slog until i start really dying at 38km and regret going out too fast.\n\nanyway... your original comment is probably getting roasted because marathon running is not \"shuffling\" if you've trained. the diff between my half marathon pace and full is like 0:14/km\n\n[deleted]\n\n3:11 full  \n1:31 half (unofficial. not a race. just running out on my own)\n\nAnd you weigh what? Under 130 right. People need to list their weights on here because being skinny at a specific PR is far less impressive than if you’re heavier.\n\nI’m similar, I’d much rather train for a fast 5k/1 mile, in fact I think my mile time of 5:48 is more difficult to achieve than a 5:48 marathon, for an average person. But I acknowledge that other people may have different goals, maybe they’re more endurance oriented.\n\nI enjoy knowing I ran a MARATHON…running a half is like telling people you climb HALFWAY to Everest and stopped…oh you did it quick? Cool…but you still can’t do the full thing?…lol\n\nSame boat, I’d rather run a fast half\n\nYou run slower. Just like you wouldn't run a half at your 5k pace, you wouldn't run a marathon at your 1/2 pace.\n\nYou don’t slow down by much.\n\nThe complete answer is you run a lot more in training and slow down a little during the event. \n\nI mean, it depends on what your definition of “much” is. Most race converters put your full about 15-20 seconds per mile slower at the faster end (which matches up pretty well with the record paces, too), and 30+ seconds at the slower end, which is a pretty big difference in terms of how it feels, especially after 10-12 miles, hence being able to knock out halves at MP during a training block.\n\nI’ve run 1:24 half off virtually no training at 95kg and a 3:09 full off of 2 runs in 4 months 95kg - I don’t buy that running itself a tonne is necessary - I was v fit from cross training in both instances (the marathon I tore my hamstring in Jan / raced in May) mind you I was in my 20s for the marathon - at 35 on 1 run sesh a week at 108kg did 3:25 in Amsterdam. Either way point is running more is probably the most overrated advice for amateur runners there is.\n\nFunnily enough, a lot of people who are HM focused and not really raced the short distances much (it's a lot of people) have very little difference between their HM and 5k pace. Mine were only 9 seconds apart per KM until I did a  first ever 5k specific training recently, and got quicker by 10 seconds per KM. But yea... No one runs a marathon at their HM pace.\n\nWth how, I decided to start doing parkrun after doing my first HM, I went 30s/km faster without any specific training (it was wayyy harder on the breathe though obviously).\n\nDepends how fast your HM is. I'm fairly fast in the HM and got 8th in my age category in my last race (while just getting over strep throat). I've seen plenty of people with my 5k PR running HM at 20 minutes slower. Plus I should add that I did the 5k training at the same time as rehabbing glute tendonopathy.\n\nThis is a big part of why I really think most people should focus on getting at least reasonably fast at 5k before even worrying about running a half or a full. If you can run a fast 5k, the big round marathon times that people constantly post about are barely faster than easy run pace.\n\nPlus, you can run a competitive 5k basically every week if you wanted, and get a lot of feedback on whether you're actually getting faster or not, instead of investing 4 months only to find out your training didn't help much (or just happen to have a bad or unlucky day).\n\nI disagree. They should train for a half just because it forces them to run more. Then from that new base go ahead and do 5k work. Most people aren't running enough that 5k specific work is going to do much over just more total volume and generic workouts.\n\nAgreed. Building consistent volume helps 5k pace tremendously.\n\nWhat on earth does race distance have to do with training volume? If people want to get fast they will put in the mileage no matter what race length they're training for. If they don't, they won't put in the miles and will run slow, even if training for a half.\n\nYou don't train for a 5k by running less than you would for a half; you just focus your training and racing on actually getting *fast* while also running high mileage. You can see this simply by looking at what every XC coach does, and it isn't start their new guys by training for a HM.\n\nSimilarly, there's a reason that you can go Google the top finishers from any pro marathon or half, and you'll see that they have a 3k, 5k, or 10k medals or notable wins before moving to the longer distances.\n\nYes, the pros and competitive runners. My advice is for people starting out. Where going for a further distance will do more than doing 5k work on low volume. Training for a half will make you faster for your 5k for most newer runners, its not until you are already running higher volume that it won't. You are getting really bent out of shape for my comment and for most people the race type they are running DOES affect their volume. Just look at people doing marathon builds versus most 5k runners.\n\nAnd the whole point is that most people will benefit way more from continuing to train for and race 5k while increasing volume, which we know because that’s how everybody who is actually fast—from your local high school kid who never ran before 9th grade all the way up to the pros—got there in the first place.\n\nHot take \n10k is the perfect thing for this and there should be more 10k races \nIt forces longer “long runs” but isn’t so long that people are intimidated\n\nWell, some people enjoy running further than running faster. So people should focus on what they like.\n\nBtw, what do you consider to be 'reasonably fast'?\n\nWhat's a good 5k pace?\n\nHow long is a piece of string? It’s all individual. Measure only against yourself and your workouts will be much more fulfilling.\n\nWorld record is 12:35\n\nMost people cannot sprint this pace for like 10 meters. Crazy…\n\nIt's insane how well conditioned these people are!! I often do strides at 20s/100m which equates to 3:20/km and marathon wr is faster than 3min/km...\n\nThat’s just a lie\n\nYeah 15 second 100m. Pretty doable for anyone reasonably fit.\n\nOk, it seems I did not follow through with the math all right. True. Can we say that it gets challenging after like 300 meters?\n\nFor sure\n\n~20km/hr\n\nThank you for a valuable answer.\n\nYou break 16 minutes is good. I could do that at one time (15:37).\n\nSoooo. A 17 min 5k is not good?\n\nA 17 min 5k is not good because at that pace I would surely die.\n\nHehe, me too…\n\nI tried to break 20min the other day... figured all of my marathon training would get me there easily. Ran 20:13 and it felt awful. Running 5km fast sucks!\n\nI'm with you! I haven't tried to run 5k in a long time, let alone run it fast, but I'd rather run a slow 15 miler than a fast 5k any day.\n\nAS Always, depends on your Point of View. I wouldnt be fine If i dont Go sub 16 in a 5k...a sub 17 5k is still a great achievement.\n\nRun slower and more.  You can only run sustainably at high volume if you reduce the intensity of most of your mileage.\n\nIf you can run a 1:35 half, you can probably run a 3:30 full, and depending on the course, maybe even a little faster than that.  \n\nImagine if you are at 1:35 half pace, then subtract about :15-20/km from your pace.  That would feel MUCH easier, right?  You could sustain that for significantly farther than 21k, right?  Of course you could -- go try it sometime. :) But don't necessarily just sign up for a marathon without practice.  Instead of 21k, just do a 25k or 30k long run one week, and maybe even 35k.  Just make sure you do those longer runs on routes where you'll have access to water when you need it.\n\nI ran a 1:35 half in October and I’m running my first marathon in April, this gives me a bit of hope 😅\n\nA 1:35 half is an outstanding time! My best 10k is 56 mins and I was super duper proud of that. You'll be absolutely fine for the marathon\n\nThank you!! I did vomit at the end lol\n\nI run 1:37 and got 3:26 after 6 more weeks\n\nNice to hear ).  I did a 1:37 training run half last weekend and have 9+ weeks to Miami full.  3:31 would be a PR for me (52M so time running out!). 3:26 would be glorious\n\nabsolute dream!\n\nI had a pretty soft HM PR of about 1:40, then in my actual marathon I got 3:22:xx and set a HM PR on the way of 1:36:45. So you might have a few more minutes in you even at your current fitness!\n\nYou can do it!  My half PR is 1:38 (hilly course), which I ran just a month or two after a 3:38 marathon (flat course).\n\nHow much elevation gain? Congratulations!\n\nActually, I take that back.  The half had about 750' of elevation gain and the marathon had just under 2000'.  For whatever reason, I remember the marathon feeling flatter.  Maybe I was just stronger. :D\n\n&gt; Every time I’m finishing a half my mind cannot comprehend how could my body continue to run for another 21k. \n\nThat's because you've trained and raced with the goal of running a half marathon *and no more than that*\n\nYou gave it your all for those HMs and it's good that you were tired at the finish. No you should not have been ready to run the same distance all over again. Otherwise you ran your half too slow.\n\nHowever if you slow your pace, and follow a proper training plan, you can build yourself up to a full marathon. But it takes time - most marathon plans are around 20 weeks.\n\nYour experience of what your body feels like after finishing a half, and that you couldn't just run the distance all over again, is why people often say that \"a full marathon is twice the distance but 3-4x as hard\"\n\nIf you do decide to go for it, follow a proper training plan (for example Hal Higdon)\n\nBest of luck.\n\nBack when you started running, you probably wondered how the hell people could run half-marathons, yet here you are. The simple answer is that you train for it. You run more, you run longer, and eventually you get to the point where you can run marathon distance. \n\nThe main difference I think is that if you want to get anywhere near your potential, then it is much harder to do that for a marathon. It pretty much becomes who you are and everything you do is geared towards it. Going away for the weekend? Trying to find somewhere to do your long run becomes a vital part of selecting your hotel, and the first thing packed is your running gear. It really can pretty much take over your life.\n\nAs someone who is currently on a spontaneous vacation, I can relate. The 2 things I did when I decided to go on this break was the hotel I'll be staying at, and messaged a local running group if I could join their weekly lsd.\n\nHell, I ran a marathon in 2018, still ran solidly in 2019, then covid hit and my running took a bit of a back seat with multiple 2-3 month breaks due to the lack of motivation/no races. \nEvery time I restarted running, I couldn’t believe that I’d ran 26.2 miles as I was struggling to get through the 2 mile run I was daydreaming during.\n\nThat is why I don't run marathons anymore, I go tired of the long training. I love the race but running in humid south Florida can take a toll. Soto the OP, if you have the time to train and run those longer distances, go for it!\n\nYou didn't share your typical weekly volume for your 5 runs per week, but if you average over 50 kpw (31 mpw) I'd actually be shocked if you couldn't go out this weekend and set out at 5:45/km (1:15/km slower than your HM pace), try to maintain that pace, and knock out a marathon in under 4:15 (5:45/km is a 4:03 marathon).\n\nOf course, it would be more effective and lower risk to follow a structured marathon training plan, but I wanted to make the point that you almost certainly can complete one right now.\n\nOn pure hate\n\nAnd self loathing\n\nMy throat is an open grave\n\nLearn to savor the pavement, the flavor of dirt, flirting with death every step every breath.  Using the street to beat the shit out your feet, it’s only the mind that’s admitting defeat.\n\nYou run it slower.\n\nMy half time is usually in the low 1:40s. When I finish at that pace there is no way I could keep going. I ran the marathon in even splits of about 1:53.\n\nI'm running a full on Sunday, and I've run 3 before. After mile 20, my body always wants to give up, (especially the last two since it was always unseasonably hot) but I just keep putting one foot in front of the other. \n\nBut training helps. Personally, for my body, a half is like a fourth of the race, 13-20 is another fourth, and the last six feels like half the race.\n\nThe last 10k of a marathon is the truest gut check there is.\n\nI used to run a lot more than I do now, and I've done both a marathon and a 50k. If you can run a half in 1:35, you can totally do a full. In fact, you could probably do a full on your half training if you slowed down. \n\nThat's really the key. You need to slow down enough that your body clears the lactate out as you're running. It is a pure aerobic effort.\n\nNot knowing anything about your half marathon training plan, I can only make an educated guess as to what would help you go the full distance. \n\n(1) Avoid overtraining like the plague.\n(2) Maintaining technique when you're tired. \n(3) Further developing your aerobic capacity.\n\n(1) One of the best things you can do is make sure you don't overtrain. For example, if you're doing two tempo runs a week while training for your half, cut it down to one. If you're doing speed work once a week cut it down to once every two weeks. And then combine that with increasing the duration of your long runs. \n\n(2) In order to maintain your technique when you're tired, one of the best things you can do is run some strides barefoot on the grass after your long run. It doesn't have to be much. It can be a few 100 m sprints focusing on exaggerating technique with the arms, driving the knees, and so on. It can be a couple 40-yard dashes at 70% effort. It can be running a 400 at 80% effort. The key is not to shock your system too much. Start out with something small and work your way up. My favorite is alternating 60 m sprints with 300 m sprints, but you do what works for you.\n\n(3) If you're running 1:35 for the half, you're going to be finishing the full in well under 4 hours. One of the best ways of increasing the time on your feet is by taking what would be your half marathon long run, and bookending it with walking until you get up to 3 hours total. Then, you can gradually increase the duration of time you spend running and decrease the duration of time. You spend walking over the course of like 3 months until finally you're running for 3 hours straight. Then, toward the end of your Marathon training program before you taper, let's say 3 weeks out and 5 weeks out, you can bookend your 3-hour run with two half hour walking segments to get you on your feet for 4 hours. If the rest of your training is good, you'll make the marathon. Just don't start out too fast.\n\nAt this point, you just have to trust the training and realize that your body is making the adaptations you need for the marathon. Start out slow and stay healthy, and you should be fine.\n\nYou could get by with 4 days of running per week. Better if you can add in some cross or strength training. \n\nForget who said it, but i liked the quote that went something like \"if your goals don't scare you, you're not dreaming big enough\"\n\nA marathon felt like an impossibility for most of the training, but just ran my first this past weekend. You can do it if you commit to it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAs long as you can run that much without injury. Rate of injury goes up quite a bit when you go from 4 to 5 days. Some people have no problem with 5 runs a weeks, others will end up getting injured. That's the idea of cross training. A lot of runners also neglect strength training.\n\n[deleted]\n\nParker Valby routinely talks about how she cross trains more than runs. She's not much of a hobby jogger.\n\nI got some good advice for running a marathon when I couldn't imagine doubling a half. Your body will do what you set out to do, the way you feel done after 13 is because that was your goal, if you're doing 26, then 13 will feel roughly the way 6.5 felt in the half. Simplified but pretty much held up for me.\n\nA fuck ton more miles and a fuck ton more longer runs\n\nTbh even when tapering for marathons I still barely comprehend the thought of having to run one\n\nFor me, a marathon never seems like that big of a deal while training. It's when I get to mile 20 in the marathon and I realize there is still another 6.2 effing miles that I'm like \"holy crap, this is a long way.\"\n\nFunny I have the opposite mentality when racing 😂 when I start I’m like “dang I have to run 24 more miles?” But then even through all the pain at the end all I can think is “only 3 more miles, I’ve done that hundreds of times by now”\n\nYou could do it just by adding longer than half marathon runs in over time.\n\nA full is like a half but you have to be more conscious about fuel and water.  And obviously, training runs to get your body accustomed to it.  A half does this to an extent but you can easily do 2/3 of a half with no fuel.  For a half, you really need a gel or two at miles 4 and maybe 8.\n\nIt sounds crazy (I've only done a few halves) but after doing them, I was like ... I could run 14 miles next week and 15 miles two weeks later.  I could have started to build mileage.  I just don't have that much interest in it.  A 20 mile solo run isn't that much of  a slippery slope if you think about it.  If you can run 20, you can run a full.  Granted I'd want to have a run of like 22 miles in personally.\n\nStart doing 120min long runs.. at your pace, you'll find yourself going over that HM distance and thinking a little differently about what some more miles will feel\n\nThe time you spend training and the distance you run in sessions increases exponentially the further your race day distance becomes. 5 runs a week is good but that is the minimum I would expect a marathon runner to do. It's an all consuming training period of slow and fast, interval, easy, anything you need to get your fitness at the level to make it to the end. The first mistake people make is assuming that you can passively train just by running enough distance per week. You can do this with half marathons but the full one is a completely different beast.   \n  \nI've heard of the 10-10-6 method, so you would want to make sure your first 20 miles are really solid. That's not something you can squeeze into your lunch break.\n\nYou just have to train for the distance. Last October, I ran my first half. Last month, I ran my first full, and a half marathon is just a training run distance for me now. I advise following a plan. I did Hal Higdon, and it worked great for me. I was able to run the entire 26.2 miles without stopping (minus 1 bathroom break).\n\nI feel like 75% of it is mental. If you can find a training plan that is a good balance of physical and mental training, you’ll be just fine. For me, the Hansons plan was a good fit - might not be a fit for everybody.\n\nIt's mental training as much as it is physical. I have only run one full but done a few halfs. Each week during training I didn't think I could do 15, 17, 20 miles but then once you've done that distance it's not a big deal and you mentally know you can do it and keep adding to it.\n\nAs others have said, slow down and focus on getting the distance done and it will be easier each week.\n\nWith your feet\n\n…RCJ gonna come for you…\n\nAnyway, serious answer! A lot of training, a little bit of self belief, and some planning. I remember for my first marathon I got to mile 20 and realized that I was going further than I’d ever run before. And then I nearly got taken out by a clothing rack rolling out of a beach shop a mile later. I still finished though!\n\nBut also OP, you’re a good half marathoner! I’ve got faith in you (if you decide to go for a marathon).\n\nLiterally just go and do it. You’re a fast runner. Level out your pace and run a marathon.\n\nI felt the exact same way. I remember finishing a half at 1:29 and while walking through the finish corral all I could think of was my sub-3 marathon buddy and how I couldn’t even imagine running another 13 miles at that pace. That was 2 years ago, and now I’ve managed to run a 2:57. Once you commit to the higher mileage of full marathon training, your body adapts and gets stronger and it’s an amazing process to see in yourself. You add volume and as you go beyond 13 miles on long runs your mental limits change. Next thing you know 13 miles feels short. If you have a desire to do a full, find a training plan and just start, you’ll surprise yourself\n\nYou'll be running slower about 1-2 min/mile slower so you can make it.\n\nYou build up to it distance wise. You introduce long runs that compliment your half marathon training such as 25km runs, and then this gradually increases. Once you can hit 32-34km in training untapered then you should be able to run a marathon.\n\nNutrition is absolutely vital in a marathon though. Half marathon and under you can get away with zero nutrition if you run under 2 hours without it affecting you. Try that in a marathon though and you’re in for a bad time\n\nYou gradually increase distance over time just like every other distance. A half seems insane also when you're training and running a first 5K.\n\nDouble your half time and add 10-20 minutes and that's a good marathon goal time.\n\nI'll second this. Novice runner here. Maxed out at 38 miles per week during marathon training. My two races this year: (1:58 HM) and (4:19 FM).\n\nDefinitely have to put in the miles, yes. I maxed out at about 50 miles per week. My half PR last year was a 1:32 and shot for a 3:15 this May, completed in 3:13. \n\nI'm going to max out at 70 miles per week for my second and my new half PR is 1:26, so looking to go under a 3:05.\n\nI had the same question. But then I signed up for a marathon, and stood on the start line thinking: yep, I can do this. I ran my second marathon this year.\n\nThe same way you probably felt when you finished your first 10k about running a half. Just keep training and building your base. Eventually you will get there. I will say marathon distance is quite a bit harder than the half but it’s very doable. Especially if you’re running half’s at 1:35. You’re in good shape you could probably get up to marathon distance in 12 weeks\n\nThe Nike Run Club app is free and it will explain it all. It has guided runs with real Olympic coaches walking you through it. There is a marathon training program for 18 weeks but you could probably already skip ahead to your long runs at about 15 miles.  \n\nIt is great hearing real runner’s stories, how they got started, what they do to win. How they run in the rain. \n\nHow Lopez became an Olympic runner because he was running for his life. He is actually tells his story. \n\nYou can do a marathon. You are already doing a half marathon. \n\nIt is the ultramarathon running that really amazing!\n\nJust do it. I ran my first marathon in 4:26 with no training, had never run past 5 miles and it was all mental after mile 10. My second marathon I had 6 weeks to train but I only trained 4 and over did it. On race day I got there 10 minutes before the start and was cramping since mile 11 I did 4:36 . My suggestion is \n-take it slow, hydrate, stretch ,run your pace &amp; most importantly enjoy it\n\nYou run your first without trying to get a good time. Just get used to it and then try improve from there.\n\nGet a Training plan suitable for your fitness level and just follow it, you're already there, you just need to prove to yourself it's doable.\n\nEvery time I finish a 10k, I can’t imagine how my body can continue to run for another 10k.\n\nOnce you get a lot of miles under your belt and I mean a lot of miles it does get easier. There is something though that I think you’re perceiving about those last 6 miles that are just different. I’ve done a few and I was never amazing (but my PR starts with a 2!), and until my last 2 it always felt like a coin flip on that last 10k. It’s not for nothing that people say the race doesn’t really start until mile 20.\n\nYou need to fuel along the way. One tank isn’t gonna get you 26 miles.\n\nYou are supposed to feel like you wouldn't be able to do it again when you run through the finish line. Doesn't matter if it's a 5k, 10k, Half or Full. You don't simply double your 5k for a 10k. Same is true for half and full. With a 1:35 half and a decent amount of weekly mileage I think you would be genuinely blown away by how easy a 4 hour marathon will seem you.\n\nThe same way you run a marathon, except you pray to Díos and not God.\n\nHonestly. I did a trail marathon in September with my furthest distance in training being 16 miles. You just do it. It's more a mental thing than physical for me. You just seem to power on and get through it lol. I'm doing 30 miles in April. I have problems.\n\nI run slowly, my marathon pace is arund 6:15˜7:00 /Km.\n\nYou already have a great HM time, so yeah it really is just training. Your training will essentially just get a little slower and longer. \n\nAnd FWIW, I think everyone has that feeling when they’re first moving to longer distances. I bet a lot of people run their first 5K and their heart feels like it’s gonna explode, and they  think the idea of running a HM (or even a 10K) is insane. But then ya train and ya do it\n\nYour half PB is 4min faster than mine and I’ve done 2 marathons this year.\n\nThe training will get you ready for it with its gradual increase in distance.\n\nI’ve never done one but I imagine you just don’t stop.\n\nWhen I did my first marathon, my mentality was run a half, then another half. How hard can it be?  \n\nTurns out it is hard and since then I've trained for marathons. Follow the training programme and you'll be fine\n\nJust build up to it. 2 or 3 extra KMs a week.\n\nHow badly do you want it? I progressed from an 8K in 2022 to a half in 2023, and recently a full in 2024! I’m not fast by any means (avg 10min/mile) but I wanted to absolutely accomplish running a full! I realized I could do a full when I ran 15 miles for the first time, and then eventually 17, and the big 20!!! It also helps you tell other people you’re running a full to keep yourself accountable (until you realize you have to actually run 26.2 miles the night before).\n\nIt’s all mental and doable. Progress there slowly is what I say. I had fun in my journey, and I hope you do too.\n\nGet on a marathon training plan.  I can run a half in my sleep but would have to train hard to get back up to marathon readiness.  First off - slow down cause you won’t finish a marathon at 2x1:35, second start with this plan, but only train 4x per week with CrossFit on day 5, 2 days rest so something like this \n\nMonday - 6 miles\nTuesday - 8 miles\nWednesday - rest\nThursday - 4 miles \nFriday - rest\nSaturday - incremental add 1 mile per week to 26, so if you can run 10 now start at 10 then every week increase it 1 mile the same amount of weeks before the marathon.  So if the marathon is in 20 weeks start on Saturday with 7 miles. \nSunday  CrossFit \n\nThis is how I trained for marathons.\n\nCries in 3:30 for a half marathon.\n\nI had the same thought as well and my half times weren’t nearly as good as yours. \n\nHonestly, you kind of just do it. You settle into the long runs and they become enjoyable. It sounds like you’ve got a great base, so find a training plan and slowing increase the mileage and time on your feet.\n\nGo out for a 30k longrun a couple of times. After that you should be good to go.\n\nWith your feet\n\nThat's why they say the race is only on in the last 10k of the marathon. Pretend the start line of the marathon's race is at km 32... And basically try to get there as relatively fresh as possible. You'll be running quite a bit slower than your HM pace - probably 20 to 30 seconds slower per KM if the distance seems intimidating to comprehend.\n\nWell I ran a marathon to complete it about 10 years ago. Was able to do it because I ran AS SLOW AS POSSIBLE.\n\nThis year I was all trained up and set a time goal. And I FAILED because my time goal was too ambitious (in spite of what the calculators told me).\n\nSo I would suggest that if you do a marathon for the first time, just try to survive. Go really really easy. Then once you've done it and know what its about, then try to speed up.\n\nFailing isn't fun.\n\nNote: I'm over 50.. so your mileage may vary.\n\nCan’t wait till this makes it to rcj\n\nI’m wondering the same thing. I’ve run 10 halves, all around 2 hours. Every race I’m so glad I’m done and can’t imagine running that distance again. I do want to check off a marathon off my bucket list though. Is it possible without significant training? I don’t really train for my halves, I just maintain a decent fitness level.\n\nYou just go slower. And never. Ever. Quit. \nTrain by doing that a million times and you adapt?\n\nIs there a bot in this app that replies to every post 20 times with some version of “run slower?”\n\nYou train by running longer distances at goal marathon pace or slightly faster than goal marathon pace. A 1:35 half translates into a 3:20 marathon.\n\nIf you want to run a marathon, find a training plan that includes intervals, tempo runs, and long runs. By the end of that 12-18 week plan you’ll be confident you can run a full marathon.\n\nYou just ran a 5k and this 8 times\n\nI run half in 1:45 and a full marathon in 4:00. Rule of thumb is, add 10 minutes to your 2xHM time for a fairly realistic marathon target time. Obviously still gotta do the long runs, though at your level, they're not quite as long as mine...\n\nI've been running halfs for a long time and always thought the same as OP. This year I ran my first marathon and I ran super slow. Like a pace I would have thought unimaginably slow, but I did it. Also had a solid nutrition plan. I came thru with no injuries and felt great the next day. It's possible, but don't maintain your current expectations around pace\n\nMore miles in training over a longer time. And you’ll have to run slower. You’re right, you could not run another 21k at your half pace. To get an idea of your ideal marathon pace you can plug it into an online calculator that’ll spit out your likely full marathon pace.\n\nThat’s because you’ve never set out to do it. Your brain only lets you run what you told it you were going to run. Train for a marathon and you’ll run a marathon.\n\nI trained for my first marathon and also coming off never even running a half. Ran 6 days a week and if I could do it I’m telling you anyone can do it. Majority of it is a mental game. If you can run a half you can definitely run a marathon!\n\nI always feel like half marathons are more painful than full ones.  Like they are just long enough to make me miserable.  Marathons leave me feeling physically depleted but on an endorphin high. \n\nIf you can run 3-4 miles you can run a marathon with proper prep.\n\n Beyond logging the miles nutrition is key.  Be consistent and don't change things up on race day. \n\nThe long runs are a crucial part of full marathon training too. Just train properly and you have it in the bag!\n\nIf you’re running 5 days a week and doing halfs in 95 minutes as far as training goes just take your longest run each week and start adding 1-2 miles per week. Get up to training runs once weekly of around 20 miles and you’ll be ready no problem.\n\nI just asked myself this this week after finishing a 50 mile Ultra.  How do they tun those 100 mile ultras!  My joints are raging 38 miles in!  I pushed through the pain but couldn’t fathom running 62 more!\n\nGo slower\n\nYou just need to slow your pace down and tell yourself that you can run a marathon. A lot of running is a mental game. At the start of September I ran 15k for the first time in 3 years. At the end of September I ran a marathon. I would recommend taking more time increasing your long runs as I hurt my calf after my marathon, but if you’re running a 1:35 half, you can easily get up to a marathon.\n\nIt is a good start with a 1:35 HM and I understand your feeling.  After my first half I realized ohhhh I have to do this again for a full.  Training for a full gets your mind and body ready for that second 21km.   Read the book Advanced Marathoning to give u an appreciation of why you need to do a long run (endurance), tempo run (strength) and intervals (power).\n\nBuy skates.\n\nOnly with coaching u can finish a marathon in a good time\n\nYou run slower. It's very relaxing. If you have 1:35 pr, you can easily do a sub-4 marathon.\n\nTraining is indeed the key. More weekly mileage and longer distances at once. \n\nIt’s common for a training plan to include long runs up to 32k. And, personally, I build up to at least one full 42k in training. Weekly, you ought to be doing somewhere in the range of 70-100+k. \n\nOnce you get to where those things are doable, racing a full marathon is still difficult, but achievable\n\nM 3-5 miles, T 3-5miles, W cross train(squats lunges at least), Th rest, Fri 4-6 miles, Sa 8-20 miles. Su smoke weed and chill out.\n\nMany 1k, 2k and eventually 5k intervals during training.\n\nPrimarily training, of course - but it really comes down to determination and TWTW (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dagC1JRyPE). So much of it is mental and pushing through.\n\nRun a lot and eat a lot!\n\nIf you can run a half you could go out and run a 50k tomorrow. You’ll be miserable and hate it but you could easily do it. Just follow a quality 16 week marathon training plan and you’ll be fine.\n\nConsider hiring a coach! I follow Courtney Kitchen, Allie Kieffer, and James Mckirdy on instagram. They all seem great.\n\nMcKirdy Trained has a great stable of coaches—mine included.\n\n42km is not much, there are plenty of folks out there running 100k and above distances. There is no other magic that reducing the pace and adding many training hours in your week\n\nA 1:35 half marathon PR is more than sufficient to run a marathon. Your pretty well trained and people less trained have completed full marathons. Difference is that a 1:35 half might translate into a 3:30 full. You just slow down. In my experience, I can run a half at a brisk pace in my zone 4 cardio. Can't do that with a full. You have to slow down or your going to burn out. Hence the phrase its a marathon not a race.\n\nNothing really prepared me for a full, but long long runs certainly help and in general just increasing your weekly milage. In my first marathon training block my longest run was 18 miles. They say a marathon is split into 2 parts, the first 20 miles and the last 6 and both are equally as hard and I found that to be true. I also found it to be true that long long runs in training were kinda double edged swords. On one hand it prepared me mentally, on the other hand I often found I had to sacrifice more time for recovery. In general, I just consistently made an effort to run 10 miles multiple times a week and I think that helped the most. For both my marathons, I ran about 40 miles a week split between 4-5 days. \n\nEven though I have done 2 marathons, I still have that thought that I cant comprehend running longer than a half after I finish a half in distance. But thats the beauty of a marathon. Your mind is more powerful than you think. Just run at a slower more methodical, constant, and steady pace and you power right through it."

They have a pair of shorts that look like what I’m looking for, for a great price\n\nCan’t say I’ve tried squatting in them but when I run they don’t ride up or budge at all!\n\nWhat kind of sorcery is this?? :O \nI was already impressed with bras with pockets but this is genius\n\nDo you know if their bottoms are squat proof as well?\n\nI love Constantia! Their Journey tank and PR crop top are great\n\nThank you!! I just bought a Brooks 3 pocket bra at a race expo over the weekend. It’s amazing. And not just for the pockets. Wore it for the marathon and no chafing at all and very supportive.\n\nI’m impressed you were ballsy enough to wear something new for a marathon! I’m too nervous to ever do that.\n\nHonestly I’m surprised too 😅 I didn’t even use the pockets because my shorts had a enough. I just couldn’t wait to wear it! Thankfully, it all worked out well. Probably not something I’ll do again.\n\nSuch a great bra!!\n\nThis may have been life changing. Thanks for sharing this!\n\nI have this bra too- it’s amazing! \n\nAnother pocket sports bra I like is from Expntl athletics: https://expntlathletics.com/products/race-day-sports-bra-mountain-girl-green\n\nThis brand is very hyped up by all the influencers and it’s a small business so they sell out often. Not a huge fan of the shorts personally (pockets are small/minimal and they sit in hard to access spots, and the shorts run small) but the pocket bras are great!\n\noh I haven't heard of this brand! Cute stuff! Added to the list. Thanks!!\n\nOf course! \nThey have a new line of pocket bras too that I haven’t bought but look cute. \nI like their tank tops too - nice material.\n\nCVG shorts all have pockets.\n\nHonestly the fact that CVG isn’t on this list feels criminal to me\n\nomg these are so fun!!! Added!!\n\nJanji also has the long bra with back phone pocket and the 3.5” trail shorts. \nThe Flipbelt compression shorts are great too with all the pockets.\n\nThanks!! I didn't see these on the website so I had to specifically search for them in Google. Both the long bra and the trail shorts are out of stock (except for 5 XLs for the trail shorts) so they might be discontinuing them? I hope not because they both look great! I've added to the list for now.\n\nI think they might just be that popular. I had to wait a while to order as they were out of stock but I kept seeing them in ads. It didn’t take long before they were out of stock again. Either way, I really like mine so I hope they plan on keeping them!\n\nIf anyone is looking for the trail shorts, I just got some last week from this small running store [here](https://shop.7kft.co/products/women-s-janji-3-multi-short?srsltid=AfmBOoonQrug0mKVjRlJSDk6QZKZnLzvZKNkaLtVrQ4blxPbAQGXx3Lh). Looks like they only have M, L, and XL left now.\n\nOiselle pocket jogger shorts have tons of pockets.\n\nYes! I love their shorts! I have 2 pairs!\n\nThanks for sharing! Bandit has a pocketed bra as well.\n\noh yeah! I totally forgot about their bras. Added! Thanks!\n\nI love this! Thank you for sharing! \nCan anyone recommend a phone pocket sports bra with non-removable pads? \n\nAlso, I can confirm that the “Rabbit leggy smashems” she has on this list are fantastic! I can’t recommend them enough. I just bought a second pair. They are my go to long run and race shorts. So comfortable, and so many pockets. 2 large side pockets, a zip pocket in the back that is large enough for your phone, and essentially a built in “running belt”/not running belt that gives you a ton of room for multiple gel packets of any size. \n\n[I have no brand affiliations, I just love athletic wear with pockets 😅].\n\nNot sure if they still sell them but senita used to make awesome ones \n\nI am all about running in bike shorts with pockets. I have Nike and Athleta that are in your spreadsheet that I like. Two brands not mentioned on your list are DSG (Dick's Sporting Goods own brand) - I think currently only available in black as their Momentum Ultra High Rise Bike Shorts, but I also have an older bright green pair that are sooo soft and comfy.  Also, Peloton has their Cadent 7\" High Rise Pocket Bike Short that I like. They have a bit of compression which has never bothered me while running but which might not be to everyone's taste.\n\nAwesome! Thanks!! I've added these to the list!\n\nLOVE THIS! Thank yoU!!!!\n\nYou're welcome! I'm so glad people are liking it! :)\n\nThanks for putting this together! Seriously, the struggle to find good pockets in women's workout gear is real.\n\nRight?! Men's stuff always has pockets! Glad you like the list!\n\nGreat list, but need to add Love Her Shop. I ran the NYC Marathon in one of my FAVORITE pair of Love Her’s and they were comfortable and amazing the whole 26.2 miles! They did not move and I sparkled 🤩.  They are also super affordable under $35 for all their products\n\nomg thanks for sharing!! These are soo cute!! Added to list and the black galaxy ones to my cart :)\n\nCuuute! Love this collection! Adding it to my list.\n\nPlease share to /r/xxrunning\n\nAlready did! 👍🏻\n\nWoop!\n\nNike has a really good high impact running bra with 5 pockets that I bought during covid\n\nI love these bras but sadly I think they are discontinued, I’ve I managed to find one on poshmark about a month ago new with tags though but they don’t pop up often, I’d been on the lookout for awhile\n\nI can't seem to find this product anywhere besides resale sites :(\n\nOh nooo. I bought it in 2020 and it's one of my most favourite bras to run in\n\nI have a Nike sports bra (Nike Swoosh On The Run) with a pocket on the back in between the shoulders (I never use it so I can't comment on the usefulness/design)\n\nI can't seem to find this product anywhere besides resale sites :(\n\nIt does sadly seem to be discontinued, but [the trail version has three pockets](https://www.nike.com/be/en/t/trail-swoosh-on-run-support-lightly-lined-sports-bra-XkCT9h) if you can find that wherever you're at.\n\noh damn this looks awesome, but it seems only available in the UK (I'm in US). I've added to the list though!\n\nOmg thank you!! Why is it so hard to find the pocket in the back bras!? This list is great!\n\nyay thanks! Glad you like it!\n\nI really love the Skechers Gowalk 10' bike shorts. I bought a pair that looked good in a store, and then a month later ordered 3 more.\n\nThey are flattering, have deep pockets on both sides, and are long enough that my thighs aren't rubbing against each other the whole run.\n\nI really appreciate feeling that my phone is secure and not bouncing around as it is firm against my leg.\n\nOh I didn't know they even had clothing! Awesome! Added!\n\nThank you for your service 🫡\n\nJust doing my duty for the women’s running community! 🫡🫡🫡\n\nFantastic list! I recently bought the \"Adidas run pocket medium-support bra\" which has three pockets on the front that can hold a lot things and has been really handy on my long runs.\n\nThanks for sharing! I've added to the list!\n\nI've looked at this bra multiple times and had no idea it had 3 pockets!  Why don't they advertise that better?  It's like whoever designed the bra was a woman but the person who wrote the marketing copy/named it/chose the pictures was a man\n\nJanji 7” running shorts from REI.\n\nadded to the janji line! thanks!\n\nLSKD, gymshark and lululemon bike shorts with pockets - the ones with TIGHT pockets. I've tried loose running shorts with pockets in the past and your phone and keys will just jiggle and bounce around way too much.   \nI do find that lululemon shorts are sometimes a little too shallow for my phone to sit safely in.\n\nThanks!! I've added!\n\nNnormal also have bras with pockets! I think it's called trail cropped top. Thanks for the list!!\n\nThanks! Added to the list!\n\nVuori has the Studio Pocket Bike Shorts with a 6-7” inseam, I’m a fan of those\n\nthanks!! i see they only have 2 colors right now, I hope they make more because they look awesome and have 3 pockets! Added to the list!\n\nGreat work, thank you. I checked a few of the bras and they all do not seem to offer enough support for bigger cup sizes unfortunately. Are there some models on the list that offer more support ?\n\nUnfortunately, not that I'm aware of. I just put every bra I could find on this list no matter the support.\n\nIve been running with a hydration vest even on short runs just because of the amount of pockets. space for gloves, dog poo bags, chapstick,  sun glasses, my phone, a dog bowl, and so much more.\n\nIf anyone is looking for a good cause to run for- HEADstrong Foundation- they are a nonprofit thats help kids and adults access cancer care in Boston and Philly. They just opened a new lodging resource in Boston last May called Nick's House! It's completely free to the families! Definitely a good cause to run for!
